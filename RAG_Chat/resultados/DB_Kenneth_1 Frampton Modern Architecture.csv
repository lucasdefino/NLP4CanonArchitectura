Thus, the axis begins and ends with an arch. When the Arc du Carrousel was built, however, an observer in the Place du Carrousel was impeded from any view westward. The central part of the Palais des Tuileries intervened to block the line of sight to the west. When the Tuileries was burned down during the Paris Commune in 1871, and its ruins were swept away, the great axis, as it presently exists, was opened all the way to the Place du Carrousel and the Louvre.",Hippodrome,TRUE

Streatham Street flats,Yes,Roberts,London,English,1848,1848,0,1,0,0,1,0.9984365702,"worker's cottage containing four flats, again to the design of Roberts, for the Great Exhibition of 1851. This generic model for the stacking of apartments in pairs around a common staircase was to influence the planning of working-class housing for the rest of the century. The American-backed philanthropic Peabody Trust and various English benevolent societies and local authorities attempted, after 1864, to upgrade the quality of working- class housing, but little of significance was achieved until the slum clearance Acts of 1868 and 1875 and the Housing of the Working Classes Act of 1890, under which local authorities were required to provide public housing. In 1893, when the London County Council (established in 1890) began to build workers’ flats under the auspices of this Act, its Architects’ Department made a remarkable effort to deinstitutionalize the image of such housing by adapting the Arts and Crafts domestic style (see p. 53) to the realization of six-storey blocks of flats. Typical of this development is the Millbank Estate, begun in 1897. Throughout the 19th century the effort of industry to take care of its own assumed many forms, from the ‘model’ mill, railway and factory towns to projected utopian communities intended as prototypes for some future enlightened state. Among those who manifested an early concern for integrated industrial settlements one must acknowledge Robert Owen, whose New Lanark in Scotland (1815) was designed as a pioneering institution of the co-operative movement, and Sir Titus Salt, whose Saltaire, near Bradford in Yorkshire (founded in 1850), was a paternalistic mill town, complete with traditional urban institutions such as a church, an infirmary, a secondary school, public baths, almshouses and a park. Neither of these realizations could match in scope and liberating potential the radical vision of Charles Fourier’s",Single-Family Housing,FALSE

At about the same time, Henri Sauvage explored the expressive ‘plastic’ potential of this new monolithic material in his set- back apartments in the Rue Vavin, completed in 1912. By this date the reinforced-concrete frame had become a normative technique, and from now on most of the development was to lie in the scale of its application and in its assimilation as an expressive element. While its first use on a megastructural scale was in Matté Trucco’s 40-hectare (100-acre) Fiat Works, begun in Turin in 1915 [21], its appropriation as the primary expressive element of an architectural language came with Le Corbusier’s ‘Maison Dom-Lno’ proposal of around the same date. Where the one clearly demonstrated that flat concrete roofs could sustain the vibration of dynamic moving loads - the Fiat factory has a test track on its roof - the other postulated the Hennebique system as a ‘patent’ primal structure to which, after the manner of Laugier’s primitive hut, the development of the new architecture would have to refer.",Hostel,FALSE

As the Casa Vicens had been built around a conservatory, so the Palau Giell was built around a music room, an organ loft and chapel. This composite space echoed the form of the typical Islamic court and ran through the entire upper section of the house. Prominent among Guell’s enthusiasms were Ruskin and Wagner, and Gaudi seems to have been as much affected by the theories of the one as by the music-dramas of the other. At any event Ruskin’s reputation was at its height at the turn of the century, and his dictum, so compatible with Wagner, that the architect who was not a sculptor or a painter was ‘nothing but a framemaker on a large scale’ would clearly have appealed to Gaudi. For GUuell the transformation of society at large was to be effected through the garden city. To this end in 1891 he commissioned Gaudi and Berenguer to design a workers’ community for his textile plant at Santa Coloma de Cervelld, later known as the Colonia GUell. This was to be followed by a commission in 1900 for a middle-class suburb, the Park GUell, situated on the Montafia Pelada overlooking Barcelona, a project eventually realized without its perimeter of houses between 1903 and 1914.

In a letter to L.-C. Boileau in 1898, Guimard openly acknowledged his debt to Viollet-le-Duc: ‘Decoratively, my principles are perhaps new but they derive from those already in use with the Greeks ... | have only applied the theories of Viollet-le-Duc without being fascinated by the Middle Ages.’ Yet Guimard was concerned to achieve that native style prescribed by the French theorist as conforming to usage, climate and national spirit and ‘to the progress which has been made in science and practical knowledge’. Thus we find him writing in 1903: A style of architecture, in order to be true, must be the product of the soil where it exists and of the period which needs it. The principles of the Middle Ages and those of the 19th century, added to my doctrine, should supply us with a foundation for a French Renaissance and an entirely new style. Let the Belgians, the Germans and the English evolve for themselves a national art and assuredly in so doing they will perform a true, sound and useful work.2",Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary,FALSE

Boccioni wrote: ‘We find in Germanic countries a ridiculous obsession with a Hellenized Gothic style that is industrialized in Berlin and enervated in Munich.’ By the same token Boccioni’s positive concern to extend the field of the sculptural object to incorporate its immediate milieu had connotations which were intrinsically architectural. This he made explicit as a converse principle in his preface to the catalogue of the first exhibition of Futurist sculpture in 1913: ‘The search for naturalistic form removes sculpture (and painting also) from both its origins and its ultimate end: architecture.’ In his concern for a non-naturalistic expression, Boccioni developed a plastic aesthetic that was entirely removed",Single-Brand Store,FALSE

This so-called ‘Stile Floreale’ was to enjoy an extensive, if brief, national popularity after the resounding success of Raimondo D’Aronco’s flamboyant pavilion for the Exhibition of Decorative Arts held in Turin in 1902. Thereafter, in Udine, D’Aronco continued to follow the lead of Olbrich, while the Milanese architects of the ‘Stile Floreale’ attempted to integrate their taste for the Neo- Baroque with motifs drawn from the Wagnerschule. In Milan this impulse found its most powerful synthesis in the works of Giuseppe Sommaruga, who seems to have exercised a particular influence over Sant’Elia’s early development.

The typically irregular Gothic Revival plan, documented in Muthesius’s Das Englische Haus, clearly inspired Loos’s wholly unprecedented development of the Raumpi/an, yet with his Classical predilection for cubic form he could not accept the picturesque massing that was its natural consequence. From this, no doubt, came the tortuous manipulation of the available volume of the prism as though it were just so much raw material from which to create a dynamic composition in section. Such plastic intentions were basically incompatible with an architecture of consistent distinction between structural and non-structural elements, and while Loos strove to maintain such distinctions in his public work, at a domestic level he gave primacy to the sensation of space, rather than to the revelation of architectonic structure. The principles of Viollet-le-Duc were in any event alien to him, since he deliberately contorted plans for the sake of providing an architectural promenade of sensual significance as Le Corbusier was to do. In almost all his domestic work structural junctions are invariably masked by revetment, either with the aim of hiding unresolved conditions or out of a desire to provide an appropriate level of decorum. During his tenure as chief architect to the Housing Department of Vienna, from 1920 to 1922, in the austere aftermath of the war, Loos applied his as yet undeveloped Raumplan to the problem of mass housing. The result was a number of remarkable housing studies, in which his preferred form, the cube, became transformed into a stepped terrace section. In 1920 he designed a brilliant and economical housing scheme, known as the Heuberg Estate [72] Terrace houses were integrated with greenhouses and allotments, in which the occupants were expected to grow",Single-Family Housing,FALSE

Like Scharoun, however, his attitude to massing was often naively imitative of biological form. In this respect, one may see Scharoun’s Home and Work Exhibition building at",Bank (branch or headquarters),FALSE

Flat-roofed, with polychromatic rendered facades, its modernistic formula was to be adopted by Ernst May as a model for the first units to be built in Frankfurt, in 1925. In 1924, in the Siedlung Georgsgarten, his second work at Celle, Haesler developed Theodor Fischer’s Alte Heide row housing model of 1919 into a general system, the housing being laid out in rows an optimum distance apart for sun penetration and ventilation. This pattern, based on Heiligenthal’s rule (fig. 119, p. 149) that the rows should be spaced no less than twice their block height apart, became the normative Neue Sachlichkeit formula, to be repeated in any number of housing schemes realized in Germany between 1925 and 1933. In such layouts, following Haesler’s example, south- or west-facing living rooms open onto communal green space.

This last was roofed by a concrete slab, perforated by inset cylindrical glass lenses. It employed the same technique as the reinforced-concrete shell vaults covering the city arcades.

Aerial perspective, and top-lit galleria and stair hall of main entrance. In 1928, one year after the Deutsche Werkbund’s Weissenhof housing exhibition in Stuttgart, a similar demonstration of prototypical residences was constructed in Brno and the comparable Baba housing estate was built outside Prague. It is characteristic of the period that the Dutch architect Mart Stam also designed a house in the Baba estate. However, this impulse to build housing stock comparable to that of the Weimar Republic was undercut by the worldwide stock market crash of 1929. This fundamental change in the cultural and political climate was summed up in 1993 by Alena Kubova when she wrote: In its quest for a social function for architecture, the development of which would define its modernity, European avant-garde theory had come up with the ideal of minimal",Government Administrative Offices,FALSE

There was, in effect, very little Neo-Plastic architecture before 1920, when it made its first appearance in the work of Rietveld. Prior to 1915 Rietveld had taken courses with the architect PJ. Klaarhamer, who, while never associated with De Stijl, was collaborating at the time with Van der Leck. The year 1917 saw the creation of the famous Red/Blue chair designed by Rietveld. This simple piece of furniture, based on a traditional folding bed-chair, provided the first occasion for a projection of the Neo-Plastic aesthetic into three dimensions. In its form, the bars and planes of Van der Leck’s compositions were now realized as articulated and displaced elements in space. Aside from its articulation, the chair was distinguished by its exclusive use of primary colours in conjunction with a black frame - a combination which, with grey and white added, was to become the standard colour scheme of the De Stijl movement. Its structure enabled Rietveld to demonstrate an open architectonic organization that was manifestly free from the influence of Wright. It still predicated a Gesamtkunstwerk, but one that was free from the biological analogies of 19th- century synthetic Symbolism, that is to say, from Art Nouveau. Few, if any, of Rietveld’s colleagues could have foreseen the full potential of the modest pieces of furniture that he went on to design between 1918 and 1920 - the buffet [127], baby cart and wheelbarrow which, as direct",Factory,FALSE

While the roof of the former recalled not only his Maison Monol of 1919, but more profoundly the traditional barrel-vaulted construction of the Mediterranean, the latter evoked not only the nomadic tent but also that reconstruction of the Hebraic temple in the wilderness which he had chosen to illustrate in Vers une architecture as an example of regulating lines. With this series of works the burden of expression now shifted from abstract form to the means of construction itself. As Le Corbusier was to remark of his weekend house: ‘The planning of such a house demanded extreme care, the elements of construction were the sole architectural means.’ Despite the archaic and vernacular references, both works still exploited aspects of advanced technology, the weekend house making telling use of reinforced concrete, plywood and glass lenses and the pavilion making a spectacular demonstration of steel cable suspension in such a way as to recall the jointing techniques which were then the province of aeronautical construction.

Chandigarh Capitol,Yes,Le Corbusier,Punjab,India,1957,1957,0,2,1,0,3,0.9983180165,"Secretariat and Assembly Buildings. The realization of Chandigarh proper, as an abstract and ill-advised plan, can (as Stanislaus von Moos has argued) hardly be separated from the political aspirations of India at the time of its independence. For Chandigarh was more than the capital of the Punjab: it was the symbol of the New India. It epitomized the idea of a modern industrial state, the utopian destiny which Nehru had envisaged for India in total opposition to Gandhi's will. Thus Chandigarh had already been laid out as a picturesque ‘motopian’ suburbia by the American planner Albert Mayer before its hasty rationalization into a more or less orthogonal road network at the hands of Le Corbusier, in association with Pierre Jeanneret, Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry. The emerging crisis of Western Enlightenment, its inability to nurture an existing culture or even to sustain the significance of its own Classical forms, its lack of any goal beyond constant technical innovation and optimum economic growth, all seem to be summed up in the tragedy of Chandigarh - a city designed for automobiles in a country where many, as yet, still lack a bicycle",Town Hall or Municipality,FALSE

Senate House,Yes,Carl Ludwig Engel,Helsinki,Finland,1818,1818,0,0,1,0,1,0.9995853305,"Senate House, the University and the Cathedral, all built after 1818 to the designs of Schinkel’s fellow pupil, Carl Ludwig Engel. As for National Romanticism, such is Aalto’s debt to this movement that it is hardly possible to appreciate his later career without first examining its origins and aims. Initially, National Romanticism was as prevalent in Sweden as in Finland, particularly in the work of the architect Gustaf Ferdinand Boberg, who was responsible in his Gavle Fire Station of 1890 for introducing the work of Richardson into Scandinavia. However, in general, Swedish architects were incapable of transforming this Neo- Romanesque manner into a convincing national style. What was true of Sweden was even more true of Denmark, where Martin Nyrop’s popularly acclaimed neo-medieval Copenhagen Town Hall of 1892 remained complacently rooted in a highly eclectic, if successful form of historicism, totally unmoved by the conviction and integrity of Richardson’s heroic example. Indeed the Swedes and the Danes were only able to achieve an authentic national revivalist manner after the main impulse of the nationalist cultural movement was already over, most notably in Ragnar Ostberg’s castle-like Stockholm City Hall (1909-23), and in PV. Jensen-Klint’s proto-Expressionist Grundtvig Church, Copenhagen, designed in 1913 but not realized until 1921-26. National Romanticism in Finland had already become a significant force by 1895, when a group of artists came to their ideological and artistic maturity at the same time",Parliament or Assembly,FALSE
