Kuma has since completed two other civic pieces for the same community, dating from 2010: the Yusuhara Wooden Bridge Museum and the Yusuhara Marche, the latter combining a market hall with a small hotel. The Wooden Bridge Museum is a highly ingenious construction, designed in collaboration with the engineer Katsao Nakata, with a 40-metre (131-foot) timber span supported at its ends by piers and in the centre by a free-standing timber construction. Built of Japanese cedar, this feature involves a concatenation of cantilevering timber brackets of increasing span, similar to the traditional Japanese masugumi block and bracket system.

Marie Short House,Yes,Murcutt,Sydney,Australian,1974,1974,0,1,1,1,3,0.9992171327,"a sliding sunscreen outer layer of adjustable louvres; an intermediate sliding screen to keep out insects; and another layer of adjustable louvres in metal and glass in order to secure the house at night or during the winter months. Perhaps no one has written more appreciatively of Murcutt’s use of multiple membranes combined with sheet- metal roofs than Philip Drew in his 1987 study of Murcutt’s work entitled Leaves of /ron, with its knowing allusion to John Ruskin’s Stones of Venice of 1851. As Drew put it: 585 Murcutt, Marie Short / Glenn Murcutt House, Kempsey, New South Wales, 1974. One of the consequences of the side use of louvered screens is to enhance the continuity of the building surface since the louvers read as a change in the surface texture rather than as a break in the material. Moreover, the louvers add to the delicacy of the forms. The thinness of the iron sheets and the hard leaf-like character of the buildings is advanced by expressing the edges of the sheets and projecting the profile end sections of the break-pressed gutters.? Drew explains how Murcutt enhanced the ecological profile of his roofs by using skylights covered with fixed louvres, raised clear of the glass and angled at 32 degrees so as to exclude summer sun while permitting the entry of winter sunlight. Moreover, a second layer of break-pressed, corrugated iron was invariably added to the apex of the roof as a means of evacuating hot air from the house. Break pressing is a technique employed to bend metal sheet into the required profiles. Throughout his career, Murcutt has built in wood save for the structural frame and metal roof as we find in his Marika-",Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary,FALSE

One should not underestimate the important cultural role that was once played by the co/egio system in Spain, prior to its deregulation by the European Union, since these guild- like institutions guaranteed the Spanish profession a level of protection that hardly existed in any other country. The regionally based co/egios exercised a powerful influence over the entire construction industry, having jurisdiction not only over building permits but also over professional fees from which they subtracted a small percentage for its services. This system was thus able to patronize local architectural culture through exhibitions, lectures and subsidized magazines. The continuing validity of the Spanish tradition in architectural reportage and criticism largely derived from this patronage, as is still reflected even now in outstanding Spanish publications including E/ Croquis and Arquitectura Viva. Not only did this erstwhile institutional support assure Spanish architects of their prestige, but it also encouraged them to design with reference to an immediate reality rather than to become preoccupied, as elsewhere, with either an inaccessible future or an equally remote past. Despite the unfortunate deregulation of this system, the capacity of Spanish architects to make a realistic contribution to society persists, for while Spanish work has become more varied, the profession still retains an ability to build in an exceptionally rich and effective manner, as may be seen in the work of the Galician architect Manuel Gallego. He graduated from the ETSA (Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura) Madrid in 1963 and thereafter worked as an assistant to de la Sota before becoming an architect within the Galician ministry of housing, while still maintaining a small practice that would allow him to realize the occasional piece of urban infill in remote parts of Galicia.",Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary-Hospital,FALSE

Thereafter came his ultra-experimental steel-framed Agios Dimitrios School [706] of the first half of the 1970s. The multi-layered circular plan-form of this building allows a seemingly endless rearrangement of the available space, while the horizontal louvres at the eaves vary both in angle and density according to the trajectory of the sun. 706 Zenetos, Agios Dimitrios School, Athens, 1975. Apart from the influence of post-war Miesianism, particularly evident in the work of Nicos Valsamakis, namely, his elegant Lanaras House built in Anavyssos, Attica, in 1963 [707], Greek modern architecture in the last quarter of the 20th century seems to have been an extraordinarily sensitive reiteration and elaboration of the syntactical legacy of 1930s Greek Rationalism.",Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary,FALSE

Conforming to the typical height and width of the average plot and featuring a range of standard balconies, canopies and roof terraces, along with horizontal windows, shaded by retractable sunblinds, this modern architectural repertoire, set within an existing orthogonal street grid, spontaneously created a modern urban continuum comparable to the uniformity of Tony Garnier’s Etats-Unis neighbourhood built in Lyons between 1924 and 1935. Perhaps no single Athenian building so succinctly captures this normative syntax as does Constantinos Doxiadis’s Ekistics research office built on the lower slopes of Lycabettus in 1961 [709]. It is disconcerting to realize that this received /ingua franca of modern Greek architecture has now become routine, largely restricted to speculative development and to accommodation of the ever-expanding tourist industry that totally exceeds the modest programmes that Konstantinidis envisaged when he worked for the Xenia organization in the 1950s. 707 Valsamakis, Lanaras Residence, Attica, 1961-63.

The municipalities of Barcelona and Bologna were similarly dedicated to the modernization of the obsolete European city, partially echoing in actual practice the so- called reconstruction of the traditional city advocated by Leon Krier and Maurice Culot. However, unlike Krier and Culot, and even Ungers, Kleihues did not consider the pre- war Modern Movement as negative. Instead, as the architectural historian Winfried Nerdinger explains, Kleihues envisaged the reconstruction of the city as a dialectical confrontation between a progressive modernity and the traditional ‘place-form’ provided by the streets and blocks of the 18th- and 19th-century urban fabric. The unexpected fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 effectively brought Kleihues’s reconstruction of Berlin to a close and, regrettably, the building boom that followed favoured a return to one-off free-standing buildings. This trend was exacerbated by the neo-liberal laissez-faire economic policies emanating from the US and the UK, and this led to the growth of suburban fabric, accompanied by the supermarket, which had the effect of undermining traditional shopping frontage and with it the viability of the city as a whole. With the reunification of Germany in 1989 the tax base and the purchasing power of the society shifted from the traditional city to the suburbs. This transformation led to the rise of the ecological movement as a critical alternative, divided between a technological approach and a ‘greener’ socio-cultural stance.",Hospital / Clinic / Dispensary,FALSE

Dubai has been the leading contender, with its 160-storey Burj Tower designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. While such extravagances seem increasingly irresistible in capital cities throughout the developed world, global megalopoli are ever more attended by large masses of impoverished people, particularly in countries under development. Here, cities with already congested infrastructures continue to become denser, so that the population within the metropolitan region of Mexico City now stands at 21 million, along with that of Beijing and Mumbai at around 20 million each, Sao Paulo at 12 million,",Observation Tower,FALSE

Notwithstanding the undeniably arresting image of a building faced completely in cobalt-blue glass, the museum in Arles is not easily accessible, largely because, detached from the urban core, it can only be approached via a ring road encircling the city. The articulation of its internal space, with freestanding cylindrical columns, conveys the impression of a Neo-Purist enclave, as removed from everyday life as the collection it houses. Such hermeticism does not arise in the case of the Peronne museum, on account of the immediate proximity of the urban fabric and the presence of an adjacent riverside park. Moreover, the elevation of its concrete mass on pilotis enables a carefully orchestrated promenade through the sombre relics of the 1914-18 war to be relieved by views over the park that flanks the building on its south-western face. 805 Holl, Linked Hybrid, Beijing, 2003-09. 806 Ciriani, Museum for the First World War, Peronne, 1994.
