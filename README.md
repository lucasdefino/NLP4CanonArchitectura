# NLP4CanonArchitectura
This project aims to develop a methodology to "decipher" the architectural canon of the 20th century that is, to identify data patterns that reveal how the canon has evolved over time. The architectural canon includes noteworthy works that are essential in the education of professionals and artists and in setting high standards of quality.
