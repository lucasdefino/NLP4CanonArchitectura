"What is modern architecture?’ Strange as it may seem to ask this question today,",Paragraph
"after more than a century of answers by the movement's protagonists, apologists,",Paragraph
"and historians, the need to rethink this body of work is no less pressing in our time",Paragraph
than it was in the past. No doubt there exists some consensus about which projects,Paragraph
"were especially important and influential; this volume presents 50 that will, we",Paragraph
"trust, seem sensible choices to most readers, more or less. But the basis for that",Paragraph
"consensus, the reasons why some, and not other projects, have been judged to",Paragraph
"be especially, if variously, modern are not self-evident. The date of construction",Paragraph
"or of conception is not enough, for not everything that was built or designed in",Paragraph
the twentieth century expressed the modernity of the time. Nor were the buildings,Paragraph

richness gives them the capacity to absorb even the most unprecedented o,Paragraph
insertions — and be better for it. All of this is to say that even the most strident,Paragraph
proposals are never closed in on themselves. Modern architecture was not “spoken,Paragraph
"into the void,” even if Adolf Loos, who published essays under this title, said things",Paragraph
and invented configurations that had not been said or seen before.” Only by,Paragraph
accepting the idea that modern projects adhered to inherited conditions as much,Paragraph
"as they rejected them can we understand why Loos admitted, “I am a modern",Paragraph
architect because I build in the manner of the ancient Viennese.”,Paragraph
"While many modernists would have rejected Loos’ statement, even a little his-",Paragraph
"torical study shows that no surpassing is ever complete, or desired. Advances",Paragraph
"always depend on “conversations” with predecessors. Rarely are they viva voce,",Paragraph
"of course; they are instead asymmetrical, because the past, having passed, cannot",Paragraph

"erns we still study, did not say both yes and no to work from the past? Because not",Paragraph
one of the conversations between modernists and their predecessors was limited by,Paragraph
"or concluded in the twentieth century — not Tadao Ando’s with Louis I. Kahn,",Paragraph
"Kahn’s with Le Corbusier, or Le Corbusier’s with the ancient Greeks and Romans —",Paragraph
we should not be surprised that still today we find it hard to “sum up” what modern,Paragraph
architecture was or is all about.,Paragraph
"Modernity, and by implication modern architecture, has been famously",Paragraph
"described as “an incomplete project.”* Rightly celebrated and often cited, this only",Paragraph
reverses the direction of the observation we have just made: twentieth century,Paragraph
modernism reaches forward into our present just as it extended itself backward into,Paragraph
its past.,Paragraph
Nor was there only one new architecture: first there was the modernism of the,Paragraph
“pioneers”; after this came the translations of formerly new vocabularies into local,Paragraph
dialects; next followed the modernism of those who built in different regions,Paragraph
throughout the world; and then still another modern tradition emerged as a result,Paragraph
of the critical assessments that called for a renewal of early impulses. The history of,Paragraph
modern architecture is less a line of development than a field of sequential begin-,Paragraph

borating new possibilities that appeared thanks to changed conditions.,Paragraph
"There is, as a result, a history of the histories of modern architecture. Through-",Paragraph
"out much of the twentieth century, reports on the new architecture insisted on the",Paragraph
novelty and progressive character of its exemplary projects. The Latin stem modo,Paragraph
can be translated as “just now.” For the early historians of the movement an acute,Paragraph
sense of the unprecedented character of conditions just now meant stopping the,Paragraph
clock of earlier ages and starting another one for the new time. According to this,Paragraph
"premise, historical change is not transitional but successive, distinct ages precede",Paragraph
"and follow one another; the Gothic, mannerist and baroque periods occurred in",Paragraph
"blocks or chunks of time, hewn out of the landscape of the past by historical science",Paragraph
"in order to be viewed independently, as separate and sequential architectural",Paragraph
approaches.,Paragraph
Two histories of the 1920s that were particularly emphatic about the epoch-,Paragraph
making advances of modern works were Adolf Behne’s The Modern Functional,Paragraph
Building (1923) and Walter-Curt Behrendt’s The Victory of the New Building Style,Paragraph
(1927). To some degree these books were both histories of the movement and pro-,Paragraph
"posals for it, simultaneously retrospective, as Behrendt announced that a victory",Paragraph
"had been won; and prospective, because his “history” set forth an agenda. No less",Paragraph

Reintegration (1929) and Alberto Sartoris’ Gli elementi dell’architettura (Elements of,Paragraph

Pevsner’s Pioneers of the Modern Movement from William Morris to Walter Gropius,Title
and George Nelson’s Building a New Europe: Portraits of Modern Architects. But per-,Paragraph

"In the postwar decades, however, as the work of the modernists was coming",Paragraph
"under the tough criticism of a younger generation of modernists, the progress",Paragraph
of the movement was reassessed. To some degree Giedion’s use of the term,Paragraph
"“new tradition” suggested or anticipated this turn, by placing the modern period",Paragraph
among traditions that had come before. Without disavowing the linearity of devel-,Paragraph
"opments, later historians offered what might be termed “regional” accounts, in",Paragraph
both the geographic and disciplinary senses of the term: the world-wide locations,Paragraph

"variation, and Jean-Louis Cohen’s The Future of Architecture since 1889 (2012) shows",Paragraph
the amplitude and richness of its geographical and cultural diffusion.,Paragraph
"Additionally, in recent decades much historiographic work has focused on single",Paragraph
"figures, limited time frames, and under-studied territories. The result is an abun-",Paragraph
dance of material that complicates the story of modernism. Partly because of this,Paragraph
"richness, few today are willing to accept epic narratives of the whole period. Addi-",Paragraph
"tionally, there is considerable doubt about the value and methodological assump-",Paragraph
tions of such accounts. The ambition seems to have run its course. But the difficulty,Paragraph
of the task and hesitations about method cannot free us from the basic task of all,Paragraph
"history writing: to tell a story, about architecture and for it; and also about the",Paragraph
"worlds it builds. For such a story to be told, selections must be made — for wholly",Paragraph
inclusive tabulations of events still want an explanation — meaning that choices must,Paragraph
be made. These must be guided by the double requirement for utmost plausibility,Paragraph
(approximating objectivity) and intelligibility.” For this second requirement to be,Paragraph
"fulfilled, imagination is required, for historical traces are always incomplete, terms",Paragraph
"are often used with ill-defined meanings, and the protagonists generally remain",Paragraph
"silent on their primary motivations. The historian’s imagination, of course, limits",Paragraph
the account’s objectivity. One nevertheless attempts to reconstruct a sequence that,Paragraph
"rectifies all available data, seeking a rendition that is inferior to none other in like-",Paragraph
lihood. An intelligible narrative also requires judgments about importance that in,Paragraph
turn invoke the historian’s sense of what indeed is architectural. None of this can be,Paragraph
avoided if the desire for both explanation and understanding is acknowledged. It is,Paragraph
"not only the breadth and systematic unity of the report that is important, but also",Paragraph
the depth and singularity of the understanding the story creates.,Paragraph
"Accordingly, the historian’s task today is to describe avenues of design practice",Paragraph
"hat were opened, pursued, and then abandoned, ways of working and of thinking",Paragraph
"hat initially built upon earlier achievements but later diverged, found their footing",Paragraph
"in the particularity of a given historical moment, but then sought to recall topics",Paragraph
"that have always defined the discipline. Concern for “classical,” “primitive,” and",Paragraph
"“vernacular” traditions, for example, went hand in hand with the celebration of",Paragraph
"contemporary possibilities. To see the historical depth of progressive propositions,",Paragraph
we need to look beyond the claims of unprecedented novelty by the protagonists or,Paragraph
their apologists. Consider this example from Le Corbusier: “T wish it were possible,Paragraph
"for the reader, by an effort of imagination, to conceive of what such a vertical city",Paragraph
"[the Voisin City] would be like; imagine all this junk, which till now has lain spread",Paragraph
"out over the soil like a dry crust, cleaned off and carted away and replaced by",Paragraph
immense clear crystals of glass...”° Despite what seems a rather thoroughgoing,Paragraph
"erasure, the clearing recommended in this transformation allowed the city’s axes",Paragraph
"to stay where they were, along with what Le Corbusier called the great creations of",Paragraph
"the past: Invalides, Tuileries, Place de la Concorde, Camp de Mars, and the Etoile.",Paragraph
One does not have to accept his preference for monuments over fabric to see his,Paragraph
desire to assimilate the new into the old.,Paragraph
A clear rendering of this assimilation emerges when we take a close reading of,Paragraph
"the full spectrum of architectural tasks: the work of intervening in a given site, of",Paragraph
"interpreting a program of uses, of selecting materials (many of which were familiar",Paragraph
"but used in unfamiliar ways), and of detailing construction. What might be called",Paragraph
"the different times of architectural work — the prehistory, current expectations, and",Paragraph
"future possibilities of the site, program, materials, and labor practices — were folded",Paragraph
"in on themselves, as if the past had been nothing more than a recent present and the",Paragraph
future a present yet to come. It is precisely this interlapsing that is the subject matter,Paragraph
of histories that seek to catch the growth and continuity of the modern tradition at,Paragraph
"its source: the actual practices of design and construction, which is to say project",Paragraph
making.,Paragraph
The basic premise of this book’s structure is that a particularly good way of,Paragraph
understanding the history of modern architecture (including the modern architec-,Paragraph
ture of our time) is by looking again at the tradition’s key projects. We would like,Paragraph
"this term to describe works that were not only built and persist to our time, even if",Paragraph
"altered, but also those we can no longer see because they were destroyed or",Paragraph
"intended to be temporary, or even only drawn or modeled. A history of projects",Paragraph
can address and explain the themes that persist through a work’s several stages and,Paragraph
t,Title
t,Title
"alterations, as well as the concrete and limited conditions that allowed and",Paragraph
expressed those changes.,Paragraph
Given the weight of our historiographic tradition and of our naturalized sense of,Paragraph
"distinct ages succeeding one another in time, coming to grips with the interlapsing",Paragraph
just mentioned means looking again at buildings and designs we thought we knew,Paragraph
perfectly well. Each of the 50 chapters of this volume is an exercise in that task. When,Paragraph
"a built project is not the topic of study it is the idea of one, as represented in drawings",Paragraph
or models. In some cases works that were built decades ago remain standing today.,Paragraph
Other significant projects were destroyed or modified beyond recognition. Still,Paragraph
others were meant to be temporary. Another set of projects that have been impor-,Paragraph
tant in this history were never built at all. Regardless of the current state of a partic-,Paragraph
"ular work, its projective dimensions are the essential subject matter of the",Paragraph
50 chapters that follow. Although different interpretative instruments and proce-,Paragraph
"dures are required for the different embodiments of a project (built, altered, tempo-",Paragraph
"rary, or unbuilt), there seems to be no good reason to rank one kind of",Paragraph
"materialization over another. As shown in the chapters that follow, architectural pro-",Paragraph
"jects have the capacity to absorb and integrate ideas, material facts, cultural norms,",Paragraph
"and possibilities, as well as questions internal to the discipline of architecture.",Paragraph
"Because it refuses any categorical separation of fact and idea, of any discrete condi-",Paragraph
"tion and recurring theme, there is perhaps no better medium of architectural history",Paragraph
"than the project. A new story of the modern tradition unfolds as a result of this focus,",Paragraph
even though the characters who play leading roles have names we have heard before.,Paragraph
The projects presented in the book have been grouped into six chronologically,Paragraph
"structured sections, the subtitles of which introduce the term world. Our basic",Paragraph
premise is that the modern architectural project is an instrument of world building.,Paragraph
"The book’s sections show, however, that different understandings of the architec-",Paragraph
tural project corresponded to different senses of the worlds that would result. We,Paragraph
"distinguish the ways projects were alternately anticipatory, imaginative, construc-",Paragraph
"tive, recursive, interrogative, and engaging. The story that results is thus an",Paragraph
account of the modern period as well as an elaboration of the different aspects,Paragraph
or dimensions of project making in these years. The ways of doing architecture,Paragraph
and of world building that emerge in this story are modern architecture’s gift to,Paragraph
"the present, representing at once an inheritance and a set of tasks.",Paragraph

The progressive movements from the turn of the nineteenth century to the dawn,Title
of World War I largely preconditioned the modern avant-gardes that followed. All,Paragraph
the buildings studied in the chapters of this section were designed by architects who,Paragraph
were born at the end of the nineteenth century and practiced at the beginning of the,Paragraph
twentieth century. They were part of a generation that witnessed unparalleled,Paragraph
"modernization first hand, an experience that deeply influenced the way they",Paragraph
thought architecture had to engage the world. While the concept of the “modern”,Paragraph
had been long in the making — from the seventeenth century quarrel against the,Paragraph
supremacy of the ancients to the Enlightenment ideas of critical reason — industri-,Paragraph
"alization brought about an unprecedented world, so radically transformed that its",Paragraph
inhabitants struggled to recognize it. Modern life was catapulted into existence,Paragraph
"through urban developments that took place at a record pace, changing the world",Paragraph
more rapidly and dramatically than ever before.,Paragraph
"The industrial city witnessed an extreme urbanization, no longer composed of",Paragraph
"familiar expressions of communal intimacy, torn by political turmoil, and increasingly",Paragraph
questioning established traditions and patterns of behavior. Modernization was inti-,Paragraph

"rural relationships. In Europe, London’s population increased from 1.2 to 4.5 million,",Paragraph
"and Berlin’s from 172,000 to 1.9 million. Cities in the United States surpassed these",Paragraph

"motivated by far-reaching communication and news outlets, and disciplines such as",Paragraph
sociology and city planning determined to understand the urban world by relying,Paragraph
"heavily on new methods of information mining, such as statistics.",Paragraph
These changes in the urban topography had a fundamental impact on architecture.,Paragraph
In cities affected by the Industrial Revolution — and with it the implementation of,Paragraph
new policies — the erosion of traditional urban and architectural forms and norms,Title
"not only transformed existing typologies, such as prisons and schools, but introduced",Paragraph
"a multitude of new programs. Urbanization, economic development, and expansion",Paragraph
simultaneously provoked and demanded a new make-up of the city. The exceptional,Paragraph
rise of the railroad for example — which in the United States largely conditioned,Paragraph
monopolistic capitalism and the exploitation of the frontier—not only shifted regional,Paragraph
time and space ratios by bringing territories closer together but also demanded new,Paragraph
"building types in the form of the urban and suburban train station. Similarly, new",Paragraph
manufacturing techniques and procedures required more and differently equipped,Paragraph
"factories, while new product lines and an ever-enlarging consumer culture carved",Paragraph
new spaces of commerce into the city. The expansion of the latter proceeded during,Paragraph
the nineteenth century from single stores along sidewalks to a collection of stores,Paragraph
"under colonnades, and the excavation of the urban block through arcades, only to",Paragraph
culminate toward the end of the century in the “house of goods” — the department,Paragraph
store — from the rue de Colonnes (1793) via the passage Delorme (1808) to Bon,Paragraph

bureaucratic structures. Different companies would congregate in buildings,Paragraph
equipped with the newest technologies and devoted entirely to office space.,Paragraph
"It is, therefore, no coincidence that Louis H. Sullivan’s famous — famously mis-",Paragraph
understood and notoriously overused — dictum “form ever follows function”,Paragraph
appears in his essay “The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered.”* As Joanna,Paragraph
"Merwood-Salisbury shows in her chapter, the Carson Pirie Scott building by",Paragraph
Sullivan quickly became a symbol of “the rational and universal expression of social,Paragraph

London and the iron lattice tower by Gustave Eiffel (1889) in Paris are only two,Paragraph
of the legendary products of modern technology that challenged architectural,Paragraph
thinking and forever transformed the city. Not only were these new constructs,Paragraph
"utterly different, even alien, to the neighborhoods they occupied but they also",Paragraph
seemed to transform their surroundings. Modernist painters such as Robert,Paragraph
Delaunay depicted the buildings adjacent to the Eiffel Tower fractured and,Paragraph
"reflected into a cacophony of forms, and photographers were equally mesmerized",Paragraph
by the tower's lightweight member through which the city was newly seen. Both,Paragraph
works hinted at a new spatial condition that questioned the solidity of architecture,Paragraph
"and the opposition between interior and exterior. Sigfried Giedion, empowered by",Paragraph
"hindsight, would later lobby that “in the air-flooded stairs of the Eiffel Tower,” one",Paragraph

"Bruno Taut. Often, these explorations were supported by the use of materials",Paragraph

or what Amy Kulper in her chapter on the House for an Art Lover by Charles,Paragraph

Turbine Factory points at Behrens’ intense search for an “architecture of our time.”,Paragraph
Behrens stipulated that architectural details had to be suppressed once the tempo of,Paragraph

"Just before and immediately after 1900, architecture had tested disciplinary",Paragraph

the late Detlef Mertins have expanded and opened up new insights in familiar,Paragraph

Marshall Berman went so far as to identify a shift from an open-ended and,Paragraph

a more hermetic understanding of modernism in the following decades. He saw,Paragraph
"a polarization at the beginning of the twentieth century, when “[ojpen visions",Paragraph
"of modern life have been supplanted by close ones, Both/ And by Either/Or.”""°",Paragraph
"For Berman, the struggle with modernity by the “first modernists,” as he calls",Paragraph
"them, presented not only problems but also revelations, where “their self-ironies",Paragraph
"and inner tensions were a primary source of their creative power.” As such, these",Paragraph
early projects of the late nineteenth and very early twentieth century hold a unique,Paragraph
"place in the history of modernity — one of dualisms and twilights but, most of all,",Paragraph
"animated by an openness toward the modern world, which the Futurists were",Paragraph
about to polarize between embrace and resistance. The few projects presented here,Paragraph
as part of a much larger catalogue of works are not only vital to an understanding of,Paragraph
"the modernisms that followed but, to paraphrase Berman, may hold opportunities",Paragraph
"to better understand the modernities of today. While seemingly far-fetched, taking",Paragraph
clues from the resourcefulness of these early modernists may just give us the right,Paragraph
"dose of foresight to engage the city of today, to detect openings in the immediate",Paragraph
"future, and to anticipate another world.",Paragraph

who had it widened and developed as the city’s premiere commercial boulevard in,Paragraph
"the 1860s. Along with his early partners, Marshall Fields and Levi Leiter, Palmer was",Paragraph
"responsible for the first commercial “palaces” built there, all influenced by the great",Paragraph
Parisian department stores: Blondel’s Grand Magasin du Louvre (1866); Laplanche,Paragraph
and Boileau’s Bon Marché (1869-76); and Paul Sedille’s Au Printemps (1883). Each,Paragraph
"of these buildings exploited an iron structure to create huge, open shopping floors",Paragraph
illuminated with copious natural light. In Chicago the architect William Le Baron,Caption
"Jenney, one of Sullivan’s early employers, established a new precedent for buildings",Paragraph
of this type with the second Leiter building and the Fair stores (both 1891). Though,Paragraph

"edented in their enormous size. With these buildings, eight and eleven stories high",Paragraph
"respectively, Jenney inaugurated the hybrid skyscraper-department store type.",Paragraph
"The skyscraper appeared in the early 1880s when, in the middle of a real estate",Paragraph
"boom, property owners began using a method known locally as the “Chicago con-",Paragraph
"struction” to build 12-, 16-, and even 20-story buildings. This method was made up",Paragraph
"of a series of related technologies including an internal metal structure, elevators,",Paragraph
"electric lighting, steam heating, and so-called curtain walls: lightweight assemblies",Paragraph
"of brick, terracotta tile, and plate glass connected to the frame with anchors and",Paragraph
"brackets. Faster to erect than masonry, this method allowed the construction of",Paragraph
tall buildings with large volumes that produced significantly increased rental,Paragraph
"revenue for their owners. For architects, the method presented an accompanying",Paragraph
aesthetic problem: what should the Chicago construction look like? In early experi-,Paragraph
"ments, such as Holabird and Roche’s Tacoma building (1889), the inner frame was",Paragraph
expressed on the exterior via an undulating wall of unusually large windows. While,Paragraph
"the Tacoma mimicked the brown color of masonry buildings, Daniel Burnham and",Paragraph
Charles Atwood offered a radical new aesthetic in their design for the Reliance,Paragraph
"building (1895). The original home of the Carson Pirie Scott company, the Reliance",Caption
presented an obviously non-load-bearing curtain wall of cream-colored glazed ter-,Paragraph
racotta tile inset with unusually large panes of plate glass. This wall of windows was,Paragraph
folded into a series of bays projecting out over dark brown granite and bronze,Paragraph
framed display windows at the street level.,Caption
With its large windows and dramatic chromatic distinction between base and,Paragraph
"upper stories, the Reliance was a precedent for the Schlesinger and Mayer building.",Paragraph
In its design Sullivan drew on the formula he had established for tall office buildings,Paragraph
"in the early 1890s: a single block divided into three horizontal layers, with a two-",Paragraph
story “mercantile base” decorated in a “sumptuous” way in order to “attract the,Paragraph
"eye”; above this, an indefinite number of office tiers; and finally a decorative attic",Paragraph
that signified the vertical termination of the building.” Adler and Sullivan’s Wain-,Paragraph
wright (1891) and Guaranty (1895) buildings exemplify this approach. In most,Paragraph
buildings of this type the dimensions of the individual office units dictated the,Paragraph
"width of the structural bays. In the case of the skyscraper department store, how-",Paragraph
"ever, the structural bays were wider, designed to maximize open floor area for the",Paragraph
display of merchandise and allow the large windows necessary to light it. The,Paragraph
"wider spacing of the bays may explain why, in contrast to the Wainwright and",Paragraph
"the Guaranty, Sullivan gave the windows of the Schlesinger and Mayer store a hor-",Paragraph
izontal orientation.,Paragraph
"Even more significant than the wider bays, the “mercantile base” was given spe-",Paragraph
"cial prominence. Unlike other commercial buildings, where the street level occu-",Paragraph
"pants were tenants, here it was the owner of the building and the expression of",Paragraph
the Schlesinger and Mayer Company’s identity was of primary importance. Working,Paragraph
"with his assistant, Grant Elmslie, Sullivan developed a distinctive dark green metallic",Paragraph
frame for the street-level display windows. The design of these windows was part of,Paragraph
a larger effort to brand the store with a specific visual identity. Beautiful and intri-,Paragraph
"cate, the foliated decorative motif contained within the geometric frames was",Paragraph
"repeated in the store’s interior in the form of sawn mahogany panels, ornamental",Paragraph
"plasterwork capitals, and bronze-plated lighting fixtures. This motif even influenced",Paragraph
the graphic design of Schlesinger and Mayer’s newspaper advertising. With its sty-,Paragraph
"lized natural forms, this ormamental scheme echoed the art nouveau style popular in",Paragraph
"France, for example Frantz Jourdain’s Samaritaine department store (1905), which",Paragraph
included decorative ironwork and polychromatic terracotta tile with a floral motif.,Paragraph
The most obvious feature of the Schlesinger and Mayer building is the dramatic,Paragraph
contrast between the base and the facade above. Clad in a pale cream-colored,Paragraph
"terracotta tile, this facade is unornamented except for the inset borders of the win-",Paragraph
dow frames. Above this an unbroken cornice appears to float above deeply,Paragraph
"recessed windows at the attic level. Connecting these horizontal layers, a rounded",Paragraph
tower unites the State and Madison facades and acts as the main entrance to the,Paragraph
"store. Though it echoed the grid, Sullivan’s design for the upper facade stood apart",Paragraph
from the bulk of the building behind it. He employed no rhythm of vertical,Paragraph
"projecting bays, as in the Tacoma and Reliance, merely the simple repetition of",Paragraph
cell-like windows. He chose not to follow the convention by which the,Paragraph
interior structure was expressed on the exterior as a series of pronounced vertical,Paragraph
piers mimicking the classical orders. Instead the pale-colored screen appears to,Paragraph
stretch tightly across the surface from one edge of the building to the other like,Paragraph
a thin veil. This veiling effect is particularly pronounced because the horizontal,Paragraph
spandrels are deeper than the vertical mullions. Sullivan raised these mullions from,Paragraph
"the surface of the wall only on the tower where they are grouped close together,",Paragraph
"enhancing the appearance of a single surface wrapping around the corner, at which",Paragraph
"point it is puckered, or folded. It was this aspect of the building that would",Paragraph
attract the attention of the architects and critics of the early twentieth-century,Paragraph
avant-garde.,Paragraph
The Articulated Frame,Title
"By the late 1920s, the construction of the Schlesinger and Mayer building, or",Paragraph
"Carson Pirie Scott as it was now known, was considered a crucial moment in",Paragraph
"the evolution of the modern style, the first overt expression of the curtain wall.",Paragraph
Now the building was thought of primarily as a skyscraper and its function as a,Paragraph
department store was given secondary importance. Attention was focused on,Paragraph
"the upper levels of the facade, and the ornamented base and cornice were treated",Paragraph
"as vestigial, a nineteenth-century relic. In 1924 the American critic Lewis Mumford",Paragraph
"described such ornament as the “last gesture of traditional architecture,” clinging to",Paragraph
the highest and lowest stories of the “draped cube.”’ In 1939 the Museum of Mod-,Paragraph
ern Art in New York claimed Carson Pirie Scott as a native precursor to the Inter-,Paragraph
"national Style. Because of this “one great and prophetic building,” which “frankly",Paragraph
"exhibits its cage-like steel skeleton, sheathed only in terracotta,” the Museum",Paragraph
"declared, Sullivan “may claim his place with contemporary European pioneers",Paragraph
"of the Modern Movement, [Adolf] Loos, [Otto] Wagner, [Hendrik] Berlage, and",Paragraph
[Henry] Van de Velde.”* In this way the International Style was understood as a,Paragraph
"spontaneous movement arising not in the context of Europe alone, but also in",Paragraph
the United States. The Swiss critic and historian Sigfried Giedion cemented this,Paragraph
"view in his canonical Space, Time and Architecture (1941), where Carson Pirie Scott",Paragraph
figures as a forebear to the steel and glass facades of Walter Gropius’ Fagus Factory,Caption
(1913) and Gropius’ entry to the Chicago Tribune Tower competition (1923).,Paragraph
"In this historiographic framework, Carson Pirie Scott was one of a series of piv-",Paragraph
"otal buildings that launched a global modern style, one in which the thick masonry",Paragraph
"wall was transformed into an “articulated frame.” For high modernists, the internal",Paragraph
steel frame and the external curtain wall were conceptually interchangeable and,Paragraph
universally applicable. This idea was to find its highest expression in the work,Paragraph
"of German émigré Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who inaugurated the “Second",Paragraph
Chicago School of architecture” in the mid-twentieth century. Mies believed that,Paragraph
great architecture was the aesthetic fulfillment of technology: “Construction not,Paragraph
"only determines form, but is form itself,” he wrote.’ In buildings such as the Lake",Paragraph
"Shore Drive apartments (1948-51) and the Seagram building (1954-58), metal and",Paragraph
"glass skins evoke the steel structure underneath. For Mies and other modernists,",Paragraph
technology was a metaphor for the rational and efficient organization of modern,Paragraph

tecture was the aesthetic expression of technology. “The revitalization of the build-,Paragraph
ing art can only come from construction and not by means of arbitrarily assembled,Paragraph
"motifs,” he claimed.®",Paragraph
The privileging of technological expression (which was thought to further the,Paragraph
progress of modern society) over the application of historicist ornament (which,Paragraph
"was thought to retard it), dates to a turn-of-the-century discourse about the place",Paragraph
of ornament in architecture and design. At a time when traditional social bound-,Paragraph

Sombart linked the problem of contemporary design (its debasement through,Paragraph

"Prompted by the need to increase both production and consumption, he argued,",Paragraph
"the market preyed on the base urge of consumers, particularly women, for the lat-",Paragraph
"est fashion. Around the same time, the Chicago economist Thorstein Veblen",Paragraph
"coined the term “conspicuous consumption,” meaning lavish spending on clothing,",Paragraph
"jewelry and extravagant houses in order to demonstrate one’s wealth. In this sense,",Paragraph
"aesthetes believed, the system of ornament had been corrupted by consumerism:",Paragraph
the social status it once conferred could now be bought and sold. Veblen identified,Paragraph
"department stores in particular as an essential part of the “propaganda of culture,”",Paragraph
inculcating the lower classes with a taste for fashionable rather than functional,Paragraph
goods. In these terms the highly decorated base of Carson Pirie Scott was doubly,Paragraph
"problematic. Not only a throwback to an outmoded ornamental tradition, it was",Paragraph
"also designed specifically to promote the consumption of cheaply made, mass-",Paragraph

Organic Architecture and the Textile Wall,Title
"Since the 1960s, the rise of post-modernism has bought a renewed appreciation of",Paragraph
Sullivan’s ornament. Historians have focused in particular on his drawing and writ-,Paragraph
ing in order to understand how and why he produced such complex decorative,Paragraph
"facades, as well his intellectual influences and the social context in which he",Paragraph
worked. This scholarship has shown that while Sullivan utilized innovative archi-,Paragraph
"tectural technologies, he also regarded ornament as a viable form of modern",Paragraph
"expression, one that made manifest not universal social progress but the particular",Paragraph
benefits of American democracy. Like many of his contemporaries in Europe and,Paragraph
"the United States, Sullivan rejected the thoughtless replication of historical prece-",Paragraph
dent in favor of a philosophy of “organic” architecture. The definition of organic,Paragraph
architecture varied greatly. Broadly speaking it meant architectural form derived,Paragraph
"from the inner function of a building, whether structural or programmatic, and",Paragraph
not from the imitation of existing examples. Sullivan summarized this idea in,Paragraph
his famous and frequently misunderstood aphorism: “form ever follows function.””,Paragraph
"The adoption of this principle implied no particular style: quite the opposite, the",Paragraph
outward appearance of a building depended entirely on its situation. Classical or,Paragraph
"Gothic styles could be appropriate, depending on the manner in which they were",Paragraph
"used. In Chicago, “organic” architecture came to mean the “evolution” of Euro-",Paragraph
pean styles into a new American one as they were transplanted into the American,Paragraph
“west” (as Illinois and the Midwestern states were then considered). Beginning in,Paragraph
"the mid-nineteenth century, architects in Chicago adopted a simplified version of",Paragraph
"the fashionable neo-Gothic style for their commercial structures. By the mid-1880s,",Paragraph
"influenced by the French architect Eugéne Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc, they began",Paragraph
"to think of the Gothic as a constructive system, one adaptable to modern functions",Paragraph
and materials.,Paragraph
In these terms the steel frame rendered conventional forms of architectural,Paragraph
expression derived from load-bearing tectonic systems (such as the classical orders),Paragraph
"obsolete. Architectural historian Mark Wigley has suggested that, in their efforts to",Paragraph
"legitimate the curtain wall, Sullivan and his colleagues were influenced by the",Paragraph
German architect Gottfried Semper’s “principle of cladding”: the idea that the,Paragraph
origins of architecture lay not in post and beam construction but in the textile cov-,Paragraph
ering used to enclose space in early human societies.* Semper’s theory was derived,Paragraph
from the archetype of a “Caribbean hut” (a reproduction of which he saw at the,Paragraph
Great Exhibition in London in 1851) in which the lightweight wall was a separate,Paragraph
system from the masonry base and hearth. This idea was attractive to the Amer-,Paragraph
icans because it implied that the curtain wall might represent not a deviation from,Paragraph
"architectural tradition, but a return to its origins: that to dress a steel-framed build-",Paragraph
"ing in a textile-like fagade, what Sullivan called the “product of loom and mine,”",Paragraph
"might be entirely appropriate.” Certainly many of his designs evoked textiles,",Paragraph
especially his polychromatic Transportation Building at the World’s Columbian,Paragraph
"Exposition (1893), which he compared to an oriental rug.",Paragraph
This leaves the question of what Sullivan was trying to express with his una-,Paragraph
shamedly draped surfaces. His method of dividing the facades of his tall buildings,Paragraph
into three horizontal zones followed the organic principle of “form follows,Paragraph
"function,” at least in an abstract sense. But though he was well aware of what",Paragraph
he called the “social conditions” that produced the new building type — real estate,Paragraph
"conventions, structural technology, interior program — he had no interest in expres-",Paragraph
"sing them directly. Rather, he shared with the American transcendentalist move-",Paragraph
ment the belief that the role of art was to make visible the invisible spiritual world,Paragraph
behind the material one. In this sense ornament was the highest form of architec-,Paragraph
"ture, the emotional expression of the inner “life” of a building. In the case of his",Paragraph
own practice this meant making manifest the energy he saw inherent in the urban,Paragraph
"landscape of Chicago, a city he described as crude and raw but full of “big things to",Paragraph
be done.”?® Just as Jenney and Adler utilized the steel frame to construct buildings,Paragraph
"suited to those big deeds, Sullivan experimented with cast-iron, plate glass and ter-",Paragraph

While the ornamented Carson Pirie Scott building undoubtedly had a com-,Paragraph
mercial function — to draw attention to the store and to establish an image for,Paragraph
the company as a purveyor of affordable luxury — Sullivan sublimated that prag-,Paragraph
"matic function into a broader, social one. Together with his protégé Frank",Paragraph
"Lloyd Wright, he linked organic architecture to the concept of democracy,",Paragraph
which he understood not as a formal system of government but as a philosophy,Paragraph
of individual freedom and self-reliance particular to the United States. The tall,Paragraph
office building symbolized the power of the American businessman to achieve,Paragraph
great things via sheer will. Architectural historian Joseph Siry sees the,Paragraph
"department store as a related, but different form of democratic institution.’",Paragraph
"For department store owners, shopping was more than a leisure activity; it",Paragraph
"was also an aid to assimilation, a means for personal self-improvement if not",Paragraph
"reinvention. In an era of great social instability, it played an important role",Paragraph
"in the fashioning of new Americans: here the immigrant from Ireland, Ger-",Paragraph
"many, or Bohemia could learn how to dress, behave, and ultimately succeed.",Paragraph
In this context architectural ornament derived from the plant life of the Midwest,Paragraph
"was not the expression of individual social status, either inherited or bought, but",Paragraph
of the new society being forged there.,Paragraph
Though Sullivan became increasingly pessimistic about the future of American,Paragraph
"society in the later years of his life, his Prairie School followers carried his par-",Paragraph
"ticular vision of American modernism into the twentieth century. For Wright, it",Paragraph
was the single family house rather than the tall commercial building that best,Paragraph

"of European functionalism, he continued to experiment with abstracted natural",Paragraph
"forms, not only as ornament, as in his turn-of-the-century Prairie Houses, but also",Paragraph

TIMELESS MODERNITY,Title
"But the task of art, and therefore also of modern art, has remained what it has been in",Paragraph

The Postal Savings Bank in Vienna was built in two phases from 1904 to 1906,Paragraph
"and from 1910 to 1912. Its architect, Otto Wagner, was over 60 years old at the",Paragraph
"time, and perhaps the most influential architect in Vienna. He was also a highly",Paragraph
controversial figure. Shortly after he was appointed professor at the Academy of,Paragraph
"Fine Arts he published his lectures, which were both a summary of his professional",Paragraph
"credo and a militant manifesto. This work, entitled Modern Architecture, demanded",Paragraph
that architecture would no longer imitate past forms but become an up-to-date,Paragraph
building art. Wagner's efforts were aided by a lucky coincidence of internal and,Paragraph
external factors. In the 1890s a fundamental change in art and culture had swept,Paragraph
through both Vienna and the rest of Europe. The break with historicism (referred,Paragraph
"to as revivalism) came along with a turn toward the new instead of the old, toward",Paragraph
the creative rather than the receptive. These were widespread themes around 1890,Paragraph
and the revolutionary changes in art and architecture were only part of these pro-,Paragraph
"cesses.” For Wagner this tendency was not without inner contradictions, as his ear-",Paragraph
lier works seemed to relate him to a “free renaissance style.” The turn toward an,Paragraph
ideological radicalism preceded visible changes in his practice.’ A paradoxical — or,Paragraph
according to his admirers tragic — aspect of his career was that although he took part,Paragraph
"in many international and local competitions and developed, exhibited, and pub-",Paragraph
"lished many progressive and inventive projects, he received hardly any public com-",Paragraph
missions until the mid-1890s. Most of his works were apartment buildings of mixed,Paragraph
"function, among them several important and spectacular houses in downtown",Paragraph
Vienna. His big commission in the mid-1890s to design the station buildings,Paragraph
and other structures and amenities of the Stadtbahn (urban railway) was to shape,Paragraph
"definitively the face of the modern metropolis. However, Wagner later complained",Paragraph
of not having received the type of monumental commissions with which he could,Paragraph
have demonstrated the superiority of the modern architectural principles he,Paragraph
espoused. He initiated conceptual plans for buildings such as a modern church,Paragraph
and a variety of museum types. His “agitation project” for the city museum,Paragraph
(1900) was an attempt to pre-empt the announcement of a public competition,Paragraph
in order to be awarded the commission directly. Although he did indeed win,Paragraph
"the competition, which was announced shortly after his action, he was not able",Paragraph
"to realize his plans even after a long and eventful battle. Nevertheless, he went",Paragraph
"on to build two monumental buildings at the beginning of the twentieth century,",Paragraph
which were to be his major works: a church for the psychiatric hospital complex at,Paragraph
Steinhof on the outskirts of Vienna (1902-04) and the Postal Savings Bank,Paragraph
(1903-12). Both are manifestations of his mature approach while naturally differing,Paragraph

"The first part, closer to the Ringstrafe, was erected between 1904 and 1906, and the",Paragraph
second part was built in simplified form between 1909 and 1912.,Paragraph
"The building, which according to Wagner is an exemplary case of a modern",Paragraph

"space in the building required relatively low floor heights, which Wagner justified",Paragraph
by referring to practicalities.,Paragraph
He employed a hybrid construction with concrete floors and load-bearing walls,Paragraph

The different versions of the plan trace the evolution of Wagner’s stylistic devel-,Paragraph
opment from the use of explicitly historicist elements through the influences of the,Paragraph
"Secession to a rational, functionalist approach. At the same time, Wagner distanced",Paragraph
himself more and more from tradition or the idea of continuity. He stated that art,Paragraph
"and architecture should always express their own time. Given the new materials,",Paragraph
"methods of construction, demands, and lifestyle, these should become the starting",Paragraph
"point for artistic creation. In the final phase of this evolution, Wagner arrived at a",Paragraph
"severe form of economic expression, where, as Otto Antonia Graf outlines, “all the",Paragraph
concepts and realized constructions result from the character and purpose of the,Paragraph
"building.”’* This did not entail a ban on tradition, which is present in a clear",Paragraph
"but more indirect, allusive way.",Paragraph
"Wagner emphasized two main functions on the facade: first, the position of the",Paragraph
"directorate on the piano nobile, expressing hierarchy and distinction; and second, the",Paragraph
"entrance with five doors and a canopy above them, which underscored the bustling",Paragraph
public circulation. This construction is kept apart from the main body of the build-,Paragraph

"Wagner, thus, created a number of transitions from the outer to the inner public",Paragraph
"space. First, the urban square functions as an anteroom to the stairs with the can-",Paragraph
"opy. In the building itself we enter an imposing, elegant vestibule with a broad,",Paragraph
"marble staircase, which leads up to a connecting passage that opens onto the hall.",Paragraph
This ceremonial introduction heightens the effect of the main hall in the heart of,Paragraph
the building.,Paragraph
The Heart of the Building: The Counter Hall,Title
Counter halls with a public function have always formed the central part of modern,Paragraph
"bank buildings, beginning with Soane’s spectacular Bank of England (1788-1834).",Paragraph
"Wagner's counter hall is a building within a building, a light iron and glass structure",Paragraph
that contrasts with the stone clad exterior. From the very beginning Wagner placed,Paragraph
the vestibule and the main hall in the center of a symmetric composition. Despite,Paragraph
the explicit demand of the competition brief to allocate the counters for checking,Paragraph
"and savings activities in different rooms, he concentrated all of them in the main",Paragraph
hall and situated the processing administration vertically in the floors on both sides,Paragraph
of the courtyard. The individual floors were arranged flexibly. The safes and safety,Paragraph
"deposit boxes were placed below the courtyard along with a large mail room,",Paragraph
which was connected by lifts to the counters and the administrative offices for,Paragraph
"checking and savings, in order to provide an effective network of communication.",Paragraph
"However, compositional considerations were of equal importance to practical ones",Paragraph
for Wagner. He divided the almost regular quadrilateral courtyard into three parts,Paragraph
in order to achieve the desirable elongated form of the hall. This resulted in a basil-,Paragraph
"ica-like space with three naves, a higher one in the middle section and two lower",Paragraph
aisles on each side.,Paragraph
Perhaps the most effective and influential feature of the counter hall is the,Paragraph
juxtaposition of a sacral type of space with industrial materials and structures.,Paragraph
Iron glass constructions had been a novelty yielding great acclaim in public,Paragraph
buildings since the middle of the nineteenth century. Examples of such anon-,Paragraph
"ymous, transitory spaces of the modern metropolis can be found in exhibition,",Paragraph
"trade, and commercial halls, as well as in department stores. However, the vis-",Paragraph

"Wagner had already used an iron-glass roof in his Landerbank 20 years earlier,",Paragraph

"the Postal Savings Bank, however, Wagner avoided any direct allusion to historical",Paragraph
"forms, and consciously used industrial structures without any traditional ornamen-",Paragraph
"tation. At the same time, he wanted to avoid the “ignoble” appearance of the iron",Paragraph
"trusses caused by the usual industrial green paint and, therefore, devised a method",Paragraph
"to ennoble the iron structure, as he described it: “The naturally very precisely exe-",Paragraph

ing structure to glitter through the roof. Wagner wanted to build a second protec-,Paragraph
tive glass roof at the top of the building but due to the wishes of the client had to,Paragraph
lower it immediately above the visible membrane roof of the hall. Wagner was,Paragraph
"afraid of the unpleasant effects of these changes, in consequence of which he had",Paragraph
"“to lower and simplify the profiles of the side aisles, to thicken the iron trusses in",Paragraph
order to be able to carry the second roof which will take away the ... lightness and,Paragraph
"daintiness of the banking hall.”’* On both sides of the central nave, five columns",Caption
"bear the double-skin structure, running through the lower membrane of the roof.",Paragraph
"Not only the roof but also the floor is made of glass, which is surprising at first sight.",Paragraph
"Perhaps because of the unusual application of glass bricks, this is the only point",Paragraph
where Wagner refers to spectacular examples from abroad. It is no accident that,Paragraph
"these examples are from Paris, which was for Wagner the center of modern life.'®",Paragraph
"The pragmatic argument for the use of the glass bricks was their translucency,",Paragraph
"which allowed the workplaces below the hall to receive natural light. Nevertheless,",Paragraph
"the compositional role and aesthetic effects were at least as important, or even",Paragraph
more so. The field of glass bricks is ordered in a raster of a thin solid framework,Paragraph
made of white granite with black frames and stripes indicating the main direction.,Paragraph
The conception seems to be similar to the description of carpets in Modern Archi-,Paragraph
"tecture. Within an elongated, bigger field, the bricks are always ordered in units of",Paragraph
"four pieces, with two different prismatic patterns. The thick translucent material",Paragraph
refracts light and produces spectacular effects.,Paragraph
Wagner also used glass for cladding the walls. Together with the marble panels,Paragraph
"below and the artificial marble plaster above, the glass panels create a sleek com-",Paragraph
posite surface. The rationale is again functional: the cladding served to protect the,Paragraph
walls from the doodles of the public or clerks who might be tempted to scribble,Paragraph
"their calculations on them. However, the intentions of the composition seem to go",Paragraph
beyond these practicalities as the combined effect of the different kinds and uses of,Paragraph
glass and their harmony with other materials and structures result in complex aes-,Paragraph
thetic effects.,Paragraph
"Wagner was even keen on the newest, rarely used materials such as aluminum,",Paragraph
which he sought to use abundantly for both functional and aesthetic purposes. Its,Paragraph
"silver-like, glittering appearance, together with its ease of cleaning and non-fading",Paragraph
"nature, made it suitable for noble and elegant features both outside and inside the",Paragraph
"building. Aluminum columns by the entrance support the canopy, which acts as a",Caption
"kind of prelude to the banking hall, signaling the difference between the building’s",Paragraph
solid structure and the modern iron-glass construction inside. The iron columns of,Paragraph
the hall are clad in aluminum with geometric ornamentation. Wagner also used,Paragraph
"aluminum for the design of the ventilation and heating pipes, which number among",Paragraph
the most original and inventive elements of the interior. Another new material was,Paragraph
"linoleum, invented in the middle of the nineteenth century, an inexpensive material",Paragraph
for high use areas. He carefully focused on the protection of the heavily used parts of,Paragraph
"the floor. To avoid buckling and the danger of stumbling, the linoleum is inverted",Paragraph
"into the floor and, with the other materials, creates an even surface. Each material",Paragraph
"and form is repeated, transformed, connected, and contrasted with others.",Paragraph
Wagner consciously avoided the use of vivid colors in his design. The colors in,Paragraph
"both public counter hall and work places is a combination of white, gray, silver,",Paragraph
"and black, expressing the economic, hygienic, and impersonal character of the",Paragraph
"institution and the Grofstadt. Nevertheless, in the central hall the palate is nobler,",Paragraph
while in the workplaces it is much simpler — an assembly of a kind of “colorless,Paragraph
"colors.”’” The glass floor and roof, the combination of glittering marble and glass",Paragraph
"panels on the walls, as well as the added marble plaster above them — all add to",Paragraph
"the effects of light. In addition, the exterior walls in the courtyard above the hall",Paragraph
"are plastered in white majolica, the brightness of which further amplifies the",Paragraph
reflections and demonstrates the conscious manner in which Wagner made,Paragraph
his choice of materials and effects. Whereas from a functional point of view,Paragraph
"cleanness and clearness are the keywords, the harmony of materials and effects,",Paragraph
of transparency and reflections and the rich modulations of light result in a sort,Paragraph
of “industrial sublime” and monumentality. The banking hall seems to be float-,Paragraph
"ing in light, strengthened and contrasted even by the artificial light of the pure",Paragraph
electric bulbs.,Paragraph
"Wagner designed the Postal Savings Bank as a Gesamtkunstwerk, an integral work",Paragraph
of art encompassing both the building and its furniture from the smallest detail to the,Paragraph
"whole. The functional aspects, the employment of objects and rooms and their ease",Paragraph
"of care and durability were expressed by Wagner in the different forms of covering,",Paragraph
cladding and fixings. Not only the marble plates but also the glass panels are fixed to,Paragraph
the walls with bolts. The feet and other heavily used parts of the furniture are cov-,Paragraph
ered with aluminum. The use of fixed bolts and heads as structural ornaments can be,Paragraph
"observed in various forms and at different scales, from the furniture and the inner",Paragraph
walls to the facade. There is a certain duality or even ambiguity in this use of “bolts”,Paragraph
"or rivets, which partly act as real structural joints and partly as ornaments.",Paragraph
The Synthesis,Title
"Wagner's original intention was that a final integration of the solid and the ethereal,",Paragraph
"the outer and inner construction, would be achieved with an iron and glass dome",Paragraph
on the top of the building above the courtyard. While this was rejected by the direc-,Paragraph
"tor because of economic and practical reasons, Wagner insisted on the “absolutely",Paragraph

of the main hall with a projected length of 207 meters (127 meters were realized,Paragraph

up in Mies van der Rohe’s later notebook entry that “people who build factories,Paragraph

central to the architectural debates of the time as it is complex. Behrens’ artistic,Paragraph
maxim from his early involvement with the artists’ colony in Darmstadt had been,Paragraph

Behrens explicitly rejected as a “pseudo-aesthetic” the idea of a beautiful form,Paragraph
"that arises directly from the laws of mechanical construction, for “just as nature is",Paragraph

"Das Glashaus hat keinen anderen Zweck, als schén zu sein.’",Paragraph
Part of the prestige of the Glass House rests upon the renown of the man who,Paragraph
"designed it, Bruno Taut (1880-1938), an architect with a particularly ambitious",Paragraph
vision for the future of architecture. Yet Taut’s reputation derives in no small,Paragraph
degree from the Glass House itself — an early work of his career — and the high,Paragraph
place it continues to hold in the history of modern architecture.,Paragraph
The most obvious and exceptional fact about the Glass House is implied in its,Paragraph
seemingly lapidary name. The Glass House is the first among the many buildings,Paragraph
"known simply by the material with which it was built, an attribute also given, for",Paragraph
"example, to houses by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson. This is even",Paragraph

"who called it “my ‘Glass House,’ the lightest possible concrete structure.”” While",Paragraph
"the building’s reinforced concrete construction, particularly its highly complex",Paragraph
"polyhedral lamellar dome structure, was a technical masterpiece in and of itself,",Paragraph
and in respect to its engineering ingenuity more than equal to the application of,Paragraph
"the various kinds of glass,’ it is nonetheless the use of glass that led to this building",Paragraph
becoming one of the most iconic structures of twentieth-century modernism. Self-,Paragraph

A Strange Building at the Werkbund Exhibition,Title
The Glass House was part of the first Deutsche Werkbund-Ausstellung held in,Paragraph
"Cologne in 1914. The Deutscher Werkbund, a German association of artists, archi-",Paragraph
"tects, designers, and industrialists, organized the exhibition in Cologne with the",Paragraph
initial purpose of establishing a partnership between product manufacturers and,Paragraph
design professionals that would improve the competitiveness of German compa-,Paragraph
nies on the global market. As Frederic Schwartz explains in his work on the Werk-,Paragraph
"bund, the organization was formed around 1907 to facilitate cooperation between",Paragraph
"producers, tradesmen, and art professionals. Schwarz writes: “It drew support from",Paragraph
groups within and outside of government who saw the artistic reform of German,Paragraph
production and trade as a source of national prestige and economic prosperity; and,Paragraph
"it spoke also to the many groups, so characteristic of Wilhelmine Germany, who",Paragraph
"furthered cultural reform of all kinds.”* Thus, the Werkbund was as much an art",Paragraph
and manufacturing collaborative as a state-sponsored program intended to inte-,Paragraph
"grate traditional crafts and industrial mass-production techniques, in order to",Paragraph
put Germany on a competitive footing with Great Britain and the United States.,Paragraph
"The exhibition was held at the Rheinpark, a large open green area opposite",Paragraph
"Cologne’s city center. The Hohenzollernbriicke, crossing the Rhine, essentially",Paragraph

to the exhibition situated on the other side of the river. The exhibition had come to,Paragraph

"the Glass House still incomplete. Scheduled to last until the end of October, the",Paragraph
"exhibition was prematurely shut down on August 5, in reaction to the outbreak",Paragraph
of World War I a day earlier.’,Paragraph
The encounter with the Glass House must have been strange for visitors to the,Paragraph
"exhibition grounds. It was as if the earth had miraculously opened, releasing a",Paragraph
building’s base made of concrete that arched upward with a soft curvature in a,Paragraph
shape not unlike the utopian and enormous mega-structure rising out of the Alps,Paragraph
that Taut later drew in Alpine Architecture.” Obviously the Cologne site was not,Paragraph
"Alpine, yet a row of large mirrored glass spheres suggested that these spheres,",Paragraph
"too, were brought up from the underworld to the light; that an eruption had come",Paragraph
to an inadvertent stop where the globes found their ultimate position — all of this,Paragraph
the result of mighty geological forces at play.,Paragraph
"Rising immediately from the bulge-like concrete ring was a tambour frame, sup-",Paragraph
"ported by slim concrete pillars, with partial glass insets in the configuration of a 14-",Paragraph
sided prism. A gently curved and slightly pinnacled rhomboid cupola was built on,Paragraph
"top of the tambour. The glass facets of the cupola, with their mirroring surface,",Paragraph
"took on a greenish-yellowish coloration in bad weather. Somewhat unhappily, this",Paragraph
"appearance gave rise to one of the building’s nicknames, Spargelkopf, meaning",Paragraph
"asparagus tip. In clear weather, though, the glass facets mirrored the crystalline",Paragraph

"wind with the leaves of the adjacent trees, and, sometimes, the fleeting reflection",Paragraph
"ofan airplane. At night-time, the body of the building — illuminated with thousands",Paragraph
of watts from the interior — was transformed into a sparkling and radiating jewel —a,Paragraph
designation one assumes Taut would have preferred.”,Paragraph
The circumstances of how the Glass House became a part of the Werkbund,Paragraph
exhibition are unclear. It was not part of the original building program for the,Paragraph
"exhibition. As a consequence, Taut did not receive an actual building commission",Paragraph
from the exhibition’s board of directors but was assigned a specific location on the,Paragraph

This meant also that the office of the exhibition organizers did not carry the build-,Paragraph

the context in which Sant’Elia was writing. During the first decades of the twentieth,Paragraph

chasm between our own epoch and earlier periods.” Others felt similarly. At,Paragraph
the First International Dada Fair in Berlin George Grosz and John Heartfield pro-,Paragraph
claimed: “Art is dead; long live Tatlin’s machine-art.”,Paragraph
"But as I have already observed, the expectations for difference expressed by",Paragraph

"in subsequent avant-gardes, particularly those of our time.",Paragraph
Leaving aside for a moment the ideas of history and project making that were,Paragraph
"advanced in 1920s and early 1930s, one can observe that project making had been",Paragraph

(not the Gothic) period for Poelzig; and ancient Scandinavia for Asplund.,Paragraph
"If we are to grasp the particularity of their work, especially their built work, we",Paragraph
"need to consider their modernity within the traditions they tried to renew, even",Paragraph
though they also argued against tradition. A common mistake of older histories,Paragraph
of the modern movement is that they accepted the self-identification of the moder-,Paragraph
"nists as modernists at face value, neglecting clear evidences of historical continuity",Paragraph
in their built work and the historical dimension the discipline they sought to renew.,Paragraph
The choice suggested by the last chapter of Vers une architecture — architecture or,Paragraph

used the journal even though he did not share the utopian dimensions of Taut’s,Paragraph

artists and architects. It was not only publications that served the dissemination,Paragraph

fertile soil for the development of projects that proposed radically new possibilities?,Paragraph
"It seems that thought and works that were free from the constraints of actual sites,",Paragraph
"ways of building, and budgets were particularly free for the formulation of new",Paragraph
worlds. What is most striking about the projects of this time is that the designers,Paragraph
convinced themselves that the architecture that emerged from their discussions,Paragraph
would be richer than the world in which it was to find its place.,Paragraph
The projective thinking of these years also shared ground with concurrent art prac-,Paragraph
tices. In one sense this is obvious because a number of the protagonists were both,Paragraph
"artists and architects. Vladimir Tatlin, for example, was mainly a painter. Richard",Paragraph
"anarchitectural project, was envisaged asa synthesis of the arts. Le Corbusier admitted",Paragraph
that his painting studio was a laboratory for the discovery of architectural ideas. While,Paragraph
"Mies van der Rohe was no painter, his dedication to the art of building did not prevent",Paragraph
"him from adopting new art techniques, such as montage, for the representation and",Paragraph
"dissemination of his ideas. Moreover, as George Dodds shows, the relatively high",Paragraph
degree of abstraction of Mies’ Brick Country House drawings allowed — encouraged?,Paragraph
"— comparisons with contemporary painting, particularly when Mies’ plan was viewed",Paragraph
"without its perspective rendering, rotated 90° on the page, and placed alongside Theo",Paragraph
"van Doesburg’s Rhythms of Russian Dance. Van Doesburg, for his part, was as much a",Paragraph
painter as an architect. His Café de Aubette in Strasbourg can be seen as a three-,Paragraph
"dimensional translation of one of his Contra-Compositions, as described in Hilary",Paragraph
Bryon. Van Doesburg described it as the realization of “unbridled imagination.”,Paragraph
"As with Tatlin’s experimental work, in this case the alliance between artistic and archi-",Paragraph

"the 1920s and 1930s, actual buildings did not reveal new possibilities as vividly as draw-",Paragraph
"ings, photographs, models, installations, temporary constructions, and writings.",Paragraph
"Of course many radical proposals named a location for the projects. Yet, the",Paragraph

"to determine. In most of Mies’ renditions of his skyscraper projects, the identifying",Paragraph

"ographical details were added to the lines, angles, thicknesses, and distances shown",Paragraph
"on the plan. Michael Andersen, in his chapter on the Stockholm Public Library,",Paragraph
explains that Asplund backed away from reshaping the building’s immediate vicin-,Paragraph
ity — the transformation of which he had sketched out in an early version of the,Paragraph
project — in order to achieve greater complementarity between its rawness and,Paragraph
the building’s simplicity. Flora Samuel shows that Le Corbusier’s Voisin Plan,Paragraph
"was clearly sited in the center of Paris. But, while some remnants of pre-existing",Paragraph
"conditions were meant to survive the insertion, the relationships between the",Paragraph
orders of the new and old were never articulated and are hard to imagine.,Paragraph
Construction materials also played important roles in these proposals for the new,Paragraph
architecture. Much has been written about the forward-looking character of glass,Paragraph
and steel (ferro-vitreous) construction. These materials were often described as,Paragraph
“modern.” They are still seen in this way today. But two facts make the claim uncon-,Paragraph
vincing: materials like steel and glass were used before this period; and other mate-,Paragraph
"rials, such as brick, were also used in forward-looking designs. Yes, Mies did design a",Paragraph
concrete version of his country house; but his sense of “the modern” did not prevent,Paragraph
him from developing a brick variant too. The conclusion this example suggests is,Paragraph
that materials themselves are neither modern nor traditional; what makes them,Paragraph
"indicative of new thinking is the way they are used, the dimensions of the steel col-",Paragraph
"ummns, the expanse of glass panes, the ways pieces are joined together (to give the",Paragraph
"impression of uninterrupted planarity), their positions with respect to one another,",Paragraph
"these buildings is that new uses — modern uses — were key, and that new applications",Paragraph
were made possible by what today is often called “research” on materials.,Paragraph
A common way research of this kind was undertaken in the architecture of the,Paragraph
1920s and 1930s was by utilizing — as much as possible — a single material for the,Paragraph
whole of the building. Bruno Taut’s Glass Pavilion at the Cologne Exhibition is an,Paragraph
obvious case in point. The projects by Mies already mentioned also isolate and,Paragraph
explore the possibilities of one or two materials: glass and steel in the skyscraper,Paragraph
"projects, concrete and brick in the country houses. Ersoy argues that Mies (re)dis-",Paragraph
"covered the “liquid” character of glass in the FriedrichstraBe project. Similarly, the",Paragraph
first real building undertaken by Bauhaus teachers and students was a study in tim-,Paragraph

"nishings, and ornament. Tatlin’s Monument to the Third International was a study",Paragraph
in the frank (unpainted and unclad) use of steel. In many early modern projects,Paragraph
"(constructivist, expressionist, and De Stijl designs) materials were not specified.",Paragraph
But this did not mean the topic was neglected. The forms and geometries of,Paragraph
van Doesburg’s Contra Compositions were expected to “react dialectically” with,Paragraph
"the materials of construction once the labors of building commenced. This, too,",Paragraph
"would be a time when unforeseen possibilities could be discovered. But again,",Paragraph
"the use, not the material itself was modern. Unprecedented applications disclosed",Paragraph
"new possibilities, sometimes for their own sake, sometimes to represent new ways",Paragraph
"of inhabiting rooms, buildings, or urban settings.",Paragraph
"In the chapters that follow, a basic question arises in different forms: what is the",Paragraph
relationship between the “possible realities” imagined in early modern projects and,Paragraph
the “real possibilities” of the modern world? Flora Samuel’s account of Le Corbu-,Paragraph
sier’s Voisin Plan shows that the design not only proposed the reorganization of a,Paragraph
"large section of the city but also allowed for new architecture, furniture, art works,",Paragraph
"emotions, and therefore new ways of living. Modern forms were meant to be",Paragraph
"“orthopedic,” Le Corbusier said, which is to say corrective.° Ufuk Ersoy explains",Paragraph
that Mies van der Rohe imagined not only a new architecture but also anew human,Paragraph
subject. Life was the target of this re-ordering as much as architecture. The same,Paragraph
"can be seen in the writings and designs of Poelzig, Tatlin, van Doesburg, and",Paragraph
Asplund. The fact that the various realizations of this ambition — the creation of,Paragraph
a new type of person — were challenged by cultural and historical conditions out-,Paragraph

the documentation Tatlin submitted for examination consisted of the two elevation,Paragraph

itarian one.” This rationale was already present in Tatlin’s earlier statement on,Paragraph
"monuments, but he now assigned a more definite program to the structure: the",Paragraph

"“share in the social and public life of the city,” but he did not indicate a proposed",Paragraph

Tatlin’s model was first exhibited in the studio where he and his assistants had,Paragraph

"in 1923, at the “Exhibition of Artists of All Directions” in Petrograd.”*",Paragraph
Reception of the Monument,Title
Tatlin’s project for the Monument found immediate resonance both within Soviet,Paragraph
"Russia and abroad. In January 1921 Shklovskii praised the project, writing that “the",Paragraph
"Monument is made of glass, iron, and Revolution.””* In 1923 the poet Vladimir",Paragraph
Mayakovsky counted Tatlin’s Monument among the “first art objects of the,Paragraph
post-October epoch.””’ Tatlin’s work also attracted the attention of the Soviet lead-,Paragraph
"ership, notably Leon Trotsky. In his Literature and Revolution, which was first pub-",Paragraph

historical styles in his Monument and in “attempting to subordinate the entire,Paragraph
design to a correct constructive use of material.””“ He nevertheless expressed skep-,Paragraph

Tatlin’s Monument had a broad impact on the international scene. Reports on,Paragraph

Leningrad; the other at the International Exposition of Decorative Arts in Paris.,Paragraph
While Tatlin’s Monument circulated through the vectors of an emerging inter-,Paragraph
"national art world, Soviet architects responded to the complex spatial and program-",Paragraph
matic propositions Tatlin had put forward. Lissitzky captured the paradoxical role,Paragraph
of Tatlin’s Monument in the development of Soviet architecture with great clarity.,Paragraph
"nhis lecture “On New Russian Art” of 1922, Lissitzky noted that “within the sphere",Paragraph
"of architecture proper, the most important work was accomplished only on theo-",Paragraph
"retical territory, in consequence of the absolute paralysis of building.” He counted",Paragraph
Tatlin’s Monument as one of the few “architectural manifestations of recent years.”,Paragraph
"But, as Lissitzky never tired of pointing out, Tatlin’s Monument was not the",Paragraph
"achievement of an architect but the work of a painter. Tatlin, unlike Lissitzky,",Paragraph
had no architectural training. Lissitzky nevertheless described the Monument as,Paragraph
"“the first work of the new generation, which is demanding of itself invention, ele-",Paragraph
"mentary design, clear construction and mastery of material.””° Eight years later, in",Paragraph
"his book Russland (1930), Lissitzky modified his interpretation of Tatlin’s tower.",Paragraph
"With a hint of disdain, Lissitzky recalled how Tatlin “assumed ... that the intuitive",Paragraph
and artistic mastery of materials would lead to inventions on the basis of which,Paragraph
objects could be constructed.”*° Lissitzky identified Tatlin’s work as a landmark,Paragraph
"in architectural constructivism, but he nevertheless offered the disparaging sugges-",Paragraph

gon II at Khorsabad.,Caption
Tatlin’s relationship to architectural constructivism was complex. With few,Paragraph
"exceptions, constructivist architects rarely claimed Tatlin’s legacy as their own.",Paragraph
Moisei Ginzburg hardly mentioned Tatlin in his 1924 book Stil i epokha (Style,Paragraph
and Epoch). This text was a first attempt to identify the sources of what Ginzburg,Paragraph
called Gn purely Wolfflinian fashion) “the characteristic aspects of the new style.”,Paragraph
Ginzburg illustrated Tatlin’s Monument in the book’s crucial chapter on construc-,Paragraph
"tivism in architecture, but he did not discuss it in his text.’’ Six years later, Ginzburg",Paragraph
would level a harsh critique at Tatlin in the pages of Sovremennaia arkhitektura,Paragraph
"(Contemporary Architecture). Here, in 1928, Ginzburg described Tatlin’s “engi-",Paragraph
neering compositions” as demonstrations that he was fully alienated from both,Paragraph
social and technical reality.’”,Paragraph
Despite Ginzburg’s reservations about Tatlin’s relationship to architectural,Paragraph
"constructivism, there was a direct and strong link between Tatlin and Aleksandr",Paragraph
"Vesnin. Perhaps more than anyone else, Vesnin was responsible for bringing",Paragraph
the principles of constructivism to architecture. He was present during the crucial,Paragraph
debates of 1921 at Moscow’s Institute of Artistic Culture where constructivism was,Paragraph
"first defined, and he worked very closely with Liubov’ Popova on a number of pro-",Paragraph
jects in the early 1920s. Vesnin also claimed to have worked with Tatlin.,Paragraph
Tatlin’s influence is evident in a project Vesnin and Popova produced for the,Paragraph
meeting of the delegates of the Third International in 1921. Vesnin and Popova,Caption
devised a mass spectacle that was to take place during the event in Moscow. It,Paragraph
was to be a theatrical contest between the “citadel of Capital” and the Socialist city,Paragraph
"of the future. The socialist city is made up of lattice-like trusses, and the entire scene",Paragraph
appears to be bound together by high-tension cables. There is certainly a formal,Paragraph
"resemblance to the open-work structure that Tatlin devised for his Monument,",Paragraph
"but the very concept of the event is more significant, for it recalls Tatlin’s interest",Paragraph
in staging a spectacle on the construction of the Monument in Petrograd.,Paragraph
"Vesnin and Popova’s project resembles a stage design, and it was on the stage",Paragraph
that constructivist architecture found its first realizations. Vesnin’s set for Alek-,Paragraph
"sandr Tairov’s production of G. K. Chesterton’s The Man who was Thursday, which",Paragraph

"in his project with Popova. He also made use of curved ramps, and the set incor-",Paragraph
porated moving platforms and crane-like arms. Lissitzky recognized the novelty of,Paragraph
"Vesnin’s work. In his lecture “On New Russian Art” of 1922, he noted that the",Paragraph
set allows one to “trace how the principles of the Tatlin tower have been applied,Paragraph
"to the theater.”*’ Lissitzky’s remark is especially significant, for it is only a short",Paragraph

ment of architectural constructivism. Their Palace of Labor emphasizes the build-,Paragraph
ing’s reinforced concrete frame through the rhythmic articulation of austere,Paragraph
structural members — a quality that links it to Tatlin’s interest in the culture of,Paragraph
materials.,Paragraph
Konstantin Melnikov translated Tatlin’s dynamism into concrete architectural,Paragraph
projects. His entry to the competition of 1924 for the Moscow headquarters of,Paragraph
the newspaper Leningradskaia Pravda made dynamism a basic operating principle.,Paragraph
"His building’s four upper floors were to be anchored to a central, cylindrical core,",Paragraph
which would act as the pivot around which each floor could rotate freely. The,Paragraph
movement of the floors would not only alter the building in plan; it would also,Paragraph
lend the building a constantly changing silhouette. Melnikov’s project represents,Paragraph
"a reinterpretation and extroversion of the internal, rotating forms of Tatlin’s tower.",Paragraph
The dynamism of Tatlin’s tower would also find its detractors; Lissitzky would,Paragraph
ultimately be among them. While he noted the innovative qualities of Tatlin’s,Paragraph
"work in his lecture on Russian art of 1922, Lissitzky also wrote that “this group",Paragraph
reached a kind of material-fetishism and forgot the necessity of creating a new plan.,Paragraph
At times this reminds one of building a concrete railway-station from a Gothic,Paragraph
"design.”** In place of this alleged material fetishism and overt dynamism, Lissitzky",Paragraph
emphasized the importance of what he called spatial equilibrium. To establish this,Paragraph
condition was one of the fundamental aims of his Wolkenbiigel project (1923-25).,Paragraph
"Here vertical pillars counteract horizontal floors, producing an asymmetrical",Paragraph
"balance. In contrast to the revolving shapes of Tatlin’s tower, Lissitzky ensured that",Paragraph
his series of skyscrapers for Moscow would become stable points of orientation,Paragraph
within the city’s expanding urban scale.,Paragraph
A fourth vector of Tatlin’s architectural legacy concerns electromagnetic waves.,Paragraph
"A radio station, telegraph cabins, telephone centers, and great projectors that could",Paragraph
display movies and messages on the clouds were all integral parts of Tatlin’s,Paragraph
"Monument. As Punin wrote, “radio, screen, and cables are elements of the Mon-",Paragraph
"ument, and they can also be elements of form.”?” Tatlin’s interest in these media",Paragraph
technologies had a strong spatial dimension: the radio station was to be equipped,Paragraph
"with an antenna capable of reaching the entire world, thus suggesting that he con-",Paragraph
ceived the scope of the Monument on a global scale.,Paragraph
"In a series of understudied projects, Ivan Leonidov explored the relationship",Paragraph
between architecture and broadcast media that Tatlin outlined. This is evident,Paragraph
"in Leonidov’s project for a monument to Christopher Columbus (1929), which",Paragraph
"was to be located in Santiago, Chile. The aim of Leonidov’s Monument was the",Paragraph
“condensation of all the achievements of world progress.”*° The center of the Mon-,Paragraph
ument was a “radio-port” composed of two 300 m-tall pylons. He imagined that on,Paragraph
"the open squares of cities around the world, screens would be installed that would",Paragraph

social and technological progress. In Leonidov’s remarkable Monument we find a,Paragraph
"direct response to the most expansive, if least visible, ambitions of Tatlin’s Mon-",Paragraph
ument to the Third International.,Paragraph
"By the early 1930s, the reception of Tatlin’s Monument in the Soviet Union",Paragraph
"adopted a new character. In his book, Puti arkhitekturnoi mysli, 1917-1932 (Paths",Paragraph
"of Architectural Thought, 1917-1932), Roman Khiger described Tatlin’s project",Paragraph
as a “typical product of the chaotic aesthetic reflexes of revolution” and noted that,Paragraph
it represented a “primitive desire to embody the dynamism of revolution” in archi-,Paragraph
tectural form.*” Tatlin’s Monument received little attention from Soviet critics,Paragraph
"during the following decades. In his book, Vyvoj sovetské architektury (The Devel-",Paragraph
"opment of Soviet Architecture) of 1936, the Czech critic Karel Teige drew a parallel",Paragraph
"between Tatlin’s tower and the project for the Palace of the Soviets by Boris lofan,",Paragraph
"Vladimir Shchuko, and Vladimir Gel’freikh. While noting that Tatlin’s tower was",Paragraph
"an early attempt to apply constructivist principles, Teige nevertheless dismissed the",Paragraph
"project as “purely formalist, metaphysical, and idealistic” because it had allegedly",Paragraph
"been conceived as a symbol, not designed according to functional methods.** After",Paragraph
"World War II, in the final years of Stalin’s reign, Mikhail Tsapenko described",Paragraph
Tatlin’s tower as an “absurd formalist exercise” in a doctrinaire book on the “realist,Paragraph
foundations” of Soviet architecture.”,Paragraph
Only in the 1960s would architects and historians revive serious interest in,Paragraph
Tatlin’s Monument and its conceptual underpinning.” The first review of Tatlin’s,Paragraph
"work to appear in the Soviet Union following his death in 1953, was published in",Paragraph
"Dekorativnoe iskusstvo in 1966, on what would have been the artist’s 80th birthday.”",Paragraph
In Western Europe Tatlin’s legacy was celebrated slightly earlier. Two important,Paragraph
publications that addressed Tatin’s Monument appeared in 1962: Camilla Gray’s,Paragraph
"The Great Experiment: Russian Art, 1863-1922 and an extraordinary issue of Casabella",Title
"Continuita devoted to the USSR. Vittorio De Feo’s landmark URSS architettura,",Caption
1917-1936 followed in 1963; Anatole Kopp discussed Tatlin’s Monument at length,Paragraph

In the architectural discourse of the second half of the twentieth century and up,Paragraph
"until today, glass architecture has been widely seen in technical terms, obvious in",Paragraph
"its properties, selfevidently useful, and plainly modern. From this vantage point,",Paragraph
"the approaches taken by Taut and Mies may well seem surprising, as if they sought",Paragraph
not to use but to fetishize an industrial product and the techniques of its use. From,Paragraph
"their vantage point, however, glass was neither an icon of industrialization nor an",Paragraph
obsession of bourgeois culture. Nor were its properties obvious. Even if it had not,Paragraph
"yet been architectonically mastered, it was a material that could redefine the nature",Paragraph
of architectural space. As Arthur Korn wrote in Glas im Bau und als Gebrauchsgegen-,Paragraph
stand (1929): “[glass] can enclose and open up spaces in more than one direction. Its,Paragraph
peculiar advantage is in the diversity of the impressions it creates.””,Paragraph
"When these two architects are viewed together, Korn seems to have been",Paragraph
"correct, for both Taut and Mies used glass to open interior space in multiple",Paragraph
"directions. Yet, their approaches also differed, at least in Korn’s view. Believing",Paragraph
that the order of modern architecture and of modern culture more generally,Paragraph
"was based on the rational and objective laws of building art, Korn presented",Paragraph
"Mies’ perspective as the opening page of his book. Taut’s Glashaus, by contrast,",Paragraph

as will be clear in what follows.,Paragraph
Glass Architecture,Title

observed that the misuse of industrial materials had mechanized the interiors,Paragraph
"both of buildings and of the individuals who inhabited them.® In reaction, he",Paragraph
"attempted to redefine their use, to imagine expressions and meanings that were",Paragraph
radically alternative. Scheerbart’s most significant and typical literary tactic was,Paragraph
"“fictional estrangement.”'° Through a series of metaphorical utterances, he cre-",Paragraph
ated semantic ambiguities that destabilized postulations that had mostly been,Paragraph
taken for granted by the general population. The aim was not destabilization,Paragraph
"for its own sake, but to stimulate his readers’ imaginations. One of the most",Paragraph
effective ways by which Scheerbart attempted to loosen the link between words,Paragraph
"and world was with the use of glass. For the poet, glass, specifically colored glass,",Paragraph
could serve as a metaphoric tool to deform what one perceived. His aim was to,Paragraph
free the mind from habitual images in memory. To this end glass became an,Paragraph
"instrument of imaginative freedom, capable of engendering possible, if unknown",Paragraph
environments.,Paragraph
"In 1914, after learning about Taut’s engagement in the Glass House project,",Paragraph
"and in the hope of extending the imaginative abilities of architects, Scheerbart",Paragraph
attempted to translate his ideas into architecture. The result was his widely,Paragraph
"known manifesto, Glasarchitektur.'! In the first and strongest chapter of the",Paragraph
text he invited architects to break open the closed character of the rooms in,Paragraph
which modern men had been constrained to live. He intentionally juxtaposed,Paragraph
"architecture with glass to separate buildings from their ordinary, pragmatic",Paragraph
definition.,Paragraph
"Taut’s Glashaus was designed with a similar intent, exploiting glass’s fictional and",Paragraph
"estranging potential. In Taut’s view, what distinguished glass from other materials",Paragraph
"was its fictive character. Although it “emanated” from the earth, it could act as if it",Paragraph
"were intangible. By virtue of its changeable nature, submissive one might say to",Paragraph
"external or ambient influences, it could mimic “air, water, fire,” and overcome",Paragraph
the heaviness of the earth.'* This meant that glass could help the architect elevate,Paragraph
"the materials of construction toward the immaterial. Furthermore, glass was not",Paragraph
"only to chronicle substantial transformations of the earth surface, but also to carry",Paragraph
“subtle” values and feelings that would stimulate the human psyche. Through col-,Paragraph
"orful luminous surfaces in constant flux, Taut created perceptual ambiguity, which",Paragraph
"encouraged the impression of an architecture without earthly limitations, agitating",Paragraph
the visitors’ sense of horizon. After visitors entered the glass hall their contact with,Paragraph
mundane reality was suspended.,Paragraph
"From a distance the Glashaus looked like a gemstone, one that crystalized sub-",Paragraph
"surface potentials. Coming closer, one would notice a substantial transformation",Paragraph
"from the bottom upward. Emerging from a sculpted, organically shaped concrete",Paragraph
"base, the building ended in the crystalline geometry of the polyhedral cupola,",Paragraph
which was composed of rhomboids.,Paragraph
"The art critic Adolf Behne, who hoped that the renewal of arts would generate",Paragraph
"a spiritual revolution and change the modern individual, appreciated the Glashaus",Paragraph
for having given shape to nothing other than its “inner-artistic” purpose.’ Taut’s,Paragraph
building was a purpose-free — zweckfrei — work that freed technology from its,Paragraph
pragmatic concerns. Taut had accomplished this by returning to “the primal ele-,Paragraph

"primal elements were enlivened through “pure” artistic means of color, line, and",Paragraph
"light. Leaving aside all derivative elements, Taut invented his own modern orna-",Paragraph

"buildings, as if they embodied an inexhaustible force. His aim was to cause a psychic",Paragraph
"excitement of airiness that would evoke the dreams of flight or fall. Mies, on the",Paragraph

THEO VAN DOESBURG'S OBLIQUE VIEW OF,Paragraph
MODERN ARCHITECTURE,Title
Theo van Doesburg’s Contra-Construction is one of modern architecture’s iconic,Paragraph
pictorial representations. Embedded in its traces are early modernism’s regard for,Paragraph
"universality and infinite space, and by extension spatial simultaneity and formal",Paragraph
"abstraction. The drawing’s convention itself, parallel projection, is inherently based",Paragraph
"on the concept of infinity. Unlike perspective, pictorial depth is indicated objectively",Paragraph
"via parallel projectors extending infinitely. As well, the Contra-Construction is an",Paragraph
oblique parallel projection drawing and thus has coexisting two-dimensional and,Paragraph
"three-dimensional spatial aspects. Of course, parallel projection techniques had been",Paragraph
"representational tools with varied ends for engineers, architects, and artists for cen-",Paragraph
"turies, but van Doesburg’s drawing immerses the representation in its projective",Paragraph
"essence. For perhaps the first time, the visual expression of a conceptual proposition",Paragraph
exactly coincided with this means of architectural representation.,Paragraph
De Stijl,Title
"In 1917, near the end of the tumultuous First World War, a collective of Dutch",Paragraph
"artists and architects formed the De Stijl, or the Style, group to promote painting,",Paragraph
"sculpture, and architecture as cooperative artistic endeavors with a common aim of",Paragraph
"advancing a new, unified order to be shared by the arts, life, and culture. In varied",Paragraph
"ways, the artistic movement coalesced as a response to cubism and perhaps to",Paragraph

"ever, it was through art, be it painting or architecture, that the group probed new,",Paragraph
"plastic modes of expression, or in other words, the non-mimetic embodiment of",Paragraph
nature’s underlying laws or principles particular to each art form.,Paragraph
Theory of Neoplasticism in Painting,Title
Mondrian’s early ideas and work featured largely in De Stijl’s initial neoplastic,Paragraph
"tenets. From about 1918 onward, Mondrian tested not only abstraction in",Paragraph
painting but also its transcendence by engaging how one could use the universa.,Paragraph

"that plastic mathematics, or positive mysticism, was a means of contemplation",Paragraph
on the eternal laws of cosmic creation because it “penetrate[s] nature in such,Paragraph
a way that the inner construction of reality is revealed to us.”* Schoenmaekers’,Paragraph
writings ruminated directly on what would become De Stijl’s geometric and,Paragraph
"color principles. Within his theory of contraries, or mystical dialectics, Schoen-",Paragraph
"maekers laid out the fundamental, qualitative differences, yet necessary balance,",Paragraph
"between the vertical and the horizontal.’ He explained, “the two fundamental,",Paragraph
"complete contraries which shape our earth and all that is of the earth, are: the",Paragraph
"horizontal line of power, that is the course of the earth around the sun and",Paragraph
"the vertical, profoundly spatial movement of rays that originates in the center",Paragraph
"of the sun.”® Following this line of reasoning, the horizontal line, the vertical",Paragraph
"ray, their perpendicular intersection, and thus a principle of the right angle were",Paragraph
established as the absolute fundamentals of natural construction that must be put,Paragraph
into equilibrium.’ Color was similarly configured: “The three principal colors are,Paragraph
"essentially yellow, blue, and red. They are the only colors existing ... Yellow is the",Paragraph
"movement of the ray ... Blue is the contrasting color to yellow ... Asa color, blue",Paragraph
"is the firmament, it is line, horizontality. Red is the mating of yellow and blue ...",Paragraph

Architectonic Plasticism,Title
Architecture’s neoplastic means were also discussed in the pages of De Stijl.,Paragraph
"Between 1917 and 1920, the De Stijl architects reviewed the plastic approaches",Paragraph
"of others as well as presenting their own designs.'° Later, Van Doesburg used their",Paragraph
plastic forms to identify the principles of architectonic plasticism.’’ He noted a,Paragraph
"house by Van’t Hoff, observing that its external features result from its internal",Paragraph
"features, every spatial unit can be perceived from the outside, and its ideal form",Paragraph
"transcends nature.” Also, note the reinforced concrete house had a flat roof and",Paragraph

articulated with cantilevered overhangs. A hotel by Wils was referenced for its,Paragraph

and some latent formal properties evidenced in Frank Lloyd Wright’s Prairie,Paragraph

"Berlage (1856-1934), such as cornices and banding emphasizing the horizontal and",Paragraph
an exterior form of aggregated volumes extending from an interior core element or,Paragraph
volume.'* Van Doesburg applauded the early plastic works of the De Stijl architects,Paragraph
and conceded that architecture’s “plasticism will evolve from the functional needs,Paragraph
"which determine the division of space,” but he added that in order to achieve a",Paragraph
"truly monumental art, the problem of “color and space is the most important.”1*",Title
Painting and Architecture,Title
The fundamental association of architecture and color had been laid out in De Stijl’s,Paragraph
"first issue by the painter Bart van der Leck. In his essay, “The Place of Modern",Paragraph
"Painting in Architecture,” Van der Leck explained that because architecture is con-",Paragraph
"structional, closed, and colorless, with planar surfaces and space-restricting flatness,",Paragraph

Whereas Mondrian focused primarily on developing neoplastic ideas in his,Paragraph

returned to and redrew the Contra-Construction drawings — twice. Both circum-,Paragraph

The first adjustment to the notion of Contra-Construction straddles 1923-24.,Paragraph

"evolved as a compelling spatio-geometric question, but this was challenged in the",Paragraph
early 1920s when the Theory of Relativity posited time as the fourth dimension in,Paragraph
"the space-time continuum. In 1922, Van Doesburg recognized the issue, writing in",Paragraph
"De Stijl, “a new and important problem has arisen in painting and sculpture beside",Paragraph
"the problem of space, and that is the problem of time.”**",Paragraph
"By 1923, Van Doesburg related both space and time to the exhibited architecture;",Paragraph
the accompanying Manifesto noted: “We have studied the relationship between space,Paragraph
and time and have found that the plastic expression of these two elements through,Paragraph
color gives a new dimension.”*” One infers here that the fourth dimension is engaged,Paragraph
"through color. Yet, it was not until 1928 that Van Doesburg explained how space and",Paragraph
time were purposely and plastically expressed through color in architecture.** His,Paragraph
"argument sets out that neoplastic, two-dimensional paintings not only established a",Paragraph

man is metaphorically moved by color’s plastic space and from “this relationship of,Paragraph
"‘dynamic man’ to space, a new notion was established to architecture, the notion",Paragraph
"of time.” In architecture, man’s actual movement in space would allow man not only",Paragraph
"to engage color as in the painting, but also to engage color in time. Thus, color’s role",Paragraph
"expands in architecture as “space-time painting.”’” Put simply, color engaged dynam-",Paragraph

THE FUNCTIONAL CITY,Title
The city plans of the Franco-Swiss architect Le Corbusier changed the face of town,Paragraph
planning in the postwar era. The three best known are the Ville contemporaine,Paragraph
"(1922, also known as the City of Three Million), the Plan Voisin (1925), the focus",Paragraph
"of this chapter, and the Radiant City (1933). The Plan Voisin, developed together",Paragraph
"with his cousin Pierre Jeanneret, was particularly controversial as it was here, for",Paragraph
"the first time, that Le Corbusier translated the brittle assertions of his canonical",Paragraph
"books, Toward an Architecture (1923), The City of Tomorrow (1924) and The Decorative",Paragraph
Art of Today (1925) to a real site — Paris.,Paragraph
"At the core of this discussion is the definition of the “functional city,” in Le",Paragraph
"Corbusier's terms, a city that provided the body with emotional as well as physical",Paragraph
sustenance: “A form of town planning which ... attempted to create happiness and,Paragraph
expel misery would be a noble service in this age of confusion.”’ I will draw on Le,Paragraph
Corbusier's fondness for dualistic thinking to differentiate bodily needs in terms of,Paragraph
the poetic (emotional) and the utilitarian (the ingress and egress of provisions and,Paragraph
waste).” Having illustrated how these two needs were to be addressed by the Plan,Paragraph
"Voisin and one of its “cells,” the Esprit Nouveau Pavilion, I will discuss the reasons",Paragraph
"for what I believe to be a distortion of his ideas toward the utilitarian, leading to the",Paragraph
subsequent neglect of the poetic body in many of the “Le Corbusier inspired” city,Paragraph
plans of the 1950s and 1960s.,Paragraph
It is my intention to focus on the motivations and methodology beneath the Plan,Paragraph
Voisin in order to tease out its importance for the development of architectural,Paragraph

"for the Voisin plan,” part of a long tradition of urbanism in France and a vision that,",Paragraph

"ike Le Corbusier's, was strongly influenced by the socialist utopianism of Charles",Paragraph

No other architect has received as much attention as Le Corbusier. His upbring-,Paragraph
ing (as Charles Edouard Jeanneret) and self-education through books and travel,Paragraph
"have been studied in minute detail by scholars from a variety of angles, though",Paragraph
"much still remains obscure.* Le Corbusier was a connoisseur, a collector of objects",Paragraph
"and ideas. His work, both at large and small scale, was an exercise in curatorship",Paragraph
and ordering. Deeply troubled by what he saw as the chaos of the world around,Paragraph
"him, he sought “a new age of discipline, wisdom and unanimity.” Spirituality",Paragraph
played a vexed role in all this. Having been quick to depart from the religion within,Paragraph
"which he was raised, he spent much of his life looking for a system of belief that",Paragraph
"made sense of the world around him, a journey that led him to nature,'° to science,",Paragraph
and eventually to an Orphic vision of the world as a system of mathematical rela-,Paragraph
tionships charged with energy and indeed love. His more arcane ideas are couched,Paragraph
"cryptically within his writings, left obscure for fear of ridicule in an architectural",Paragraph
"milieu that increasingly favored the rational, a key factor in the misinterpretation",Paragraph
"of his work.""*",Paragraph
"As a young man Le Corbusier described his city plans as “technical,” apparently",Paragraph
"because he wanted to get away from accusations of political bias.'” Politics are,",Paragraph
"however, central to the making of a city. The source of the word politics is ancient",Paragraph
"Greek. Aristotle’s Politics focused on the political life of the city, the polis. Although",Paragraph
"well versed in Aristotle, Le Corbusier was very careful to side-step such issues,",Paragraph
which are nevertheless absolutely integral to an accurate understanding of his moti-,Paragraph

"1919, helped to finance not only the Plan but also the Esprit Nouveau Pavilion",Paragraph

"for “their luxury and artisanal manufacture,” rendering it slightly ironic that his",Paragraph

in the innate bodily appeal of Platonic solids such as the cone or the cube. “The,Paragraph

a system of “regulating lines” giving geometric order to space and form. Such ideas,Paragraph
would eventually evolve into his theory of the Modulor.°’ Underpinning all this is,Paragraph
"the belief, again inspired by Plato, that if it is possible to change the way people feel",Paragraph

Mass production was the vital next step in Le Corbusier’s vision. The industri-,Paragraph

desired. In the chapter “Mass Production Houses” in Toward an Architecture he,Paragraph
drew connections between the production of cars and the production of houses.,Paragraph

"of evolutionary endeavor. The house should become “a machine for living,” the",Paragraph

Addressing the Needs of the Utilitarian Body,Title
There are moments in Le Corbusier's narrative when the needs of the poetic,Paragraph

"which are few, seem to have been those with the greatest impact as they discuss",Paragraph

"How such measurements, well known for flattening out the subjective, tally with",Paragraph
his poetic world view is a moot point.,Paragraph
Le Corbusier’s fascination with order led him inevitably to the concept of,Paragraph
"zoning. All his city plans are zoned with areas devoted to industry, housing,",Paragraph
"and so on. The passage of people, cars, and other forms of transport would be",Paragraph
similarly segregated. “The motor has killed the great city. The motor must save the,Paragraph
"great city,” wrote Le Corbusier.*” In his opinion, “the ‘corridor-street’ between its",Paragraph
"two pavements, stifled between tall houses, must disappear.”** It was chaotic, dark",Paragraph
"and unhealthy. Inspired, in part, by the Garden City ideal of Raymond Unwin, he",Paragraph
"proposed instead a series of aerial arteries devoted to vehicular traffic, leaving the",Paragraph
verdant ground plane free for pedestrians who would move through the city on a,Paragraph
"series of platforms and what have come to be known as “streets in the sky,” perhaps",Paragraph
his most infamous legacy.,Paragraph
Legacy of Voisin,Title
Although he continued to search for a higher authority with the vision of Colbert or,Paragraph
"Louis XIV, Le Corbusier was soon to be disabused of his delusion that capitalism",Paragraph
would bring about the city that he so desired. The assumptions behind the Plan,Paragraph
"Voisin were that that zoning was desirable, that the use of geometry could be used",Paragraph
"to make a link between the city and the poetic body (with quasi-scientific results),",Paragraph
and that mass production would provide the key to creating the unity in detail nec-,Paragraph
essary for a visually ordered city. The garden that formed its backdrop would be a,Paragraph
"pleasant place affirming the links between nature and mankind, again addressing",Paragraph
"poetic needs; and further, and most importantly, that the needs of the poetic and",Paragraph
utilitarian body must be addressed in tandem. For Le Corbusier the term “func-,Paragraph
"tional” encompassed emotional and sensory needs, a fact that escaped the majority",Paragraph
"of commentators, notably the eminent historian Nikolaus Pevsner, who wrote the",Paragraph
history of modernism for generations of architects with the utilitarian body very,Paragraph
much in mind.*?,Paragraph
"Le Corbusier himself came to detest the word functional, which in the hands of",Paragraph
"Hannes Meyer and others became increasingly bogus in its pursuit of objectivity,",Paragraph
denying the “magical” qualities of architecture that he felt to be so important. Le,Paragraph
"Corbusier raged at the misrepresentation of his ideas, but in leaving his work so",Paragraph
"ambiguous and open for interpretation, he was often his own worst enemy.**",Paragraph
The primary organ for spreading “the functional city’ were the meetings of,Paragraph
"CIAM, the Congrés internationaux d’architecture moderne founded in Switzerland",Paragraph
"in 1928.7 After World War II, local authorities all over Europe, tasked with the",Paragraph
"swift reconstruction of their cities, were quick to understand the cost-saving poten-",Paragraph

"Council, were happy to deliver homes to people who did not always accept the",Paragraph

principles but ignored their philosophical grounding. The utilitarian body might,Paragraph

"Communities’ 1990 Green Paper on the Urban Environment, which stressed the",Paragraph
importance of a “mixing of urban uses” taking “the old traditional life of the Euro-,Paragraph
pean city” as its model.*°,Paragraph
"Writing in the early 1990s Robert Fishman stated, “the Plan Voisin still arouses",Paragraph
"the same horror as it did at its original showing,” I suspect because of its seemingly",Paragraph
wanton destruction of a large swathe of Paris.°” Many would say it is just as well,Paragraph
"that the Plan Voisin has never been tested in its entirety, the postwar experiments",Paragraph
in city planning being too far from Le Corbusier’s original conception to count in,Paragraph
my opinion. Ultimately the potential benefit of Le Corbusier's city vision for a will-,Paragraph
"ing populace, under the right political conditions, has yet to be properly tested —",Paragraph
only his Unité d’habitation in Marseille (started 1947) giving some sense of what,Paragraph
might be possible.**,Paragraph
Conclusion,Title
Much of the blame for the misinterpretation of Le Corbusier’s theories must lie,Paragraph
with Le Corbusier himself. The Plan Voisin was an attempt to create a universal,Paragraph
city for an individual place while addressing a generalized vision of bodily need. His,Paragraph
knowledge of history had taught Le Corbusier that such a solution needed to be,Paragraph
slippery in its semantics offering multiple possible interpretations if it was to stand,Paragraph
any chance of success over time. It is for this reason that Charles Jencks was partly,Paragraph
correct to identify Le Corbusier as the first Post Modern architect.,Paragraph
That Le Corbusier came to understand that there are no universal solutions can be,Paragraph
seen from a sketch that he made of himself as Don Quixote tilting at the windmills of,Paragraph
"his own ideals (dated 6 October 1953), a drawing that offers much to the profession",Paragraph
even today. Le Corbusier's early career was spent constructing a vision of world,Paragraph
"order, but it was filled with contradiction and empty assertions. He was not immune",Paragraph
"to the pressures caused by finance, politics, and fashion. During his late career he",Paragraph
"came to understand the futility of pursuing his early vision, but the importance of",Paragraph
pursuing it anyway. The decisive clash of real and ideal that is the Plan Voisin exem-,Paragraph
plifies this conundrum perhaps more than any other Le Corbusier scheme.,Paragraph

Building in the City,Title
"Like many other European cities, Stockholm underwent great changes in the early",Paragraph
"twentieth century and Asplund, a writer, editor, and practicing architect, took an",Paragraph
"active part in that development. In a lecture, published in the journal Arkitektur, he",Paragraph
discussed the city’s monumentality and voiced his skepticism about the expressive,Paragraph
"design of housing facades at the time, which, to his mind, attracted way too much",Paragraph
attention in the cityscape:,Paragraph
"A city gets its charm from the rhythmic alternation between simple, modest apart-",Paragraph

"to be displayed to its best advantage, this simple and familiar rule also applies to",Paragraph
the art of city building |... the effect of a cityscape with a monumental building will,Paragraph
depend on both its placement in the city plan and its architectural design.’,Paragraph
In the years around 1920 Asplund’s interest in the city’s development was embo-,Paragraph
died in his design of the Sédermalm housing development and his competition,Paragraph
"entries for Gétaplatsen, Gustav Adolf Square, and the Royal Chancellery (with",Caption

"the lack of planning in Stockholm, he mentioned the eastern part of Observator-",Paragraph

Asplund’s work on the project over the next decade not only shows the great,Paragraph
"care with which he made the building, but also indicates the changes and new direc-",Paragraph
"tions in his architecture in the period. The hill, with its observatory, towers over",Paragraph
"the roofs of the city. It is cut offby two busy thoroughfares, Sveavagen to the north-",Paragraph
"east and Odengatan to the northwest. In his early sketches, Asplund was working",Paragraph
with a site plan in which a continuous volume along Sveavagen would contain a,Paragraph
number of different institutions. These did not correspond to the municipal land-,Paragraph
"use plan, which accentuated the corner of the site with a monumental square",Paragraph
"framed by buildings. This plan was published in the journal Byggmdstaren, together",Paragraph
"with three of Asplund’s subsequent proposals, in which the library is a separate",Paragraph
building with a circle-in-a-square floor plan.’ The site plan for the three proposals,Paragraph
shows how he first located the building on Sveavagen and then moved it to the,Paragraph
"street corner, before finally placing it on Odengatan with a new orientation of",Paragraph
the main entrance.,Paragraph
"In the studies of the library’s placement and orientation, the surrounding obser-",Paragraph
"vation hill is likewise shaped in different ways. In the first of the three site plans, the",Paragraph
"landscape is subordinated to an idealized geometry, in which the irregular hill",Paragraph
"would be straightened out into a terraced, rectilinear park with regularly spaced",Paragraph
vegetation and large staircases. The landscape was made an object of the will to,Paragraph
"organize and rule. In the last of the site plans (and partially in the second), the hill’s",Paragraph
"steep cliffs were left in their natural state, while the north-south axis of the observ-",Paragraph
"atory still contrasted with the symmetrical and rectangular geometry of a park,",Paragraph
corresponding to the street grid. The areas along the roads on both sides of the,Paragraph
"library would be turned into parkland, and Asplund later won the competition",Paragraph

lized. Leaving the cliffs as they are creates a unity that equates landscape and build-,Paragraph
ings in a mutual relationship and to this day contributes to the impression of,Paragraph
Stockholm as a green city.,Paragraph
"In the subsequent adjustment of the site plan, the building’s square volume,",Paragraph
"which on some schemes was U-shaped in plan, was slightly rotated in relation",Paragraph
to the orthogonal street grid and thus was geometrically emancipated from the,Paragraph
surrounding residential and commercial buildings. It was also moved forward,Paragraph
"toward Sveavagen, locating the center of the cylindrical volume, which rises over",Paragraph
"the rest of the building and can be seen from a greater distance, on the observa-",Paragraph
tory’s north-south axis. This volume is the same all the way around and thus is,Paragraph
"perceived as frontal no matter from where it is viewed, giving it the character of a",Paragraph
fulcrum in the urban structure.,Paragraph
With historical counterparts in the Rotonde de la Villette by Claude-Nicolas,Paragraph
"Ledoux, the Villa Rotonda by Andrea Palladio, the Castel Sant’Angelo in Rome,",Caption
"and the Lanterna del Faro in Messina, among others, the basic geometric shapes",Paragraph
"of the library lend a forceful impression that, despite their modest size, is capable",Paragraph
of holding its own against the weight of the hill and the mass of the neighboring,Paragraph
"building blocks. In its urban context, the advanced position and the rotation, as",Paragraph
"Johan Martelius has argued, can be seen as an attempt to establish an extended axis,",Paragraph
"through Adolf Fredrik’s church and Strémgatan’s square, to the Royal Palace.* The",Paragraph
library’s square and cylindrical volumes sit behind a platform on which shops with,Paragraph
large glass sections to the street contribute to an inviting and well-defined,Paragraph
streetscape.,Paragraph
The ability to design a building based on a multifaceted and complex under-,Paragraph
standing of the city is manifested in many other projects as well. As Colin St. John,Paragraph
"Wilson explains, “the spirit that informed Asplund’s approach was grounded in a",Paragraph
rigorous and sensitive interpretation of context. The way in which the strands ofa,Paragraph
formidable orchestrated order are woven from the grain of the surrounding fabric,Paragraph
"is truly remarkable.”* For Asplund, the act of designing was an extended and",Paragraph
exploratory process in which the different scales and levels of meaning of the con-,Paragraph
"text were analyzed and gradually worked in, so that the projects were integrated",Paragraph
"into, while simultaneously changing, the context.",Paragraph
"In Collage City, Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter compare Asplund’s competition",Paragraph
"entry for the Royal Chancellery to Le Corbusier’s Plan Voisin. In their view, the",Paragraph
Chancellery expresses a profound understanding of the city’s historical continu-,Paragraph
ity and a remarkable sense of its specific details. This is manifested in many of,Paragraph
"Asplund’s works, which Rowe and Koetter consider as having “the most elabo-",Paragraph
rate use of multiple design strategies.”® These strategies are put into play not,Paragraph
"only in the design of the city, which is their primary interest, but also in how",Paragraph
Asplund’s projects relate to a great number of other architectural and societal,Paragraph
conditions.,Paragraph
The Library’s Gestalt,Title
Stockholm Public Library came into being out of a desire to create a democratic,Paragraph
"place where anyone could come, regardless of background. It was intended not just",Paragraph
"to inspire and invite those who were already well versed in literature, but also, in",Paragraph
"the words of chief librarian Fredrik Hjelmqvist, to “awaken an interest in those",Paragraph
"who are still slumbering, and it will ease the way into the world of books for",Paragraph
all of those for whom that road presents difficulties.”” Among its most important,Paragraph
"innovations, Hjelmqvist emphasized the library’s open shelves and card catalogue,",Paragraph
"its openness to users, its separate children’s and youth departments, and the clear",Paragraph
The axial progression of spaces is familiar from many other building cultures.,Paragraph
"Working from Oswald Spengler’s Untergang des Abendlandes, Asplund discussed this",Paragraph
in his professorial inaugural lecture at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in,Paragraph
"1931: “In Egyptian culture space was seen as a direction, a path, best illustrated,",Paragraph
"according to Spengler, by the temples with their unending narrowing, majestic",Paragraph
"routes between rows of sphinxes, through pillared champers, courtyards and pas-",Paragraph
sages towards the goal.”’* The desire to allude to Egyptian architecture is not lim-,Paragraph
"ited to this. It is also, more literally, expressed in the exterior frieze and in the",Paragraph
entrance portals of the three almost identical facades.,Paragraph
The progression of spaces at the Public Library is characterized not only by an,Paragraph
"axial composition, but also by contrasts between the size and proportions of the",Paragraph
"rooms, the colors and textures of materials, and the direction and intensity of",Paragraph
"the lighting. Contrasts of big and small, hard and soft, and light and dark create",Paragraph
"a forceful transition from the spectacle of the street to the calmness of the interior,",Paragraph
presenting a wealth of varied and content-rich experiences. The artistic ornamen-,Paragraph
"tation is an integrated part of the spatial progression, from the exterior frieze with",Paragraph
"its subjects from different cultures, to the door handles with Old Testament figures,",Paragraph
"and the interior reliefs, with stories from Homer's Hiad. The aforementioned proj-",Paragraph
ect entry similarly proposed to feature the Greek inscription FNWOI LAYTON,Paragraph
(Know thyself) on the floor of the lobby. Asplund had observed the statement,Paragraph
"in a building in Rome on his grand tour of France and Italy in 1913-14.""*",Paragraph
"In his analysis of Asplund’s architecture, Robert Venturi zeroes in on the",Paragraph
ornamentation: “Much of the early work of Gunnar Asplund and some other early,Paragraph
twentieth-century architects espoused a non-literal historicism that was expressed,Paragraph
through representational ornament.”’” It is a telling statement of how Asplund’s,Paragraph
"work was viewed by many in the 1970s and 1980s, who considered it a precursor",Paragraph
to the stylistic escapades of postmodernism. The myriad narratives of the ornamen-,Paragraph
tation have fostered many and highly varied interpretations of their meaning. Aside,Paragraph
"from this, they tell parts of the stories that can be borrowed as books in the library,",Paragraph
potentially arousing curiosity and a desire to learn.,Paragraph
The exterior of the library is as simple and moderate as its interior is rich in,Paragraph
"texture and detail. The large, serene, plastered volumes with their simple window",Paragraph
"openings tone down the middle scale, and the building assumes the character of an",Paragraph
"abstract, almost alienated object. The Danish architect Steen Eiler Rasmussen",Caption
described how the simple look induces a figure-ground reading emphasizing the,Paragraph
building’s lines over its forms.'® The abstract and alienated are counterbalanced,Paragraph
not only by the building’s integrated placement on the site but also by the colored,Paragraph
"plastering of the facade, which is common in Stockholm and thus, in a very uncom-",Paragraph
"plicated way, ties in to the surroundings, including the observatory.",Paragraph
The ornamentation on Asplund’s buildings was in part influenced by a way of,Paragraph
"thinking that came from the Romantic period, when artistic motifs from different",Paragraph
epochs were rather freely used and combined. Though it can justifiably be,Paragraph
"regarded as a potpourri of styles, it also serves spatial and organizing purposes",Paragraph
in the Public Library. The ornamentation helps to differentiate the importance of,Paragraph
the spaces and underscore the lines of the building. Asplund had earlier proclaimed,Paragraph
"that “now, more than anything, it seems to be about employing the currently mod-",Paragraph
"ern type of architecture, regardless of environment and tradition, and above all not",Paragraph
falling behind in the ‘architectural race.’ People forget that it is more important to,Paragraph
"follow the style of the site rather than of the times.”'” In other words, he was arguing",Paragraph
in favor of anchoring architecture in its context. He also distanced himself from the,Paragraph
tendency to hopelessly pursue the whims of fashion and blindly follow the styles of,Paragraph
"the changing times, not least historicism.",Paragraph
Asplund was very aware of the relationship between the different scales of a,Paragraph
building and their contextual cohesion. In his review of the Gothenburg Tercen-,Paragraph
"tennial Jubilee Exposition, he formulated this in an architectural ideal: “Today’s",Paragraph
"architectural desire, at its best, inclines toward a subordination of detail, a coordi-",Paragraph
nation of all heterogeneous needs and requirements and dimensions under a strong,Paragraph
"architectural idea. Around a central concept. It strives for order and character.”""*",Paragraph
The notion of having a simple and strong architectural idea for a building was not,Paragraph
only essential in Asplund’s work; it was also an indispensable principle for many,Paragraph
other Nordic architects of the twentieth century.,Paragraph
The above two quotations about the style of the site and architectural desire,Paragraph
indicate the artistic tensions and paradoxes that marked Asplund and his times. Like,Paragraph
"the rest of Europe, the Nordic countries had contrasting cultural currents and sig-",Paragraph
nificant social challenges. The downgrading of styles and the subordination of,Paragraph
"detail likewise signaled the impending breakthrough of modernism, which would",Paragraph
catch up with the library before it had even been completed. Eva Eriksson has aptly,Paragraph
described how “Nordic 1920s-Classicism can be seen as an heroic attempt to,Paragraph
"employ the knowledge and experience of history, without directly borrowing its",Paragraph
"finished dress, to design the modern city.”??",Paragraph

"bition of works by C.F. Hansen, and she considers Carl Petersen’s Faborg Museum",Paragraph
from 1915 to be the breakthrough work of the period.”” Henrik O. Andersson and,Paragraph
Kenneth Frampton argue in a catalogue for a retrospective exhibition in 1982 that the,Paragraph
currents in architecture and other arts in the rest of Europe and the United States,Paragraph
helped to lay a foundation for the significant blossoming of classicism in Nordic archi-,Paragraph
"tecture.”"" Moreover, there was considerable exchange in the field of architecture",Paragraph
"among the Nordic countries in the period, not least due to their closely related lan-",Paragraph
"guages, geographical proximity, and shared cultural heritage. For example, Danish",Paragraph
architect Kay Fisker wrote about new Swedish architecture in the Danish journal,Paragraph
"Arkitekten, after working for Asplund and Lewerentz for a time.” Conversely,",Paragraph
Asplund reviewed a Danish book about the old manor house of Liselund that,Paragraph
had served as an important source of inspiration for his Woodland chapel. The book,Paragraph
"included measured drawings by Kay Fisker, Aage Refn, and others, and was",Paragraph
reviewed in the Swedish journal Arkitektur.”* These are just some of the countless,Paragraph
examples of the exchanges between architects in the Nordic countries.,Paragraph
"In the exhibition catalogue, Frampton further describes how this period of Nor-",Paragraph
dic architecture was characterized by a Doric sensibility that “intended a return to,Paragraph
"an accessible culture of building; to an expression which, despite its modesty,",Paragraph
aspired to a certain restrained monumentality and generally employed a sparse,Paragraph
"but nonetheless direct iconography.” In this sensibility, Frampton says, classical",Paragraph
and vernacular architecture could be combined into new architectural expressions.,Paragraph
"Relating the architecture to a sensibility, rather than a stylistic preference, allows",Paragraph

"priori view of how architecture should look.” In his review, he focused on the",Paragraph
building’s style more than its functions — despite an aim for “a radical functional,Paragraph

Decades ago interpreters of modern architecture observed a “turn toward the,Paragraph

"To introduce the productive role of the project’s place, program, and construc-",Paragraph
tion let me outline some of the ways this period’s key buildings benefited from,Paragraph
their encounter with conditions outside their designers’ control.,Paragraph
The coordination between a project and its location took a number of forms in,Paragraph
the built work of these years. The most obvious sort of connection was visual: the,Paragraph
"site presented itself through a series of views, around the building and from within",Paragraph
"it. The heated debates about the “pros and cons” of the horizontal window, for",Paragraph
"example, took for granted the importance of the landscape or urban prospect.”",Paragraph
"Le Corbusier argued for the first sort of view, Auguste Perret the second. Similarly,",Paragraph
"a chief function of a ribbon, sash, or “French” window was to frame a view. Perhaps",Paragraph
the most famous instance of the aperture’s framing function is the “window” that,Paragraph
"concludes the Villa Savoye’s promenade architecturale. Window walls, by contrast,",Paragraph
opened entire panoramas. No less common than discussions of framing were the,Paragraph
many accounts of “merging” or “connecting” interiors to their surroundings for the,Paragraph
sake of views. In all of these examples the wider context was understood as a pic-,Paragraph
ture. But that was not the only sense of the site at this time.,Paragraph
"The project’s location was also understood dynamically, which is to say as a play",Paragraph
"of environmental forces; particularly, light, wind, and temperature. Design and",Paragraph
"construction now entered into this play, into its sequences, transformations, and",Paragraph
"variations. Patterns could be discerned — days and seasons, for example — but",Paragraph
"the key principle was alteration, the outcome of which was development or dete-",Paragraph
rioration. Let me explain this more fully by citing a few examples that are studied in,Paragraph
the chapters that follow.,Paragraph
Buckminster Fuller is known to have viewed the natural and built worlds very,Paragraph
"widely — unusually so, one could say. Distances and dimensions were taken to be",Paragraph
"significant, but also the movements and energies at play in the great expanse. Fuller",Paragraph
characterized the ambient landscape as a “field of forces” or animated context that,Paragraph
not only posed the problem but also determined the success of any built work. He,Paragraph
"focused on the selection and sizing of construction materials, particularly new and",Paragraph
"lightweight materials, as AnnMarie Brennan shows. Even the term he used for his",Paragraph
"best known inventions, dymaxion, points in this direction: it couples maximum",Paragraph
yield with the dynamism of elements. The energies of the work were to harmonize,Paragraph
with those of the world.,Paragraph
Something less than a planetary horizon could also allow the building site to be,Paragraph
understood as an interaction of natural forces. Approaching the topic more locally —,Paragraph
and with both industrial and vernacular construction materials — Frank Lloyd,Paragraph
in his study of Fallingwater. There is no question that the views from the house,Paragraph
"were breathtaking, as was the prospect of it from the lower level of the falls.",Paragraph
But the process-character of the place was equally important. Levine shows that,Paragraph
Wright’s concern for the site’s temporality led him to synchronize the times of,Paragraph
"occupation with those of the daily cycles, adjusting the geometry of the plan to",Paragraph
"the path of the sun, lines on the ground with those in the sky. Wright had, of course,",Paragraph
been working with diagonal composition for years; it was one of the outcomes of,Paragraph
“breaking the box” (of enclosed orthogonality). But in this and other projects of the,Paragraph
"time, ideas for spatial layout developed in dialogue with conditions he had not",Paragraph
designed but was compelled to work with — natural conditions. Later he described,Paragraph
the principle that regulated this cooperative effort as the “organic ground motive.”,Paragraph
Once the project’s location was understood as both a set of views and play of,Paragraph
"forces a number of basic tasks presented themselves, the first of which was orien-",Paragraph
tation. Randall Ott explains that the buildings sited near the Goetheneum were,Paragraph
"carefully positioned with respect to one another, each in its own spot, but also fac-",Paragraph
ing the “gravitational center” of the constellation. Because the main building occu-,Paragraph
"pied the hilltop, the ensemble’s overall layout was thus co-determined by pre-",Paragraph
"existing topography, institutional requirements being the other determining factor.",Paragraph
The role of topography in the configuration and detailed articulation of a single,Paragraph
"building can be seen clearly in Eileen Gray’s layout of E.1027, as described by",Paragraph
Caroline Constant. She explains that while Gray conceived the house from inside,Paragraph
"to outside, opportunities of the location were used as counterparts to interior spe-",Paragraph
"cifications and qualification — the seaside site partly determined qualities of light,",Paragraph
"temperature, and air in the house’s several settings, as well as their degrees of inti-",Paragraph
"macy or openness. The living room, for example, enjoyed southern exposure; the",Paragraph
"bedrooms, on the other hand, were greeted by the morning sun. Views of the",Paragraph
"ocean were also important, of course. But while the apertures were designed to",Paragraph
"respond to opportunities of prospect, they also had to protect the interiors against",Paragraph
"glare and winds, allowing some and resisting others.",Paragraph
"In his account of Villa Savoye, Richard Wesley explains that the building’s dif-",Paragraph
"ferent framing instruments variously targeted the wide panorama and axes of view,",Paragraph
even if the terminal point (a historic monument) framed by the famous solarium,Paragraph
"window could rarely, if ever, be seen. But the screen wall performed environmen-",Paragraph
"tally, too; it sheltered plants and people against the wind, while it partially enclosed",Paragraph
open-air rooms. A viewing frame also opened the wall that enclosed the roof deck,Paragraph
of Adolf Loos’ Miiller Villa. Christopher Long explains that it framed a prospect of,Paragraph
Hradéany that included Prague Castle. The enclosing wall opposite this one sup-,Paragraph
"ported an open-air shower, presumably for use after sunbathing. The attractions of",Paragraph
"a closer vista, however, help explain why Loos reversed the typical orientation of",Paragraph

its windows and balcony could open onto the descending terraces of the villa’s gar-,Paragraph

"scape garden beyond. In fact, each of the four facades was distinct, precisely",Paragraph

"relative privacy, and so on. Nothing could be further from the truth than the",Paragraph
old idea that this building was disengaged from its location. Care for ambient,Paragraph
views was coupled with attention to patterns of use and environmental change.,Paragraph
"In the buildings of Le Corbusier, Gray, Loos, and Wright, “rituals of living” were",Paragraph
coordinated with the cycles of daily and seasonal change in the natural,Paragraph
environment.,Paragraph
Engagement such as this did not restrict invention. Reversals of typical patterns,Paragraph
of site development discovered unforeseen possibilities in the project’s location.,Paragraph
A case in point is Richard Neutra’s siting of the VDL house. Edward Ford explains,Paragraph
"that Neutra broke from the habit of placing the house in the middle of its lot, where",Paragraph
"front, side, and rear yards had similar dimensions and character. By pushing the",Paragraph
plan close to two of the boundaries he was able to develop an elaborate layout,Paragraph
of courts and gardens that extended interiors into complimentary outdoor settings.,Paragraph
"Insofar as the “flow of space” from inside to outside was virtually uninterrupted,",Paragraph
"the interiors were largely qualified by site conditions (of light, air, plantings, and so",Paragraph
on). The same sort of thing happened in urban settings in the work of other archi-,Paragraph
tects. Grace Ong explains that the street front of the PSFS building enclosed public,Paragraph
"spaces at several levels -subway, sidewalk, and mezzanine — all public and all inter-",Paragraph
connected. Although there was no precedent for stratification such as this in,Paragraph
"Philadelphia, the discovery of these new possibilities made the proposal attractive",Paragraph
"to clients, who saw its commercial advantages. But with respect to the history of",Paragraph
"urban architecture, this manner of engaging and developing the vicinity also",Paragraph
allowed the solution to serve as a model for later projects in this and other,Paragraph
American cities. And the innovations at the lower levels were complemented by,Paragraph
"new solutions above, for the large sign was designed by Howe and Lescaze to",Paragraph
be seen from blocks away (along a cross-city avenue on one side and from a bridge,Paragraph
"on the other). Here, as before, the actual site provided architects with “un-",Paragraph
designed” conditions that served as the grounds for project development. Projects,Paragraph
"in these years, one can say, developed eccentrically; a work’s source of order was",Paragraph
"outside its proper limits, the margins shaped and qualified the center.",Paragraph
The more we learn about the actual construction of the buildings of the “heroic”,Paragraph
period of modern architecture the more we see that later historians have been,Paragraph
more dogmatic about materials and methods of construction than the architects,Paragraph
themselves. No doubt the architects initiated the familiar — if now discredited —,Paragraph
"story about “modern” materials (steel, concrete, and glass) and “modern” means",Paragraph
"of construction (standardization, prefabrication, and dry assembly) determining",Paragraph
"the “evolution” of modernism. Yet, the apologists went much further than the",Paragraph
"designers, in some cases to the point of obscuring the subject matter of their",Paragraph
descriptions — the buildings themselves. Richard Wesley explains how Sigfried,Paragraph
"Giedion, for example, rewrote and reduced Le Corbusier’s Five (or Six) Points",Paragraph
for a New Architecture so that they would express more forcefully his,Paragraph
notion of building technology as the engine that powered the modern movement.,Paragraph
"Le Corbusier was far less dogmatic. The “points,” such as they were, only",Paragraph
and its outer surface was stucco. No less hybrid was the most representative work of,Paragraph
"his former teacher, Adolf Loos’ Villa Miiller in Prague. Loos did not share Neutra’s",Paragraph
"dedication to the newest products, but he was equally willing to integrate ways of",Paragraph
building we tend to see as categorically distinct. The structure of the Miller Villa,Paragraph
combined perimeter brickwork with cast-in-place concrete columns toward the cen-,Paragraph
"ter, a so-called “half-box” system with outside load-bearing walls and two longitu-",Paragraph
dinal frames inside the plan (the Hennebique system). A spatial idea — the,Paragraph
"Raumplan, which allowed varying floor and ceiling heights — required the insertion",Paragraph
of the different means of support where level changes were desired. Loos feltnoneed,Paragraph
to “reveal” or “express” the structure; more important was the accommodation and,Paragraph
representation of the building’s use program. A mixture of building materials and,Paragraph
"techniques was the result, nevertheless. A simple, pure, or self-evidently modern",Paragraph
way of building was far less important than careful attunement to ways of living —,Paragraph
"patterns that were, of course, of their time.",Paragraph
The buildings studied in the chapters that follow were designed to accommodate,Paragraph
and express ways of living that were partly modern and partly traditional. Possibi-,Paragraph
"lities were projected, of course, patterns of life that might be present and may have",Paragraph
occurred in the past; but ways of living nonetheless. One cannot overlook the,Paragraph
"impracticality of many of these buildings, even those that are most well known.",Paragraph
"If the Villa Savoye is to be seen as a machine for living, the term should be under-",Paragraph
stood theatrically not mechanistically. Richard Wesley describes it as a “contriv-,Paragraph
ance for producing the effect of dwelling.” But the tension between expression,Paragraph
and accommodation is one of degree. Caroline Constant describes Eileen Gray’s,Paragraph
focus on quotidian comfort and sensuality. This concentration resulted from her,Paragraph
desire to overcome the dehumanizing qualities of architecture based on abstrac-,Paragraph
tion. The alternative represented by E.1027 was care for human needs and the exi-,Paragraph
"gencies of life, a concern for intimacy that did not prevent enjoyment of the natural",Paragraph
"world. For Loos, the concern with inhabitation led to specific structural solutions",Paragraph
that allowed for great differentiation of settings. The floors of the Miiller Villa can,Paragraph
"best be seen, Christopher Long argues, as stacked, rotating platforms; props to be",Paragraph
"elaborated and qualified by materials, dimensions, and furnishings that would suit",Paragraph
intended purposes. His idea of each setting having its own character or mood is,Paragraph
"close to the argument put forth by Alvar and Aino Aalto at Villa Mairea, for there",Paragraph
the modern way of building was not an exercise in standardized construction per se,Paragraph
"but in the formation of “character, identity, and milieu.” Scott Poole shows that the",Paragraph
"Villa was, indeed, innovative; not in the sense of earlier experiments with form and",Paragraph
geometry but rather in its ever more precise attunements to the habits of the,Paragraph
"human body, resting and moving within the building’s several settings.",Paragraph
Richard Neutra took a different approach to the task of accommodating prac-,Paragraph
tical purposes. Edward Ford shows that the plans and sections of the VDL House,Paragraph
did not specify the functions of rooms. Neutra thought of purposes and settings,Paragraph
rather more “elastically.” But corresponding to this sense of spatial generality was,Paragraph
a highly analytical — Neutra once criticized himself for being overly fond of,Paragraph
"“systematic consistency”* — sense of bodily movements, postures, perceptions,",Paragraph
and emotions. One can certainly identify typical forms and geometries in his,Paragraph
"work, but he maintained that his chief goal was responsiveness to sensory motor",Paragraph
conditions. A similarly generalized sense of rooms can be seen in Le Corbusier’s,Paragraph
"work, particularly Villa Savoye. Richard Wesley alludes to this in his comments",Paragraph
"on that building’s “free plan,” which could be described as a configuration that",Paragraph
was free-from fully defined enclosures so that it would be free-for rather more,Paragraph
"idealized patterns, those of an artistic type of person, for whom creativity and",Paragraph
"modernity would be realized though mediated, conditioned, and engaged ways",Paragraph
of making and living.,Paragraph
"The fact that these buildings acknowledged the continuity of ways of living, the",Paragraph
"hybridity of building practices, and the dependence of interior on site conditions",Paragraph
suggests that another sense of the architectural project had force in these years:,Paragraph

“THE ART OF A MASTER”,Title
It was a late spring or early summer day in 1926 when the architect Erich,Paragraph
"Mendelsohn, almost certainly with the music of Johann Sebastian Bach playing",Paragraph
"in the background, made this series of sketches for the facade of a department store",Paragraph
"in the southern German city of Stuttgart."" Mendelsohn, who shared a birthday with",Paragraph
"Bach and was married to a talented cellist, made at least one sketch for the store on",Paragraph
the back of a program for a concert of Bach’s music in which his wife performed.”,Paragraph
"He often sketched while listening to music on the gramophone, and preferred the",Paragraph
Renaissance and baroque technique of counterpoint to Romantic harmony.’ Show-,Paragraph
"ing the building from four different points of view, and also including locations for",Paragraph
"two flights of stairs within one corner tower, the sheet illustrates the degree to",Paragraph
which the architect conceived of it in the round. He drew three of the perspectives,Paragraph
"in black charcoal; the fourth and largest one, however, is executed largely in red,",Paragraph
with black used only to underline the bands of the stair tower. This corresponded,Paragraph
"more closely with the color of the brick, out of which the steel-framed building,",Paragraph
"which was completed in 1928, was eventually faced.",Paragraph
"Quickly and skillfully drawn, the sheet stands at the center of interconnected",Paragraph
"stories about the Neues Bauen (New Building), as the commercial and residential",Paragraph
architecture erected in a bold and inexpensive new style was termed in Germany,Paragraph
"during the 1920s and early 1930s; about Erich Mendelsohn, who was one of its most",Paragraph
famous and fashionable practitioners; and about the impact that industrialization,Paragraph
has had on consumerism and thus in turn upon architectural and urban space.‘,Paragraph
"Because both Mendelsohn and his client, Salman Schocken, were politically pro-",Paragraph
"gressive Zionists who would emigrate to Jerusalem and the United States, this",Paragraph
is also a story about the role that German Jews played in the creation of both,Paragraph
modernity and modernism.’,Paragraph
The physical evidence offered here also complicates received wisdom about the,Paragraph
modern movement in architecture in crucial ways. It demonstrates the importance,Paragraph
of individual creativity within an approach toward architecture that has often been,Paragraph
"understood to be objective and functional. Furthermore, although the urban con-",Paragraph
"text is implied rather than shown, it proves how seriously Mendelsohn took a very",Paragraph
specific site in a very specific city. This is a welcome reminder of how attuned to the,Paragraph
existing urban fabric Neues Bauen almost always was.,Paragraph
The Drawing,Title
"In this drawing the balance of pragmatism and imagination, which Mendelsohn",Paragraph
"would have phrased in terms of functionalism and dynamism, that characterized",Paragraph
Neues Bauen during the brief German economic boom of 1924 to 1929 as well as its,Paragraph
"immediate aftermath, are both clearly on display. The tension between the",Paragraph
"volumes is indicative of this larger tension, as well as of the contrapuntal compo-",Paragraph
sition techniques Mendelsohn admired in both baroque music and contemporary,Paragraph
art and architecture.,Paragraph
What exactly are we looking at? The top sketch shows the Eberhardt- and,Paragraph
"Steinstrafe facades of the building. Lined by streetcar tracks, the Eberhardtstrape",Caption
front was the most important. Furthermore the curves of the street and the,Paragraph
intersections that framed the full block site ensured that the two most prominent,Paragraph
"corners, each of which could be glimpsed at a considerable distance, were located at",Paragraph
either end of this facade. In this sketch Mendelsohn contrasts the curved stair tower,Caption
"anchoring the far facade with the sharp corner with Steinstrafle and the second,",Paragraph
"taller, and more enclosed rectangular tower that punctuated the transition from",Paragraph
"the high front and lower rear stories of the block. In the next, much smaller sketch,",Paragraph
Mendelsohn envisions the building from the corner of Stein- and Breitestrafe. Par-,Paragraph
adoxically Breite or “Broad” street was in fact the much narrower rear facade of the,Paragraph
building. Only at its far end does the height of the building begin once again to step,Paragraph
"up. By the third, also relatively small sketch, Mendelsohn’s design strategy is appar-",Paragraph
"ent. He is wrapping a single facade treatment around each corner, in this case of",Paragraph
"Breite- and Hirschstrafe. This one, however, is the least developed of the four; it",Paragraph
remains the single aspect of the building least documented in the surviving photo-,Paragraph
"graphs. In the fourth drawing he returns to the key Eberhardtstrafe facade, now",Paragraph
"viewed from the crucial corner with Hirschstrafe. Befitting its key role in the design,",Paragraph
this is the largest sketch; the red color of most of the drawing adds additional visual,Paragraph
prominence.,Paragraph
The following year Mendelsohn wrote of the importance of such sketches to his,Paragraph
design process:,Title
"I see the site, the surface area, the space above it. Generally, the architectural idea",Paragraph
already appears spontaneously at this moment. | fix it in the form of a sketch. This,Paragraph
"means that the knowledge, the exact information about the actual requirements",Paragraph
"enters one’s subconscious; the surface area comes to life as a ground plan, the empty",Paragraph
"space as a spatial shape, a two- and three-dimensional experience at the same time.",Paragraph
"keep this first sketch. For, as an experience, as a vision, it has concentrated reality,",Paragraph
"plan, and structure into one architectonic organism. An inspiration, an action of",Paragraph
creation.®,Paragraph
Although the subject of the drawing is immediately identifiable to anyone famil-,Paragraph
"iar with photographs of the realized building, the two smaller sketches of the plan",Paragraph
of the curvilinear stair tower remind us that Mendelsohn had not yet in fact fina-,Paragraph
lized all the details of his design. In the end he nestled the flights of stairs within the,Paragraph
"curve of the tower, rather than back from it as shown here. In fact, this is not the",Paragraph
only way in which these sketches differ from the final result. The sense of certainty,Paragraph
conveyed through the rapid movement of the charcoal over the paper is in this,Paragraph
sense an illusion. Published plans reveal that the corner on Breite- and Hirschstrape,Paragraph
never projected forward in the way shown here; the half-dozen bands of windows,Paragraph
"in the cylindrical stair tower grew to 16 in the final scheme, where, except on the",Paragraph
"ground level, they no longer corresponded in any way to the number of stories",Paragraph
behind them. Nor are the sketches detailed enough to show the considerable atten-,Paragraph
"tion Mendelsohn eventually paid the glazing of each corner treatment, the alternat-",Paragraph
"ing stripes of brick and local stone that tied the two stair towers together, or the",Paragraph
way in which he punctuated the Eberhardtstrafe facade with bold letters spelling out,Paragraph
the Schocken name. These were illuminated from within in the dematerialized,Paragraph
night view that was as central to the building’s impact as its more sedate daytime,Paragraph
"appearance. Finally, the sketches give no sense of the way in which Mendelsohn",Paragraph
"sensitively addressed the slope of the site, which fell a full story along the length",Paragraph
"of the Hirschstrafe facade. As was characteristic for him, Mendelsohn resolved",Paragraph
"many of these details through the less glamorous means of a model, although even",Paragraph
after this was built he and his client battled over whether to add a single recessed,Paragraph
"story, as Mendelsohn favored, or further bulk, as Schocken desired.",Paragraph
The Building,Title
The pair of speeches that architect and client gave in October 1926 at the opening,Paragraph
of an earlier Schocken store in Nuremberg demonstrated the degree to which each,Paragraph
nonetheless understood the goals of the other. Schocken declared in words that,Paragraph
"were undoubtedly inspired by his appreciation of Mendelsohn’s sketches, “The",Paragraph
"art of a matter shows itself in the ability for selection and reduction, in the ability",Paragraph
"to refrain from the inessential, to restrict material, to recognize the supporting col-",Paragraph
"umns, to shape what is needed with a few strong lines.”” Mendelsohn in turn",Paragraph
defined the spirit of the age in terms of “Bare knees and a sporty ‘do/Radio,Paragraph
"and film/Automobile and aeroplane, specialty shops and department stores.” It",Paragraph
"demanded, he concluded, buildings designed in the same spirit. “You do demand",Paragraph
"sincerity? From your friends, from everyone? But you want to be tricked by the",Paragraph
"things around you, by your house, your builders? Are those somehow things that",Paragraph
"do not belong to you — your electric stove and razor? So efficient, so simple, so",Paragraph
"obvious ... Only one who has no rhythm in the body — do not think of jazz,",Paragraph
"be serious — does not understand the metallic swing of the machine, the humming",Paragraph
"of propellers, the enormous new vitality that stimulates, blesses, and makes us",Paragraph
creative.”*,Paragraph
Mendelsohn achieved this rhythm in Stuttgart through the skillful way in which,Paragraph
he exploited the dynamic potential of the functional steel frame. In addition to,Paragraph
"allowing the complete glazing of the corner stair tower, this also permitted him",Paragraph
to cantilever the shop windows along Eberhardtstrafe forward of the supporting col-,Paragraph
umns. This in turn created a band of shop windows interrupted only by an,Paragraph
"entrance, to connect the two stair towers at ground level. The effect was especially",Paragraph
"impressive at night, when the carefully conceived figure ground relationship of the",Paragraph
day view was reversed and the building appears to sit atop an illuminated void.,Paragraph
Little of this architectural excitement permeated the straightforward display of,Paragraph
"goods on the building’s interior, however. Most earlier department stores were",Paragraph
"arranged around atria, which announced the existence of multiple floors of goods",Paragraph
"and helped illuminate deep spaces. Mendelsohn eliminated this feature, tucking",Paragraph
only a small light court — insisted upon by the building authorities — into the rear,Paragraph
of the building. Instead he relied heavily upon electric light. He canted the column,Paragraph
"grid, which featured four rows parallel to Eberhardtstrage and a further three parallel",Paragraph
"to Breitestrafe. The existence of this grid, around which he wrapped many of the",Paragraph
"sales counters, was later given as an excuse to replace the building with a more up-",Paragraph
"to-date one featuring clear spans. At the time, however, the quasi-industrial char-",Paragraph
acter of the interiors contributed to the chain’s image of no-frills goods and prices.,Paragraph
"Nonetheless, the fittings for Stuttgart were the most detailed Mendelsohn designed",Paragraph
for Schocken. They included a prow-like mezzanine from which managers could,Paragraph
"observe the sales force, an element that he accentuated by ringing the ceiling above",Paragraph
it with exposed light bulbs.,Paragraph
The Architect,Title
The Stuttgart design emerged from a process that was characteristic of Mendel-,Paragraph
sohn. More than any of his contemporaries allied with either Neues Bauen or the,Paragraph
"broader Modern Movement of which it was a part, despite having lost on eye",Paragraph
to cancer in 1921 Mendelsohn relied on the perspective sketch as the crucial stage,Paragraph
"in his design process. Beginning in 1914 the architect, who was born in Allenstein in",Paragraph
"1887 and had been educated in Berlin and Munich, began to draw visions of a new",Paragraph
"industrial architecture, whose boldly sculptured forms were inspired in part by his",Paragraph
admiration of the increasingly abstract paintings of Wassily Kandinsky and other,Paragraph
painters associated with the Blue Rider group.’ Although he did not contribute,Paragraph
"to the Arbeitsrat fir Kunst’s exhibition of unknown architects, held in Berlin in",Paragraph
"1919, and did not join the Crystal Chain, initiated the same year, Mendelsohn",Paragraph
shared with many expressionist contemporaries a predilection for curves that could,Paragraph
"be labeled organic.’ Mendelsohn’s drawings also fostered the sense of drama that,",Paragraph
"while based in part upon his interest in experimental theater, was extremely effec-",Paragraph
"tive commercially. No one realized this better than Schocken, who proved to be",Paragraph
"Mendelsohn’s most sage, if also his most consistently demanding client, and who",Paragraph
saw the sketches when they were first put on public display in Berlin in 1919. By,Paragraph
this time Mendelsohn had already received the commission for what became his,Paragraph
"breakthrough building, the Einstein Tower in Potsd am.""",Paragraph
Mendelsohn’s only attempt to build in the highly expressionist style of drawings,Paragraph
"that originally had no relationship to function and little to structure, the Einstein",Paragraph
"Tower was largely complete by the late summer of 1921, although the economic",Paragraph
crisis delayed the installation of its interior furnishings and scientific equipment.,Paragraph
"The building, whose eccentric shape was intended to be a monument to the con-",Paragraph
"troversial new theory of relativity, and to express the possible conversion of mass",Paragraph
"into energy postulated by it, also housed a highly pragmatic observatory and lab-",Paragraph
oratory for relativity-related research. Erected in part out of brick covered with,Caption
"stucco, rather than entirely out of reinforced concrete as its architect had originally",Paragraph
"intended, its eccentric forms were also inspired by art nouveau and Futurist",Paragraph

construction infused with industrial imagery and inspired as well by De Stijl and,Paragraph
constructivism. Where most adherents of Neues Bauen focused on the design of,Paragraph
"housing estates on the suburban fringes of Berlin and Frankfurt in particular,",Paragraph
Mendelsohn’s early fame generated a slew of commercial commissions. These,Paragraph
came almost exclusively from Jewish businessmen like Schocken and the publisher,Paragraph
"and real-estate developer Hans Lachmann-Mosse, the father of the renowned his-",Paragraph
torian George Mosse.’* Such men recognized the advertising merits of,Paragraph
Mendelsohn’s architectural flair and were also proud of his association with Ein-,Paragraph
"stein, the most celebrated member of their community.",Paragraph
They also appreciated the first-hand familiarity with the latest international,Paragraph
architecture that informed Mendelsohn’s designs. He found that the composition,Paragraph
"of baroque music, one of Germany’s most venerated cultural traditions, correlated",Paragraph
almost exactly with the art and architecture he had seen in the Netherlands in 1921,Paragraph
"and again in 1923, and in the Soviet Union in 1925 and twice in 1926. Here he made",Paragraph
"contact with architects, who excelled at juxtaposing abstract rectangular forms.",Paragraph
"These included J. J. P. Oud, already a proponent of De Stijl geometries, and the",Paragraph
"constructivists, E] Lissitzky, Konstantin Melnikov, and the Vesnin brothers.'? This",Paragraph
"was not the only fruit of these trips. Somewhat paradoxically, Mendelsohn’s cap-",Paragraph
"italist graphics were undoubtedly inspired in part by Soviet political propaganda,",Paragraph
especially as integrated by the Vesnin brothers into their 1924 project for the Len-,Paragraph
"ingrad headquarters of the Soviet newspaper, Pravda.",Paragraph
Even more crucial to the respect accorded to the architect by his commercial,Paragraph
clients was the trip he made to the United States in 1924 and the book he published,Paragraph
"about it two years later, Amerika: Bilderbuch eines Architekten (America: Picturebook",Paragraph
"of an Architect). Mendelsohn’s itinerary, which took him from Manhattan to four",Paragraph
"Mid-Western cities, adhered to that of the German businessmen who sailed across",Paragraph
"the Atlantic to observe first-hand the factories, department stores, and office",Paragraph
"buildings, which were bigger and bolder than their European counterparts.’* He",Paragraph
made a pilgrimage to Taliesin to meet Frank Lloyd Wright. Mendelsohn was,Paragraph
scarcely the only German cultural figure of the day to advance his standing at,Paragraph
"home this way; he sailed over with Fritz Lang, the director of Metropolis. Mendel-",Paragraph
"sohn was awed by the speed of American traffic, the brightness of the night light-",Paragraph
"ing, the height of the skyscrapers, and the bare volumes of the industrial",Paragraph
"vernacular. He was appalled, however, by the historicist veneers that fronted",Paragraph
"the towers he photographed, and dreamed of a more straightforward expression",Paragraph
of their most modern qualities.,Paragraph
"The commercial function and downtown location of the Schocken store, and",Paragraph
"Mendelsohn’s other department stores, office buildings, and single cinema set them",Paragraph
"slightly apart from the other most celebrated examples of Neues Bauen, even as they",Paragraph
established new prototypes for these building types that would be influential for,Paragraph
decades around the world. The Stuttgart store bears comparison with the Weissen-,Paragraph
hof Housing Estate erected in 1927 on a suburban hillside only a few miles away by,Paragraph
"an international who’s who of avant-garde architects led by Mies van der Rohe,",Paragraph
with whom Mendelsohn had had a falling out and whose invitation to participate,Paragraph
"he consequently refused.’* As befits its suburban setting, the Weissenhof buildings,",Paragraph
which were open to the public as an exhibition before the civil servants they were,Paragraph
"built to house moved in, are arrayed in a manner influenced by the garden city",Paragraph
"movement, with considerably more space between them than was available to",Paragraph
Mendelsohn. Another significant difference was the choice of exterior materials.,Paragraph
"Although some of the contributions to the Weissenhof were also steel-framed, they",Paragraph
"were all clad in stucco, whereas Mendelsohn chose more durable brick and stone,",Paragraph
just as he eschewed the fashionable tubular metal furnishing on view throughout,Paragraph
the Weissenhof. Only Hans Scharoun’s contribution to the Weissenhof shared,Paragraph
Mendelsohn’s dynamism. The composition of the contributions to the housing,Paragraph
"exhibition were either more subtle or, in some cases, simply more banal.",Paragraph
The Client,Title
The balance of pragmatism and panache that made the Schocken store such a com-,Paragraph

"client. A decade older than his architect, Schocken and his brother Simon owned a",Paragraph
chain of department stores that during the second half of the 1920s expanded from,Paragraph
its original base in Saxony across southern Germany.’® Acutely aware of the role,Paragraph
"played by publicity, Schocken employed Mendelsohn for only the most visible of",Paragraph
"the new stores: an expansion of an existing building in Nuremberg, which opened",Paragraph
"in 1926; the building in Stuttgart; and another in Chemnitz, which was completed",Paragraph
in 1930. Smaller stores in cities like Cottbus featured novel architecture but were,Paragraph

"the place where middle-class consumers were introduced to new technology,",Paragraph
"whether that of elevators and escalators, or new goods, such as radios and gramo-",Paragraph
"phones, not to mention the latest fashions.’*",Paragraph
One of the most modern aspects of department stores was the degree to,Paragraph
"which they were run, staffed, and frequented by women. For a decade after",Paragraph
"the death in 1877 of her husband Aristide, Marguerite Boucicaut ran Bon Marché",Paragraph
in Paris.'? Although the leading administrative positions were more often,Paragraph
"reserved for men, many staff were women, not least because it was presumed",Paragraph
that their attentiveness to fashion would help win sales from female customers.”°,Paragraph
"Sales girls, like stenographers and telephone operators, numbered prominently",Paragraph
"among the New Women of the Weimar Republic, who challenged established",Paragraph
"social norms, most famously by bobbing their hair and shortening their skirts,",Paragraph
"but also by earning independent incomes, taking unprecedented control over",Paragraph
"their romantic lives, and constituting a large part of the audience for a novel",Paragraph
"new form of entertainment, the cinema.”? Many department stores catered to",Paragraph
"women by offering them respectable places to lunch and take tea, as well as",Paragraph
clean public toilets.,Paragraph
Department stores arrived relatively late in Germany; the big chains such as Kar-,Paragraph
"stadt, Tietze, and Wertheim began to flourish only at the end of the nineteenth",Paragraph
"century. With the exception of Karstadt, most German department stores were",Paragraph
founded by Jewish families. From the beginning they attracted opposition — much,Paragraph
"of it frankly anti-Semitic — for the way in which they undercut smaller, established",Paragraph
"businesses.” In part to demonstrate their respectability, in part because fashion was",Paragraph
"a crucial part of their business, by the 1890s German departments store owners",Paragraph
were paying careful attention to architecture. Bernhard Sehring’s Hermann Tietz,Paragraph

"Schocken’s business model was to keep prices low and quality high, and to focus",Paragraph
on supplying staples to the broadest possible array of consumers. He paid rigorous,Paragraph
"attention to the bottom line, turning to Mendelsohn and Neues Bauen because he",Paragraph
realized how much less expensive this industrially-oriented architecture would be,Paragraph
than its overtly palatial predecessors. No one would have more appreciated the,Paragraph
degree to which Mendelsohn based the Eberhardtstraffe facade on the reinforced,Paragraph

The Schocken chain was “Arianized” in 1938; only in 1949 was it returned to,Paragraph
"Schocken. Like his architect, he had lived in exile in Jerusalem, where Mendelsohn",Paragraph

of small stone structures that Badovici renovated in 1927-31 according to plans,Paragraph
"drawn up by Gray. To the rear of the house was a small garden court, set into",Paragraph
the steep hillside. As both its shallow depth and the height of its rear wall reinforced,Paragraph
"the dwelling’s limited volume, Badovici invited Fernand Léger to paint a mural on",Paragraph
the courtyard wall in 1934. Prose poet Jean Follain remarked on the result:,Paragraph

BUILDING PHILOSOPHY,Title
"The Villa Miller, completed in Prague in 1930, is among Adolf Loos’ signature",Paragraph
"works and one of the epochal buildings of the modern movement. With its tight,",Paragraph
"interlocking volumes positioned on multiple levels, the house remains perhaps the",Paragraph
"best illustration of Loos’ Raumplan, or space-plan, conception. It is a tour de force of",Paragraph
"modern space-making, an essay on how to foster complex volumes and how to",Paragraph
"connect them. It is the key building of Loos’ later years, a summation of all he",Paragraph
sought to achieve as an architect and a précis of his idiosyncratic ideas of form,Paragraph
and living. It has become one of the most oft-studied and discussed buildings of,Paragraph
"those years, an object lesson in three-dimensional design.",Paragraph

"ern Bohemia, where Loos had numerous clients. Miiller and another Pilsen native,",Paragraph
"Lumir Kapsa, were partners in a large construction company, Miiller & Kapsa,",Paragraph
which their fathers had founded in Pilsen before the turn of the century. The,Paragraph
"Miillers had moved to Prague only a short time before, and in September they",Paragraph
"purchased a large, hilly lot in the StfeSovice district (at Nad Hradnim vodojemem",Paragraph
642/14) above Prague Castle and the central city.”,Paragraph
"The genesis of the commission, however, remains unclear. Franti8ek Miiller evi-",Paragraph
"dently first approached Czech architect Karel Lhota, a professor of architecture at",Paragraph
"the building trades school in Pilsen, and Loos’ local partner there. Lhota, in turn,",Paragraph
asked Loos to participate in the project — an arrangement that Miiller seems to have,Paragraph
intended from the outset.” Both architects signed a contract with FrantiSek Miiller,Paragraph
"on October 30, 1928.",Paragraph
"Lhota, it seems, made the initial drawings for the house, probably with Loos’",Paragraph
"input, though it is possible that Miller intended for Loos to design only the inter-",Paragraph
"iors. But Loos soon became fully involved in the project, apparently modifying the",Paragraph
"structural system and spatial plan that Lhota had made, which, in turn, necessitated",Paragraph
numerous changes to the facade.’ The first extensive drawings date to November,Caption
"1928. Loos and Lhota worked swiftly, and by late December the basic set of plans",Paragraph
was complete and submitted to the Prague 6 municipal offices for a building per-,Paragraph
"mit.* The city authorities, however, rejected the design because both its footprint",Paragraph
and its height exceeded what was permitted for the area. Many of the neighbors,Paragraph
"also complained that the large, flat-roofed house was decidedly out of character",Paragraph
"for the area, which was made up of mostly smaller, conventional, pitched-roof",Paragraph
"structures. Miiller was forced to resubmit the project twice more, each time with",Paragraph
"slightly altered plans. The final design was not approved until late June, after the",Paragraph
Provincial President had issued an override of the authorities’ decision.,Paragraph

Tagblatt not long after the house’s completion that the authorities had rejected the,Paragraph
"house “on ten occasions” for “aesthetic reasons.”® In truth, records show that there",Paragraph
"were far fewer rejections, probably no more than five in all, and most of the objec-",Paragraph
tions had to do with the building’s siting and scale (although one of the position,Paragraph
"papers from the zoning office closed with the remark, “besides, the proposed facade",Paragraph
"is tasteless”).” Miiller, who was intimately familiar with the permitting process in",Paragraph
"Prague, used his knowledge and connections to push the project through, even",Paragraph
though it manifestly did not comply with local ordinances.,Paragraph
"The larger problems had to do with a lack of coordination between Loos, who",Paragraph
"was the building’s actual designer, Lhota, who was to prepare the final plans, and",Paragraph
"Pilsen contractor Bofivoj Kriegerbeck, who served as the site manager. Loos and",Paragraph
"Lhota split the 50,000 crown commission, but Lhota’s construction drawings, based",Paragraph
"on Loos’ verbal instructions and incomplete sketches, were so riddled with errors",Paragraph
"that, as Kriegerbeck later described, Loos was forced to step in and oversee the",Paragraph
"process, working closely with Kriegerbeck to ensure its completion.* Heinrich",Paragraph
"Kulka, one of Loos’ former pupils who served as Loos’ assistant in Vienna, was",Paragraph
"so employed, starting in December 1929, to aid in the completion of final details,",Paragraph
while the immediate supervision for the Miiller & Kapsa Company was left to yet,Paragraph
"another assistant, Rudolf Volesky.",Paragraph
"The work went far from smoothly. Loos, who was nearly deaf by that time and in",Paragraph
"health, was often absent during the weeks the final decisions were being made",Paragraph
about the house’s disposition and detailing. Loos also had an unusual working,Paragraph
"method, typically relying to a large extent on his associates. Lhota recalled afterward:",Paragraph
"“[Loos] maintains that he is not an architect but a building philosopher. Of course,",Paragraph
this attitude also stems from his aversion to drawing: he positively hates architectural,Paragraph
"draftsmanship. His projects consist of a sequence of logically fluent ideas, he practices",Paragraph
written — not drafted — architecture; if there is no one at hand capable of understand-,Paragraph
"ing Loos, no blueprints are produced. Yet ‘this someone’ is always found.”",Paragraph
In the case of the Villa Miiller it was Lhota and Kriegerbeck who mostly per-,Paragraph
formed the work of “translating” Loos’ ideas. But as Kriegerbeck remembered,Paragraph
ry,Title
"years afterward, Loos could be highly unreliable: “At first, Loos worked with gusto",Paragraph
"but pretty soon his verve waned, he could not persevere. No wonder: he was a",Paragraph
"delicate little wisp, his illness had progressed, he did not take good care of himself,",Paragraph
and he loved parties. Never before did he have so much work to do at one time.””°,Paragraph
"At one point, Loos, flush with money from the Miller commission, went off to",Paragraph
"Paris for a month without informing his co-workers and, characteristically, having",Paragraph
"spent all of his available funds there, wired Miiller asking for money to return.",Paragraph
Miiller refused but eventually sent money to Loos’ office in Vienna to pay the fare,Paragraph
of one of his assistants to go to Paris and bring Loos back with him. Many of the,Paragraph
final decisions and much of the detailing in this period thus were left to Kriegerbeck,Paragraph
"and Kulka.'' Miiller also intervened in the design process, altering some of the",Paragraph
"details, especially on the facades. Despite his considerable wealth, he vetoed some",Paragraph
of Loos’ suggestions for more expensive detailing and for the preparation of a more,Paragraph
detailed set of plans.’* Loos also refined the plans a number of times during the,Paragraph
"course of construction or, in a few instances, changed them entirely.",Paragraph
"Because Loos was only infrequently on site while construction was ongoing,",Paragraph
"some of the work was executed contrary to his instructions, and this created further",Paragraph
"problems. Claire Beck Loos, Loos’ wife at the time, later remembered one incident:",Paragraph
“Loos orders an overhang of half a centimeter on the house. He drives away. When,Paragraph
"he returns, the overhang measures an entire centimeter instead of only a half. Loos",Paragraph
is beside himself and has the extra half a centimeter taken off all the way around the,Paragraph
house.””?,Paragraph
The House and its Interiors,Title
"Despite the myriad issues, the house that emerged over the early months of 1930 is",Paragraph
one of the extraordinary modernist works of that era. The massive white cubic,Paragraph
"structure is set near the edge of the upper portion of the steeply sloping lot, imme-",Paragraph
"diately adjacent to Nad Hradnim vodojemem Street. The north facade, which is set",Caption
back some distance from StieSovicka Street (the principal thoroughfare in the area),Paragraph
"and featuring a large balcony and windows, has the appearance of the building’s",Paragraph
"main or front facade. But the entry is, in fact, on the other, or south, side, which",Paragraph
has much smaller windows and is largely unarticulated. The east and west facades,Caption
"are also differentiated, the west facade only with smaller and unaligned windows,",Paragraph
"the east sporting a large oriel. All of the facades, despite their differences, share the",Paragraph
same understated look. Loos explained to Kriegerbeck why he had placed so little,Paragraph
"emphasis on them: “I do not play with the facade, I do not live there. Take a chair,",Paragraph
sit in the rain in the middle of the street and look at the facade. If1 do a facade in the,Paragraph

"the first floor I leave it uncovered, I can’t see that far.”""*",Paragraph
The matter-of-factness of the building’s exterior cloaks the richness and com-,Paragraph
"plexity of its interior spaces. The south entry, which is set in a shallow recess below",Caption
"street level, leads past a travertine door surround and bench (a late addition to the",Paragraph
"design) and into a narrow, emerald-green corridor. Just beyond is a vestibule, orig-",Paragraph
"inally painted white, with a dark blue ceiling and yellow curtains. From there a",Paragraph
right-angled stair leads to the double-height living room. This space is unusually,Paragraph
"large, measuring 11 x 5.6 meters (36 x 18 feet), and 4.3 meters (14 feet) high.",Paragraph
On one side of the hall are massive windows and a door to the north balcony;,Paragraph
"on the other is a long, green-gray Cippolino marble wall, which conceals two stair-",Paragraph
"ways, one to the boudoir and library (or gentleman’s study), the other to the dining",Paragraph
"room and the upper floors. The dining room is situated just above the hall, in a",Paragraph
"lower, more intimate space, overlooking the hall. On the other side of the same",Paragraph
"intermediate floor, or entresol, are the split-level boudoir, the study, and, con-",Paragraph
"cealed from public view, the kitchen and pantry. Above, on the next floor, are",Caption
"the bedrooms, bathrooms, and a children’s playroom; and on the topmost floor",Caption
"are a storage space and a summer breakfast or tearoom, which gives out onto",Paragraph
another terrace.,Paragraph

"pletion, described the experience of walking into and through it:",Paragraph
"Through a weather-covered entrance, a wind porch, and a small vestibule, by climb-",Paragraph
"ing several winding stairs, we enter the hall, which surprises us by its beauty... The",Paragraph
"hall, the dining room, and the staircase produce an all-embracing spatial effect of",Paragraph
unparalleled harmony. The columns and the stepped bannisters of the staircase,Paragraph
ascending to the dining room are lined with sublime greenish marble (Cippolino,Caption
"de Salon, Valley of the Rhéne), displaying reddish blue and yellow veins. The dining",Paragraph
"room and study are made from mahogany, the lady’s boudoir is from lemon wood.""”",Paragraph
"This description, however, hardly does justice to the richness and complexity of",Paragraph
"the interiors. They are made up of a succession of highly varied spaces, with het-",Paragraph
erogeneous forms of cladding or surfaces. The house is effectively divided into,Paragraph
"three zones. One, a service zone, includes the garage and laundry on the lowermost",Paragraph
"floor, the kitchen and pantry on the main floor, a rear service stair, and a maid’s",Caption
room on the upper level. The second zone is made up of the principal living and,Paragraph
entertaining spaces on the lower floors. And the third includes the more private,Paragraph
realm: the bedrooms and children’s playroom on what is essentially the third floor,Paragraph
and the breakfast or tearoom on the fourth. The house is also subdivided into two,Paragraph
"spatial spheres: the upper portion, the top two levels, which preserve the conven-",Paragraph
"tional horizontal layering of floors, and the lower floors in which the Raumplan",Paragraph
idea is fully developed.,Paragraph
The functional and spatial partitioning is possible because of the house’s unusual,Paragraph
structural system. The exterior walls are conventional load-bearing block construc-,Paragraph
"tion, but the interior supports consist of four reinforced concrete columns that",Paragraph
"carry the horizontal beams. By moving the beams, which extend from the walls",Paragraph
"to the columns, up or down in relation to each other, Loos was able to vary",Paragraph
"the heights of the different rooms. The four columns, which form a rectangle in the",Paragraph
"building’s center, also support the upper stairway, which wraps around their edges,",Paragraph
"leaving an open well and, in conjunction with a rooftop skylight, permit light to",Paragraph
"enter into the interior. The effect, then, in the lower part of the house is a series",Paragraph
"of stacked and rotating platforms, which resolve in the upper stories into a sort of",Paragraph
perimeter plan with an open stair at the center.,Caption
Space and Meaning,Title
"It is this spatial play, the product of the Raumplan, to which the Villa Miiller owes",Paragraph
"its notoriety. But while Loos is now justly famous for his idea, he had curiously",Paragraph
little to say about it during his lifetime. He had begun to experiment with the,Paragraph
"Raumplan concept early on, first in his Goldman & Salatsch Building on Michae-",Paragraph
"lerplatz in Vienna (1909-11), and later, during and after World War I, in a series of",Paragraph
commissions for single-family houses. Throughout the last decade and a half of his,Paragraph
"career, he investigated and reinvestigated strategies of spatial manipulation, experi-",Paragraph
"menting with various means to foster pleasing, affective, and functional volumes.",Paragraph
"His few specific spoken or written references to the Raumplan came late, starting",Paragraph
"only in 1929, at the time he was already at work on the Villa Miiller. In a footnote to",Paragraph
"an essay penned after the death of his favorite cabinetmaker, Joseph Veillich, Loos",Paragraph
exclaimed that his new approach was the “greatest revolution in architecture”:,Paragraph
Before Immanuel Kant humanity could not yet think in space and architects were,Paragraph
compelled to make the toilet as high as the hall. Only by dividing everything in,Paragraph
two could they obtain lower rooms. As man will one day succeed in playing chess,Paragraph
"on a three-dimensional board, so, too, other architects will find spatial solutions for",Paragraph
the ground plan.’°,Paragraph
"Kulka, writing two years later, employed the term Raumplan for the first time in",Paragraph
"print (Loos never used it in any of his writings), arguing that Loos had “introduced",Paragraph
"a fundamentally new and higher spatial concept: thinking in space, the planning of",Paragraph
"rooms of differing heights, composing these with interlocking volumes to create a",Paragraph
"harmonious, inseparable unit that formed a single spatially economical whole.”’”",Paragraph
"Loos’ most complete statement, however, can be found in Lhota’s transcript of a",Paragraph
"conversation he had with Loos in Pilsen in 1930; “My architecture,” he quotes Loos",Paragraph
as saying:,Paragraph
"is not conceived in plans, but in spaces (cubes). I do not design floor plans, facades,",Paragraph
"sections. I design spaces. For me, there is no ground floor, first floor, etc...For me,",Paragraph
"there are only contiguous, continual spaces, rooms, anterooms, terraces, ete. Stories",Paragraph
merge and spaces relate to each other. Every space requires a different height: the,Paragraph
dining room is surely higher than the pantry — thus the ceilings are set at different,Paragraph
levels. To join these spaces in such a way that the rise and fall are not only unobserv-,Paragraph
"able but also practical, in this I see what is for others the great secret, although it is for",Paragraph
me a great matter of course...It is just this spatial interaction and spatial austerity that,Paragraph
thus far I have best been able to realize in Dr. Miiller’s house.”®,Paragraph
Loos’ allusion to austerity here highlights one of his rationales for introducing,Paragraph
the Raumplan — to utilize space more economically. Space taken away from less,Paragraph
"important rooms, he claimed, could be added to other, more significant areas.",Paragraph
Yet Loos also had other motives. Chief among them was to use the ideas of spatial,Paragraph
play to enhance — to vitalize — the rituals of daily life. To move through the Villa,Paragraph
Miiller is to engage the architecture both physically (through the act of climbing or,Paragraph
walking or touching) and psychologically (by experiencing the dramatic alterations,Paragraph
"in space, texture, color, and light). Everywhere in the house one is confronted with",Paragraph
different architectural effects and architectural realities; living in and moving,Paragraph
through it necessitates a high level of mental and physical activity.,Paragraph
"The Millers lived in the villa during the 1930s, and they continued to inhabit it",Paragraph
throughout the German occupation and the early postwar years. But after the,Paragraph
"Communist seizure of power in Czechoslovakia in 1948, the house was converted",Paragraph
"into an “apartment villa,” and the Miillers were forced to move into a few rooms.",Paragraph
"FrantiSek Miiller died in 1951, and the house was “nationalized” in 1955. Milada",Paragraph
Miillerova occupied the several rooms that had been allotted to the couple — after,Paragraph
"1962, it was only the former servants’ quarters — until her death in 1968. In 1972, the",Paragraph
villa was put at the disposal of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central,Paragraph
"Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and it was not until 1989, after",Paragraph
"the Velvet Revolution, that it was returned to Eva Miillerova. In 1995, the city of",Paragraph
Prague purchased the house and assigned it to the City Museum of Prague. From,Paragraph
"1998 to 2000, it underwent extensive restoration and is now accessible to the",Paragraph
public.”,Paragraph
"In architectural circles, the Villa Miiller almost immediately became a revered",Paragraph
object. Loos himself believed it to be one of his most important works. On the,Paragraph
"occasion of his 60th birthday party, held at the house on December 10, 1930, Loos",Paragraph
wrote in the Miiller’s guest book that it was his “most beautiful house!” (He,Paragraph
"added that Frantisek Miller was “the most intelligent client I have ever had,”",Paragraph
and “This is the entire secret of architecture.””°) Shortly after the house’s com-,Paragraph
"pletion, Robert Scheu, a protégé of Loos, wrote fawningly: “Now we know the",Paragraph
beauty of reason. The glory of the modern age incarnated in the splendor of,Paragraph
"space. Modern humankind has its home.””’ And Kulka, also hardly an objective",Paragraph
"observer, described the villa as the most complete expression of Loos’ conception",Paragraph
of architecture.”,Paragraph
But the verdict from others was equally glowing. The Czech art historian,Paragraph
"Antonin Matéjéek, for example, gushed (though not entirely accurately): “Having",Paragraph
"found an ideal investor in Dr. F. Miller, A. Loos was able to incorporate his artistic",Paragraph
"creed in this house to a hitherto unattained perfection. In all previous cases, he had",Paragraph
"to fight obstacles interfering with the purity of his idea; anywhere else, he had to",Paragraph
accommodate the wishes of the client beyond the acceptable measure.””’,Paragraph
The more thoughtful discussions of the house that appeared in later years,Paragraph
emphasized its remarkably plain exterior and the sophisticated spatial play of,Paragraph
"the interior. Gustav Kiinstler, who along with Ludwig Miinz produced the first",Paragraph
"complete monograph on Loos’ works in 1964, rendered a typical assessment:",Paragraph
"Nothing on the |house’s] exterior...betrays the truly novel conception, the product of",Paragraph
"a genial design ability, of a complete and wholly unordinary idea of available living",Paragraph
space and its organization. The usual scheme of the single-family house — living,Paragraph
"rooms on the ground floor, bedrooms on the second floor, connected by a stair,",Caption
"which is to say two wholly independent spatial groupings, on different levels and",Paragraph
independent of each other — has been rearranged to form a convincing...and harmo-,Paragraph
"nious sequencing of rooms of different sizes and heights, which through the course of",Paragraph
a gradual climb from the entry to the main living floor...fuse the house into an,Paragraph
extraordinary whole.”,Paragraph
"Some later commentators, however, had difficultly reconciling Loos’ plain",Paragraph
facades (which seemingly offer evidence of his anti-ornament pronouncements),Paragraph
"and his remarkably prescient spatial ideas with the villa’s sumptuous, and in many",Paragraph
"respects traditional, furnishings and finishes. Nikolaus Pevsner, Vincent Scully, and",Paragraph
"Kenneth Frampton, among others, all dealt with this issue effectively by pointing to",Paragraph
what was modern and ignoring what seemed not to be. But other historians and,Paragraph
critics were able to bring together the varied faces of the villa. Yehuda Safran and,Paragraph
"Wilftied Wang, writing in 1985, argued that Loos’ design had “preserved a ‘desire",Paragraph
"for habitability,’ in terms not of function but of the shape of the interior space.” The",Paragraph
"colors, surfaces, and textures all operated to normalize the spaces, making them",Paragraph
livable:,Title
"Against such conceptual rigor, the green Cipollino marble mounted in panels creates",Paragraph
with its pattern of veining a ready-made design over the entire wall of the staircase.,Paragraph
"The block of stone stands out against the white walls, allowing one to perceive the",Paragraph
interior at a glance. The extreme variety of colour — yellow curtains and red brick,Paragraph
"fireplace, green curtains and granite slab used as a dining room table — intensify",Paragraph
the links effected by contrasts and similarities.”,Paragraph
The Italian historian Benedetto Gravagnuolo similarly maintained that Loos’,Paragraph
stress on color and comfort were evidence of his intention to heighten the livability,Paragraph
of the house — something that had been at the center of Loos’ ambitions from the,Paragraph
start of his career — and that the villa “synthesizes many of the ideas of design that,Paragraph
"had emerged in [Loos’] previous works.””° Giovanni Denti, professor at the Poli-",Paragraph
"tecnico in Milan, echoed the assessment: “The silence of the exterior protects the",Paragraph
"interior, which is an ensemble of places offering hospitality to different moments",Paragraph
"of family life ... In the Miiller house every place has its own character, its own",Paragraph
"aspect, determined by materials and Raumplan.”””",Paragraph
"Leslie van Duzer and Kent Kleinman, who wrote one of the best books on the",Paragraph
"house, Villa Muller: A Work of Adolf Loos, also underscored the importance of the",Paragraph
interior finishes:,Caption
"Each room. ..is not only distinctively formed, but also uniquely clad. Despite the den-",Paragraph
"sity and opacity of the construction, one experiences the interior of the building as a",Paragraph
"sequence of linings. Like slipping in and out of fine dinner jackets, lining succeeds",Paragraph
"lining. The entry sequence, for example, is composed of four discrete spaces and four",Paragraph
discrete wrappers.”,Paragraph
"Van Duzer and Kleinman have suggested, however, that a person’s experience",Paragraph
"of the house can differ greatly, depending on whether he or she is actively moving —",Paragraph
“roving” — through the house or passively seated. The “roving subject ... is further,Paragraph
"privileged by the freedom to gaze and peer across boundaries,” permitted even",Paragraph
"“visual access to the landscape beyond the shell of the building,” whereas anyone",Paragraph
stationary within has a far more limited experience because the rooms are often,Paragraph
bounded in ways that reduce or eliminate such visual connectivity.”,Paragraph
"Beatriz Colomina has drawn a related comparison, emphasizing the tension",Paragraph
between elements of theatricality and intimacy in the house:,Paragraph
"In the Miiller House...the sequence of spaces, articulated around the staircase, fol-",Paragraph
lows an increasing sense of privacy from the drawing room to the dining room and,Paragraph
"study to the “lady’s room” (Zimmer der Dame) with its raised sitting area, which occu-",Paragraph
pies the center or “heart” of the house. But the window of this space looks onto the,Paragraph
"living space...|TJhe most intimate room is like a theater box, placed just over the",Paragraph
"entrance to the social spaces in this house, so that any intruder could easily be seen.",Paragraph
"Likewise, the view of the exterior, toward the city, from this “theater box” is con-",Paragraph
"tained within a view of the interior. Suspended in the middle of the house, this space",Paragraph
assumes the character both of a “sacred” space and a point of control. Comfort is,Paragraph
"produced by two seemingly opposing conditions, intimacy and control.”°",Paragraph
"Precisely how much of any of this Loos intended, we have no way of knowing.",Paragraph
He left few clues to his objectives in designing the spaces and even fewer about,Paragraph
how he thought his clients should live there. The little remaining evidence suggests,Paragraph
"that he thought simply about providing his inhabitants a full and rich environment,",Paragraph
"one that was intimate, secure, and comfortable, one that allowed a certain flexibil-",Paragraph
ity for conducting the rituals of daily life. If the paths through the house describe a,Paragraph
distinctive journey and a very specific set of spatial experiences (from closed to,Paragraph
"open, from darker to lighter, etc.), they are also part of a narrative of dwelling.",Paragraph
"One enters, one removes one’s outer clothing in the cloakroom and then ascends",Paragraph
to the living room. There one might relax or entertain. The room is both public and,Paragraph
"private. The dining room, poised just above, is about an even more intimate form",Paragraph
"of interaction. Whether the Millers were dining alone or with guests, the space,",Paragraph
"with its lower ceiling and cozy scale, offered a field for close conversation.",Paragraph
"Like almost all grand Central European houses of the time, the villa is also metic-",Paragraph
"ulously segmented: there are the servants’ spaces, always concealed, and spaces for",Paragraph
the Miillers and their guests. The divisions between public and private are similarly,Paragraph
fully drawn. The public spaces — and the public portion of the promenade through,Paragraph
"the house — end at the dining room. What lies beyond, the boudoir, Frantisek",Paragraph
"Miiller’s study, and the bedrooms and breakfast room above, are all screened away.",Paragraph
To enter this zone is to be admitted to a different and far more personal realm.,Paragraph
"Beyond that, Loos appears to have given his clients the latitude — literally and",Paragraph
"figuratively, the space — to shape their own lives. The furnishings and finishes,",Paragraph
"which meld the traditional and the modern, are about expressing the Miiller’s life-",Paragraph
"style, much less about assembling it. Because the interiors are not stylistically con-",Paragraph

in all of his interiors — is that they should be of high quality (and therefore durable),Paragraph
"and that they stand outside the cycles of fashion, which would prevent their rapid",Paragraph
obsolescence. But since the house was not conceived with the purifying rigor that,Paragraph
"characterized much of modernism, it falls into another category, a deeply personal",Paragraph
"one. Lhota’s comment, that Loos was “not an architect but a building philosopher,”",Paragraph
rings true here. The Villa Miller is perhaps less a modernist architectural object,Paragraph

SHIP SHAPE,Title
"In January 1975, the American designer and inventor R. Buckminster Fuller",Paragraph
"(1895-1983) gave a series of 12 continuous lectures lasting 42 hours. In the lectures,",Paragraph
"simply titled “Everything I Know,” Fuller spoke on a broad range of topics that",Paragraph
"included his personal history, inventions, and the seemingly esoteric vignettes that",Paragraph
illuminated his thinking. At one point he spoke admiringly of the indigenous,Paragraph
"Polynesian people of New Zealand, the Maori. Initially classified as “ignorant”",Paragraph
"by European settlers because they could only count to two, Fuller claimed that",Paragraph
the Maori were in fact quite advanced since they had already discovered the,Paragraph
"advantages of binary systems, anticipating the emerging world of computers.",Paragraph
Fuller continued to note that these “water people” who ruled the South Pacific,Paragraph
"seas, despite not having literature or written language, did not possess charts or",Paragraph
"maps for navigation. They lived their lives without very much need for clothing,",Paragraph
and therefore the Maori seamen did not have pockets in which to carry devices,Paragraph
"such as compasses. However, they did have very long ear lobes embedded with",Paragraph
"large discs fashioned out of bone or ivory, which, according to Fuller, signaled",Paragraph
the cardinal points of a type of corporal compass. Fuller admired the Maori and,Paragraph
"considered their novel method of navigation as “a very mature, very economic,",Paragraph
very efficient kind of information controlling device.”! Not only could the Maori,Paragraph
navigate the open seas of the South Pacific with their “information controlling,Paragraph
"devices,” but the constantly changing forces of weather, tides, and currents",Paragraph
"necessitated that their rings merge within the extraneous skin, thereby transform-",Paragraph
ing the surface of the body into a site of performance. This small passage demon-,Paragraph
"strates Fuller’s appreciation for other skilled “water people,” but more",Paragraph
importantly it illustrates his approach to design centered upon the very same,Paragraph
"appreciation of performance, and underlines his understanding of the built envi-",Paragraph
"ronment as being formed by undulating flows, forces, and turbulences of a non-",Paragraph
"Cartesian, smooth space reminiscent of the sea.",Paragraph
The concept of dynamic forces shaping form in order to increase,Paragraph
"performance was the foundation of Fuller’s most noted project, the",Paragraph
"Dymaxion House. While Fuller is best known for his dome structures,",Paragraph
the Dymaxion House is perhaps the most important failed architecture project,Paragraph
of the twentieth century. It can be considered a failure because the project,Paragraph
never achieved its primary goal of being a mass-produced house that would,Paragraph
be transported directly to its customers across the United States at an affordable,Paragraph
"price. The house’s significance, however, lies in the fact that Fuller reimagined",Paragraph
"the way people would live in the future, and introduced to the architectural",Paragraph
"profession new criteria by which to judge and assess housing design, which",Paragraph
"was according to a standard of improved performance, not unlike the",Paragraph
manufacturing and performance benchmarks of industrially-designed objects,Title
"such as boats, cars, and airplanes. His insight into this advanced approach",Paragraph
was derived through his ability to transfer knowledge from his experience in,Paragraph
manufacturing and the U.S. military to the field of design.,Paragraph
The design and redesign of the house spanned the entirety of Fuller’s early,Paragraph
"career from 1927 to 1946, undergoing many name changes; from the initial 4D",Paragraph
"Lightful Houses of 1927, to the Fuller or Dymaxion House, to the Dymaxion",Paragraph
"Dwelling Unit or Machine, to the last version, the 1946 Wichita House. It served",Paragraph
as the catalyst for many auxiliary projects that were guided by Fuller’s principle of,Paragraph
"the Dymaxion creed, which included the Dymaxion bathroom unit, the Dymaxion",Paragraph
"car, and Dymaxion deployment units.",Paragraph
The house design developed through many iterations over a period of almost,Paragraph
"20 years; therefore, when speaking of the Dymaxion House, it is a reference to",Paragraph
a specific design vision that proposed the application of scientific methods of,Paragraph
"industrial assembly to construction processes, rather than simply the design",Paragraph
of one type of futuristic-looking house. A constant theme defining all of Fuller’s,Paragraph
projects during this time was the concept of the Dymaxion creed. The term,Paragraph
"“Dymaxion” is the combination of the words “dynamic” and “maximum,”",Paragraph
where the “maximum gain of advantage [is derived from] the minimal energy,Paragraph
input.”?,Paragraph
Industry: Housing Design Based on Performance,Title
"As a young adult, Fuller was twice dismissed from Harvard University, and each",Paragraph
time this happened his mother would send him to work in factories. His first job,Paragraph
"was an apprenticeship to a machine installer at a cotton mill in Quebec, his second",Paragraph
"was with the Armour Meat Company where he was fascinated by the rapid, com-",Paragraph
"plex, and semi-automated methods of the meatpacking process. Although his time",Paragraph
"on the factory floor was brief, Fuller was able to observe and comprehend the",Paragraph
important principles that determined success in industry. He too witnessed first-,Paragraph
hand how a factory operated and the manner in which the machine tools func-,Paragraph
"tioned, and most importantly he gained insight into the ways in which value",Paragraph
was created. He would later claim that a significant corollary of mass production,Paragraph
"was that it was premised upon a process of “constantly improving performance,”",Paragraph
dependent upon perpetually improving the technology for manufacturing pro-,Paragraph
ducts of “increasingly improved and measurable performance.”’ This crucial aspect,Paragraph
of successful industry was one that Fuller did not see happening within the con-,Paragraph
struction of American housing.,Paragraph
Therefore it was through the design and production of the Dymaxion House,Paragraph
that Fuller sought to establish a new housing industry by treating houses like indus-,Paragraph
trially-designed products engineered to be mass produced within a factory using,Paragraph
the latest in material technology and adhering to advanced performance standards.,Paragraph
"He conceded that engineered building products, such as elevators, lighting, and",Paragraph
"heating systems were products of industry; however, the house, in its entirety,",Paragraph
was not conceived with the same drive toward constantly improved innovation,Paragraph
and increased performance.,Paragraph
"Adhering to his Dymaxion creed, Fuller’s house was to be produced mostly from",Paragraph
"the lightweight material of aluminum, manufactured in a factory, and then shipped",Paragraph
in a reusable stainless steel tube to any location within the United States along with,Paragraph
trained service crews who would immediately set upon the task of assembling the,Paragraph
"house. A large crane would suspend a central aluminum mast, the house’s main",Paragraph
"structure, while other parts, such as the main ground floor platform, and interior",Paragraph
"and exterior walls, were to be constructed by connecting them to the central mast",Paragraph
"by a universal joint. This central column, or mast, would also perform as the",Paragraph
"mechanical core, containing all of the plumbing, electrical, and ventilation systems.",Paragraph
"Once the assembly was completed, and state-of-the-art appliances and pre-",Paragraph
"fabricated bathrooms installed, the house would be lowered onto the ground",Paragraph
and “anchored.”*,Paragraph
U.S. Navy: Dealing with Dynamic Forces,Title
Fuller was introduced to sailing and navigation as a young boy growing up ona,Paragraph
"small island in Penobscot Bay, Maine. After his university misadventures, he",Paragraph
"enlisted in the U.S. Navy, a move that fostered his childhood interests of sailing,",Paragraph
"navigation, and boats. Fuller thrived in the disciplined environment of the Navy",Paragraph
where he was exposed to the logistics of Atlantic transport operations and the,Paragraph
organized movement of supplies moved over large expanses of geographical ter-,Paragraph
ritory. His responsibilities as U.S naval officer required the ability to understand,Paragraph
"statistical methods (and early versions of operations research), map projection,",Paragraph
and chart making.,Paragraph
John McHale noted that the atmosphere of the Navy exposed Fuller to “precise,Paragraph
"mathematical reckoning, advanced communications and the technical know-how",Title
"involved in the logistics of mass tonnage movements, ballistics and navigation;”",Paragraph
influences that ultimately led to his concept of comprehensive total environmental,Paragraph
design and pre-planning.’ His exposure to the inner workings of manufacturing,Paragraph
coupled with the logistical prowess of the Navy provided Fuller with the conclu-,Paragraph
sion that the key element to success in industry was to understand it as a constantly,Paragraph
"mobile entity of fluid systems. Fuller explained that by 1927, he understood that",Paragraph
innovation for house manufacturing was not to be found in the automobile indus-,Paragraph
"try, but in shipbuilding and the aeronautical world, which was based on the prin-",Paragraph
cipal of measuring performance per pound of weight.,Paragraph
In order to illustrate the amount of advanced engineering and technology that,Paragraph
"went into shipbuilding compared to architecture, Fuller often made the",Paragraph
comparison between the Mauretania ocean liner and the Hotel Belmont in New,Paragraph
"York City.° The hotel, Fuller noted, received its electricity from the city infrastruc-",Paragraph
"ture and received its food twice a day from local suppliers, since its refrigeration",Paragraph
storage capacity was very small. However the ocean liner was required to carry its,Paragraph
"own power and provisions for 1,500 people for a total of 30 days. Based on a per",Paragraph
"guest basis, the Mauretania weighed one-fifteenth of the Belmont, proving that",Paragraph
weight does not equal stability. The Mauretania could withstand the motion of,Paragraph
"open sea, whereas the Hotel Belmont would collapse under the same conditions.",Paragraph
Fuller concluded by pointing out the fact that if the Mauretania weighed as much as,Paragraph
the Belmont Hotel per unit of performance the boat would quickly sink.,Paragraph
4D Lightful Houses,Caption
"Fuller’s first iteration of the Dymaxion House, called the 4D Lightful House, was",Paragraph
based on a hexagonal plan created through the geometry of triangles. The primary,Paragraph
"problem with existing housing stock for Fuller was the heavy, load-bearing walls of",Paragraph
"traditional construction. To alleviate this issue, Fuller set out to design a house",Paragraph
made of lightweight yet strong modern materials that made up most ship and air-,Paragraph
plane construction.,Paragraph
The Dymaxion House was designed according to its performance in fuel con-,Paragraph
"sumption, water requirements, actual production of individual parts, wind and",Paragraph
"other weather conditions, and the ease of construction and delivery of materials",Paragraph
"to the site. Unlike the existing housing stock in the United States at this time, Fuller",Paragraph
imagined a new type of house as well as a novel means of constructing it. In addi-,Paragraph
"tion, he proposed a method of distributing the houses as rentable, exchangeable,",Paragraph
"and replaceable units, just as the telephone company would rent or lease a phone to",Paragraph
"its customers, and then provide the necessary logistics and infrastructure for the",Paragraph
distribution of telephone services.,Paragraph
"The 4D Houses, soon to be renamed Dymaxion Houses, would remain as a",Paragraph
"scaled model, nevertheless the project was essential in establishing Fuller's theory",Paragraph
"of “ephemeralization.” In Nine Chains to the Moon, Fuller defined ephemeralization",Paragraph
"as advanced technology’s innate ability to do more with less material, and thereby",Paragraph
continually improve the quality of life while using less energy and natural,Paragraph
resources.”,Paragraph
Dymaxion Bathroom,Title
The 4D House included a prefabricated bathroom unit installed much like a corner,Paragraph
"cabinet. The first prototype, consisting of a continuous surface of welded copper,",Paragraph
was commissioned by the American Standard Heating and Plumbing Company in,Paragraph
1930. An additional 12 prototypes were developed in 1936 for the Phelps Dodge,Paragraph
Copper Company. The innovative aspect of this bathroom design was that it,Paragraph
"was a compact, self-contained, structural unit that included a shower, bathtub, soap",Paragraph
"holder, toilet, walls, floor, and washbasin shaped from one continuous surface. At",Paragraph
"first the material was die-cut from a sheet of copper; this proved to be too heavy,",Paragraph
"however, and subsequently stainless steel was specified, and later fiberglass. The",Paragraph
"design was the culmination of considerations regarding performance, supported",Paragraph
"by the inherent properties of the material selected, using the most advanced indus-",Paragraph
trial methods of manufacture.,Paragraph
"Sigfried Giedion, in his concluding chapter on the mechanized bathroom in",Paragraph
"Mechanization Takes Command, was the first historian to take serious note of",Paragraph
"Fuller’s Dymaxion bathroom unit, and claimed that the central mechanical core",Paragraph
of the Dymaxion House was a harbinger of postwar housing design. He glow-,Paragraph
ingly described how the Dymaxion bathroom was easily and efficiently,Paragraph
manufactured:,Title
"All the components are pressed simultaneously with the metal skin, their hollows",Paragraph
sometimes helping to give the system additional rigidity. |EJvery square inch was,Paragraph
"worked out, so that the dies would have the highest industrial efficiency, and the",Paragraph
bathrooms could be stamped out by the million at minimal cost.*,Paragraph
"Despite his initial praise, Giedion would conclude that the bathroom unit fell",Paragraph
short in terms of comfort; its dimensions were not unlike those found on a boat,Paragraph
or submarine and therefore too small and rigid for any house design with a flexible,Paragraph
ground plan.”,Paragraph
Dymaxion Car,Title
Since the Dymaxion Dwelling Machine was conceived as a house that could be,Paragraph
"built in any location without roads or other infrastructure, Fuller devised a mode",Paragraph
of transport as an accessory to the Dymaxion House: “I decided to try to develop an,Paragraph
"omni-medium transport vehicle to function in the sky, on negotiable terrain, or on",Paragraph
"water — to be securely landable anywhere, like an eagle.” *° The Dymaxion Trans-",Paragraph
port Unit was initially designed as a “hoverable-type jet stilt ‘flying bedstead.’,Paragraph
"However, these plans were modified to create a state-of-the-art, streamlined car,",Paragraph
engineered with the assistance of famed yacht designer Starling Burgess.,Paragraph
Burgess assisted in translating Fuller’s concept into an aerodynamic automobile.,Paragraph
"He was best known for his design of the Enterprise, the 1930 America’s Cup winner.",Paragraph
"Not unlike the duralumin mast of Fuller’s Dymaxion House, Burgess’ innovative",Paragraph
"yacht design was the first to use duralumin masts and winches, reducing the work",Paragraph
required of 20 sailors down to four. A 1933 article in Fortune magazine claimed that,Paragraph
"Burgess, a “fine mathematician,” was known to rise at 4 am to complete a series of",Paragraph
"calculus problems, and noted that his experience in designing streamlined yachts",Paragraph
was “tremendously helpful in designing the [Dymaxion] car.”’?,Paragraph
"Shaped into the streamlined form of a teardrop, the 11-passenger, three-wheeled",Paragraph
car was easily maneuverable since its rear wheel acted as a boat rudder steering the,Paragraph
"direction of the vehicle. The front wheels, providing traction, were powered by an",Paragraph
eight-cylinder Ford motor concealed within a custom built chassis and bodywork,Paragraph
"made of duralumin, weighing about 1,700 pounds compared to the Ford Sedan at",Paragraph
"2,700 pounds.’’ Despite the advanced technology and streamlined, futuristic aes-",Paragraph
"thetic, the Dymaxion car would be yet another shelved project, as an unfortunate",Paragraph
accident involving the car at the 1933 World Fair killed the driver and injured two,Paragraph
"other passengers. The cause of the accident was not entirely known; however, it",Paragraph
"was rumored to be a problem with the steering, prompting investors to abandon",Paragraph
the project.,Paragraph

ate housing for the general civilian population. It appeared that the production of a,Paragraph
"redesigned Dymaxion House could resolve all of these problems, while achieving",Paragraph
Fuller’s goal of transforming house construction from a craft-based trade to an,Paragraph
industrialized system.,Paragraph
The major difference between the 1927 version of the Dymaxion House and the,Paragraph
1946 Wichita model was that Fuller re-engineered the exterior skin according to the,Paragraph
improved tensile strength of aluminum and incorporated the most-advanced,Paragraph
knowledge of aircraft construction since it was to be produced at the B-29 bomber,Paragraph
"Beech Aircraft plant in Wichita, Kansas. The original hexagon shape changed to a",Paragraph
"streamlined circular plan, and the roof was a smooth, curved surface compared to",Paragraph
"the previous angular form. The aluminum monocoque roof was self-supporting,",Paragraph
and the curved exterior walls were tied back to the central mast through tension,Paragraph
members enveloped within the roof. With the mast in compression and the roof,Paragraph
"and walls in tension due to the double curvature shape, the structure, modeled",Paragraph
"upon the idea of a Chinese lantern, was substantially rigid and did not require addi-",Paragraph
"tional bracing, columns, or trusses for support. The increased performance in struc-",Paragraph
ture can be found in what Fuller described as shape factors. When Fuller placed the,Paragraph
"Dymaxion prototype in a wind tunnel, he discovered that heat loss occurred in",Paragraph
"direct proportion to drag, revealing that heat loss could be reduced if the house",Paragraph
shape took on an aerodynamic form.’* The air quality and comfort was further,Paragraph
"assured through a ventilator located on the roof, which would change the air in",Paragraph
the house up to ten times per hour.,Paragraph
The redesign enabled Fuller to realize an actual prototype that manifested his,Paragraph
theory of ephemeralization with a house encompassing 800 square feet of floor,Paragraph
space and weighing a total of 4 tons; demonstrating a 98% reduction in weight from,Paragraph
a traditionally built home. Despite these technological innovations and a willing,Paragraph
"pool of 3,000 customers placing orders, the Wichita House would not be mass pro-",Paragraph
duced. Investors were unwilling to contribute the required $10 million to re-tool,Paragraph
"the aircraft plant since the project did not have any marketing, distribution, and",Paragraph
installation strategies.,Paragraph
Dymaxion Legacy,Title
The greatest legacy of the Dymaxion House was the manner in which Fuller’s,Paragraph
design approach influenced generations of future architects and historians. Interest-,Paragraph
"ingly enough, it seems that Fuller received more acknowledgment and apprecia-",Paragraph
"tion for his work by British architects, historians, and designers than American",Paragraph
ones. Alison and Peter Smithson were inspired by the continuous structural surface,Paragraph
of the Dymaxion bathroom unit for their 1956 House of the Future. Within the,Paragraph
"same U.K. design circles, the Dymaxion House served as a demonstration of port-",Paragraph
ability for the architecture group Archigram.’? While these young designers,Paragraph
"attempted to imitate the technical and mechanical imagery of Fuller’s designs,",Paragraph
and the kit-of-parts aspect of the Dymaxion House appealed to the new postwar,Paragraph
"sensibility for mobility, Archigram was not interested in the performative nature",Paragraph
"of the house. As Hadas Steiner noted, Archigram wanted to create a type of mobile",Paragraph
architecture that “violated the principle of firmitas” and the Dymaxion House,Paragraph
served as an applicable precedent.’® Fuller's house actualized this new postwar,Paragraph
"urge for freedom and the ability to roam, and it was this secondary dynamic aspect",Paragraph
— the house’s ability to be located anywhere without the reliance of infrastructure —,Paragraph
that inspired Archigram.,Paragraph
The next generation influenced by Fuller’s concepts includes the group of archi-,Paragraph
"tects characterized as High-Tech, such as Norman Foster, Nicholas Grimshaw, and",Paragraph
Richard Rogers. The Dymaxion House demonstrated a new set of design values,Paragraph
"that placed research, the development of technology regarding energy, perfor-",Paragraph
"mance, and the transfer of knowledge from other industries above any outmoded",Paragraph
notion of (postmodern) style. Foster claimed that Fuller had a “profound influence,Paragraph
"on my own work and thinking. Inevitably, I also gained an insight into his philos-",Paragraph
"ophy and achievements.”’” During the last decade of Fuller's life, Foster established",Paragraph
"a relationship with the inventor /architect, and his admiration for his work included",Paragraph
financing a built replication of Fuller’s Dymaxion car.,Paragraph
"Although not acknowledged as an important influence, the work of contempo-",Paragraph
rary American architect Greg Lynn seems to revisit problems similar to the ones,Paragraph
Fuller addressed almost 80 years ago. Not unlike the “dynamic” in Fuller’s Dymax-,Paragraph
"ion creed, Lynn’s design strategy is one based on the concept of “animation.” In his",Paragraph
"1999 book, Animate Form, Lynn proposed a new architecture that was not animate",Paragraph
"itself, but was in fact formed by moving, fluid forces acting upon it. By adopting this",Paragraph
"approach to architecture, traditional notions of statics and structure were replaced",Paragraph
by a “more advanced system of dynamic organizations.” !*,Paragraph
"To illustrate his concept, Lynn often cites the designing of a boat hull, where",Paragraph
"naval architects are required to factor in mobile forces such as flow, wind, turbu-",Paragraph
"lence, and viscosity, in both upwind and downwind performance. However, the",Paragraph
actual boat hull is static in its final form; “While physical form can be defined in,Paragraph
"terms of static coordinates, the virtual force of the environment in which it is",Paragraph
"designed contributes to its shape.”""® The design of the boat hull negotiates these",Paragraph
"shaping forces by engineering curves and inflection to modulate and respond, but",Paragraph
the actual surface of the hull does not move.,Paragraph
"Since the publication of Animate Form, Lynn has in fact entered into a new design",Paragraph
realm that includes both moving and non-moving parts called “projectiles.” Like,Paragraph
"Fuller, one of Lynn’s first projects was to design a factory-produced house called",Paragraph
the Embryological House (2000). Using an iterative process of digital animation pro-,Paragraph
"grams borrowed from film and aerospace industries, Lynn set up a series of control",Paragraph
curves and shape grammars within a matrix that determined the way each form,Paragraph
"would interact with others, and then established a set of expressions dictating",Paragraph
"how the geometry defined structure, cladding, and apertures.”° This process, an early",Paragraph
"attempt at mass customization, created a series of 50,000 varied house designs which",Paragraph
did not require adding or subtracting structure or cladding to create this formal,Paragraph
difference.,Paragraph
"Paralleling Fuller’s interest in everything related to boats and sailing, Lynn estab-",Paragraph
"lished a company with a naval architect, and now designs seafaring vessels such as",Paragraph
the GF42 Trimaran. The process of designing these boats includes the application,Paragraph
"of fluid dynamics, which calculates both the force of wind and the dynamics of",Paragraph
"water within a single model. A basic, instinctual geometry of the hull, rig, and sails",Paragraph
"is created, and then these shapes are sent to a computer with massive processing",Paragraph
"power, to calculate all of the data. It is through this iterative process — the analysis of",Paragraph
"the flow and motion across surfaces, together with a graphical response — that the",Paragraph
final design is selected.,Paragraph
"For Lynn, the most innovative aspect in the boating construction industry is the",Paragraph
simple fabrication of materials for the hull and sails consisting solely of layers of,Paragraph
fibers and resin rather than a frame structure with cladding fastened to it; a con-,Paragraph
figuration that occurs in most traditionally conceived architectural works. Consid-,Paragraph

"aluminum panels for the Dymaxion House, these vessels are made from 100% car-",Paragraph
bon fibers strategically placed along load paths and then molded together with glue,Paragraph
and heated into a strong composite material.”! Fuller and Lynn discovered the per-,Paragraph

structure into one smooth continuous surface.,Paragraph
Conclusion,Title
"In his 1969 book, Architecture of the Well-tempered Environment, the British architec-",Paragraph
"tural historian Reyner Banham, in reference to Fuller’s Dymaxion approach of",Paragraph
"“ephemeralization,” recalled Paul Valery’s book Eupalinos, the Architect. He",Paragraph
explained how Eupalinos was primarily concerned with applying accepted meth-,Paragraph
"ods to complete specific tasks, and, according to the tradition of the architectural",Paragraph
"profession, discovered a theoretical problem embedded within every pragmatic",Paragraph
"decision. However, Tridon, the shipbuilder, attempted to resolve the problem",Paragraph
"at hand in the most direct and efficient manner, whether it was part of the ship-",Paragraph
"building tradition or not, and considered philosophical theories as additional guid-",Paragraph
ance toward achieving the most direct solution. Banham continued the analogy by,Paragraph
pointing out that contemporary architectural education was comparable to a,Paragraph
“sophisticated yacht with glass-fiber hull and aluminum mast” and other advanced,Paragraph
"materials. However, in terms of performance, the architecture produced by these",Paragraph
elite institutions still required “an onboard motor to be used (under conditions of,Paragraph
great embarrassment) in emergencies.””” He concluded by noting that arguments,Paragraph
that defend the use of traditional methods in architecture often ignore the fact that,Paragraph
outside the “protected circle” of academia and the staged discourse of architectural,Paragraph
"media, “there has been for almost a century a tide of innovation in environmental",Paragraph
management fully comparable with that in nautical design.””?,Paragraph
These insights begin to explain the unsuccessful acceptance of Fuller’s Dymaxion,Paragraph
House. A 1947 Fortune article referred to prefabricated housing as “the industry that,Paragraph
"capitalism forgot,” noting that an entire generation of architects dismissed the possibil-",Paragraph
ity of prefabricated housing because they could not foresee how it could work within,Paragraph
"contemporary political and financial structures, as is still the case today.’* Nevertheless,",Paragraph
Fuller’s concept of performance transferred from the sphere of industrial design and,Paragraph
manufacture to architecture is a noble goal with continuing resonance in contemporary,Paragraph
architectural practices that currently explore the increased possibilities ofnew advances,Paragraph
in digital software and custom fabrication technologies. It becomes clear that the pro-,Paragraph
fession now needs to find a solution to overcome the same political and economic bar-,Paragraph

contains some hyperbole and some inaccuracies. As a result the house and its,Paragraph
"importance have often been misunderstood, most importantly the degree, or more",Paragraph
"accurately the way, in which it was constructionally experimental. While it",Paragraph
"employed a variety of new materials and processes, it did not represent a radical",Paragraph
break with the past in its basic construction; it was more evolutionary than revo-,Paragraph
lutionary in its innovations. It is more of a prototypical system than a prototypical,Paragraph
"form, as there is much about the house that is particular to its program and its site.",Paragraph
Nevertheless the VDL house remains a canonical work. Neutra’s intent was to,Paragraph
redefine three aspects of American building culture — to transform the typical site,Paragraph
"plan of the single family house, to transform the process of single family house",Paragraph
"construction into an industrialized system, and to establish a scientific methodol-",Paragraph
ogy for determining a sympathetic relationship between an architectural space and,Paragraph
"its occupants, using the newly acquired tools of psychology. All three ideas were",Paragraph
"central to much of 1930s modernism, but Neutra’s take on all, particularly the last",Paragraph
"two, was his own.",Paragraph
Neutra’s first assault on the status quo was the site plan. He wished to rein-,Paragraph
vent the typical American model of the isolated house sandwiched between a,Paragraph
front lawn and back yard. The result would be a cell that could multiply itself,Paragraph
"into a high-density settlement pattern. The result, he predicted, would be a Los",Paragraph
"Angeles 40% the size with half the traffic. His task, as he described it, was to",Paragraph
"make density beguiling or, more specifically, to place three families on a 60 x 70",Paragraph
foot lot.' Neutra’s solution to the problems high density created was both,Paragraph
real and psychological. Space would be both physically and psychologically,Paragraph
expanded.,Paragraph
This translated into a plan of buildings that were pushed to the property bound-,Paragraph
aries with courtyards between and accessed by multiple entries. This plan took,Paragraph
some time to achieve realization. The first phase was a 24x 70 foot block built,Paragraph
"in 1933, a large, two-story building along Silver Lake Boulevard facing the Silver",Paragraph
"Lake reservoir, containing the major living space on the second floor, with a view",Paragraph
"of the lake, and Neutra’s office below. The office was accessed off the major street,",Paragraph
the residence from the rear by an elevated stairway. In 1939 the second phase was,Paragraph
"added to the rear, a T-shaped wing that created an H-shaped complex with two",Paragraph
"courtyards. It included a garage and two rental apartments, one for a bachelor",Paragraph
"and one for a couple, to help with the financing. A smaller rooftop addition was",Paragraph
made to the older wing in 1944.,Paragraph
Making Houses like Cars,Title
"The second of Neutra’s revolutions was to be constructional; in short, to make",Paragraph
houses like cars. Neutra said it was the very idea of industrialization that brought,Paragraph
"him to America. Harwell Hamilton Harris, who worked for Neutra from 1928 to",Paragraph
"1932, said, more specifically, that it was the ideas of Henry Ford.” Ford saw rigid",Paragraph
"standardization as the key to the economies of mass production and Neutra, along",Paragraph
"with Le Corbusier and Gropius, agreed. But an equally important influence on",Paragraph
Neutra’s constructional conceptions was his work for Holabird & Roche on,Paragraph
the documentation and construction of the Palmer House Hotel in Chicago.,Paragraph
"Among the many European architects who admired American construction, as",Paragraph
"opposed to American architecture, Neutra was one of the few to experience",Paragraph
the former under construction first-hand. In terms of formal and constructional,Paragraph
"consequences these experiences were manifested in two ways. The first, derived",Paragraph
"from Ford, was the idea of standardized components but of a relatively small",Paragraph
scale. These consisted of a minimum number of components that were to be,Paragraph
applied in a maximum number of functional conditions. The second construc-,Paragraph
"tional principal, growing out of his Chicago experience, was that modern con-",Paragraph
"struction, regardless of program or scale, “consist[s] of skeleton construction",Paragraph
clad with lightweight materials.” The Palmer House Hotel was to Neutra a,Paragraph
"strange hybrid, a heavy masonry envelope hung on a light steel frame. He wished",Paragraph
to hang a light envelope on a light frame.,Paragraph
The ideas of the rigidly standardized part and a skin and frame construction had,Paragraph
achieved their most doctrinaire expression in Neutra’s Lovell house of 1929. Its,Paragraph
standardized module consisted of a series of 4-inch steel H columns spaced at a,Paragraph
ittle over 5 feet with standardized steel units of out-swinging casement windows,Paragraph
between. The opaque portions of the wall were gunite (sprayed-on concrete).,Paragraph
"oints were bolted or welded, not nailed; the structure was steel, not wood, and",Paragraph
"there was, in theory, minimal on-site labor. This facade pattern was nearly univer-",Paragraph
"sally applied. The same structural bay and the same window unit enclose library,",Paragraph
"bedroom, and bathroom, and, with variations in the height of the windows, are",Paragraph
"placed on the north, south, east, and west elevations. There were of course open-",Paragraph
"ings, erosions, and protrusions in this envelope, but the idea of the rigid module,",Paragraph
"made of rigidly standardized units, and hung on a rigidly standardized industria-",Paragraph
"ized frame, was pervasive. There was an absolute clarity of what was structural",Paragraph
frame and what was not.,Paragraph
If Neutra was to adopt the Lovell house system or another one like it to the VDL,Paragraph
house he had to face some economic realities. The Lovell house is twice the size of,Paragraph
VDL and cost $12 a square foot. The 2000-square foot VDL house was eventually,Paragraph
built for $4 a square foot. If the VDL house was to be a prototype on the order of,Paragraph
"the Lovell, Neutra would have to do so at one-third of the cost. Van der Leeuw’s",Paragraph
"check was for $3000; the eventual cost of the house was $10,000 and the check was",Paragraph
"an interest free loan, not a gift. Neutra never used the gunite-sprayed, steel-framed",Paragraph
"assembly of the Lovell house again, probably because subsequent commissions had",Paragraph
"less generous budgets. The VDL house, built three years after Lovell, is far less",Paragraph
dogmatic in its application of the ideas of standards and industrialized systems,Paragraph
and is perhaps the richer for it.,Paragraph
"Neutra’s solution, at least in theory, was simple. If he could not afford a steel",Paragraph
frame he would build a wooden frame that looked like steel. From a distance,Paragraph
the facades of the VDL house seem similar to those of the Lovell. Columns tightly,Paragraph
spaced at four feet are infilled with standardized window units of two steel case-,Paragraph
ment windows. Closer inspection reveals far more crucial differences. The first,Paragraph
"floor level is supported by precast concrete beams, but the house above is wood",Caption
"columns and wood joists. The walls are stucco, not gunite. The VDL structure is",Paragraph
best understood as a modification of the traditional balloon frame. The members of,Paragraph
the typical balloon frame are 2 x 4 wood studs spaced at 16 inches supporting floors,Paragraph
"of joists, usually 2 x 8s or 2 x 10s, also spaced at 16 inches. In the VDL system the",Paragraph
"studs are larger and more widely spaced, 4 x 4s at 4 feet, while the floor and roof",Paragraph
joist sizes and spacing remains the same. The long ribbons of standardized steel,Paragraph
"casement windows used at Lovell remain, and with them the large number of wall",Caption
openings required. This degree of openness is less easily accommodated in wood,Paragraph
than in steel. A balloon frame is structurally dependent on the wood sheathing of its,Paragraph
"exterior wall for lateral stability. Despite its name, it is far more of a wall system",Paragraph
than a frame. In the VDL house diagonal bracing is added at every bay to provide,Paragraph
"additional lateral stability, making the whole system far more ofa structural hybrid,",Paragraph
not purely a frame but not really a wall diaphragm. Neutra argued that the wood,Paragraph
frame provided greater elasticity in earthquakes. He was careful not to say greater,Paragraph
than what. So from a technological standpoint the VDL house is a much less a pure,Paragraph
"industrial product, much less like a car, than its predecessor. Despite the long list of",Paragraph
"innovative products the house contains, it is far more a hybrid of old and new",Paragraph
technology.,Paragraph
In a 1935 article Neutra wrote that his office had “endeavored to give many indi-,Paragraph
vidual jobs entrusted to us a character which would easily lend itself to series pro-,Paragraph
duction.”* Later he called his early buildings “templates ... for the imaginative,Paragraph
appropriation of our advancing industrial methods.”* What is implied by this is,Paragraph
obvious: that there is little real prefabrication in the VDL house except for the steel,Paragraph
windows. The rigid module probably accomplished little in terms of real economy.,Paragraph
Harris wrote that Neutra saw himself as preparing the public — “education” he,Paragraph
called it — so that when industrialization finally came the public would be ready.,Paragraph
A dubious aspect of this “education” was painting all the exterior wood with alu-,Paragraph
"minum paint, implying that it was metal, but again, Neutra argued that he was",Paragraph
preparing the public for the technical revolution that was to follow.®,Paragraph
Rooms with No Names,Title
This standardized wall system is applied on all facades and all types of space. Neu-,Paragraph
"tra, writing in 1947, described the modern dwelling as consisting of spaces that,",Paragraph
"while by no means universal, could accommodate a variety of functions. He said,",Paragraph
"“In our house rooms have no names such as living room, dining room, bedroom ...",Paragraph
Rooms are portions of our great living space and pragmatically elastic.”” This was,Paragraph
"particularly true of the VDL house, and helps to explain some of the odd moments",Paragraph
"in the plan — small rooms for major functions such as the dining room and kitchen,",Paragraph
odd juxtapositions of space such as the intersection where the corridor connecting,Paragraph
the kitchen and dining crosses the public entry to the main living space.,Caption
The idea ofa standardized module consisting ofa structural bay and window was,Paragraph
not new in 1933 or even 1927. Le Corbusier's villa at Garches used repetitive struc-,Paragraph
tural bays of 2.5 and 5 meters with standardized 2.5-meter-wide windows between,Paragraph
"them; and the villas at Carthage, the Weisenhofsiedlung, and the original plan for the",Paragraph
"Villa Savoye do the same. The Corbusian facades of the 1920s also appear, at times,",Paragraph
indifferent to program. The front of Garches has one row of standard window units,Paragraph
"and the rear has two, both enclosing a complex interior spatial layout. In this regard it",Paragraph
"has much in common with the first phase of the VDL house, which had one row of",Paragraph
"standard windows on the east side and two on the west, also only loosely related to",Paragraph
"the interior disposition of space, and both houses have a living space on the second",Paragraph
floor with a external stair access. But while the VDL house owes a formal debt to Le,Paragraph
Corbusier it also owes a technical debt to Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1911-17 Wright,Paragraph
had developed the Ready-Cut prefabricated housing system. It used widely spaced,Paragraph
4 x 4 wood columns along with ribbons of casement windows in an arrangement,Caption
identical to the VDL but about half the width.,Paragraph
Neutra convinced material suppliers to donate products to the house with the,Paragraph
"promise of publicity — glass and aluminum sandwich panels, Masonite walls, cork",Caption
"flooring, precast concrete floor joists, and blue enameled metal wall panels. Few if",Paragraph
"any were used for the first time here, but many were new on the market. Yet,",Paragraph
"excepting the precast joists used for the ground floor, most of the new products",Paragraph
"were finish materials, not structural, and created the appearance of a building gen-",Paragraph
erated by new building products rather than the essence of one. Neutra’s intentions,Paragraph
"here, however, went well beyond simple economics. He frequently acknowledged",Paragraph
"the influence and mentorship of Adolf Loos, who planted in Neutra a fascination",Paragraph
"with the simple products of American industrial culture. To Loos, the true",Paragraph
American art was the vernacular products of American industry that remained,Paragraph
uncorrupted by “designers” (the oak toilet seat was a particular Loos favorite.) This,Paragraph
"suggested a second model of the industrialized house, one that Neutra was partic-",Paragraph
"ularly fond of, not the house made from prototypical custom components but the",Paragraph
"house made from ready-made available objects, the house bought from the cata-",Paragraph
"logue and ordered over the phone. Harris said that Neutra saw Sweets Catalogue, the",Paragraph
"necessary instrument for such an activity, as his bible.®",Paragraph
The Question of Light,Title
"There are a variety of exceptions to this rigid system of standards, most conspic-",Paragraph
"uously the second floor living room, which became the focus of Neutra’s second",Paragraph
"obsession — light, reflection, transparency, and permeability. The structure and",Paragraph
facade follow the same basic module of the remainder of the house but there,Paragraph
are crucial additions and deletions. The casement windows of the typical module,Paragraph
"are gone, replaced by large, single sheets of polished plate glass. On its most simple",Paragraph
"level Neutra wished to expand the space both in fact and in perception, and to",Paragraph
"establish a connection to the “natural” environment beyond, particularly the lake.",Paragraph
In its most literal form this expression included folding glazed steel doors that erase,Paragraph
the boundary between living room and terrace. Other effects are more subtle and,Paragraph
virtual. The roof projects beyond the exterior wall and contains a continuous,Paragraph
recessed lighting strip so that at night more light comes in than goes out. This,Paragraph
"reverses the typical condition where, after sunset, glass walls become black mirrors",Paragraph
"to the interior space, and thus maintains the transparency of the interior/exterior",Paragraph
connection. From the exterior this is reversed. The light makes the glass reflective,Paragraph
"at night, increasing privacy. Thus the living room is more connected to the outside",Paragraph
by greater transparency but at the same time more removed because of the absence,Paragraph
"of direct, operable openings to the landscape. The living/family room of the",Paragraph
"ground floor apartment has a similar connection to nature, with sliding doors that",Paragraph
"open along more than half of the long wall surface to the adjacent courtyard, allow-",Paragraph
"ing for direct access and connection to the constructed, but natural landscape.",Paragraph
While the living room was about light it was about a great deal more. Neutra,Paragraph
"said of the room in 1962, “Providing light for reading the newspaper was not the",Paragraph
"primary purpose of this illumination. Rather I saw in it an emotive stimulant, chan-",Paragraph
ging endocrinal discharges and biochemistry.”” Neutra believed for most of his life,Paragraph
that the human response to architecture could be scientifically understood. Biore-,Paragraph
"alism was his own term for this study, and its underlying principle was that our",Paragraph
"response to the physical environment is based on genetic impulses, but overlaid",Paragraph
with a kind of prenatal conditioning. Neutra agreed with Freud that the house,Paragraph
"is the successor to the womb. Neutra had known Freud in Vienna, but the primary",Paragraph
"influence on Neutra’s thinking seems to have been Wilhelm Wundt, one of the",Paragraph
founders of experimental psychology.’ To Neutra the crucial stimuli of a response,Paragraph
"to architecture included sound, touch, even taste, and the crucial necessities were",Paragraph
"the connection to nature, the need for privacy within density, and the need for nat-",Paragraph
"ural light, and with it radiation. Neutra’s client, Philip Lovell, was a medical jour-",Paragraph
"nalist and an advocate of massive exposure to natural sunlight, and his focus on the",Paragraph
physiology of architecture certainly contributed to Neutra’s own ideas. Some of,Paragraph
Neutra’s design decisions that appear largely aesthetic were to him the product,Paragraph
"of scientific analysis. The large, transparent, operable surfaces established a connec-",Paragraph
tion between the body and nature — the lake and garden. The reflective surfaces of,Paragraph
"the glass, mirrors, and water altered perception, expanding small rooms in a dense",Paragraph
"urban environment; and the exterior soffit lighting, through reflection, rendered all",Paragraph
these transparent spaces private.,Paragraph
Neutra’s interest in light extended beyond the visible spectrum. The reflective,Paragraph
"qualities of one of the donated materials, a sandwich panel of plate glass and alu-",Paragraph
"minum, was used to form reflective spandrels and retain the heat generated by the",Paragraph
shower in the bathroom. At a time when the walls of a number of modernist build-,Paragraph
"ings were built of uninsulated solid masonry, Neutra was experimenting with",Paragraph
reflective insulation within the hollow walls of the VDL house. The active material,Paragraph
here was reflective foil. Since reflective surfaces greatly reduce heat transfer by,Paragraph
"radiation, a wall cavity lined on one face with a reflective surface will retard heat",Paragraph
"transfer, and thus heat loss, through radiation. Obviously at different times of the",Paragraph
year the heat may be moving in or out of the building. Neutra experimented with,Paragraph
various locations for the foil; on the north wall it is placed on the inside face of the,Paragraph
"exterior plaster, on the south wall on the inside face of the wall cavity, and in",Caption
another portion of the south wall it is placed on the inside face of the exterior layer,Caption
but the cavity is filled with Rockwool insulation.,Paragraph
Neutra’s concern with natural light and the transparency of the space may have,Paragraph
led to some ill-advised decisions. Both the Lovell house and the VDL house have the,Paragraph
"facades with maximum glazing facing west. In both houses this was the best view,",Paragraph
"and in both houses the living room is located on the second floor to accommodate it,",Paragraph
"but Neutra did little to ameliorate the large quantities of afternoon sun, which",Paragraph
"caused serious problems at Lovell. Gregory Ain, who worked for Neutra from",Paragraph
"1930 to 1935, said that the living room of the Lovell house was often uninhabitable",Paragraph
"for this reason. At the VDL house the overhanging roof gave some relief, but as the",Paragraph
"western sun is low, the roof’s helpfulness as a sunshade recedes in late summer after-",Paragraph
noons. Neutra argued that this problem was solved by “fast growing trees.”,Paragraph
Rebuilding from the Ashes,Title
"In 1963, while Neutra was away, most of the VDL house burned down to its foun-",Paragraph
"dations. The concrete substructure, basement, subfloor, and part of the guest wing",Caption
"survived, and the decision was made to rebuild it to the extents of the previous",Paragraph

"and implementation was handled by Neutra’s son, Dion. Neutra provided instruc-",Paragraph
"tions in the form of annotated tracing paper overlays to photographs of the original,",Paragraph
"but some design decisions were made by Dion, not all of them to Neutra’s liking.”!",Paragraph
"While the spatial layout is roughly the same as the old, its character was trans-",Paragraph
"formed, incorporating a number of changes that reflected the evolution of Neutra’s",Paragraph
thought. Those aspects of the house that were the manifestation of its “industria-,Paragraph
lized” character — prefabrication and standardization — are eliminated or subdued.,Paragraph
"Those that were the product of Neutra’s interest in biorealism — light, heat and the",Paragraph
physiology of architecture — are heightened or expanded.,Paragraph
"The most dramatic changes were to the most public facade, the west. The new",Paragraph
design is decidedly less modular and more varied in its divisions and composition. Its,Paragraph
“industrialized” structure became a faint background pattern. The rigid module of,Paragraph
4-foot column and casement window unit is simplified. Here the double casement,Paragraph
window modules were replaced by single panes of fixed glass. Neutra said this was,Paragraph
"because of increased noise on Silver Lake Boulevard, which it faced. Problems of",Paragraph
excess solar radiation were ameliorated with the addition of two-story louvers.,Caption
"More substantially, the nature and quantity of transparency, translucency, mutabil-",Paragraph
"ity, and reflective surfaces were greatly increased. Mirrors were added. Solid walls",Paragraph
were glazed. Shallow pools of water were placed on the all of the roofs. Reflective,Paragraph
glass appeared in certain locations. While all these elements created a highly dra-,Paragraph
"matic and photogenic imagery of transparent and reflective surfaces, Neutra again",Paragraph
"described these changes in scientific terms. The water on the roof, he explained,",Paragraph
acted to cool the house through evaporation and reestablish the connection to,Paragraph
"the lake beyond, the water’s edge having receded over the years. At least one author",Paragraph
has argued that the rebuilding transformed a highly original work of the 1930s into,Paragraph
"an accumulation of 1950s clichés — structural outriggers, suspended stairs, and",Paragraph
"reflective pools.” This is a bit unfair, as many of these elements, clichés or not, were",Paragraph
pioneered by Neutra in previous work. Reyner Banham thought the new house bet-,Paragraph

"density site plans in other projects, but the bulk of Los Angeles, which includes",Paragraph
"a great many Neutra houses, is obviously characterized by freestanding houses",Paragraph
"in the middle of suburban lots. Between 1948 and 1961 he designed a small,",Paragraph
"nine-house community in Silver Lake, the “Silver Lake Colony,” but at a lower",Paragraph
density than the VDL prototype implied. In the end he was absorbed by the system,Paragraph
he wanted to change.,Paragraph
Neutra’s Legacy,Title
"Neutra’s legacy as a technical innovator, like that of many modernists, falls outside",Paragraph
the mainstream of the evolution of the construction industry. It is perhaps because,Paragraph
of its impurity that the VDL construction system was far more often replicated than,Paragraph
"his steel prototypes, certainly in Neutra’s own work. While he experimented with",Paragraph
more radically alternative building systems — all-steel construction in real projects,Paragraph
"like the Beard and Von Sternberg houses, diatomaceous earth panels in theoretical",Paragraph
projects like the Diatom house — the VDL system became the standard Neutra res-,Paragraph
"idential building system, used in the Strathmore and Kelton apartments, the",Paragraph
"Brown, Kun, Barsha, and Hofmann houses, and even in portions of buildings like",Paragraph
"the Moore house of 1950, whose aesthetic seems far away from its 1933 predeces-",Paragraph
sor. It is replicated in spirit in some 1950s work by others. It is hard to imagine that,Paragraph
Craig Ellwood’s Broughton or Hale houses would have been built the way they,Paragraph
were if the VDL house had not come first. The “house ordered from a catalogue”,Paragraph
"saw its ultimate realization, at least in theory, in the Eames house. Writing late in",Paragraph
"his career, Neutra said that the industrialization of the housing industry had not",Paragraph
failed; it had never been tried.“,Paragraph
"The industrialization of building remains a topical issue, but the conventional",Paragraph
"wisdom as to its nature has precisely reversed itself since 1933, proclaiming that",Paragraph
the nature of digital fabrication and production is the absence of a need for rigid,Paragraph
"standardization. Contemporary industrialization, in theory, is rather about infinite",Paragraph
variety.,Paragraph
Neutra’s fascination with biorealism and the psychology of architecture would,Paragraph
"seem to anticipate current trends such as biophilia, particularly in its emphasis on",Paragraph
"the need for our connection to nature, but the basic premises differ. Biophilia empha-",Paragraph
sizes its origins in genetics. Neutra felt that those impulses acquired prenatally were of,Paragraph
equal importance. In any case it cannot be said that Neutra left behind a methodology,Paragraph
"for responding to psychological factors, but rather a style that was to its author a man-",Paragraph
"ifestation of that study, and it is that style, rather than the ideology that produced it,",Paragraph
that has become his enduring legacy. There is an image common to many of Neutra’s,Paragraph
"later houses, including the rebuilt VDL house; that of elemental planes of water inter-",Paragraph
secting planes of transparent or translucent glass and opaque surfaces of wood or,Paragraph
"plaster. Allinterpenetrate, overlap, and slide by one another, and a projecting piece of",Caption
structure usually confirms the absence of a visible barrier between interior and exte-,Paragraph
"rior, or at least confuses us as to its location. It was the photographer Julius Shulman",Paragraph
who codified this image and it is no accident that Neutra’s career as an architect is so,Paragraph
closely associated with Shulman’s career as an architectural photographer. The typical,Paragraph
Shulman photograph of the typical Neutra space has become a trademark for both.,Paragraph
"The legacy of the science of biorealism, strangely, is a set of aesthetic devices —",Paragraph
"extended structure, glass and water, reflection and transparency.",Paragraph
Critical opinion of the historical importance of VDL house has risen and fallen,Paragraph
"over time with Neutra’s own reputation. In 1946 Edgar Kaufmann, who had",Paragraph
"selected Frank Lloyd Wright to design Fallingwater, selected Neutra to design",Paragraph
"his house in Palm Springs. In 1949, Neutra was on the cover of Time magazine.",Paragraph
But by the time Reyner Banham wrote Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies,Paragraph
"in 1971, the year after Neutra’s death, his reputation had declined considerably.",Paragraph
"Banham described much of Neutra’s work, particularly the larger buildings, as",Paragraph
“good-average” and made it clear that he preferred the work of Neutra’s one time,Paragraph
"partner, Schindler.'” The absoluteness and clarity of Neutra’s ideas on industrial-",Paragraph
ization that had made him the man of the hour in the 1930s seemed a liability in,Paragraph
"Banham’s relativist, post-International Style, modernist world. But Neutra’s repu-",Paragraph
"tation slowly rebounded, and when in 1980 Neutra’s widow donated the VDL",Paragraph
"house to California State Polytechnic University at Pomona, the house began its",Paragraph

transformations occurring during this tumultuous era. Architect William Lescaze,Paragraph
"had been influenced by the rational expressionist strain of European modernism,",Paragraph
which he demonstrated in his designs for commercial interiors in New York imme-,Paragraph
diately prior to his work on PSFS. Howe had nurtured a late-blooming passion for,Paragraph
modern architecture. He had become interested in German modernism while,Paragraph
studying a classical approach to architecture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts from,Paragraph
1907 to 1912. In addition to bringing his enthusiasm for modern architecture to,Paragraph
"the project, Howe also provided the client. During his prior partnership with",Paragraph
"Arthur Mellor and Walter Meigs, in the firm Mellor, Meigs, and Howe, he designed",Paragraph
"four branch banks in the early 1920s for the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society,",Paragraph
whose president was James M. Willcox. When he terminated his partnership with,Paragraph
"Mellor and Meigs, Howe started his own practice and took with him one of the",Paragraph
"firm’s most substantial clients, the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society. His prior part-",Paragraph
"nership and professional connections, in addition to his refined American upbring-",Paragraph

clientele.,Paragraph
"When they came together as partners in 1929, both architects were struggling to",Paragraph
"define a “functional” modern architecture, informed by their individual experi-",Paragraph
"ences variously studying and practicing classicism, art deco, and expressionism.",Paragraph
"As partners, they believed that functionalism, a highly debated term from its incep-",Paragraph
"tion, was the basis of their common understanding of modern architecture. They",Paragraph
would describe the PSFS Building’s “functional”’ forms as “growing out of the,Paragraph
"requirements of our civilization and the modern technique of building...”* Indeed,",Paragraph
throughout the process the client had described the 33-story skyscraper as a collec-,Paragraph
"tion of distinct building programs, “Office, Bank & Store,” a description that even-",Paragraph
"tually would become a reality as the tall, rectilinear volume was devoted to rental",Paragraph
"offices and mechanical services, while the curved volume held the banking hall and",Paragraph
the store. The contrast between straight and curved forms was highlighted through,Paragraph
"different materials that sheathed the building’s forms and, in turn, its functions.",Paragraph
"The service core was clad in black brick, the bank and store — both commercial",Paragraph
"spaces — in polished granite, and the office tower in an envelope of brick spandrels",Paragraph
and piers clad in limestone and marble. The play of reflective and matte surfaces on,Paragraph
the exterior massing echoed that inside the banking hall. The material claddings did,Paragraph
"not simply express interior function, however, but instead added to the dynamism",Paragraph
of the volumes through surface effects.,Paragraph
The PSFS Building further demonstrated “functional” principles by creating,Paragraph
important links to the surrounding urban site. While the building’s modern expres-,Paragraph
"sion was strikingly unlike Philadelphia’s classically derived architecture, there were",Paragraph
aspects of the building design that accommodated the neighborhood. The ground,Paragraph
and underground levels of the PSFS Building allowed the city’s infrastructure to,Paragraph
"integrate with the architecture, as shopping and public transportation became part",Paragraph
"of the building. The neighborhood was a lively area, full of moderately priced retail",Paragraph
"outlets, with the Reading Railroad terminal across the street. As the building",Paragraph
"owner, Philadelphia Saving Fund Society leased store space located at the corner",Caption
"street level to its very first tenant, a women’s clothier called Lerner Shops, and this",Paragraph
blended easily into the retail street environment. An A & P grocery market was,Paragraph
another retail tenant in the building. Two underground levels accommodated a,Paragraph
connection to the Market Street subway stop and a stair to the subway concourse,Caption
was located on the street level between the banking hall and store entrance.,Paragraph
"Expressive of its functions, the PSFS Building was conspicuously modern, an",Paragraph
"example of which that was rarely seen in America at the time. Certainly, modern",Paragraph
architecture of a different evolution was prominent in Philadelphia’s buildings. In,Paragraph
"the first decades of the twentieth century, Philadelphia’s modern architecture was",Paragraph
exemplified by the pared-down classicism of the Philadelphia Art Museum and the,Paragraph
"City Beautiful movement, out of which the Benjamin Franklin Parkway had been",Paragraph
"created. The modern architecture of the PSFS Building, however, was based on",Paragraph
entirely different sources.,Paragraph
"In the pre-World War I period, both Howe and Lescaze were earnest students",Paragraph
of new developments in architecture. Repercussions of these early influences can,Paragraph
"be witnessed in Lescaze’s sketches for the base of the PSFS Building, which dis-",Paragraph
played the dynamism and exuberance that had only been seen in works by J.J. P.,Paragraph
"Oud, such as Hoek van Holland (1924-27) and Erich Mendelsohn’s buildings of",Paragraph
"the Tageblatt Headquarters, known as Mossehaus, in Berlin (1921-23) and the",Paragraph
Schocken department store in Stuttgart (1926-28). Oud’s poetic and Mendel-,Paragraph
sohn’s dynamic functionalism can both be read in the PSFS Building.” Lescaze,Paragraph
"had studied J. J. P. Oud’s building, as one of the projects included in his proposed",Paragraph
book comparing European and American modern architecture suggests. He,Paragraph
believed that Oud’s Hoek van Holland housing for workers was a model for,Paragraph
"European modern architecture. Like the PSFS Building, Oud’s scheme was",Paragraph
"designed for multiple uses. It contained 41 dwellings, four shops, four ware-",Paragraph
"houses, and a public library. Both buildings were designed as self-contained com-",Paragraph

of linear rows of houses and his curved plate glass facades undoubtedly influ-,Paragraph
"enced Lescaze’s curved ground floor storefront, which prominently displayed",Paragraph
"retail merchandise through a large, continuous glass window at the PSFS Build-",Paragraph
"ing. For Oud as well as for Lescaze, the curved element was seen as a symbol of",Paragraph
"the modern machine, emulating its circular movements.",Paragraph
"Lescaze had also visited Berlin, at least twice in the 1920s, once in 1922-23 and",Paragraph
"again in 1926. Though not documented in Lescaze’s archive, it is highly likely that",Paragraph
"he saw first-hand the strikingly modern renovation of the Mossehaus, the most",Paragraph
prominent feature in Berlin during those particular years. The emphasis on,Paragraph
curved horizontality in Mossehaus’ corner facade is unmistakably similar to,Paragraph
Lescaze’s sketch and the subsequent design of PSFS’s corner banking hall,Paragraph
facade. Mendelsohn believed that horizontality best expressed the modern con-,Paragraph
"struction of reinforced concrete, as well as the velocity of modern urban street",Paragraph
"life. Furthermore, for Mendelsohn horizontality would provide a much-needed",Paragraph
stabilizing force that would alleviate the stress of modern life. And on an expe-,Paragraph
"riential level, the blurring of verticals and the extension of horizontals reflected",Paragraph
the way automobile passengers traveling at high speeds perceived buildings as,Paragraph
they drove past.*,Paragraph
"Echoing Mendelsohn’s Mossehaus, the bold 1929 rendering by Lescaze showed",Paragraph
a similar horizontally curving facade and windows. The sketch dramatizes the play,Paragraph
"of receding surfaces, one recessed at the street level and another implied by a dark",Paragraph
"shadow at the second story banking hall level. In addition, Mossehaus’ appearance,",Paragraph
"prominent location, and publicity-minded patron also made it similar to the PSFS",Paragraph
"Building. Like the individualistic modernism of Oud and Mendelsohn, the",Paragraph
PSFS Building design would take shape from the dynamic sketches of one of its,Paragraph
designers.,Paragraph
Business,Title
It was just this kind of architectural individualism that translated well into the,Paragraph
"business culture of PSFS’s clients. Throughout the design process, James Willcox",Paragraph
and the PSFS Building Committee judged its architecture by how it would dis-,Paragraph
tinguish itself through its functional characteristics and its aesthetic appearance,Paragraph
"and, specifically, how these attributes would affect their business. While the",Paragraph
"Building Committee did not have a particular aesthetic in mind, its criterion",Paragraph
for the architecture was that it be a sound business investment. Upon seeing,Paragraph
"Howe and Lescaze’s proposed modern design, one consulting rental agent stated,",Paragraph
"“the architecture, while novel, is striking and mod ern,”” while another one noted:",Paragraph
"“Opinions will undoubtedly vary regarding its architecture, but the building is",Paragraph
sure to be talked about.”!° J. M. Willcox was ultimately concerned with how,Paragraph
his new building would bolster the saving fund’s larger business strategy to create,Paragraph
"a competitive advantage. Originality, or the quality of being remarkable, served",Paragraph
as an advertising strategy and was ultimately one of the aspects that convinced,Paragraph
Willcox to accept the modern design.,Paragraph
"But even in 1930, during the design process, the Building Committee was still",Paragraph
not convinced of the modern design. It also had been presented with a more tra-,Paragraph
"ditional, Beaux-Arts scheme, in 1926, designed by Howe’s former practice, Mellor,",Paragraph
"Meigs, and Howe. This caused Howe to write a letter on July 30, 1930 to his client,",Paragraph
"Willcox, in which he argued for his modern design in bankers’ language. In pecu-",Paragraph
"niary terms, Howe compared the modern and traditional schemes by their cost",Paragraph
effectiveness. He presented a graph that showed the gross area and cost saving that,Paragraph
the society would gain by building the modern scheme instead of the traditional,Paragraph
"one. While the modern scheme would cost more, the society would get more",Paragraph
"for its money. “In other words, for $930,000 or about 20% more than the cost",Paragraph
"of the 1926 building, your institution obtains more than 200,000 square feet or over",Paragraph
"60% additional floor area. Furthermore, the 1930 building is more completely",Paragraph
"equipped mechanically than the 1926 building.”'’ Here, Howe used business",Paragraph
criteria (price per square foot) to cast modern architecture as a good business,Paragraph
investment.,Paragraph
The discussion over the design’s “modernism” also continued as the client,Paragraph
worried that it might not appeal to potential tenants. Because modern architecture,Paragraph
"was predominately linked to industrial rather than commercial buildings, Willcox",Paragraph
"informed Howe that, “We must recognize the fact that there is something in your",Paragraph
design which requires explanation. The first impulse of everyone I have shown it to,Paragraph
"is [to turn] away from it.”’? Yet Willcox was open-minded about modern design, as",Paragraph
long as it would help his profits. “I don’t think that there is anything in your design,Paragraph
which would decide a prospective tenant against taking space in the building if the,Paragraph
matter were properly presented. It is impossible to take the architect along every,Paragraph
time a prospect is to be interviewed.”'* Willcox thought through the myriad of,Paragraph
possibilities and conclusions that would color his decision-making and finally con-,Paragraph
"cluded, “On the other hand, its uniqueness — at least in Philadelphia — gives it an",Paragraph
"advertising value that is worth something.”""4 Here, architecture served as adver-",Paragraph
"tisement, giving the city a brand identity and an architectural image of the Phila-",Paragraph
delphia Saving Fund Society. Willcox’s assessment would come true: there was no,Paragraph
"other comparable architecture in height, size, or expression. Strikingly unlike its",Paragraph
"urban context of commercial buildings in the early 1930s, the PSFS Building would",Paragraph
define modern architecture in Philadelphia.’”,Paragraph
Advertising,Title
The modernity of an electric sign for the PSFS Building was foundational for the,Paragraph
"design. The idea for such a sign was raised by the client himself, and in a letter to",Paragraph
"Willcox on May 26, 1930, Howe noted, “You are aware that ever since you first",Paragraph
asked me to design a branch bank around an electric sign I have been looking,Paragraph
for a means of architectural expression which would not be in conflict with any,Paragraph
form of modern activity outside the field of architecture.”’* If the idea for the elec-,Paragraph
"tric sign originated with Willcox, Howe viewed the suggestion as an opportunity to",Paragraph
design a modern building. The awkwardness of the electric sign designs on the,Paragraph
1926 branch banks showed that a modern direction for placing advertising on,Paragraph
"the PSFS bank was needed. Here, lettering was permissible as modern ornament",Paragraph
because it possessed “functional purpose in advertising and in indicating the use o:,Paragraph
"different parts of a building.”’” In fact, in The International Style: Architecture Since",Paragraph
"1922, Hitchcock and Johnson stated, “Lettering is the nearest approach to arbitrary",Paragraph
ornament used by the architects of the international style.”!* The development o,Paragraph
"the red neon P § F S$ sign has been largely overlooked, with the exception of David",Paragraph
Leatherbarrow’s insightful discussion of the urban implications of the sign.’*,Paragraph
"The sign had many variations between July 1930 and the summer of 1932, when",Paragraph
it was finally constructed. The architects and clients grappled with three aspects o,Paragraph
"the sign design. First, whether the Society’s whole name or its abbreviation should",Paragraph
"be used. Second, whether the sign would be mounted on the side of the building",Paragraph
"or on top. Third, whether the sign’s orientation would be north, south or east.",Paragraph
These details occupied the architects and clients throughout the design process,Paragraph
and were not mere minutiae; for these decisions signaled modernity on many,Paragraph
levels.,Paragraph
Legibility became an important deciding factor as the architects and clients chose,Paragraph
between displaying the whole name versus the initials. The discussion highlighted,Paragraph
the sign’s function as a medium for mass advertising. Publicity was at the forefront,Paragraph
in the minds of the clients and the use of initials was not only a matter of legibility; it,Paragraph
also signaled the modernization of the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society as a com-,Paragraph
"pany, recasting its image and establishing a visual standard. The wish to modernize",Paragraph
"was contested by the Society’s hesitation to fully to embrace a modern image, as",Paragraph
the oldest savings fund in America was just starting to grow into a modern business,Paragraph
through the diversification of real-estate ventures and expansion through branch,Paragraph
banks. These difficulties to wholeheartedly accepting modernity was not surprising,Paragraph
at a time when modern life in America was itself still in transition.,Paragraph
Advertising value figured largely in the decision to use initials for the sign and to,Paragraph
"orient it toward the north-east transportation corridor. Earle Bolton, staff architect",Caption
"for Howe and Lescaze, who attended most of the design meetings, reported the",Paragraph
clients’ desire for advertising value as the reason they eventually approved the initi-,Paragraph
"als for the sign.”° One of the vice-presidents of the construction company, Fuller",Paragraph
"and Company, asked Willcox if he had ever seen a large electric sign reading",Paragraph
“PON” visible from the Pennsylvania Railroad as one came into Newark. Willcox,Paragraph
"had noticed the sign, which led him to inquire for what the initials stood for. The",Paragraph
Fuller and Company vice-president voiced his enthusiasm for using initials: “Let’s,Paragraph
"make everyone curious about PSFS.””""",Paragraph
"At a special roof sign meeting in late April 1932, full-scaled letter samples were",Paragraph
viewed: one at the size of the PSFS initial design and another at the size for the full-,Paragraph
name version. A hotel room at a high floor was rented several miles away to judge,Paragraph
"visibility of the letters atop the actual, nearly finished PSFS Building. A single letter",Paragraph
"S was first hoisted into place. Its simple sans serif typeface with an 18-inch stroke,",Paragraph
"proved extremely legible. However, the full name size was constructed at a dimen-",Paragraph
sioned stroke that was considered illegible. The legible initials version was clearly,Paragraph
preferable: “great size ... takes less concentration to assimilate.””” By late spring of,Paragraph
"1932, the final sign design would show the PSES initials.",Paragraph
"While the architect’s first sign design depicted it on top of the building, it was",Paragraph
followed by a number of studies that took advantage of the blank south facade that,Paragraph
covered the elevators and service equipment. PSFS’s sign design on the facade,Caption
reflected commercial signage practices of the time. By the 1910s and 1920s in Amer-,Paragraph
"ica, billposting on building facades had become a prevalent way of advertising. At",Paragraph
"the same time, there was also influence from a more rarified source. Both George",Paragraph
"Howe and William Lescaze visited the 1925 Exposition des arts décoratifs in Paris,",Paragraph
and had seen Le Corbusier's Pavilion de Esprit Nouveau.’ The abbreviated letters,Paragraph
“E N” composed an emblazoned sign on the entrance facade. Le Corbusier's sign,Caption
not only reinforced the custom of billposting but also the use of abbreviation.,Paragraph
"Despite these illuminating studies, the sign was finally positioned, not on the side",Paragraph
"of the building, but on top of it— an example of skyline lettering. One precedent for",Paragraph
the PSFS sign position was the Van Nelle Factory in Rotterdam by J. A. Brinkman,Paragraph
"and L. C. van der Vlugt, built between 1925 and 1931, which also used sans serif",Paragraph
lettering. The two buildings shared many similarities as modern architecture for,Paragraph
"business clients, including angling of the sign toward key sight lines, and function-",Paragraph

The sign atop the building also coincided with a decision to provide air condi-,Paragraph

the business savvy client that office space would be infinitely more desirable if,Paragraph
“manufactured air” (air conditioning) were installed throughout the entire office,Paragraph

and the sign would hide the gigantic cooling towers of the air conditioning. This,Paragraph

"stood not simply as a display for a name, but as more conventional outdoor",Paragraph

"ever, in a variation of seven schemes presented on November 1930, the architects",Paragraph

The extensive property the Kaufmanns owned in the southwestern corner of,Paragraph
"Pennsylvania follows the winding and precipitous course ofa mountain stream, Bear",Paragraph
"Run, which works its way down through the sandstone cliffs of an old glacial ravine,",Paragraph
"falling nearly 1,500 feet in four miles before emptying into the Youghiogheny River.",Paragraph
"About halfa mile before it reaches the river, it drops in a series of dramatic falls over",Paragraph
large boulders strewn in its bed. This is the place Edgar Kaufmann had in mind for,Paragraph
"the house, and it is where he took his architect near the end of 1934. According to",Paragraph
"reports, he had thought Wright would site the structure on the flat, lower bank of the",Paragraph
"stream, facing the waterfalls. To his client’s surprise, and later consternation, Wright",Paragraph
decided to locate the house over the water by cantilevering it from the opposite cliff,Paragraph
and balancing the structure on the existing boulders in the streambed. Wright wrote,Paragraph
"to Kaufmann in late December, immediately after returning home, that “the visit to",Paragraph
the waterfall in the woods stays with me and a domicile has taken vague shape in my,Paragraph
mind to the music of the stream.”” He later described his idea for the design as “an,Paragraph
"extension of the cliff beside a mountain stream.” More importantly, he explained",Paragraph
that the house was conceived for someone “who liked to listen to the waterfall”,Paragraph
and for this reason was designed as a “living space over and above the stream.”*,Paragraph
Fallingwater’s design combines a seemingly accidental naturalness with a subtle,Paragraph
"though no less powerful geometric order and structural logic, all characteristic of",Paragraph
the architect’s work since the 1911 design of his own country estate of Taliesin in,Paragraph
"Wyoming Township, Wisconsin, but never before resolved in such a dramatic",Paragraph
way. A binary opposition of stone and concrete expresses the conjunction on a,Paragraph
"basic, material level. The stone, quarried less than 500 feet from the actual site,",Paragraph
"was reserved for all vertical, load-bearing piers and walls; reinforced concrete",Paragraph
"was used to create the stack of horizontal balconies, or trays, cantilevered from",Paragraph
"the rock ledge over the bed of the stream.” Bounded by curved parapets, the trays",Paragraph
weave through the vertical stone structure to provide the house’s living spaces.,Paragraph
"These are continuous inside and out. Where one tray overlaps another, doors",Paragraph
and windows of plate glass in steel sash are inserted to mark the distinction,Paragraph
between interior room and outdoor terrace. The lowest tray forms the main floor,Caption
"of the house and contains a single open space combining the functions of living,",Paragraph
"dining, reception, and library. The middle tray, with its main terrace forming",Paragraph
"the roof of the living room, contains the two master bedrooms plus a smaller guest",Paragraph
"room, each with its adjacent terrace. The top tray, roofing over the second-floor",Paragraph
bedrooms and forming an aerie within the overarching branches of the tall oak,Paragraph
"trees, became the bedroom suite of Edgar jr?",Paragraph
The site on the north bank of Bear Run is a narrow shelf making an almost,Paragraph
perfect 30°/60° triangle defined by a group of large boulders that follow the line,Paragraph
of the ledge determining the upper of the two falls. The nearly 15-foot cantilever,Paragraph
"of the living-room floor is partly supported by three “bolsters,” as Wright called",Paragraph
"them, that angle up from the rock ledge. The even greater cantilever of the sec-",Paragraph
ond-floor terrace is partly supported by the two free-standing piers in the living,Caption
"room; the weight of the enclosed section of the second floor, along with that of",Paragraph
the entire upper story (all of which is contained within the angle of the chimney,Paragraph
"mass and the north wall of the house), serves to counterbalance the effect of the",Paragraph
"cantilever. Visually, the composition is stabilized by the trellis of reinforced-",Paragraph
concrete beams that continues the slab of the second-floor tray through the rear,Paragraph
wall of the house and ties the floating layers of living space into the face of the,Paragraph
"cliff. As a result, the tunnel-like driveway beneath becomes a fully integrated part",Paragraph
of the design.,Paragraph
The orthogonal geometry adopted for the plan contrasts with the triangular,Paragraph
shape of the shelf on which the house is superposed. The interaction of the two,Paragraph
geometries is reflected in the pivoting of the plan and the resulting diagonal axes,Paragraph
"that govern its spatial form. The east-west path of the existing road, which was",Paragraph
"reused as the driveway, served as the datum line from which Wright angled the",Paragraph
house in a southeasterly direction so that the leading edge of the cantilevered trays,Paragraph
would parallel the course of the stream beneath them and the diagonal axis defined,Paragraph
by that line would become the axis of the house’s main space. As “an extension of,Paragraph
"the cliffbeside a mountain stream,” the house swings with the glen to align with the",Paragraph
"stream, thus incorporating within its space the direction and sense of motion of the",Paragraph
"body of water it overhangs. Within the space of the house, the dynamic quality of",Paragraph
this representation is perceived kinesthetically as an experience of virtual,Paragraph
movement.,Paragraph
The spatial definition of the interior of Fallingwater depends on lines generated,Paragraph
"by implied diagonal axes. The main floor, entered at ground level, is approximately",Paragraph
"48 feet deep by 38 feet wide. Its flexible, open plan is loosely organized around a",Paragraph
"central atrium-like space, illuminated from above by a large, nearly square,",Paragraph

"area of the study, or library. Projecting between the two piers at the far side of the",Caption

"overlooking the stream. And just to the left of the fireplace is another built-in seat,",Paragraph
"under the window, forming a more cozy sitting area next to the fire. To the right of",Paragraph
the fireplace and set back into the rear stone wall of the house is the dining area. On,Paragraph

upper-floor bedrooms.,Paragraph
"The materials used inside are the same as those outside, an identity that is rein-",Paragraph
forced in two key places by the actual intrusion of an element from outside. The,Paragraph
"walls and piers are stone; the ceiling, forming the underside of the upper slab, is",Paragraph
"plastered and painted the same color as the parapets. The main, living-room floor is",Paragraph
"covered in flagstones, similar in color and texture to the stones in the bed of the",Paragraph

"was created nearer to the road, the architect insisted on retaining the hatch and",Paragraph
"stairs, admitting the originally intended use was perhaps only a pretext: “We",Paragraph
got down into the glen to associate directly with the stream and planned the house,Paragraph

"each reveals, within the space of the living room, the direct association of the house",Paragraph
"with its site. Taken together, as they were meant to be, they describe a cross-axial",Paragraph
diagonal line that traces the underlying geometric relation between building,Paragraph
and site.,Paragraph
"The most dramatic, memorable, and well-known image of Fallingwater is the",Paragraph
"view from the southwest, just below the first falls, where the house seems to rise",Paragraph
from the stream and float effortlessly over it. It is the view Wright chose for the,Paragraph
perspective he drew for Kaufmann as most fully representing the total effect of the,Paragraph
"house in its site, as well as the one most often reproduced in photographs.” But, as",Paragraph
"a representative image, it can be very deceptive, because this view does not actually",Paragraph

Fallingwater as an Experience in Time and of Time,Title
Fallingwater is approached from a bridge that crosses the stream just above the two,Paragraph
falls. From it one can hear the sound of the falls but cannot see them. One senses a,Paragraph
"drop-off beyond the house, but only the height of the trees and the depth of the sky",Paragraph
"suggest this. The bridge abutments, which are constructed of the same thin ledges",Paragraph
"of quarried stone as the house, blend into the stratified, natural stone walls of the",Paragraph
"stream. Joining the house’s lower walls on the downstream side, they form a seam-",Paragraph
"less transition between architecture and nature. The concrete span of the bridge, on",Paragraph
"the other hand, is like the cantilevered trays of the house. Its softly rounded para-",Paragraph
"pets effect a fluid connection between the stone piers of the banks, suggesting an",Paragraph
allusion to moving water. This dual reference was pointed out by the architectural,Paragraph
critic Lewis Mumford shortly after the house was completed. “The stones repre-,Paragraph
"sent, as it were, the earth theme,” he wrote, “the concrete slabs are the water",Paragraph
theme.”,Paragraph
"Beyond the bridge, the drive bends around the rear of the house and cuts",Paragraph
"between it and the cliff, The horizontal lines of the building’s stone walls, which",Paragraph
"are extended left and right into space by concrete beams and slabs, echo the strata",Paragraph
"of stone ledges in the walls of the glen, while the rippling effect of the cliff is picked",Paragraph
up by the staggered vertical slots in the house’s rear wall. The passageway under-,Paragraph
neath the transverse beams that tie the house back into the cliff gives the impres-,Paragraph
sion of a natural cut shaded by an arbor-like trellis. Water can be seen seeping out,Paragraph
"of the cliff face on the right. It also streams from a spout, in the pier next to the",Paragraph
"entrance, into a small basin that functioned as a footbath. As you pass between",Paragraph
"the stone walls of the loggia into the deep recess of the entry area, you hear the",Paragraph
water and feel its moisture. The transition from outside to inside is so orchestrated,Paragraph
as to seem like a gradual change in atmosphere rather than a change of place.,Paragraph
The gray-blue flagstone paving of the bridge and loggia continues into the house,Paragraph
to become the living-room floor. The only difference is that the flagstones inside,Paragraph
"are waxed and polished to give them a shiny, reflective appearance. This causes the",Paragraph
"eye to skim the surface quickly, following the line of the diagonal axis across the",Paragraph
"room toward the light at the far side, which comes through the band of windows",Paragraph
and doors opening onto a terrace projecting over the ravine. The shiny surface of,Paragraph
the flagstone floor has a slippery look and feel that suggest the instability of the,Paragraph
moving water underfoot.'*,Paragraph
The reference to the stream below the floor is not merely metaphorical. It is,Paragraph
made real by the living rock of the boulder projecting through the floor as the fire-,Paragraph
place hearth and by the hatch that opens to reveal not only a view of the stream but,Paragraph
"also the sound, smell, and moisture of the water rushing over the stream’s stone",Paragraph
"bed. The visible water’s reflective surface reads as continuous in color, texture, and",Paragraph
"substance with the waxed flagstone floor. The cool, damp air coming off the stream",Paragraph
"is funneled through the hatch, while the steady burble resonates in the external",Paragraph
"concrete wall of the chamber, which echoes, in its curve, the semi-cylindrical hol-",Paragraph
low of the fireplace.,Paragraph
The stream is brought into direct apposition with the living-room floor along the,Paragraph
"room’s main diagonal axis, which, as already noted, parallels the ledge of the falls.",Paragraph
The polished flagstones reconstitute its rocky bed. Their uneven surface reflects the,Paragraph
constantly changing light that filters into the room through the trees. The irregular,Paragraph
outline of their raised joints recreates the stream’s swirling movement as it rounds,Paragraph
the bend before meeting the ledge. The connection to the stream is not a disem-,Paragraph
"bodied, optical one. It is felt underfoot, through the body, and through all the",Paragraph
senses. The waxed floor imparts a sense of fluid motion to the body and suggests,Paragraph
the suspended animation of the drop of the waterfall from one level to the next.,Paragraph
Walking across the imaginary line connecting the projecting stone of the hearth to,Paragraph
"the opening of the hatch, one is made aware of the changes in level that determine",Paragraph
"the direction and flow of the water, and is thus subliminally induced to project",Paragraph
one’s thoughts beyond the space of the room. As the floor continues through,Paragraph
"the plate-glass doors onto the southwest terrace, the dark flagstone plane turns",Paragraph
"up into a rounded concrete parapet. In its light, airborne mass, this shape echoes",Paragraph
"the color, texture, and trajectory of the cascade of white foam spilling over the rock",Paragraph
ledge just below it. One is left to imagine that the virtual pressure of water welling,Paragraph
up in the terrace is released in the overflow of the cantilever.,Paragraph
This returns us to Mumford’s perception of the concrete slabs and parapets as,Paragraph
"representing the “water theme,” a perception that should be taken all the more",Paragraph
seriously given the critic’s acute understanding of Wright’s work and close per-,Paragraph
"sonal relationship with him at the time. All the stone in the house, except for",Paragraph
"the thin, waxed flagstones of the living-room floor, is treated as an inert, static",Paragraph
"material, acting in compression — the “earth theme,” as Mumford noted. In vivid",Paragraph
"contrast, the concrete is treated as fluid and dynamic, acting in tension. While the",Paragraph
deeply raked and randomly laid stone literally reproduces the eroded appearance of,Paragraph
"the rear cliff face, the two terraces cantilevered over the falls, being broader in scale",Paragraph
"and smoother in treatment than the stone walls, at first appear to echo the large",Paragraph
boulders in the streambed. But that is only an initial and partial impression. Their,Paragraph
"rounded, fluid contours and light, insubstantial surfaces relate more to water than",Paragraph
"to stone — not to a thin film of water as in the waxed flagstones, but to water aerated",Paragraph
and transformed into foam. The different directions in which these two main can-,Paragraph
tilevered terraces point correspond almost exactly with the relative disposition of,Paragraph
the two falls beneath them. Appearing to spill out from the stone masses to either,Paragraph
"side of them like the falls between the banks of the stream, the two seemingly air-",Paragraph
borne trays effect changes in level that echo those in the stream. In its representa-,Paragraph
"tion of the falling water, the house itself thus becomes a natural step in the descent",Paragraph
of Bear Run to the river.,Paragraph
"Wright intended Fallingwater to represent nature in flux, to suggest the",Paragraph
phenomenon of change over time. The architect’s decision to site the house,Paragraph
over the waterfall rather than facing it was critical and determined everything,Paragraph
"about the perception and meaning of the house. It meant that the house, “designed",Paragraph
"to the music of the stream” for “one who liked to listen to the waterfall,” would",Paragraph
"offer an aural rather than a primarily visual experience of the falling water, an expe-",Paragraph
"rience that, by its very nature, would be more time-consuming than instantaneous.",Paragraph
Wright privileged the aural over the visual and thereby gave precedence to the,Paragraph
continual over the momentary. Hearing takes time and gives to time a depth that,Paragraph
"vision lacks. Where looking focuses on that which is present to the eye, listening",Paragraph
relies on expectation and is amplified through deferral. Hearing also blurs bound-,Paragraph
"aries and distinctions and renders them fluid in contrast to vision, which specifies,",Paragraph
"clarifies, and reduces the flux of nature to discrete, controllable, knowable entities.",Paragraph
It is thus not by chance but rather by design that the visitor to Fallingwater readily,Paragraph
conflates the concrete with water and the living-room floor with the streambed,Paragraph
"beneath, just as it is by design that the view of the waterfalls is deferred until",Paragraph
one leaves the house to reflect back on it.,Paragraph
In the end it is the prolonged timeframe of listening and hearing that is the most,Paragraph
unusual and meaningful aspect of one’s experience of Fallingwater. The sound of,Paragraph
the rushing water and falls becomes perceptible as soon as one reaches the bridge,Paragraph
leading to the house. It does not stop when one enters the house. It underscores the,Paragraph
waxed flagstones of the floor to cause the element of moving water to pervade the,Paragraph
space of the living room. The echo chamber-like semicircular backing of the hatch,Paragraph
amplifies the sound as it makes it literally part of the room.’’ Hearing the water,Paragraph
constantly rushing underneath extends the kinesthetic experience of the con-,Paragraph
structed interior space into a temporal dimension that includes the entire physical,Paragraph
"environment of which that space is a part. Through hearing, one imagines what",Paragraph
"one might see, and it is this that gives Fallingwater a valence beyond the momen-",Paragraph
"tary and the purely visual. Inside the space of the room, one already senses the",Paragraph
"continuous and unending cycle of nature — of growth, movement, and change —",Paragraph
that the view of the house from below the falls ultimately confirms in the retro-,Paragraph
spective view it affords of the house’s place in the overall environment of Bear Run.,Paragraph
"As an integral part of its natural environment, Fallingwater appears as mutable as",Paragraph
the landscape. It registers its effects and continually changes with the seasons. In the,Paragraph
"fall, the autumn leaves bring out a burnished quality in the originally light ochre",Paragraph
"color of the painted concrete, while the falls slowly diminish to a mere trickle as",Paragraph
"winter comes along. In winter, when the ice takes over, the house itself seems to",Paragraph
"become frozen in time, only to return to life, with a vengeance, with the early",Paragraph
spring rains. Such an engagement on the part of architecture with the elements,Paragraph
"of nature is extraordinary and sets Fallingwater apart. To animate, activate, and",Paragraph
"give life to buildings, architects have often used water in the form of fountains.",Paragraph
"But while the water itself may be natural, the shape and movement imparted to",Paragraph
it are artificial and controlled. The liveliness is merely an illusion. More to the,Paragraph
"point, the illusion, like that of a play, only lasts for a limited amount of time. Even-",Paragraph
"tually, the fountain is turned off and all becomes static once again. As in the theater,",Paragraph
"when the play ends and the lights come back on, the audience is made aware of the",Paragraph
"gulf between art and reality — which is to say, art and life.",Paragraph
"The extraordinary thing about Fallingwater is that the illusion, the spectacle, the",Paragraph
"movement of water never stops. This may sound simplistic, but it is profound. Once",Paragraph
"it gets dark, and especially after the lights in the house have been turned off, one",Paragraph
naturally expects the falls to be turned off as well — but they cannot be. Fallingwater,Paragraph
is continuous with the stream and waterfalls that preceded it and with the entire nat-,Paragraph
ural system that has grown up around them and takes its life from them. The expe-,Paragraph
rience of the house is an experience of time as duration. Wright liked to say that in his,Paragraph

"never. This finally is what gives the building its magic, its uniqueness, and its lasting",Paragraph

The Danteum is one of the most enigmatic projects by one of the most enigmatic,Paragraph

"17.5 x 5.4 meters and weighing 16 tons with fixed rows of chairs, would slip aside",Paragraph

opened for ventilation. The mechanical maneuvers for changing this setting,Paragraph
would take about 45 minutes altogether. The third movable or mechanical fea-,Paragraph
"ture was a suspended wall system, which could close off part of the community",Paragraph
hall from the surrounding galleries and thereby provide an enclosed space for,Paragraph
the film theatre. This modular wall system comprised a total of 60 panes.,Paragraph
The panes measured approximately 1 x 7 meters and were made of thin metal,Paragraph
frames clad with sheet metal at the bottom (up to 2 meters). Above they were,Paragraph
covered with stretched raphan fabric and filled with mineral wool for acoustical,Paragraph

"about efficiency, lightweight structures, and prefabricated systems based on kits",Paragraph

It is evident that Prouvé’s commitment to evolve architectural form both from,Paragraph
systems of fabrication and from the expression of construction principles placed,Paragraph
him in a structural-_rationalist linage running back to Viollet-le-Duc. In Viollet-,Paragraph
"le-Due’s lecture XIII, concerning “The Construction of Buildings,” Viollet offered",Paragraph
the following proclamation (referring to the use of cast iron in construction):,Paragraph
“Forms proper to the nature of the materials employed may not have been discov-,Paragraph

desirable to begin. For in architecture a true and rational form reveals itself only,Paragraph
after a series of efforts and trials methodically conducted.””’,Paragraph
"Furthermore, Prouvé had an artisanal side to his work, which he obviously had",Paragraph
inherited from growing up in an art environment influenced by the ideas of art,Paragraph

an illustration. Although the awnings were conceived as functional and rational,Paragraph

An Ethical Dilemma,Title
"In this context, Mairea, a private country villa for a wealthy art patron and a captain",Paragraph
of industry seems an unusual development for architects whose foundation as,Paragraph
"modernists was substantially influenced, less than a decade earlier, by the practical",Paragraph
difficulties of the Minimum House.’* The Aaltos addressed this ethical dilemma in,Paragraph
their description of the project where they advanced the thought that the villa,Paragraph
could be conceived as an opportunity for experiment and innovation.” In this,Paragraph
"sense, any architectural assignment: a house, hospital, library, factory — could pro-",Paragraph
vide an opportunity for discoveries that had general implications for architecture,Paragraph
beyond the specifics of a particular program. The Aaltos explained: “The individual,Paragraph
"architectural assignment can be treated as a laboratory experiment of sorts, in",Paragraph
which things can be done that would be impossible with present-day mass produc-,Paragraph
tion and those experiments can spread further and eventually become available to,Paragraph
one and all as production methods advance.””? Alvar Aalto elaborated on the idea,Paragraph
of a luxury villa as an experimental laboratory in a lecture at Yale University on,Paragraph
"May 9, 1939: “[W]e may use the house as a laboratory to tackle some of the central",Paragraph
problems in architecture today ... [YJou use this house to work out those things,Paragraph
"especially, and the solutions you discover in this building can later be applied in",Paragraph
connection with larger buildings and under different conditions. ...””*,Paragraph
The utopian idea that technological progress would give designers and manu-,Paragraph
"facturers the capacity to bring good, high-quality, mass-produced objects to the",Paragraph
"general public had already been realized in the Aaltos’ domestic objects — furniture,",Paragraph
23 It,Title

Expanding the Concept of Rationalism,Title
But Alvar Aalto was struggling with modernism’s orthodox formalism and had,Paragraph
"largely withdrawn from the idea that an objective approach, driven by science,",Paragraph
"technology, and the logic of construction, would inevitably resolve the fundamen-",Paragraph
tally human purpose at the core of architecture.” He did not dismiss the idea of,Paragraph
highly analytical working methods; he simply believed that the architecture of the,Paragraph
"time, as it developed in the direction of “functional and constructive necessity,” and",Paragraph

"Hence, experiments carried out in the villa were not in the areas of standardized",Paragraph
"construction or technical innovation but rather primarily in the realms of character,",Paragraph
"identity, and milieu. In particular, their focus was the distinctiveness of the epoch,",Paragraph
"the specificity of the place, and a fitting domestic atmosphere for a modern family.",Paragraph
"Apart from the Aaltos’ own industrially manufactured furnishings, the relationship",Paragraph
between the art of building and technological production was typically down-,Paragraph

Masterful Coherence,Title

Orchestrating Time and Perception,Title
The choreography of the architectural encounter with the villa is distinguished,Paragraph
"by tempo, by the gradual unfolding of a relaxed domestic atmosphere.” The",Paragraph

"the calming effect of the leisurely approach remains, prolonging the subtle awak-",Paragraph

"While the villa is now in the foreground, it continues to be inseparable from",Paragraph
the presence of the forest and its profound quietude — a theme Aalto will,Paragraph
continues to reinforce throughout the villa.,Paragraph
"In the approach, there is then no long view; no place to distantly analyze the",Paragraph
"villa. Not only is the forest drawn close, but also the villa itself is presented, for",Paragraph
"the first time, from a relatively short distance, prompting a visceral response.”**",Paragraph
Contrasting dark wooden features are visually balanced yet set in sharp contrast,Paragraph

"nity. While the dark wood and light stucco are visibly balanced, the wood features",Paragraph
"dominate one’s inward experience of the villa, drawing attention to the earthiness",Paragraph

"even primitive, appealing to what Alvar Aalto, in an essay from 1922, described as",Paragraph
the subconscious content associated with old architecture. “The emotions it,Paragraph

Tokyo Bay Plan. Zhongjie Lin explains that two kinds or degrees of permanence,Paragraph

"expansive urban pattern. As with Tange’s superstructure over the bay, this design",Paragraph
proposed a network of routes and accommodations built above an unstable sub-,Paragraph
"strate; a bombed remnant, Eric Mumford explains in his chapter, of pre-existing",Paragraph
"urban structure. Had the site not included ruins, increased automobile traffic",Paragraph

No sharp distinction between the design of buildings and urban areas was allowed.,Paragraph
The same would be true for the configurations they envisaged in subsequent pro-,Paragraph
"jects: networks, webs, mat buildings, and so on.",Paragraph
"From the very start of their arguments in support of The Naked City, Asger",Paragraph
Jorn and Guy Debord assumed the wider urban landscape to be design’s proper,Paragraph
"frame of reference. Unlike Tokyo Bay and Brasilia, though, it was not city form",Paragraph
"imagined by architects, but a pre-existing ensemble. The Naked City collage, like",Paragraph
"their thinking more generally, argued for the intensification of already-existing",Paragraph
situations. The aim of this intensification would be a unitary urbanism. The city,Paragraph

"buildings of course, but also, more importantly, events. Paris in particular, but",Paragraph

"In The Naked City and a number of the other projects studied in this volume,",Paragraph

"Eyck, too, saw surrealism as one of the keys to reality. After all, Breton himself had",Paragraph

"followed the format and “method” of Louis Aragon’s Paris Peasant, Louis Sou-",Paragraph
"pault’s Last Nights in Paris, and André Breton’s Nadja, all of which gained narrative",Paragraph
momentum from the “chance encounters” that resulted from errance in the city.,Paragraph

the importance of collage in the conception of the city Debord and Jorn developed.,Paragraph
Its origins are found in Dada and cubist art. Kiesler’s involvement in the De Stijl,Paragraph
movement has been mentioned. De Stijl architecture was of course interconnected,Paragraph
"with neoplasticism in art, particularly that of Piet Mondian, to whom Aldo van",Paragraph
Eyck frequently referred. The artists and works associated with these movements,Paragraph
did not provide the architects with solutions to the problems they encountered in,Paragraph
"building and city design, but some of their ways of working were adapted to proj-",Paragraph
"ect making, as was their focus on the situations, patterns, and institutions of",Paragraph
urban life.,Paragraph
The research into the urban conditions of architectural order undertaken by the,Paragraph
architects of this period can be likened to archaeology or anthropology insofar as,Paragraph
the possibilities of creative work were discovered beneath the surface or within the,Paragraph
depth of social and cultural norms. One of the most heated debates of the entire,Paragraph
history of CIAM arose over interpretations of what Ernesto Rogers called “pre-,Paragraph
existing conditions” (preesistenze ambientali). He had published his famous paper,Paragraph
on the subject in 1955. We need not side with either Rogers or Peter Smithson,Paragraph
"to say that many, though certainly not all of the architects of the time felt that",Paragraph
the urban order their designs would shape and give substance to conditions that,Paragraph
pre-dated their projects. Tange was one of those who did not hold this position.,Paragraph
"Nevertheless, the meaning of the term “conditions” was interpreted very widely.",Paragraph
"Did “ambient” mean the vicinity of the site, something like “neighborhood”? In",Paragraph
"some cases, yes; but it was also taken to mean elsewhere in the same city, at",Paragraph
"the time of the project, of course, but also in some distant period of its historical",Paragraph
"development. “Parallel worlds,” as van Eyck described a project’s pre-existing",Paragraph
"frame of reference, could be exceedingly remote, on another continent in fact;",Paragraph

rities between oneself and others. Perhaps this was less a premise than a promise:,Paragraph
that the project would set the stage for the renewal of “human association.”,Paragraph

dirt road and preceded by a podium that acted as its atrium. This raised platform,Paragraph
solved the symbolic and actual distinction between the secular space of agrarian,Paragraph

"Always bathed in sunlight, its main front was oriented due north-west and slightly",Paragraph

the complex “functionalism of living” and to imagine an architecture adequate,Paragraph
to its mystery and vitality.,Paragraph

York. He described it as a “proportional substitute” for a single-family house,Paragraph
on four connected levels with movable and flexible partitions. Architectural Record,Caption

"twine curtain with a knot held between the thumb and forefinger, the knot used to",Paragraph
"make the house’s fishnet curtains. It is an ancient knot, known as both the fisher-",Paragraph
"man’s and the weaver’s knot, which does not easily unravel and in a network allows",Paragraph
for ready splicing and repair. Semper cited precisely this knot in Der Stil as the “old-,Paragraph
est technical symbol” and illustrated it twice in a similar fashion. He explained the,Paragraph
"knotted network first as a principle of construction, then as a decorative tradition in",Paragraph
"fabric and, most importantly, as it was translated into tectonic materials, “dressing”",Paragraph
the surface of walls.”” The knot is part of his extended demonstration that textiles,Paragraph
and architecture arose together from the principle of Bekleidung; what first appears,Paragraph
as a textile enclosure later becomes a mask concealing and representing the mys-,Paragraph
teries of architecture.,Paragraph
"In a subsequent article on the Space House in Hound and Horn, Kiesler outlined",Paragraph
the theory of the house using the stilted language of the SSA into which he had,Paragraph
recently been inducted: “The Space-House at Modernage represents two modern,Paragraph

"to the International Style show then on tour, and claimed for his work a “unified",Paragraph

"The “dogma” was evidently in transition from “time-space” to “correlation,” a",Paragraph
term developed within the SSA and used prominently by Buckminster Fuller in,Paragraph
"Shelter (1932). The altered spelling of Kiesler’s neologism, “correalism,” signals a",Paragraph
"further transformation from co-relation to co-reality, which he claimed as his",Paragraph
own. Fuller and the SSA used the term quite variously to describe mutual relations,Paragraph
"between events or conditions, but Kiesler put it in designer’s terms: “A bench is",Paragraph
"restful, a rocking chair is more, but correlated to a desk, a straight chair is better.”””",Paragraph
Correalism,Title
“On Correalism and Biotechnique” of 1939 was the mature explanation of Kiesler’s,Paragraph
theory: “the term ‘Correalism’ expresses the dynamics of continual interaction,Paragraph
between man and his natural and technological environments.””* This definition,Paragraph

He summarized the three relationships of correality in a tripartite diagram illustrat-,Paragraph
"ing the co-evolution of nature, technology, and society, with man at the center. He",Paragraph
subsumed tools and machines under the concept of the technological environment,Paragraph
(from “shirts to shelter”) and traced the stages of transformation. Dismissing the,Paragraph
"idea that technology is simply produced by scientific advance, he observed, instead,",Paragraph
"that “the technological environment is produced by human needs,” which led him",Paragraph
to a critical set of questions about functional design:,Paragraph
What is a need? How do needs arise? Are they natural or artificial? Are they static or in,Paragraph
evolution? A definition of needs has today become of prime importance to the,Paragraph
designer of technological environment. Investigations on this crucial point cannot,Paragraph
be based upon the study of architecture but must be based on upon the study,Paragraph
of man.”,Paragraph
Shifting the focus onto man and his needs led to the key insight of On Correal-,Paragraph
ism: “Needs are not static: they evolve.” Only a few of these needs are “natural” —,Paragraph
"hunger, thirst, and so on — and even these are culturally conditioned. The needs by",Paragraph
which most technologies are shaped have progressed step-by-step with the devices,Paragraph
meant to accommodate their demands. The aspirations or even luxuries of one,Paragraph
generation become the needs of the next and so drive the progressive advance,Paragraph
of innovation and of fashion. This well exceeds the structural argument of conti-,Paragraph
"nuity, pointing to the “endless” construction of human identity and its mirroring in",Paragraph
architectural constructions.,Paragraph
The mechanistic logic of functionalism rests on the identification of stable needs,Paragraph
that can be satisfied by design. The emerging paradigm of the 1930s drew on the,Paragraph
formulations of ecology in the late nineteenth century and developed in the full,Paragraph
flowering of systems-theory in the mid-twentieth. The reach of the paradigm into,Paragraph
which Kiesler’s theory fits was described by Mumford in Technics and Civilization:,Paragraph
"The humane arts of the physician and the psychologist and the architect, the hygien-",Paragraph
"ist and the community planner, have begun during the last few decades to displace",Paragraph
the mechanical arts from their hitherto central position in our economy and our life.,Paragraph
"Form, pattern, configuration, organism, historical filiation, ecological relationship are",Paragraph
concepts that work up and down the ladder of the sciences: the esthetic structure and,Paragraph
the social relations are as real as the primary physical qualities and the sciences were,Paragraph
"once content to isolate. This conceptual change, then, is a widespread movement that",Paragraph
is going on in every part of society: in part it arises out of the general resurgence of,Paragraph
"life — the care of children, the culture of sex, the return to wild nature and the",Title
renewed worship of the sun — and in turn it gives intellectual re-enforcement to these,Paragraph
spontaneous movements and activities.*°,Paragraph
Ecology was initially formulated to account for the changes in the “environ-,Paragraph
"ment” that directed the incremental evolution of species, and those ideas had been",Paragraph
extended to tools and technologies within the first years after Darwin’s Origin of,Paragraph
Species was published. Kiesler’s ambition was to explain the genesis and evolution,Paragraph
"of buildings over time, and with his students in at Columbia, he designed and built",Paragraph
an example that helps illustrate the process he imagined. They designed and built a,Paragraph
“Mobile Home-Library” — a bookcase — not only based on a conventional analysis of,Paragraph
"ergonomics and material constraints, but also to accommodate anticipated changes",Paragraph
"in the capacity and usage of the library, and the progressive evolution of the media",Paragraph
of information storage. He claimed it as a “nucleus of possibilities which will be,Paragraph
"developed through coordination with other elements,” though the same could",Paragraph
"be said of any artifact.”’ The resulting bookcase was both banal and elegant,",Paragraph
and illustrates Kiesler’s dilemma: designing discrete objects within a comprehen-,Paragraph
sive theory of evolution and adaptation over generations. From the perspective,Paragraph
"of evolutionary theory, every object is just another experiment.",Paragraph
"After his decade with the surrealists, Kiesler re-presented his theory of correalism",Paragraph
"in 1949, reviewing the stages of its development from Space House to Home-Library",Paragraph
"to the Salle de Superstition, and concluded with a restated Manifeste du Corréalisme:",Paragraph
"When a constructed space is conceived as a unified ensemble, that is to say, as a con-",Paragraph
"tinuum of colors, forms, and mechanical structures, there must be an essential, inter-",Paragraph
nal force that holds the structure together in a state of coordination. This force is the,Paragraph
specific ideology and represents the atom of the field of architecture.”,Paragraph
Kiesler’s dilemma becomes visible when he argues that the smooth walls of the,Paragraph
"endless house represent that unified ensemble, that the continuity of surface or",Paragraph
structure somehow translates to a state of continuous coordination with the forces,Paragraph
that engender buildings. He restates his aspirations for “spherical space” and,Paragraph

"access to a space, complexly configured, yet also providing direct, intimate relation",Paragraph
between the parishioner and the sanctuary. Though there is no immediately evi-,Paragraph
"dent source of light, this is a luminous interior possessed of a radiance that elevates",Paragraph
both the humble material of its construction and the sensibility of its viewers.,Paragraph
The visitor is readily drawn into the experiential wealth of this place. The,Paragraph

"“A lightness, a mysterious ease, a concise simplicity, something like dance without",Paragraph
"effort or fatigue,” are the words Eladio Dieste used to describe the goals for his",Paragraph
"work.’ Such were the necessary conditions, he argued, for a convinced acceptance",Paragraph
of a building by its users.,Paragraph
Dieste wrote those words out of the specific concern that his work should com-,Paragraph

tells of his experience of a humble woman with coarse shoes covered in mud at the,Paragraph

"moved when a difficulty is resolved by brute force. On the contrary, they want to",Paragraph
perceive a problem resolved with the effortlessness of a hawk soaring in the sky ora,Paragraph
flower unfolding in the sun. It is one thing to have such an ethereal ambition and,Paragraph
quite another to realize it. Yet that is what Dieste achieved in his buildings. It is no,Paragraph
accident that the phrase “light as a brick” was invented for his work.” The buildings,Paragraph
of this master and innovator of reinforced brick construction address us so,Paragraph
"effortlessly, and yet forcefully, that a brief first exposure suffices to assure a deep",Paragraph
engagement.,Paragraph

"that make it, I argue, one of the major architectural achievements of the second half",Paragraph
of the twentieth century.* Dieste recognized that he had achieved architectural,Paragraph
"works of excellence, even if he was loath to title himself an architect.",Paragraph
Dieste’s Reinforced Ceramic Vaults,Title
Strong claims such as these raise questions about the what and how of Dieste’s,Paragraph
achievements.,Paragraph
"Dieste made himself a master of construction in reinforced ceramics, advancing",Paragraph
that technology far beyond its primitive roots. It was virtually the only mode in,Paragraph
which he built. The vast majority ofhis structures serve everyday purposes of work,Paragraph
and storage. He invented two distinctive forms of reinforced brick vaulting that,Paragraph
were instrumental in winning the economic competition to receive the commis-,Paragraph
sions for such utilitarian structures. Serving pragmatic purposes and doing so eco-,Paragraph
"nomically, in terms of both time and cost, was the fundamental business model of",Paragraph
the design/build engineering firm of Dieste y Montafiez. It is not despite these con-,Paragraph
straints but largely because of them that Dieste’s buildings rise above their quotid-,Paragraph
ian settings and achieve an ennobling architectural presence.,Paragraph
Of Dieste’s two major innovations in structural types in reinforced brick,Paragraph
"masonry, consider first what he termed “self-carrying vaults.” These are barrel",Paragraph
vaults with none of the usual conditions of support for such a vault: no continuous,Paragraph
"side-wall supports or buttresses, no tympanum or arch under the vault at its ends.",Caption
"Dieste’s vaults rest on columns — or even a single column, as in the tour-de-force of",Paragraph
the four-direction cantilever vault of the “Sea Gull” in Salto.,Caption
Less demonstrative but equally impressive are the true self-carrying vaults,Paragraph
whose basic variants are well illustrated by the warehouses for Massaro Agroin-,Paragraph
"dustries, north of Montevideo. The main storage area is formed by a set of five",Paragraph
"parallel barrel vaults carried on a sparse grid of columns, with a cantilever of 54",Caption
feet at one end. Freely sliding under that cantilever are three still more astound-,Paragraph
"ing vaults with 43 foot cantilevers in both directions, carried on a single row of",Paragraph
four columns.,Caption
"Such minimal support is only possible if the vault, unlike traditional masonry",Paragraph
"vaults, can resist bending forces.’ This Dieste accomplished by introducing pre-",Paragraph
"stressing steel that pre-compresses the vault. In cross section, the vaults are given",Paragraph
"the most effective structural form — a catenary. This, together with ordinary rein-",Paragraph
"forcing bars between the rows of bricks, yields a thin and light vault. This lightness",Paragraph
"reduces the lateral forces but, of course, there are forces to be counteracted.",Paragraph
Dieste’s characteristic elegant solution is a horizontal edge beam at the outer limit,Paragraph
of any group of vaults — a beam that collects the lateral forces and brings them back,Paragraph
"to point supports. In the long direction of a barrel vault supported on columns, the",Paragraph
"vault acts as a beam. In these self-carrying vaults, the few and distant points of sup-",Paragraph
"port and the thin, unsupported ends of the vaults directly convey the seemingly",Paragraph
effortless lightness of these constructions.,Paragraph
Dieste’s second major structural innovation was in what he termed “Gaus-,Paragraph
sian” double-curvature vaults. Barrel vaults rise high in relation to their trans-,Paragraph
"verse span and thus are not well suited to broad spans. However, a thin vault",Paragraph
of long span and low rise is susceptible to buckling and thus not sound structur-,Paragraph
ally. Dieste would not give strength to such vaults by making them more mas-,Paragraph
sive (a solution through brute force that he naturally resisted). He developed,Paragraph
"strength in the section through shape, through double curvature. There are",Paragraph
"the catenary curves of the transverse section of the vault, but also the S-shaped",Paragraph
curves of varying amplitude in the longitudinal section of the covered space.,Paragraph
"Typically Dieste made these roofs with successive narrow vaults, with the",Paragraph
S-curves of neighboring vaults varied so as to be discontinuous — and thus,Paragraph
sources of light within the structure.°,Paragraph
"The Church of Christ the Worker, Atlantida",Caption
"It is Gaussian vaults that cover the space of the Atlantida church. However, here, in",Paragraph
"a church, Dieste sought not the equally distributed light of his utilitarian buildings,",Paragraph
"but a differentiated, controlled light. The S-curves of the longitudinal section of the",Paragraph
vaults become a continuous sin-curve of generous amplitude at the centerline —,Paragraph
"thus strong and lightless. The S-curves diminish in both directions laterally, becom-",Paragraph
ing flat as they come to rest on the level tops of the enclosing walls. The amply,Paragraph
"curved walls are generated by ruled surfaces — that is, every vertical section of",Paragraph
"the curved wall is a simple straight line, tilting successively at gradually changing",Paragraph
angles. What is already implicit in this description nevertheless deserves emphasis:,Paragraph
the curves of the walls and the curves of the vault meet in a level surface. Equally,Paragraph
impressive: the low points of the S-curves yield a straight line at the level of the,Paragraph
meeting of vault and wall — a limit of the transverse catenary curves. Aside from,Paragraph
"the geometrical elegance of this organization, it is also this that allowed Dieste to",Paragraph
"resolve, so elegantly, the lateral forces of the vault. The tie-rods that are usually",Paragraph
"necessary to counteract the lateral forces of a Gaussian vault, that are then a visual",Paragraph
"distraction below the masonry vault, a condition that Dieste himself deplored, can",Paragraph
here be obscured with the tie-rod enclosed in the level bottom surface of the vault.,Paragraph
The forces resisted by the tie-rods must be resolved in the strength of the wall. This,Paragraph
"Dieste achieves with flat edge beams at the top of the walls, themselves strength-",Paragraph
ened by the curvature of the walls.,Paragraph
"If this lightly technical account of the structure of the church seems dry, it is",Paragraph
nevertheless the direct exposition of this structure that provides the experientially,Paragraph
rich immediate impressions one receives upon approaching the building. The tech-,Paragraph
nically generated but enticing image of the church of Christ the Worker surely,Paragraph
accounts for the fact that the appreciation of Dieste’s work long rested on this sin-,Paragraph
gular work.,Paragraph
"Upon approaching the church, the strong impression of the curving walls",Paragraph
"is matched by the open-air projection of the vault, sliced at the line of its greatest",Paragraph
amplitude. Walls and vault are statically balanced and self-sufficient; the recessed,Paragraph
"facade of the church is an infill structure, as is emphasized by the reciprocating",Paragraph
"curves and voids of the lower wall, and still more by the folded plates and the inde-",Paragraph
pendence of the upper part of the facade from the enclosing structural walls.,Caption
"Entering the church, the visitor is already prepared for the drama of the walls",Paragraph

"space, the warm brick surfaces radiant — from unknown sources of light. Despite",Paragraph
"the dynamic forms, the space is simple. The space of the congregation and that of",Paragraph
the clergy is intimate and with a minimal sense of hierarchy. There is a full satis-,Paragraph
faction in the quality of a space that is rich both aesthetically and spiritually.,Paragraph
"Movement toward the altar reveals a significant, though not the most important,",Paragraph

"the sanctuary. The terminating rear wall, with close-spaced bricks laid diagonally,",Paragraph
"yields a fabric-like surface suggesting its non-structural, merely enclosing role.*",Paragraph
"Turning, looking laterally, one is impressed anew by the precision with which",Paragraph

"azno, the brickwork is exquisite. As a design/build firm, Dieste y Montafiez closely",Paragraph
"controlled the construction and, when necessary, employed adept masons working",Paragraph
evotedly within the ambitions of the firm.,Paragraph

"Turning further, the final source of light is seen to be the alabaster infill between",Paragraph

Brick constitutes the whole of the Atlantida church. Observing the interior,Paragraph
"entrance area of the church, it is not only the choir loft that is sustained by brick;",Paragraph
"the stair, too, and even the open-work of the balustrades, are in brick.",Caption
Brick,Title
Brick was the focus of all that Dieste built. It set him apart from other great engi-,Paragraph
neers of his time who worked in the presumptively “modern” materials of concrete,Paragraph
"and steel — Felix Candela, Eduardo Torroja, Robert Maillart, and Pier Luigi Nervi",Paragraph
are examples.” It can well be assumed that the comparative neglect of Dieste’s,Paragraph
accomplishments is due to a modern architectural historiography that insisted,Paragraph
on the pre-eminence of works in concrete and steel.,Paragraph
"Brick is one of the most ancient, even primitive, materials. Brick is the",Paragraph
"enduring common, environmentally defining material of great cities like",Paragraph
"London or Hamburg or Boston. Dieste’s devotion to brick, however, stems nei-",Paragraph
ther from those historic associations nor from any nostalgia for traditional,Paragraph
materials.,Paragraph
"Dieste saw a number of advantages in the use of brick, the central one being an",Paragraph
economy of construction that allowed his firm to underbid those using “modern”,Paragraph
"materials. First, brick was a locally available, inexpensive material. Still more",Paragraph
important were economies of construction. Gaussian vaults were repetitive.,Paragraph
A movable formwork could be used for the entire building; so much would be true,Paragraph
for a similar construction in reinforced concrete. But consider a group of facts of,Paragraph
"construction: brick is a dry material; in his utilitarian buildings, Dieste used",Paragraph
unskilled laborers to place bricks at designated places on the formwork; reinforcing,Paragraph
"was laid between the bricks; steel mesh and/or pre-stressed steel, depending on the",Paragraph
"type of vault, was laid over the vault; and a thin parging protected the steel and",Paragraph
"completed the roof. Because there was so little liquid cement, in such small",Paragraph
"volumes, Dieste could strike the forms in as little as a day — and move on to",Paragraph
"the next bay. Mortar at the joints could still be tooled, enabling the fine finish",Paragraph
of Dieste’s brick vaults. A concrete vault of similar form might require a week,Paragraph
for the concrete to cure. While Dieste’s innovative brick structures grew out of,Paragraph
"precedents and practice in reinforced concrete, he quite reasonably argued that",Paragraph
new materials do not necessarily displace earlier materials of demonstrated,Paragraph
effectiveness.,Paragraph
Dieste found compelling reasons for the use of ceramic materials in the margin-,Paragraph
"alized economy of Uruguay. However, he also supported brick construction for",Paragraph
reasons that rely only partially on that local condition. He claimed advantages,Paragraph
"for brick over concrete, including relative strength for weight, better resistance",Paragraph
"to temperature changes and aging, better acoustic and environmental qualities,",Paragraph
"and, in comparable quality, lower cost.'° In this Dieste provided good, hardheaded",Paragraph
"reasons for preferring to work in brick. Further, he believed that the tectonic sense",Paragraph
"of a durable material with agreeable qualities of color and texture, worked with",Paragraph
"sound craftsmanship, had a general appeal.",Paragraph
Feedback Process of a Design/Build Enterprise,Title
There are still more fundamental advantages that flowed from Dieste’s practice asa,Paragraph
"design/build engineer, particularly an immediate feedback from the experience of",Paragraph

daring of his structural work.,Paragraph
I was not the first person to be impressed by the daring of Dieste’s structures.,Paragraph
"I was unusually fortunate, however, that after my first day in Uruguay, after my",Paragraph
"first surprisingly substantive tour of works by Dieste, I was taken by a mutual",Paragraph
"friend to meet Dieste in his home. I quickly revealed, in effect, my own conviction",Paragraph
about Dieste’s work as a “dance without effort or fatigue” — though I had not yet,Paragraph
had occasion to learn these words. As genuine and motivated as were my first,Paragraph
"words to Dieste, I was too enthusiastic in my appreciation. Though suffering",Paragraph
"the effects of a degenerative disease, Dieste, with a friendly, knowing sparkle in",Paragraph
"his eyes, calmed me with the words: “I too obey the laws of physics!”",Paragraph
"In the presence of Dieste’s buildings, one may sometimes wonder if he truly",Paragraph
"obeyed those laws. But, yes, he was a rigorous engineer, and there the buildings",Paragraph
"stand. The laws of physics are satisfied. Nonetheless, we must also observe that",Paragraph
there is all the difference in the world between engineering work that follows,Paragraph
the laws of physics while safely controlled within the conventions of ordinary prac-,Paragraph
tice as compared to work that challenges what is physically viable. Dieste imagined,Paragraph
"new possibilities and then, yes, observed only the laws of physics, not cautious",Paragraph
"standard practice or rules of thumb. In consequence, one can follow in Dieste’s",Paragraph
work his own maturation both in theory and technique.,Paragraph
Dieste and Architecture,Title
The taut brick surfaces of Dieste’s buildings convey a clear sense of an economy of,Paragraph
means that is much more than a mere material matter. Also in the utilitarian build-,Paragraph
"ings, Dieste performed a “dance without effort or fatigue.” He explained:",Paragraph
The resistant virtues of the structures that we are searching for depend on their form.,Paragraph
"It is through their form that they are stable, not because of an awkward accumulation",Paragraph
of matter...there is nothing more noble and elegant from an intellectual viewpoint,Paragraph
than this resistance through form.'*,Paragraph
We know there are buildings that are technically sound without becoming archi-,Paragraph
tecture. And there are buildings of widely recognized architectural standing that,Paragraph
are open to technical and tectonic criticism. There remains a special place for,Paragraph
technically sound buildings that achieve high tectonic standards and thus deserve to,Paragraph
be recognized as architecture. This is all the more true when the designers of these,Paragraph
buildings also ran the risks inherent in technical and tectonic innovation. Dieste,Paragraph
"successfully took such risks. His are works that do not indulge the arbitrary, but",Paragraph
in which the form of the structure is also the form of the building and the delimiter,Paragraph
of space. Dieste stated this more strictly:,Paragraph
A building cannot be profound as a work of art unless it has an earnest and subtle,Paragraph
fidelity to the laws of matter. Only the reverence that this fidelity requires can make,Paragraph
"our buildings serious, lasting, and worthy parmers in our contemplative journey.’*",Paragraph
The utter directness of Dieste’s work — its “earnest and subtle fidelity to the,Paragraph
laws of matter” — moves us. It is obvious that Dieste’s innovations are not in,Paragraph
"the pursuit of novelty. They are the result of a continuous quest, a reasoned",Paragraph
"approach to building well, addressing the pragmatic problems at hand but also",Paragraph
"satisfying his own profound demands, aesthetic, ethical, and spiritual, that lay",Paragraph
behind his dance.’’,Paragraph
"Dieste, Man of Ethics and Culture",Title
Dieste was still more than an engineer and architect; he was a man with deep eth-,Paragraph
ical concerns and broad intellectual interests. In his two churches he sought to unify,Paragraph
"the congregation and the priest and liturgy for the well-being of people, especially",Paragraph
"those who labored or were dispossessed. At Atlantida, Dieste had fulfilled this ideal",Paragraph
prior to the dictates handed down by the Second Vatican Council. He was a reli-,Paragraph
gious man; a crucifix hung on the wall of his study. But his concerns were not,Paragraph
framed by the Church or even by religion more generally. His was a concern,Paragraph
"for humanity, expressed in both political and ethical terms:",Paragraph
I think that we would reach a wide consensus if we proposed as a common aim the,Paragraph
fulfillment and happiness of mankind. This is an aim that would certainly produce,Paragraph
different principles in accordance with each individual’s philosophy of life and his,Paragraph
religion...what we see around us is not acceptable... The industrial revolution took,Paragraph
place with such great injustice that the repercussions from the fierce indignation that,Paragraph
its inequities produced in mankind are the reason for the destructive madness that,Paragraph
"has spread throughout the world.""",Paragraph

"himself. Efforts dedicated to science, art, health care, and efforts to make the earth,",Paragraph

"tion and those for economy address merely money and its movement, Dieste",Paragraph
advanced a much larger cause:,Paragraph
"“The things that we build must have something that we could call a cosmic economy,",Paragraph
"that is, to be in accord with the profound order of the world. Only then can our work",Paragraph
have the authority that so surprises us in the great works of the past.”'®,Paragraph
"While here Dieste refers to structures, we should see his notion of “cosmic econ-",Paragraph
omy” in terms of that “profound order of the world.” The inexplicable harmonies,Paragraph
"of Dieste’s churches are the fundamentals of his cosmic economy, but so too are his",Paragraph
understandings of how his country should conduct itself within a world of disparate,Paragraph
"opportunities, and how genuine goods must reach equitable distribution.",Paragraph
Dieste’s thought and work are undeniably metaphysical. Yet he rejects any tel-,Paragraph
eology and his ambitions are always grounded:,Paragraph
"Ic is not easy to have a clear image of the goal. On the other hand, it is much easier to",Paragraph
have a clear image of the foundations and principles that will shape that goal. This is,Paragraph
why the idea that “the ends justify the means” is a drastic mistake. We do not know,Paragraph
"what the end will be. We have an image of our goals, but these will never be realized",Paragraph
if in our actions we betray the principles that will shape and form these goals. We,Paragraph
cannot postpone for the future city the beauty and dignity that we need so badly to,Paragraph
endure the severities of life. We cannot postpone them as principles even though we,Paragraph
"might have to compromise in practice. When we have no other choice, we will have",Paragraph
"to compromise, but we should always continue to try to achieve the principles that",Paragraph
"will shape the goal, our future.'”",Paragraph
"With this confrontation of principles and reality, it is tempting to recall",Paragraph
"Dieste’s story of one of his professors, who, hearing the word “theoretical” used",Paragraph
"with disdain, retorted, “Theoretical, theoretical, the theoretical that fails in real-",Paragraph
"ity, fails because it isn’t theoretical enough!”'* Dieste’s thought, his search for",Paragraph
"“cosmic economy,” took him readily to large and small issues in quite different",Paragraph
"domains, but there remained a selective and rational mind behind these",Paragraph

and cultures. It is precisely the creation of a setting that was rich and complex,Paragraph
enough to receive the full range of haman emotion — in particular ambivalence —,Paragraph
that van Eyck attempted to achieve in the Amsterdam Municipal Orphanage,Paragraph
"(hereafter the Amsterdam Orphanage, or the orphanage), Amstelveenseweg",Paragraph
(1955-60).*,Paragraph
The Amsterdam Orphanage was van Eyck’s first major independent commission,Paragraph
"and brought him international acclaim. As such, it was the crowning achievement",Paragraph
of his early career and remains his best known building. The orphanage’s antece-,Paragraph
dents can be traced back to van Eyck’s trips to Africa during the late 1940s and into,Paragraph
"the 1950s, where he developed his interest in how the discoveries of anthropology",Paragraph
could enrich modern architecture. He was certain that an anthropological approach,Paragraph
"could furnish modern architecture with sorely needed depth and breadth, in much",Paragraph
"the same way that many of the greatest innovators of twentieth-century art, includ-",Paragraph

"him to modern art, and her husband, Sigfried Giedion (1881-1968), who had been",Paragraph
"a founding member of CIAM, and its secretary from its inception until 1956.7",Paragraph
"Just as modern art expressed a new reality for van Eyck, he likewise observed a",Paragraph
distinct and unified cosmology in the ethnographic materials he collected from the,Paragraph
"African villages he visited. For him, these artifacts expressed the interrelationship of",Paragraph
"each thing that makes life possible and comprehensible, to all of the other things",Paragraph
"that contribute to this, across the full range of scales, from the smallest object to the",Paragraph
largeness of the world. He was especially impressed by the Dogon people of sub-,Paragraph
"Saharan Africa, who wove a rich web of orienting relations at all scales from the",Paragraph
"elements of their daily life, including baskets, homes, and the arrangement of their",Paragraph
"villages. Drawing on this experience, van Eyck attempted to translate such",Paragraph
"configurative arrangements into a modern Western form, most prominently at the",Paragraph
orphanage. This is achieved in the overall planning of the building through the use,Paragraph
"of a basic modular unit, which in turn is made out of the specific elements that form",Paragraph
it. The configuration of these elements creates a discernible overall form that is,Paragraph
"varied enough to accommodate a full range of uses, both planned for and unantic-",Paragraph
ipated. The contact with the rich cosmological patterns of village life that van Eyck,Paragraph
encountered with the Dogon — persisting parallel to the diagrammatic settings of,Paragraph
affluent industrial societies — not only revealed the limitations of narrow function-,Paragraph

"em men and women, but also suggested how just these limitations might be",Paragraph
overcome. Of particular interest are the ways in which van Eyck attempted to give,Paragraph
form to emotional functionalism as a topic of postwar architecture.,Paragraph
An Enriched Modern Architecture,Title
"Most of van Eyck’s key concerns, in particular his conviction that parallel traditions",Paragraph
"distant in both space and time, and close at hand, offer— when considered together —",Paragraph
"amore complete perspective on reality, are depicted in his Otterlo Circles emblem,",Paragraph
"the first version of which was presented at the 11th and final CIAM congress, in",Paragraph
"Otterlo, the Netherlands, in 1959. However, the description here relates to a later",Paragraph
version of the Circles. The dissolution of CIAM was organized by a grouping of,Paragraph
"architects, including van Eyck, the Smithsons, Giancarlo De Carlo, and Jacob",Paragraph
"Bakema, who banded together at CIAM X for this very purpose. Team X, named",Paragraph
"in honor of the CIAM congress at which the group formed, could be seen as the",Paragraph
"first decisively postmodern movement in architecture.’ Nevertheless, van Eyck’s",Paragraph
aim at Otterlo was progressive rather than destructive. While van Eyck’s Otterlo,Paragraph
Circles are worth considering in detail because they represent the main themes of,Paragraph
"his work, they also reveal the debt of his thinking (writing and buildings as well) to",Paragraph
"American linguist Benjamin Lee Whorf’s (1897-1941) ideas on linguistic relativity,",Paragraph

"comprehensibility across a variety of scales, even where the basic elements have",Paragraph

the interior and exterior of the building. The most emphatic representation of both,Paragraph
"occurs at the roof level, where each house-room is reasserted by the 336 individua",Paragraph
"precast concrete domes, capping each single-story unit with its own roof. It is this",Paragraph
assembly that gives the Amsterdam Orphanage its distinctive Kasbah-like roof-,Paragraph
scape. The only exceptions to this arrangement are four larger single-story units,Paragraph
"assembled out of nine initial cellular units, and four larger two-story units,",Paragraph
assembled out of nine initial cellular units extended upward by an additional nine,Paragraph
units above. Each of these larger units is in turn capped by a larger precast concrete,Paragraph
"dome, the effect of which is to clearly define them as distinct (a further exception is",Paragraph
"the building’s administrative block, which is raised up one story on columns).",Paragraph
"When the orphanage first opened, the children were housed in the eight larger",Paragraph

"younger children, from infants to ten years old, with living areas and bedrooms",Paragraph

rather than be diminished by it. Although standardization was employed in the con-,Paragraph
struction of the orphanage as a reality of modern building methods and as an eco-,Paragraph
"nomic necessity, richness was generated from repetition and layering.",Paragraph
The Greek temple plan in the left Otterlo Circle is followed by an architectural,Paragraph
"counter-construction by Theo van Doesburg (1883-1931), reminiscent of Gerrit",Paragraph
"Rietveld’s (1888-1964) Schréder House (Utrecht, 1924), and suggestive of Piet",Paragraph
Mondrian’s (1872-1944) painting. All three of these artists shared an effort to intro-,Paragraph
"duce the fourth dimension of time into art and architecture, which preoccupied van",Paragraph
"Eyck as well, particularly its association with relativity. In attempting to introduce",Paragraph
"this aspect to the Amsterdam Orphanage, van Eyck referred to the work of van",Paragraph
"Doesburg, which for him embodied “change and movement,” a crucial character-",Paragraph
istic of modernity in art and architecture in general. It is no surprise that van Does-,Paragraph
"burg represents the “authentic” tradition of modern architecture for van Eyck, who",Paragraph
wished to associate himself with his Dutch origins.,Paragraph
Although experience of the built environment inevitably includes the fourth,Paragraph
"dimension of time as a consequence of human action, the orphanage embraces this",Paragraph
"as a worthy topic of investigation. For example, by allowing elements of the build-",Paragraph
"ing to flow ambiguously into one another, while assuring that the lattice of the",Paragraph
"structure is nonetheless sensed, a degree of dynamic, perhaps generative, tension",Paragraph
"is introduced, which calls to mind a kind of push-pull action, analogizing the move-",Paragraph
ment encouraged by the arrangement of the building. Through this means the,Paragraph
usual oppressive character of institutions is avoided by making the building into,Paragraph
a web of small pavilions looking into private courts. Further evidence of van Eyck’s,Caption
preoccupation with “change and movement” is the meandering street inside the,Paragraph
"complex, which is convincingly rendered as street-like largely by way of the dura-",Paragraph
"ble materials used for the wall and floor surfaces, and the furniture as well.",Paragraph
All of the main areas of the orphanage — the children’s housing and the support,Paragraph
"areas including the infirmary, dining hall, and administrative wing — are threaded",Paragraph
together by the interior street. The dynamism of the building is further enhanced,Paragraph
"by subtle shifts of level, changes of material, color, and infill material throughout.",Paragraph
"Ina move that is at once distinctly modern and traditional, the building is organized",Paragraph
"according to what van Eyck called “labyrinthine clarity,” suggesting paths enriched",Paragraph
"by derivations analogous to unfolding experience, which the interior street empha-",Paragraph
sizes. This conceptualization of architectural paths is related to what van Eyck,Paragraph
"called “twin phenomena,” which is the linking of conditions usually separated",Paragraph
"by strict dualities. In this instance, it is revealed in the building as an arrangement",Paragraph
"that encourages the possibility of wandering, as analogous to intuition and wonder.",Paragraph
"Organized in this way, the orphanage also suggests alternatives to the rigidity of",Paragraph
diagrammatic planning.,Paragraph
"As stated earlier, in contrast to the “immutability and rest” that van Eyck asso-",Paragraph
"ciated with classical antiquity in the Otterlo Circles, the modern period is one of",Paragraph
"“change and movement.” Even so, antiquity and modernity are linked for van Eyck",Paragraph
"as both being “concepts of the mind,” suggesting the value of considering and inte-",Paragraph
"grating divergent ideas on reality, education, thought, spatial organization, and",Paragraph
society.,Paragraph
"Continuing to move clockwise around the left of the Otterlo Circle, one arrives",Paragraph
"at the plan of a Pueblo village in New Mexico, emblematic of what van Eyck is",Paragraph
"called the “vernacular of the heart,” (the “tradition of spontaneous building”). This",Paragraph
suggests there is a depth of understanding available to the developed world from,Paragraph
"apparent unity of traditional societies, from their social organization to the organ-",Paragraph
"ization of their villages, including the constant resonance between microcosm and",Paragraph
macrocosm that seems to define such societies. Order of this kind stood in sharp,Paragraph
contrast to the binary (either/or) worldview of developed societies.,Paragraph
"At the Amsterdam Orphanage, “the vernacular of the heart” is discernible in at",Paragraph
"least three ways: first, the organization of the building derives directly from the",Paragraph
"organization of the Dogon villages van Eyck had visited; second, the cellular struc-",Paragraph
ture of the building is reminiscent of the Pueblo depicted in the left Otterlo Circle;,Paragraph
"and third, the organization of the building, including the distinctive roofscape,",Paragraph
"together with its effect on the interior, relates to van Eyck’s belief that a Kasbah",Paragraph
organization was better suited to the complexity of human life than typical insti-,Paragraph
tutional structures. The orphanage is organized into two wings that slip past each,Paragraph
other in a manner reminiscent of the Dogon settlements. The several hundred,Paragraph
"house-room units extend outward from the entry court, which is the social rather",Paragraph
"than geometric center of the building, and is terminated at one end by the build-",Paragraph
"ing’s administrative wing, which is rendered slightly differently from other parts of",Paragraph
"the building and, as noted earlier, is raised one story above ground on columns to",Paragraph
define the unmistakable threshold to the complex. The extension of the cellular,Paragraph
"units is broken in many places by the introduction of numerous courts, including",Paragraph
"the entry court, but mainly by much smaller open outdoor spaces, either fully",Paragraph
enclosed by the building or partially so. This assemblage is crucial for giving,Paragraph
the orphanage its unique village-like character. Although made up of repetitive,Paragraph
"square units, the building is diverse and dynamic, largely resulting from the",Paragraph
"arrangement of each wing as an opposing stepped diagonal in plan, an organization",Paragraph
that would likely never have been possible without the influence of vernacular,Paragraph
"models, in particular the Dogon villages. Apart from establishing the two main",Paragraph
"wings of the orphanage, organizing the building in this way made possible the",Paragraph
"inclusion of the variety of the open-air places described above. In addition, the play",Paragraph
between inside and outside is further inflected by loggias in several places. The,Paragraph
"thoughtful articulation of the building — materially, spatially, and psychologically —",Paragraph
"has resulted in great social legibility, of the sort van Eyck found in traditional",Paragraph
societies.,Paragraph
Although the “vernacular of the heart” is represented in the left Otterlo Circle by,Paragraph
"a Pueblo village, this should be taken as only one example of a general concept, in",Paragraph
the same way that the Greek temple plan and the van Doesburg counter-,Paragraph
construction are suggestive rather than definitive. The text that links the Pueblo,Paragraph
"and the temple, above the former and below the latter — “extensions of collective",Paragraph
"behavior” — suggests that vernacular, classical, and, one imagines, even the modern",Paragraph
"are all wrapped around the similar habits of a given culture, though inflected by the",Paragraph
specificity of “place and occasion.” The phrase also relates to the desirable possi-,Paragraph
bility that architecture can be a counter-form to human being (a frame that contains,Paragraph
"and is inflected by it), especially ambivalence (the in between).",Paragraph
The three headline mottos in the left of the Otterlo Circle — Immutability and,Paragraph
Rest; Change and Movement; and Vernacular of the Heart — are apparently con-,Paragraph
tradictory conceptions that nevertheless promise a more complete perspective on,Paragraph
"reality, which the consideration of parallel traditions offers. Taken together, each of",Paragraph
"the traditions represented in the left Otterlo Circle, and many more besides,",Paragraph
"“encompass” according to Frances Strauven, van Eyck’s biographer, “a formal",Paragraph
and structural potential sufficiently fertile to produce variable answers to the,Paragraph
"complex reality of human relationships,” as they did in the past, suggest in the",Paragraph
"present, and promise for the future.° It matters little that from the perspective",Paragraph
"of the present, one or another tradition appears to be spent. Silted up within each",Paragraph
"is an ever-flowing wellspring of possibility, which is precisely what van Eyck sought",Paragraph
to confirm in the translation of numerous and varied influences in the Amsterdam,Paragraph
Orphanage. It is the degree to which the orphanage derives from a habit of mind,Paragraph
"that is open to myriad influences that are never redeployed literally but translated,",Paragraph
"perhaps interpreted, or even more accurately, abstracted to reveal something new",Paragraph
"and complete in itself, but still associated with its origins, that makes the building a",Paragraph
unique and enduring structure.,Paragraph
The right-hand Otterlo Circle summarizes what is for van Eyck the reality of the,Paragraph
"human condition, made up as it is of complex individual and social relationships.",Paragraph
"Here, the constant and variable relation between individuals and the society within",Paragraph
"which they are embedded is symbolized by a high-contrast, black-and-white, three-",Paragraph

"circles.” Arching above this image are the words: “For each man and all men,”",Paragraph
"referring to the necessary mutuality that underpins any society, highlighting the",Paragraph
"value of both individual and group for the whole, which van Eyck believed ought",Paragraph
to find its analogy in architecture. The contents of this Circle clearly sets out van,Paragraph
Eyck’s aspirations for the orphanage. He wanted it to be a significant lived-in exam-,Paragraph

"found within social life, and as such, its main aim is to be convivial (welcoming).",Paragraph
This thesis stands in direct opposition to the excesses of instrumental social science,Paragraph

two to three decades immediately following World War II. Van Eyck’s ethos also,Paragraph

A More Complete Perspective,Title
"To say that we experience the same things across time and space, just differently, is",Paragraph
not so much relativist — in an equivocal sense — as it is a restatement of van Eyck’s,Paragraph
debt to Whorf. This thesis also posits the generative potential of the tension resid-,Paragraph

"all people do the same things everywhere, only differently, it is reasonable that",Paragraph
"relativity, which values the validity of each of these responses, offers us a more",Paragraph
complete perspective on reality and thus amplifies the potential to build a more,Paragraph

"why architecture ignores bodies at its peril. In another sense, this approach suggests",Paragraph
"that the best forms may already be given, associating van Eyck’s preoccupation",Paragraph
"with the experience of his buildings by the individuals who would inhabit them,",Paragraph
with Adolf Loos’ (1870-1933) conviction that the “the best form is always there,Paragraph

"Viewing modern elements through a lens suggested by ancient Greek, as much",Paragraph
"as by vernacular and early modernist architecture, van Eyck conceived the elements",Paragraph
out of which buildings are assembled as a lexicon. In a manner similar to the design of,Paragraph
"sentences, van Eyck believed that individual architectural elements could gain in",Paragraph
meaning if configured into comprehensible forms by being assembled semantically.,Paragraph
"Because modern assembled construction, along with gravity, life safety, and matters",Paragraph
"of practical necessity are inescapable, an architectural syntax is also required.",Paragraph
A Configurative Discipline,Title
Van Eyck’s combinatory scheme is not quite as simple as the traditional notion of,Paragraph
"“wholes made up of parts,” but takes account of modern construction techniques",Paragraph
by recognizing that “a whole is more than the sum of its parts.” In the same way,Paragraph
that words gain in meaning through their association with the other words in a,Paragraph

"other equally charged elements of the same size, as well as smaller or larger ones.",Paragraph
The configuration of patterns out of meaningful individual parts — whole in,Paragraph
themselves — promises to achieve a more complex result than modern building,Paragraph
as simple assembly or industrial production ever can.,Paragraph
When a building’s several elements are brought together in a comprehensible,Paragraph
"way, as in the orphanage, they hold out the possibility of revealing a pattern that is",Paragraph

When Kenzo Tange travelled to Otterlo to attend the last meeting of the Congrés,Paragraph
"internationaux d’architecture moderne (CIAM) in September 1959, he seemed to be",Paragraph
preoccupied by questions of the urban form of the future. Like other participants,Paragraph
"in this conference, organized by Team 10, that ended with a formal dissolution of",Paragraph
"CIAM, Tange was asked to present “a project which he considered to express in",Paragraph

scales.,Paragraph
Tange’s Early Career,Title
Tange recalled that it was when he concluded his apprenticeship with Kunio Mae-,Paragraph
kawa and returned to the University of Tokyo to pursue a graduate degree during,Paragraph
"wartime that he began to consider “the importance of urban design, not in the",Paragraph
"sense of mere city planning involving land-use and street-network composition,",Paragraph
but three-dimensional urban design.”* He conducted historical surveys of classical,Paragraph
public spaces and familiarized himself with modernist planning principles used in,Paragraph
"cities in Japanese-occupied Manchuria. In 1942, he won first place in the national",Paragraph
competition for the Memorial of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This,Paragraph
unbuilt scheme organized the complex with a hierarchical layout along a central,Paragraph
"axis linking major memorial structures, for which Tange was inspired by “the pure",Paragraph
image of the Ise Shrine.”,Paragraph
this memorial site at the foot of Mount Fuji the nation’s new cultural center and,Paragraph
"A broader agenda of this project, however, was to make",Paragraph
link it to Tokyo and Kyoto through a linear highway system forming the nation’s,Paragraph
development spine.,Paragraph
Tange became a member of the Governmental Agency for Reconstruction after,Paragraph
"the war and led the survey team for the rebuilding of Hiroshima. In 1949, he won",Paragraph
"the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park competition, a site that was hoped to revital-",Paragraph

venation of Hiroshima. His design successfully devised a new architectural,Paragraph
"language with a recognizable Japanese identity, yet it was modern in every sense,",Paragraph
with a minimalist form using concrete and steel frame structure and flat roof. This,Paragraph
combination of modernism and tradition provided the city a new sense of order out,Paragraph
"of the chaotic urban scene of the immediate postwar years, and became a prototype",Paragraph
for postwar Japanese architecture.,Paragraph
Rising through the Hiroshima project and several other high-profile buildings,Title
"including Tokyo City Hall and Kagawa Prefectural Building, Tange advocated a",Paragraph
“new tradition” for Japanese architecture.° His designs went beyond the function-,Paragraph
alist approach to combine three distinct qualities: the dramatic expression of up-to-,Paragraph
"date technology, the incorporation of civic spaces, and unmistakable revisions of",Paragraph
traditional architectural vocabulary. They exposed raw concrete on surfaces and,Paragraph
used concrete structure to present an abstract order of classical composition.,Paragraph
The proposal for the “new tradition” was intended to transcend the naive imitation,Paragraph
"of traditional form in the prewar period, and to focus instead on modern aesthetics",Paragraph
"or “spirit,” a word he repeatedly employed on different occasions. When he argued",Paragraph
with Ernesto Rogers about the relationship between tradition and innovation at the,Paragraph
"CIAM meeting in 1959, Tange insisted that architects should “inherit spirit, not",Paragraph
specific idioms.”” This new tradition became an important part of effort of,Paragraph
"re-establishing Japan’s cultural identity, a position he made clear in two of his",Paragraph
"monographs, one on Katsura and the other on Ise.*",Paragraph
After he left Otterlo in 1959 Tange travelled to the United States for a visiting,Paragraph
"professorship at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he started to",Paragraph
develop a new methodology of urban design. For his fifth-year architectural studio,Paragraph
"he chose a design question called “New Community on the Sea: 25,000 Inhabitants",Paragraph
on the Boston Bay.” Tange apparently had in mind the Marine City that he had just,Paragraph
"presented in Otterlo. The design brief, however, reversed Kikutake’s formula for a",Paragraph
more dramatic idea by placing the residential program directly over the water. He,Paragraph
"picked one of the student projects for which he had provided the primary concept,",Paragraph
and presented it at the World Design Conference in 1960 and sent it to journals.,Paragraph

"A number of secondary freeways departed from the central spine at right angles,",Paragraph
connecting to clusters of tent-shaped residential structures that spread over the bay.,Paragraph
The whole plan was conceived as an enormous megastructure with a hierarchical,Paragraph
arrangement of circulations and programs.”°,Paragraph
"In the monograph on this plan, Tange claimed that his concept stemmed from",Paragraph
"the characteristics of what he called the world’s “pivotal cities,” namely, cities with",Paragraph
"populations of ten million or more. In his view, such cities, including Tokyo, were",Paragraph
in a state of paralysis because their physical structures had “grown too old to cope,Paragraph
"with the current rate of expansion,” and the only way to save the cities was by a",Paragraph
radical transformation.”’ He argued that the transportation system was the foun-,Paragraph
"dation of a city’s operation, and mobility would bring a city vitality and order. The",Paragraph
pursuit of greater mobility underlay all parts of the plan. By projecting the infra-,Paragraph
"structure of his new city directly onto the water, the highway system was presented",Paragraph
"with a startling clarity as the dominant element. The great size of this linear system,",Paragraph
"the perspicuity of its loop and branch road network, and the formal inventiveness",Paragraph
"of the office buildings that were clipped onto the highway, all combined to make",Paragraph
the plan an articulated statement of an urban form generated in the age of,Paragraph
automobile.,Paragraph
Tange’s notion of mobility was apparently influenced by his Western predeces-,Paragraph
"sors and contemporaries, whose work celebrated this fundamental quality of the",Paragraph
modern city and used it to construct a hierarchical order by separating automobiles,Paragraph
from pedestrians and distinguishing different movements by speed. Le Corbusier's,Paragraph
"Ville contemporaine, Louis Kahn’s series of plans for Philadelphia, and Alison and",Paragraph
Peter Smithson’s Hauptstadt Berlin competition entry were great precedents. Push-,Paragraph
"ing this concept further, Tange used mobility not only to create order but also as a",Paragraph
form giver to provide legibility of the city’s social organization. Besides the unique,Paragraph
"fishbone-shaped highway system, he developed an urban design strategy called",Paragraph
"“pilotis and core system,” combining Corbusian concept of pilotis with his favorite",Paragraph
uniform shaft of vertical circulation into a three-dimensional modular system. With,Paragraph
"the “pilotis and core,” architects would not only be able to separate automobile",Paragraph
"transportation from pedestrians, but also provide a more coherent structure",Paragraph
because architecture and infrastructure would be virtually integrated into one sys-,Paragraph
tem. The ultimate goal was to substitute the traditional two-dimensional planning,Paragraph
"method of zoning with this three-dimensional generative system, through which",Paragraph
mobility and social interaction could be developed.,Paragraph
Tange declared three objectives for his plan:,Paragraph
1 To shift from a radial centripetal system to a system of linear development,Title
"2 To find a means of bringing the city structure, the transportation system, and",Title
urban architecture into organic unity,Title
3 To find a new urban spatial order that would reflect the open organization and,Title
the spontaneous mobility of contemporary society.”,Paragraph
"The first and foremost aim of the plan, was apparently transform Tokyo’s cen-",Paragraph
"tripetal structure into a linear structure. In 1958, two years before Tange’s project,",Paragraph
the Tokyo Metropolitan Government implemented the National Capital Region,Paragraph
Development Plan to regulate metropolitan development. This plan was inspired,Paragraph
"by Sir Patrick Abercrombie’s 1944 Greater London Plan and the Garden City idea,",Paragraph
and proposed an enlarged centripetal layout with a green belt 16 to 27 kilometers,Paragraph
away from the city center to contain the further sprawl of Tokyo’s 23-ward urban,Paragraph
"core, and a series of new towns beyond this ring to house the growing population",Paragraph
and industries.” Tange’s plan was a polemical counterthrust to this governmental,Paragraph
plan. He argued that creating satellite cities would not solve Tokyo’s problems,Paragraph
"because as these satellite cities would also grow and mature, the dispersion of pop-",Paragraph
ulation and industries would create more transportation in the center city and sub-,Paragraph
"centers, and thus would only aggravate Tokyo’s overcrowding and traffic conges-",Paragraph
"tion. In contrast, a linear city could provide a greater mobility characteristic of the",Paragraph
"contemporary age. The centripetal form, he contended, represented a “closed” and",Paragraph
"medieval system, not only outdated but also incompatible with a city of such mag-",Paragraph
"nitude. The linear city, instead, embodied the very essence of social progress and",Paragraph
represented the structure that would lead to an “open society.”,Paragraph
"Tange’s argument departed from CIAM’s concept of the “urban core,” which",Paragraph
called for city building around an identifiable core modeled after traditional civic,Paragraph
"centers, an idea he had previously accepted. In the plan for Tokyo he rejected the",Paragraph
notion of civic center and turned to the linear form that he called the “civic axis.”,Paragraph
"Combined with the arterial movement that sustained urban life, the civic axis",Paragraph
"would serve as the symbol of an “open” modern city, just as a cathedral sitting",Paragraph
at the center of a centripetal organization was the symbol of the medieval city.,Paragraph
What distinguished Tange’s civic spine from the precedents of linear cities was,Paragraph
"an organic idea. In a Metabolist manner, Tange invoked a biological metaphor to",Paragraph
"defend his linear plan, comparing the transformation of a city from a radial form to",Paragraph
a linear form with the evolution of living organisms. He contended that the,Paragraph
"amoeba and the asteroid have radial centripetal forms, while vertebrates have lin-",Paragraph
ear bone structures with parallel radiations because the radial pattern was no longer,Paragraph
suitable for complex functions and had to evolve into a linear one. Tange’s “civic,Paragraph
"spine” was characterized by a sophisticated cyclical system of transportation, which",Paragraph
consisted of a double-loop composition in each link for different speeds of automo-,Paragraph
bile traffic. He claimed that this cyclical unit would make gradual expansion of the,Paragraph
"civic axis possible: at each stage of development the system was complete, but it",Paragraph
"would always be possible to add another unit, thus making the city growth a vital",Paragraph
process.,Paragraph
The awareness of urban transformation and the consideration of adaptability not,Paragraph
"only informed the design of general structure, but were also presented on a local",Paragraph
"scale. Tange noted that under the regulation of the superstructure, short-term ele-",Paragraph
"ments, like housing, should be reserved as expressions of individual choice and",Paragraph
"changing fashion. In the plan for Tokyo, the A-shaped dwelling structures demon-",Paragraph

diversity of tastes and needs. Tange expected the longer life cycles of the infrastruc-,Paragraph
ture to be organically connected with the shorter life cycles of individual construc-,Paragraph
tions to propel the city’s evolution.,Paragraph
"Tange’s concept of an open, adaptable linear megacity, however, was not agreed",Paragraph

pian nature of this project. Christopher Alexander criticized Tange’s fishbone struc-,Paragraph

"units over-the-water’; however, he was unconvinced by the idea of adaptability",Paragraph
and noted: “unhappily as in a thousand student projects (from the time of Le,Paragraph
"Corbusier's Algiers project onwards), the romance of the idea of ‘each man building",Paragraph
"his own house’ on man-made platforms, stands unsupported by a demonstration of",Paragraph
"how it is to be done.””’ Even within the circle of Metabolism, there were debates on",Paragraph
the criteria of differentiating long-term structures and short-term elements. Fumi-,Paragraph
hiko Maki noted that Tange’s mega-form was based on the assumption that,Paragraph
designers would be able to ascertain which functions to be dealt with had long cycles,Paragraph
"of change, and which shorter; however, this might not be the case. He wrote:",Paragraph
"Can the designer successfully base his concept on the idea that, to give an example,",Paragraph
transportation methods will change less rapidly than the idea of a desirable residence,Paragraph
"or retail outlet? Sometimes, the impact and momentum of technology become so",Paragraph
great that a change occurs in the basic skeleton of social and physical structure. It,Paragraph
is difficult to predict to which part of a pond a stone will be thrown and which,Paragraph
way the ripples will spread.”°,Paragraph
Thus Maki argued that even though a megastructure allowed for changeable,Paragraph
"infill, the main structure itself could become obsolete and lead to the failure of",Paragraph
the entire system.,Paragraph
An Unfolding Plan,Title

sented in a bold vision projecting a future Tokyo based on a linear city principle and,Paragraph
"integrating infrastructure, urban space, and architecture into a dynamic system. The",Paragraph

"of change was combined with the pursuit of monumentality, a quality Tange had",Paragraph

formation of culture and attempting to provide a new communal symbol.,Paragraph
"Although Tange failed to carry out the plan, his concept proved to be one that",Paragraph
would profoundly influence Tokyo’s urban development in the following decades.,Paragraph
While Tokyo retained its radial urban structure and fragmented urban landscape,Paragraph
"throughout the rest of the twentieth century, the city has today been brought into a",Paragraph

"and non-structural elements. The structural elements, in this case comprising",Paragraph
"16 cylindrical towers, were the “vertical streets” of a city, providing the necessary",Paragraph

"the vertical roads are built, but unoccupied voids remain here and there. These will",Paragraph

"Significantly, Venturi’s verbal interpretation was at least as important as the building",Paragraph
"itself for the dissemination of his ideas in contemporary architectural discourse. In fact,",Paragraph
"architecture and literature, building and text from the beginning formed a complex",Paragraph
"hybrid, a multimedia hypertext, as it were, and are hardly thinkable without one",Paragraph
another. The Vanna Venturi House exists as much in the medium of the text as it does,Paragraph

"it as a model for a “mannerist” architecture. In his 1982 “postscript,” the architect",Paragraph

"25 Years Later,” written on the occasion of the publication of the monograph dedicated",Paragraph
"to the design of the house, Venturi reread it as a predecessor of postmodernism and",Paragraph
focused in particular on the symbolic dimension of his architecture. And he added:,Paragraph
“That I saw and explained the house differently then from now is not a bad thing;,Paragraph
it means its architecture has dimensions and makes sense from several perspectives.”,Paragraph

Kahn’s January 1963 sketch of formwork provides insight into the nature of this,Paragraph

Like other mid-century modern architects closely scrutinized by Kahn — Mies,Paragraph
van der Rohe and especially Le Corbusier — Kahn eschews capriciously additive,Paragraph

Kahn reflected on the interdependence of idea and phenomenon. “The architect,Paragraph
"must always ask himself,” he said, “to what ‘dominion’ does this construction",Paragraph
"belong?””’ In the very structure of this question, he persists in his conviction that",Paragraph
the duty of architecture is to use measurable means to put us in touch with our own,Paragraph
"unmeasurable nature, bodies in touch with soul.",Paragraph
Manfredo Tafuri is unsparing in his characterization of this pattern in Kahn’s,Paragraph
practice. He argues:,Paragraph
“|Kahn sought to open] ineffable spaces for the narration of a nostalgia: nostalgia for a,Paragraph
"sign that retraces its own adventures in search of the moment, forever lost in the",Paragraph

"norm and deviation, capable of making gush forth, from the alembie through which",Paragraph
"ruptures and lacerations are distilled, a ‘circularity’ and fullness of the word, the word",Paragraph
in its entirety.”,Paragraph
"Within the sphere of Tafuri’s assessment, Kahn’s insistence on concrete makes",Paragraph
"perfect sense. As Forty observes, “Kahn’s buildings, while thoroughly modern in",Paragraph
"his attention to the structural systems and finish of the concrete, are ancient in the",Paragraph
way that the structure seems to exist as something independent of the uses to,Paragraph

"If the construction of Salk is manifestly modern and practical, its modernism and",Paragraph

Design Process,Title
The swimming pool on the beach of Leca de Palmeira was planned and built in,Paragraph
small stages over a period of about 14 years.’ Since all the building phases,Paragraph
"employed the same materials and formal language, the whole is marked by the",Paragraph
impression of self-evident coherence. Rough shell concrete was used for walls,Paragraph
"and floors, dark wood for the roof construction and interior finishing, and tarpaper",Paragraph
"for the roof covering, which was later replaced by patinated sheet copper. The",Paragraph
"broad spectrum of the architectural vocabulary, however — expanded continually",Paragraph
over the course of the design and construction — produces a sense of uncertainty.,Paragraph
"The complexity of the structure, as difficult to grasp on location as in the drawings,",Paragraph
becomes more easily comprehensible when the individual steps in its development,Paragraph
are examined one at a time.,Paragraph
"The history of the project begins in November 1959, when the city of",Paragraph
Matosinhos — where Alvaro Siza was brought up and to which the district of,Paragraph
"Leca de Palmeira belongs — commissioned the construction firm Ribeiro da Silva,",Paragraph
L* to produce a feasibility study and cost estimate for a swimming pool on the,Paragraph
beach of Leca. The original idea was a tide pool that would be supplied with fresh,Paragraph
"seawater through the flow of the tide. Co-proprietor of the firm, engineer Bernardo",Paragraph
"Ferr4o, chose a site somewhat to the north of a large sandy beach where the rocks",Paragraph
"already formed a small pond, at that time used for breeding lobsters.” Here the",Paragraph
retaining wall of the coastal road was interrupted by a platform at street level,Paragraph
(Meia-Laranja”). Ferraéo proposed replacing the pond with a rectangular,Paragraph
"swimming pool measuring 20 x 33.33 meters, whose long sides would lie parallel",Paragraph
to the retaining wall of the platform.’,Caption
"In view of the urbanistic implications of the plan, the city followed the suggestion",Paragraph
"of the engineer and commissioned an architect as well, Alvaro Siza Vieira, whom",Paragraph
Ferrao knew from the architecture office of his brother Fernando Tavora.‘,Paragraph
"Siza, at that time 26 years old, at first proposed a large lake amid the rocks instead",Paragraph
"ofa swimming pool.’ When the city rejected this idea, he suggested opening Ferrao’s",Paragraph
rectangular basin so that the edge toward the sea would be defined by the existing,Paragraph
"granite rock formations. In this way, the basin was skillfully integrated into the",Paragraph
"topographical situation, making it easier and less expensive to construct. The",Paragraph
proposal was accepted.,Paragraph
"The concept of a tide pool, however, proved unrealizable for both hygienic and",Paragraph
"topographic reasons. The basin was positioned too high in relation to sea level, and",Paragraph
"in order to comply with health regulations, the seawater had to be filtered before it",Paragraph
"was introduced to the pool. Nonetheless, as early as March 15, 1960, Bernardo",Paragraph
Ferrao submitted the final drawings for the swimming pool. After the construction,Paragraph
"work had been completed by the firm of Ribeiro da Silva L**, Siza’s proposal to raze",Paragraph
"the “Meia-Laranja” and expose the rocks beneath was put into action. In this way,",Paragraph
additional space was created for the pool’s guests and the site prepared for the con-,Paragraph
struction of the dressing rooms.,Paragraph
"The second phase of the project commenced in the summer of 1961, when Siza",Paragraph
was commissioned to plan the “facilities necessary for the full functioning of the,Paragraph
swimming pool.” The commission was awarded by the mayor of Siza’s hometown,Paragraph
"Matosinhos, Fernando Pinto de Oliveira,” who was to support the construction of",Paragraph
"the pool for many years to come. Already at that time, the project was integrated",Paragraph
"into the development plan for the entire coastal area from Leca to Boa Nova, where",Paragraph
Siza’s famous restaurant Casa de Cha was currently being built.,Paragraph
"The preliminary design, presented by Siza in October 1962,’ called for a building",Paragraph
"consisting of an access ramp, 24 dressing rooms — 12 each for women and men-—a",Paragraph
"central check-room, sanitary facilities, and a room for the pumps and filters for pur-",Paragraph
"ifying the seawater, as well as a partially roofed, wind-protected courtyard as an",Paragraph
entrance to the bathing zone. This complex was conceived as a modulation of,Paragraph
the kilometer-long retaining wall. In order not to disfigure the view of the horizon,Paragraph
"from the coastal road, the buildings were inserted into the wall like internal organs.",Paragraph
A small restaurant with a fan-shaped plan in front of the wall adjoined the dressing,Paragraph
"rooms at the northern end, while a children’s pool and a small bridge completed",Paragraph
the bathing zone.,Paragraph
"In the final drawings for this phase of the design, the restaurant was replaced by a",Paragraph
"complex rectangular building. This structure was shown only in outline, however,",Paragraph
and remained unrealized for lack of funds. The preliminary design was supplemen-,Paragraph
ted with steps leading through the rocks to the swimming pool. The construction,Paragraph
"work was carried out from 1963 to late 1964. In addition, a snack bar and a free-",Paragraph
standing WC were incorporated as temporary measures. It proved difficult to,Paragraph
"obtain clean seawater, as water drawn from between the rocks contained too high",Paragraph
"a proportion of sand. Accordingly, a spring well was installed in the proximity of",Paragraph
"the shore wall, drawing water from a subterranean canal extending a hundred",Paragraph
"meters out into the sea.* By the summer of 1965, the complex was fully functional",Paragraph
for the first time and a regular swimming business commenced.,Paragraph
"It soon became clear, however, that the facilities were insufficient for the",Paragraph
"demand. Thus in September 1965, Siza submitted a preliminary design for the",Paragraph
"“expansion of the swimming pool area, consisting of restaurant, storage spaces,",Paragraph
"sanitary facilities, bar, and esplanade.”” South of the dressing rooms, he planned",Paragraph
"a second retaining wall four meters in front of the existing shore wall, ending as",Paragraph
aramp leading to the beach of Leca. The space between the two walls was set aside,Paragraph
"for the sanitary facilities and storage areas. To the north, the provisional snack bar",Caption
"was replaced by a permanent building with a triangular esplanade, protected from",Paragraph
the powerful north wind by a concrete wall at a 45-degree angle to the shore wall.,Paragraph
This protecting wall was precisely aligned with the north-east corner of the swim-,Paragraph
"ming pool, finding its continuation in a part of the west edge of the basin. Further to",Paragraph
"the north, additional sanitary facilities were incorporated into the shore wall.",Paragraph
"Continuing northward another hundred meters, a platform, tapering to produce a",Paragraph
"perspectival effect, was planned in front of the shore wall to serve as a connection",Paragraph
"to the future restaurant. The restaurant itself, a structure about 70 meters long, like-",Paragraph
wise stood at a 45-degree angle to the shore wall on the ridge of a rock and served as,Paragraph
wind protection for the northern part of the beach. From 1993 to 1995 Siza further,Paragraph
"developed the project of this restaurant, but nothing more has yet been built.",Paragraph
This preliminary design was subdivided into a third phase — consisting of all the,Paragraph
expansions with the exception of the restaurant and the platform — and a fourth,Paragraph
"one, which was set aside for the time being. The working plans for the third phase",Paragraph
were submitted in February 1966.'° When difficulties with the building permit,Paragraph
"arose, Siza and Ferrao once again submitted a comprehensive project description",Paragraph
"in July 1967, including a “Survey of Development Phases.”*’ Construction itself",Paragraph
probably only began the following year.,Paragraph

snack bar as well as the installation of dressing and sanitary facilities for the person-,Paragraph
nel. These and other measures were presented in a design for the “connection of,Paragraph
"the third and fourth phase,” submitted in April 1973.’? In the corresponding ground",Paragraph
"plan, the large platform south of the dressing rooms appears for the first time with a",Paragraph
"stair cut into it at a 45-degree angle, as do the platform and ramp in front of the",Paragraph
"children’s pool. According to the survey of development phases, however, the",Paragraph
"ramp appears already to have been realized before 1965. According to the plan,",Paragraph
"the exterior wall of the men’s dressing area was to be replaced by a diagonal wall,",Paragraph
which however was not built.,Paragraph
"Apart from measures necessary for maintenance, the complex remained unal-",Paragraph
"tered throughout the following years. In early 1993, Siza revised the design of",Paragraph
the restaurant from the fourth phase and by 1995 had produced a complete set,Paragraph
"of execution drawings. For lack of funds or support, however, the project once",Paragraph
"again remained unrealized. During the same period, the existing buildings were",Paragraph
"renovated. Among other measures, the roofs were covered with patinated copper,",Paragraph
as already specified in the original plan.,Paragraph
"The properties alongside the coastal avenue, which in 1990 were still open green",Paragraph
"areas, have since been urbanized. Today, large apartment blocks, most of them",Paragraph
"several stories high, face the avenue. In the first decade of the new millennium,",Paragraph
Siza had been commissioned to redesign the whole coastal avenue and public space,Paragraph
"area, starting from Leca port’s North Mole, all the way up to the Boa Nova site. On",Paragraph
"May 25, 2011, Siza’s Boa Nova restaurant and the swimming pool on the beach at",Caption
Leca da Palmeira were the two first modern projects in Portugal to be classified as,Paragraph
"national monuments.’ At the same time, the coastal area between the swimming",Paragraph
"pool and the restaurant were declared a “specially protected zone,” in order to",Paragraph
“guarantee the continuity of the dialogue between the Casa de Cha da Boa Nova,Paragraph
"and the Piscinas de Marés, the coastal avenue, the beach area and the sea.”** In spite",Paragraph
"of this legal protection, in 2012 the local government tolerated the use of the big",Paragraph
"lawn area in front of the Casa de Cha to be used as an uncontrolled parking lot,",Paragraph
causing the devastation of almost all vegetation.’”,Paragraph
Nature and Geometry,Title
One of the fundamental themes of the project is its relation to the natural environ-,Paragraph
"ment: “In these first works, there ripened a definite, undeniable feeling that",Paragraph
"architecture does not end at a specific point, but extends from object to space",Paragraph
and thus — through the relation to space — finds its completion in nature.”'® But,Paragraph
what does “nature” mean in this context? Here there is no occasion for Romantic,Paragraph
"glorification or even the relaxed enjoyment of nature. The site is a wild, inhospi-",Paragraph
"table one, exposed to the wind and the waves. It lacks the idyllic quality of the",Paragraph
"Quinta da Conceicdo park, also a part of Leca de Palmeira, where shortly before",Paragraph
Siza had realized a smaller swimming pool with white plastered walls and red-tiled,Paragraph
roofs in the shadow of old pines. Nor is it as dramatic and picturesque as the rocks,Paragraph
"of Boa Nova, where Siza’s restaurant was built. Yet it draws its primal power from",Paragraph
"the presence of the Atlantic Ocean, from the sound of the wind and the breaking",Paragraph
"waves, from its closeness to the industrial harbor of Matosinhos and the view of a",Paragraph
horizon whose infinitely distant yet precise line is echoed in the retaining wall of,Paragraph
the coastal road.,Paragraph
"The wall, about a kilometer and a half in length and up to ten meters in height,",Paragraph
"constitutes a powerful, clear boundary separating the cultivated land from the",Paragraph
"beach and the rugged, inaccessible rocky coast, an area visibly exposed to the",Paragraph
"assault of the sea. The wall does not appear as an object, but rather forms a kind",Paragraph
of base for the land bounded by it. Into this wall is incorporated the architectural,Paragraph
complex of the dressing rooms. They represent a modulation of the work of engi-,Paragraph
neering that structures the entire coastal area and establishes a connection between,Paragraph
"Leca and the restaurant of Boa Nova. Despite its modest scale, the architecture is",Paragraph
thus effectively incorporated into its landscape context. Seen from the bathing,Paragraph
"zone, the wall functions as a background before which a dramatic scenery unfolds.",Paragraph
The ideal of a harmonious balance between architecture and the existing land-,Paragraph
"scape, formulated at that time by Siza’s mentor Fernando Tavora,’” was certainly",Paragraph
one of the fundamental principles underlying the project. But how does the struc-,Paragraph
ture that was actually built relate to its context? While it may distantly evoke a,Paragraph
"Japanese stone garden, it in fact represents its exact opposite — not the artful ide-",Paragraph
"alization of nature in an architectural setting, but the exposure and restrained pres-",Paragraph
"entation of a primal, wild, inhospitable situation. The design respects the natural",Paragraph
"setting and the already existing structures, adapting them to the new functional",Paragraph
demands with sparing interventions.,Paragraph
Although the strict geometry of the architecture clearly distinguishes it from the,Paragraph
"rugged, rocky landscape, this approach is not informed by the classical opposition",Paragraph
between nature and art. The change of material and the clearly defined forms,Paragraph
permit the eye to distinguish between the built and the pre-existing; yet both are,Paragraph
intensified by the presence of the other. The effect is not that of an isolated object,Paragraph
contrasting with the landscape — as is still the case with the restaurant in Boa Nova —,Paragraph
but rather of a multiplicity of structures carefully incorporated into the topography,Paragraph
and integrally connected to the given situation. Walls find their continuation in,Paragraph
"stairs and platforms of the same material, which in turn create transitions to areas",Paragraph
of rock and sand. Even the texture and color of the rough shell concrete is less of a,Paragraph
contrast than a harmonious complement to the existing granite rocks. The material,Paragraph
"has even taken on something of a brownish patina, which also darkens the granite.",Paragraph
"At times, the concrete even seems older, more weathered than the rocks — craggy",Paragraph
"forms that, as if alive, seem to spring up everywhere.",Paragraph
Taking into account that a large part of the rocky topography we perceive as,Paragraph
“natural” when we visit the pool area today had been covered by a large platform,Paragraph
"(in Portuguese called Meja-Laranja) when Siza started the project, it becomes obvi-",Paragraph
ous that the “natural” is as much part of his architectural conception as is the “arti-,Paragraph
ficial” or “architectural.” The rocks had literally to be discovered by demolishing,Paragraph
"the existing platform, which at the beginning of the project had even defined the",Paragraph
positioning and the alignment of the larger swimming pool. As in a traditional Chi-,Paragraph
"nese garden, nature is understood as part of, not opposite of the artificial, even if",Paragraph
the contrast between the rocks and the geometry of the concrete structures seems,Paragraph
to suggest this opposition.,Paragraph
The strategy of interweaving the built and the existing is associated less with the,Paragraph
idea of a Gesamtkunstwerk than with the dissolution of architecture into a complex,Paragraph
topography. Even the reduction of the materials to concrete and black impregnated,Paragraph
"wood gives the buildings a sense of the transient, like ruins. The pronounced",Paragraph
boundary of the shore wall confronts the boundlessness of the beach; as the years,Paragraph
"pass, the buildings grow outward along the shore wall. The conceptual boundary",Paragraph
"of this landscape is established to the south only by the harbor pier, to the north by",Paragraph
"the rocks and the restaurant of Boa Nova. In this way, there originate perspectival",Paragraph
relations whose dimensions recall the scale of baroque landscape design. On the,Paragraph
"esplanade, bounded by the diagonal wall, a perspectival space is created whose",Paragraph
opposite side is formed by the harbor pier — a triangle with kilometer-long sides.,Paragraph
"Finally, a slit-like window in the bathrooms concealed in the shore wall offers a",Paragraph
view of the Atlantic horizon.,Paragraph
"And what position is reserved for the visitor to the swimming pool? Carefully, in",Paragraph
"a complicated ritual, you cross the boundary of the shore wall, the line that divides",Paragraph
"a landscape cultivated by man from the rocky beach, at the mercy of the powers of",Paragraph
"the sea. A zigzag parcours along the wall compensates for the narrowness of the site,",Paragraph
"establishing distance to the mundane world. The access ramp leading northward,",Paragraph
"the darkness of the dressing rooms, and the longitudinal, southerly courtyard are",Paragraph
"all stations in a path leading to the narrow, almost hidden aperture in the wall that",Paragraph
opens out onto the beach. Only shortly before you viewed the complex from a,Paragraph
"distance; now, having performed the gestures of “submersion,” “undressing,”",Paragraph
"and “surfacing,” you feel part of a natural landscape into which you have been sub-",Paragraph
tly and sensitively introduced. The decisive moment — as you emerge from a court-,Paragraph
yard protected by concrete walls into the open landscape — now calls for initiative,Paragraph
and active involvement as you begin the exploration of the complex topography.,Paragraph
Architectural References,Title
A number of modern architects have been named as possible influences on the,Paragraph
design of the swimming pool in Leca. Alvaro Siza himself repeatedly emphasizes,Paragraph
"the importance of Frank Lloyd Wright, an influence that probably goes back to",Paragraph
"travel reports by Fernando Tavora, who visited Taliesin West in 1960. “When",Paragraph

FROM VERNACULARISM TO REGIONALISM,Title
Unity is in variety and not in uniformity.,Paragraph
The first generation of “modern” architects who practiced between the 1930s,Paragraph
and 1970s in the Middle East was deeply influenced by what has been termed “pro-,Paragraph
"gressive” architectural ideas. Viewed historically, however, their influence may not",Paragraph
"have resulted in real progress. This generation, mainly graduates of European",Paragraph
"schools, imported modernist architectural models to the Middle East, regardless",Paragraph
of whether they were in harmony with the local climate and culture. This should,Paragraph
"have been expected, for they had taken the same stance with respect to their own",Paragraph
cultural antecedents. Traditional or vernacular architecture was perceived as a con-,Paragraph
"glomeration of dead archaeological vestiges and obsolete buildings, incongruous",Paragraph
with modern times.,Paragraph
"With respect to Egyptian architects specifically, Abdelbaki Ibrahim, a former",Paragraph
"Chairman of the Centre of Planning and Architecture Studies (CPAS) in Cairo,",Paragraph
published an article entitled “The Architecture Circus”’ that described the work,Paragraph
of architects in some Middle Eastern countries as an attempt to manipulate,Paragraph
imported forms and building materials without any relevance to local culture or,Paragraph
environment — a circus performance that was obviously more of an entertainment,Paragraph
"than a solution. Many Egyptian architects performed in this circus, he observed,",Paragraph
noting that only a few resented the attitude it expressed and tried to find ways,Paragraph
to apply values learned from the ancient soil of their own land. Of major influence,Paragraph
"in the Middle East region and later worldwide, the prominent architect Hassan",Paragraph
Fathy was among this second wave of architects who shifted the paradigm of,Paragraph
"modernism, and offered a fresh appraisal of regional architecture, discovering in",Paragraph
it an internal dynamism and potential for change that would make it relevant,Paragraph
for contemporary times.,Paragraph
"With Fathy’s project at Kharga as my point of focus, I shall try to show how his",Paragraph
"work constituted a unique regional critical response to modernism, and how he",Paragraph
challenged its subsequent internationalism through a genuine reuse of regional,Paragraph
and vernacular Egyptian architecture.,Paragraph
Regionalism and Internationalism in the Middle East,Title
"In general terms, internationalism seeks the globalization of modern architecture.",Paragraph
"In addition to its geographical ambitions, it is a form or aestheticism that transcends",Paragraph
the individual and contextual characteristics of particular places. Despite the fact,Paragraph
that internationalism so defined seems to bear the seeds of liberty and appears,Paragraph
"to free architecture from some of the negative aspects of power-heritage, it has had",Paragraph
an adverse impact on what the philosopher Paul Ricoeur called the “creative,Paragraph
nucleus” of cultures and traditions.’,Paragraph
It is often assumed that culture ought to be modernized and therefore globa-,Paragraph
"lized. However, both terms are antagonistic to critical dimensions of existing con-",Paragraph
ditions. Is modernization only a question of change of tools or is it a change of a,Paragraph
culture’s “creative nucleus?” If modernization is concerned with standardizing the,Paragraph
"means of building and patterns of living, which surely provide an improved stand-",Paragraph
"ard comfort for the global masses, it is far from obvious how particular cultures",Paragraph
can meet the requirements of standardization in order to produce modern com-,Paragraph
fort at their particular civilizational level. Nor are the forms of modernist archi-,Paragraph
tecture — the aestheticism to which I referred already — adequate to the goals,Paragraph
"of modernization, positive though they may be. The importation of modernist",Paragraph
forms rarely escapes the dogma of modernism and ironically fails to achieve,Paragraph
the aims of modernization.,Paragraph
Modernist architects often sought to enforce so-called rational rules on regional,Paragraph
and vernacular architecture in order to attune it to modern reason. Assumed in this,Paragraph
procedure is a judgment that labels pre-modern building practices as primitive or,Paragraph
"disorderly; in other words, irrational. This assumption is sustained by the neglect of",Paragraph
local knowledge — knowledge of considerable complexity and richness that can be,Paragraph
grasped through direct contact with the people for whom the work is intended.,Paragraph
"Often proposed as an alternative to the modernist stance is the regionalist position,",Paragraph
which is supposed to remedy the defects of modernism by planting its abstraction,Paragraph
"in local soil, making the global local. Instead of questioning the reliability of",Paragraph
"modernism, the place is criticized for not being subservient to it.",Paragraph
"Regionalism and modernism are thus two sides of the same coin, even if the",Paragraph
imagery of the first was proposed as a cure for the emptiness of the second. When-,Paragraph
"ever the genius of a place is revealed in an architectural project, the concept of",Paragraph
regionalism is applied to situate it vis-a-vis modernism in conformity with its inter-,Paragraph
national minimalist abstraction. The abandonment ofa cultural past only generates,Paragraph
chaos in the evolutionary patterns of architecture that are intertwined with,Paragraph
embedded social and cultural fabrics.,Paragraph
"In point of fact, modernism was seldom applied in the Middle East region ide-",Paragraph
"ologically; rather as an evidence and outcome of a fascination with technology, its",Paragraph
tools and new forms. Alan Colquhoun’s comments on the relationships between,Paragraph
cultural patterns and technologies remain pertinent. The tensions between,Paragraph
"traditions and technologies were “to some extent, obscured in the West, because",Paragraph
"industrialization evolved out of local cultural traditions, and adaptation to a post-",Paragraph
industrialized culture was already quite far advanced.”* He added that “the,Paragraph
"problem is glaring, however, in the East and in Africa because of the friction",Paragraph
between two worlds and two times: the agrarian and the industrial. Are cultural,Paragraph
"patterns absolutely dependent on an industrial base, or can they maintain certain",Paragraph
independence? Is an industrialized culture irrevocably Eurocentric?”*,Title
The gap between imported modernism and local sustainable culture in the,Paragraph
Middle East is therefore very wide. To bridge this gap and resolve the paradox,Paragraph
"it represents, a retrospective measure must be sought. Is architecture in the Middle",Paragraph
East trapped between corrective measures of its own tradition and imported rules?,Paragraph
What is lost due to modernism? And what is to be gained from sustainable cultures?,Paragraph
"Unquestionably, the solution is beyond “critical regionalism.”",Paragraph
Kenneth Frampton’s description of the “universal civilization” as a victory over,Paragraph
"“inflected culture” in order to advocate a “critical regionalism” is, | think, too sub-",Paragraph
jective to provide a convincing alternative.° To use Ernesto Nathan Rogers’ term,Paragraph
"“formalistic aestheticism,” the “freestanding high-rise and the serpentine freeway”",Paragraph
are yet to surrender to the pre-existences of their milieu. “The context is the place,Paragraph
of these preexistences and anything that did not feel their influence would be vague,Paragraph
and indeterminate.”” When Frampton proposes “critical regionalism” as a way to,Paragraph
"counter-balance “sentimental regionalism,” it seems that he creates a vicious cycle",Paragraph
rather than a solution to the dilemma. If regionalism stems from a rectification of,Paragraph
"modernism, then on what new basis does Frampton suggest the pursuit of this new",Paragraph
approach? When referring to Alex Tzonis and Liliane Lefaivre in the “Grid and the,Paragraph
"Pathway,” (1981) it is essential to state that regionalism has not dominated “archi-",Paragraph
tecture in almost all countries at some time during the past two centuries and a,Paragraph
half’® but rather it is a specific architecture that has dominated all regions with,Paragraph
"monotonous aesthetics, widening the time gap between people and their built envi-",Paragraph
"ronment. When this time gap persists confusion prevails, making a sense of place",Paragraph
irrecoverable.,Paragraph
Architecture is among the key vehicles of memory and place that translates,Paragraph
"communal, spiritual, and environmental elements to living contexts. Hassan",Paragraph
"Fathy’s legacy is thus pertinent to this discussion, as he attempted to bridge this",Paragraph
gap and provide a genuine sense of a communal space. Applying regional materials,Paragraph
"and forms and activating the dormant memory of know-how, he was able to",Paragraph
"generate a regional response to imported, international, and abstract architecture",Paragraph
"that attempted neither to resolve the dichotomy of modern versus regional, nor",Paragraph
depend on architectural ideas and techniques alone. His model and contribution,Paragraph
to what may be termed a “constructive and intuitive regionalism” grounds archi-,Paragraph
tecture in its milieu without positioning it against modern forms. Nor was his work,Paragraph
“essentialist.” Fathy’s constructive regionalism went far beyond a simple rejection of,Paragraph
modernism or a sheer submission to tradition.,Paragraph
The Birth of a Regional Architect,Title
Hassan Fathy was born in Alexandria in 1900 and died in 1989 in Cairo. He grad-,Paragraph
"uated as an architect in 1926 from Cairo University, where he also taught (1930-46).",Paragraph
He designed around 160 projects. The key project that displayed his painstaking,Paragraph
attempt to achieve an affordable and regional architecture was the New Gourna,Paragraph
"design of 1946, which relocated villagers living in dwellings built over tombs to",Paragraph
constructions built entirely out of mud.,Paragraph
Fathy felt that during the critical periods of colonization and World War II the,Paragraph
architectural crisis in Egypt was due to an extraneous architecture that dictated,Paragraph
"materials, costs, and politics that were far beyond the capacities of Egyptian",Paragraph
"resources, builders, and citizens. In response he devoted his whole career to the",Paragraph
development of a regional architecture that would derive solutions from affordable,Paragraph
vernacular materials and methods. Although the Egyptian government did not,Paragraph
recognize his efforts and his New Gourna project faced several issues of implemen-,Paragraph
"tation, his ideas were well received internationally by the 1970s as one genuine",Paragraph
answer to dilemmas of high modernism.,Paragraph
His intuitive regionalism started with a childhood fascination with the country-,Paragraph
side and rural areas. The landscape of his youth inspired him to conceive of an,Paragraph
"architecture suitable to the peasant’s way of life. In The Architecture for the Poor,",Paragraph
"he wrote, “This ... wish had deep roots, going back to my childhood. I had always",Paragraph
"had a deep love for the country, but it was a love for an idea, not for something",Paragraph
"I really knew. The country, the place where the fellaheen [peasants] lived...”” The",Paragraph
pursuit of this idea by Fathy was translated later by the term ‘sustainability’ of,Paragraph
"nature and place. In order to preserve the building tradition and communal living,",Paragraph
he vehemently defended the use of local materials and local building typologies. He,Paragraph
believed the ancestral crafts are affordable to the peasant and adequate to his,Paragraph
"natural milieu. Regarding his earthen village, New Gourna, Fathy wrote:",Paragraph
"Besides the man-made environment of Gourna, with which the village would have to",Paragraph
"harmonize, there is the natural environment of landscape, flora, and fauna.",Paragraph
A traditional architecture would have accommodated itself to this natural environ-,Paragraph
"ment, both visually and practically, over many centuries. The new village would",Paragraph
"have to tone with this environment from the very beginning, and its buildings must",Paragraph
look as if they were the product of centuries of tradition...'°,Paragraph
"Following this line of constructive regionalism, Christian Norberg-Schulz later",Paragraph
argued for the importance of nature and place in the creation of a sustainable sense,Paragraph
"of belonging, particularly his search for Genius Loci, by referring to local and",Paragraph
"traditional forms.”? Yet, the position of Fathy vis-a-vis nature and place was more",Paragraph
"for reestablishing continuity with a lost tradition, as he stated: “The tradition is lost,",Paragraph
and we have been cut off from our past ... This gap of continuity in Egyptian tra-,Paragraph
dition has been felt by many people and all sorts of remedies have been,Paragraph
proposed.”!,Paragraph
In his pursuit of a regional architecture Fathy inclines more toward sustainable,Paragraph
technical and practical innovation than the emotional revival of tradition by explor-,Paragraph
ing the techniques of construction and generating essential forms. He subsequently,Paragraph
created an intrinsic contemporary design through the fertilization of the peasant’s,Paragraph
memory of skills. Fathy distanced himself from archaeological mimicry by,Paragraph
discerning real possibilities within the contemporary world. He nuanced his posi-,Paragraph
tion by stating: “We condemn contemporaneity in architecture as decorative archi-,Paragraph
"tectural details such as mukarnassat, arches, or musharabiat. This is an",Paragraph
"archaeological view that is very far from the concept of architecture, which is based",Paragraph
on the principles of design.”’’ Fathy pushed the dynamic regional design process to,Paragraph
"explore sustainable elements, as they responded to climate, landscape, local mate-",Paragraph
"rials, culture, and nature. He consequently challenged the inability of modern",Paragraph
architecture as a sophisticated building process to produce a more genuine com-,Paragraph
"munal physical context. As with the writings of John Ruskin, his position in The",Paragraph
Architecture for the Poor is essentially ethical. He attempted to expose the ways that,Paragraph
modern and imported practices were isolated from the spirit of people and,Paragraph
their place.,Paragraph
It was perhaps for this reason — rather than his specific forms and solutions — that,Paragraph
"Fathy became very influential both in Egypt and abroad, and that his teachings gen-",Paragraph
"erated a school of thought that attracted numerous followers in the Middle East, an",Paragraph
example of which is Abdel Wahid Wakil in Egypt. He was indeed among the very,Paragraph
few regional architects who stirred international interest. J. M. Richards observed,Paragraph
that “news of Hassan Fathy’s enterprises and beliefs in Egypt first reached the,Paragraph
"Western World, perhaps not coincidently, just as concern was becoming wide-",Paragraph
spread about the growing gap between what technology claimed to do for human,Paragraph
welfare and what it was actually achieving in buildings that answered the needs of,Paragraph
ordinary people...”’* Richards added that “Their philosophy [the philosophy of,Paragraph
"high modernism] required a total break with the past, whereas Fathy has looked",Paragraph
always for continuity. The modernists’ break with the past proved disastrous to,Paragraph
"the relationship between architecture and the public.” Fathy’s purpose as not,",Paragraph
"however, polemical. He did not waste his time attacking modernists, but",Paragraph
"devoted himself to working with his own people, heritage, and environment in",Paragraph
"order to realize sustainable design solutions. More than ethical, his mission was",Paragraph
spiritual:,Title
"Ifthe architect does not respect the God-made environment, he commits a sin against",Paragraph
"God. The God-made environment is the landscape, the atmosphere, the flora, the",Paragraph

"ronment there is nothing that is inharmonious. If we become one with nature, beauty",Paragraph
"is defined as it is. Beauty, then is obtained when form considers the forces that are",Paragraph
working on it.’”,Paragraph
Despite the criticism that his New Gourna project did not work well because it,Paragraph
was difficult to convince tomb dwellers to move there — mainly because it meant,Paragraph
ending their trade in stolen treasures — it remains a unique experiment at a time,Paragraph
when regionalism was seen as an arriere-garde and modernism as the avant-garde.,Paragraph
"Far from impeding progressive tendencies, this project inspired several action",Paragraph
"groups: ADAUA, Craterre, and Development Workshop.",Paragraph

"As stated by Fathy, “this enterprise would need scientific research to be done and",Paragraph

prise for redressing the ecological balance in the country.”'® Projected to be the,Paragraph
"core of a new town, the Bariz urban center was designed to serve a population",Paragraph
"of 5,000 to 10,000 people.",Paragraph
Learning from the mistakes of his Gourna project that he had designed 20 years,Paragraph
"before, Fathy planned this project from scratch with a totally new population and a",Paragraph
new program. Although there was no man-made environment on the site of the,Paragraph
"project, Fathy recognized that he was “...not freed from the constraints imposed",Paragraph
"on the designer by respecting the work of this predecessors in the area, and Bariz",Paragraph
should be a continuity of human response to the natural environment.”’” Referring,Paragraph
"to local know-how, Fathy sought the contemporary engineering skills of scientists",Paragraph
"from Egyptian universities, mainly in soil studies and structural research, in order",Paragraph
to evaluate the ancestral techniques to be explored in his new large-scope project.,Paragraph
"A full understanding of the social and cultural milieu, supported by the technical",Paragraph
"and engineering expertise, enabled him to create a truly human-scale architecture,",Paragraph
and one that answered both traditional and contemporary expectations. Contem-,Paragraph
"porary public spaces, for example, were accommodated by mud-brick vaults and",Paragraph
"domes, traditional in form and construction but contemporary in dimension",Paragraph
and use.,Paragraph
The layout of the new village of Bariz was inspired from the neighboring old,Paragraph
mud settlements that had existed for long periods of time and were able to with-,Paragraph
stand the harsh desert climate. Without duplicating verbatim the existing old,Paragraph
"Kharga fabrics, Fathy resorted to drawing lessons and interpreting techniques of",Paragraph
sustaining this context in a contemporary manner. The key factors taken into con-,Paragraph
sideration by Fathy according to his accounts’* were:,Paragraph
1 Climate and airflow considerations were crucial in order to protect the site and,Paragraph
inhabitants from harsh climate changes as well as to prevent harm to their,Paragraph
"bodies due to high desert temperatures (that reach 48 °C), exceeding by far",Paragraph
the norms of thermal comfort. In the design process Fathy tried to integrate,Paragraph
natural cooling and insulation against hot air by exploring traditional methods,Paragraph
in a contemporary architectural envelope. His elements included musharabiyat,Paragraph
"(latticework) and badgeers (wind catchers). In addition to mud and brick walls,",Paragraph
the size of shaded areas created a reasonable indoor thermal comfort for inha-,Paragraph
bitants in the whole village.,Paragraph
2 Demographic factors were also important. In contrast to his project at Gourna,Paragraph
"in Cairo, Fathy did not know his clients and had to design based only on factual",Paragraph
and numerical statistics. This challenge made the project an abstract design,Paragraph
"process of creating a virtual village that never existed. However, Fathy’s con-",Paragraph
cern about the human factor was key to designing a settlement for an organic,Paragraph
"community, based on balancing activities and reaching a certain economic self-",Paragraph
sufficiency.,Paragraph
3 Aesthetic factors were also significant. The design of housing units were related,Paragraph
"to likely users and were not duplicated for the sake of quantity, as family lives",Paragraph
"were dissimilar in terms of size, wealth, and social status. Neighborhood units",Paragraph
encompassed houses of different needs and created a sense of community in,Paragraph
one semi-public place.,Paragraph
"In addition to these factors, Fathy treated his village as a small urban entity",Paragraph
where all urban facilities and amenities were provided in order to encourage,Paragraph
new inhabitants to settle and not migrate to more urban centers in Egypt. These,Paragraph
"facilities, centered in the core area of the village, included schools, a crafts center, a",Paragraph
"cultural center, a self-sufficient construction center (for the training of local",Paragraph
"masons), an agricultural co-operation center, a Turkish bath, a grocery center, a",Paragraph
"hospital, a mosque, and a central market. It was the vibrant heart of the village with",Paragraph
"services and commerce, planned to engender social interaction at different times of",Paragraph
"the day, week and year according to secular or spiritual needs.",Paragraph
Among those buildings that deserve close attention is the market. This is a stra-,Paragraph
tegic function in the complex of activities that seeks to create the village’s auton-,Paragraph
omy in an isolated and harsh desert environment.,Paragraph
Kharga Market,Title
The market of Kharga is located in the western central part of the urban core of,Paragraph
Bariz village in a compound of public buildings surrounding a number of large,Paragraph
"courtyards that bind them all. Except for the building of the mosque, the plan",Paragraph
"of which is twisted in order to face the orientation of prayer (qibla), all other build-",Paragraph
ings including the market are oriented north with regular orthogonal layouts.,Paragraph
In order to understand the architecture of Kharga Market it is critical not to,Paragraph
isolate its plan form from the building’s constructional and structural logic and,Paragraph
"purpose; more specifically, the technology of the building’s envelope and details.",Paragraph
The complexity of Fathy’s architecture in the market resides in the fact that the,Paragraph
construction and sculpting of the building’s form was based on the craft techniques,Paragraph
of mud-brick construction. The structural systems generated essential forms,Paragraph
without any camouflage or illusion that would hide the skeleton of construction.,Paragraph
The plan consists of a large central courtyard around which all other spaces are,Paragraph
planned. Domes and vaults define the spaces as much as walls. The intriguing,Paragraph
aspect of this way of building and arranging spaces is that all of them are connected,Paragraph
with a circulation circuit that travels throughout the entire ensemble without any,Paragraph
"sense of rupture. Ease and continuity of passage were considerations in this layout,",Paragraph
but so were other kinds of movement as well. Thermal comfort was achieved,Paragraph
through the circulation of cooling air along the focal and linear spaces. Structural,Paragraph
integrity was achieved through the association of domes and vaults that worked,Paragraph
together to form a cohesive structural ensemble.,Paragraph
The functions vary in different parts of the building. They range from a series of,Paragraph
linear shops along one covered passage in the northern aisle to a coffee shop in the,Paragraph
left side that serves as a large public area for gathering. This covered passage,Paragraph
extends to an outside palm courtyard that orients the walker to the adjacent mos-,Paragraph
"que ina natural way. It also links the market building, through extending its domed",Paragraph
"walkway, to the northern administrative building. The southern aisle, on the other",Caption
"hand, is divided into sections, some for food storage and others for related shops.",Paragraph
The divisions within this aisle permit the positioning staircases that lead to the sec-,Paragraph
ond floor and upper terraces. The outside passageway on this side of the building is,Paragraph
articulated through a series of continuous domes along the outside porticos that,Paragraph
engender a special spatial and visual experience for the passerby. The lateral spaces,Paragraph
"of the building are more for services, enclosed and covered by the same structural",Paragraph
elements used elsewhere.,Paragraph
"Despite the subdivision of the market building into several functional parts, its",Paragraph
massing creates a coherent architectural complex with a clear sense of human scale.,Paragraph
The complex has an aerodynamic outside form due to the curvilinear shapes of,Paragraph
long vaults and central domes that are ideal for dispersing strong desert winds,Paragraph
as well as sandy storms. A sense of massiveness — that could easily have resulted,Paragraph
from the use of thick walls and load-bearing brick work — is avoided because of the,Paragraph
"ways macro and micro forms are careful handled as structural elements, which in",Paragraph
some cases even become ornamental elements. This is obvious mainly in the out-,Paragraph
"side gates and external facades, whose austerity and simplicity present several",Paragraph
arched openings filled with musharabiyyat (lattice work) that have both functional,Paragraph
"and aesthetic dimensions — controlling the air, presenting geometries, and playing",Paragraph
with the light that permeates from outside to inside.,Paragraph
The overall form of the market building grows out of and expresses human,Paragraph
movements and comfort. These expressions are enhanced by the effects of,Paragraph
"controlled lighting that temper the shaded areas, allowing light to trickle through.",Paragraph
"Maximum visibility is achieved, without disturbing the interior visual experience,",Paragraph
due to the strong desert sunshine.,Paragraph
A combination of traditional and modern methods is also apparent in the build-,Paragraph
"ing’s structural system. Mud brick construction is in evidence, but so too are large",Paragraph
spans and complex configurations. Fathy’s knowledge of craft traditions was,Paragraph
"formative, but it was augmented by his knowledge of the outcomes of recent",Paragraph
"research in soil mechanics and building materials, undertaken in the engineering",Paragraph
departments of Egyptian universities. New to the landscape — because of its size,Paragraph
"and composition — the market seems, nevertheless, to have arisen from the ground",Paragraph
"on which it stands, as if it were akin to the buildings from the neighboring desert",Paragraph
villages that had inspired the project in the first place.,Paragraph
Conclusion,Title
The architecture of Hassan Fathy presents a unique alternative to abstract modern-,Paragraph
ism. He discovered ways to meet the needs and desires of people within a particular,Paragraph
region through the modernization of their visual and cultural anchors. Fathy never,Paragraph
"said that he followed modernism, regionalism, or other contemporary architectural",Paragraph
"trends. Instead, he explored regional conditions in situ through an intuitive search",Paragraph
for an architecture that would be suitable for people living under contemporary,Paragraph
conditions. The result cannot easily be canonized though attempts of researchers,Paragraph
to locate its vocabulary in the modern era.,Paragraph
"However, this work does present a new regional architectural discourse, one",Paragraph
"that goes beyond the conventional “regionalism” and “critical regionalism,”",Paragraph

"and other megastructures, which had emerged at the margins of high modernism",Paragraph

appeared in a MoMA exhibition in 1960 on “Visionary Architecture” and in a special,Paragraph
issue of L’Architecture d’aujourd’hui (June-July 1962) on “Fantastic Architecture.”'°,Paragraph
"Archigram further legitimized the movement, publishing their own special issue on",Paragraph
the megastructure phenomenon in an attempt to define its formal characteristics.,Paragraph

"“molehills,” and “mounds.” He observed that the dominant orientation of",Paragraph

"Pevsner or Rowe, however, Banham ’s thesis did not go against functionalism",Paragraph
"per se, but more precisely, against an overly narrow definition of it. Indeed, for",Paragraph
"Banham, what was missing from contemporary practice was modern architecture’s",Paragraph
capacity to symbolically express its intimate relation with technology. As he stated,Paragraph
in Theory and Design in the First Machine Age (1959): “The true aim of the style [in the,Paragraph
"1920s] had clearly been, to quote Gropius’ words about the Bauhaus and its relation",Paragraph
to the world of the Machine Age: *...to invent and create forms symbolizing that,Paragraph
world.’ And it is in respect of such symbolic forms that its historical justification,Paragraph
must lie.”’?,Paragraph
Reyner Banham’s Influence,Title
Banham’s definition of style in terms of symbolic expression certainly corresponded,Paragraph
with Archigram’s preoccupation with “an aesthetic original to the mood.””* But a,Paragraph
deeper look reveals a key difference between them. While Banham argued for a,Paragraph
strong indexical relation between a building’s symbolic expression and its technical,Paragraph
"performance, Archigram, on the other hand, tended to reify modern technology into",Paragraph
"an image. As Banham himself stated, “Archigram is short on theory, long on",Paragraph
draughtsmanship and craftsmanship. They’re in the image business and they have,Paragraph
been blessed with the power to create some of the most compelling images of,Paragraph
"our time.”""* Notwithstanding this difference, however, Banham’s influence on Archi-",Paragraph
"gram proved considerable due, in part, to his involvement in the 1950s with the Inde-",Paragraph
"pendent Group, the so-called “Fathers of Pop.”’’ So when they finally met each other",Paragraph
"in 1964, he would again profoundly influence Archigram’s pursuit of style.",Paragraph
The Second World War had brought about enormous technological change in,Paragraph
"the built environment, and cognizant of these transformations, Banham lamented",Paragraph
the growing division between form and function: “the idea that architecture,Title
"belongs in one place and technology in another.”’® Moreover, in his view, the true",Paragraph
"significance of this shift from “weaponry to livingry,” as Buckminster Fuller",Paragraph
"famously put it, was that they had broadened the purview of architecture from",Paragraph
the simple matter of shelter to environmental control or “the provision of fit envir-,Paragraph
onments for human activities.” For Banham this definition meant that the origins of,Paragraph
"architecture began not with the cave or primitive hut, but with clothing (“the first",Paragraph
furs worn by our earliest ancestors”) and the discovery of fire.'’ From a historical,Paragraph
"perspective, he praised the buildings of Frank Lloyd Wright for inventively incor-",Paragraph
"porating mechanical services, and saw contemporary relevance in Fuller’s work,",Paragraph
"particularly his proposal for a “standard-of-living package,” a portable service unit",Paragraph
that could be clipped on to any building.,Paragraph
"In Banham’s view, then, technologies of environmental control (climatology)",Paragraph
had far more implications for modern architecture than traditional design,Paragraph
principles or even new construction techniques.'* Borrowing Fuller’s idea of a,Paragraph
"standard-of- living package, he believed that the mechanization of the total environ-",Paragraph
"ment would revolutionize domesticity, and speculated that one day architecture",Paragraph
"would no longer need to be fixed, heavy, and permanent, but portable, lightweight,",Paragraph
"and variable. In his seminal essay, “A Home is not a House,” he described a mobile",Paragraph
environment unencumbered by all that is solid and pondered whether we might,Paragraph
"live in pneumatic bubbles, an idea that came to him at a campus beach in Southern",Paragraph

"Warwick in heart-warming stereo, with well-aged protein turning in an infra-",Paragraph
"red glow in the rotisserie, and the ice-maker discreetly coughing cubes into glasses",Paragraph

"Upon the publication of “A Home is not a House” in 1965, Archigram shifted",Paragraph
their attention from the megastructure to the portable environment.”’ This shift,Paragraph
"is evident in Archigram 6 (1965), which featured pneumatic structures made by",Paragraph
American companies for use as warehouses. While the magazine still highlighted,Paragraph
"the odd megastructure, including one by future High Tech architect, Nicholas",Paragraph

Glenn Murcutt’s Kempsey farmhouse is a six-hour car journey north from Sydney,Paragraph

regional road that is less and less groomed and the final approach is a long bumpy,Paragraph
track. Signposts only just mark the slow dusty drive through mature forest where,Paragraph

Appreciation of the Kempsey home is united via the extent to which the presence,Paragraph

Purchasing the Marie-Short farm in 1980 provided Murcutt with a tangible early,Paragraph
opportunity to reevaluate the house elements and their broader interconnections.,Paragraph
The potential for reuse was architecturally tested and clarified by reframing the,Paragraph
original spatial relationships while maintaining the internal systematic order. In this,Paragraph
"project, adjustment and literal extension were used to demonstrate the potential",Paragraph
for the repetitive system to adapt; reemployed details and built components were,Paragraph
used to reformulate the house as a whole. The development focused both an ele-,Paragraph
mental materiality together with a more refined abstraction. Both wings were sub-,Paragraph
stantially lengthened in 1981-82 to accommodate the architect’s larger family,Paragraph
needs and each pavilion was extended three structural bays to the east; in the proc-,Paragraph
ess one veranda was unbolted and moved to its new location. Distinguishing the,Paragraph
first and expanded versions of the house suggests a critical agency in the moment of,Paragraph
transformation. Rigorous consistencies as well as shifts inherent in the two versions,Paragraph
sharply focus the productive tensions that underpin both Murcutt’s working,Paragraph
method and his inventive disciplinary contribution.,Paragraph
Comparing the early and later plans implies an almost magical ease with which,Paragraph
"the systematic built “machine” was extruded, and yet many essential relationships",Paragraph
were reconceived. In the new configuration the northern living wing was length-,Paragraph
"ened with additional service facilities and a two-bay bedroom, while on the south-",Paragraph
erm pavilion a three-bay living room with fireplace was inserted between the,Caption
original bedrooms and relocated end porch. The previous programmatic day-,Caption
wing/night-wing hierarchy was thus shifted to create independent possibilities,Paragraph
"for living, sleeping, and bathing in each pavilion, suggesting one “house” for the",Paragraph
parents and another for the children. The close proximity of the new living room,Paragraph
to the northern kitchen and dining areas amplified internal cross-connections,Caption
between the north and south wings and offered more possibilities for diverse living,Paragraph
arrangements. The resultant plan implied a greater flexibility of use with appar-,Paragraph
ently less architectural determination.,Paragraph
Marie Short’s version of the house had five’® entrances. Ceremonial double,Paragraph
doors connected the kitchen and dining areas to one porch and the other verandah,Paragraph
to a vestibule between the bedrooms. A minor hierarchy to this doubling was sug-,Paragraph

"venetian blinds enclosing that verandah, perhaps in response to the more private",Paragraph
bedroom then adjacent. In the alterations the porches were thus focused as,Paragraph
"entrance voids, clear expansions of their associated public living spaces, yet with",Paragraph
a cross movement leading from the steps toward the other pavilion. Entrance,Caption

"the public realm, the integration of design and technology, and the unflinching",Paragraph
belief in total flexibility.”,Paragraph
Scheme,Title
When Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers won the commission for the Pompidou in,Paragraph
"1971, they were both little-known architects who entered into competition with",Paragraph
some of the most high-profile architects in France for a complex project in the his-,Paragraph
"toric center of Paris. Indeed, the competition attracted some 680 entries. The",Paragraph
"immediate area of Les Halles, which had long accommodated the principle food",Paragraph
"market for Paris, was in the process of being demolished and its functions trans-",Paragraph
ferred to the outskirts. It was also a socially depressed area considered to be in need,Paragraph
"of revitalization. Georges Pompidou, then president of France, proposed a new",Paragraph
"center, geared in his mind toward the elevation of the cultural level of the",Paragraph
"“man in the street,” to stand on the vacant plateau that had once accommodated",Paragraph
the delivery trucks for the market as a grand gesture of urban renewal. The pro-,Paragraph
"gram was to include a large public library, a museum of modern art, a center for",Paragraph
"industrial design, and a center for music and acoustical research. Other facilities for",Paragraph
"administration, bookshops, restaurants, cinemas, children’s play, and parking were",Paragraph
also required.,Paragraph
France was not prone to holding international design competitions but in this,Paragraph
"case a famous intercontinental jury, including Oscar Niemeyer, Jean Prouvé,",Paragraph
"and Philip Johnson, sat as judges. The entry submitted by Piano and Rogers",Paragraph
reflected their shared affinity for innovative applications of building technology.,Paragraph
"Indeed, the two believed that technology released architects from the traditions",Paragraph
"of the past and allowed for new expressions in architectural form. In this case,",Paragraph
the desire for a large open structure with its six extended floor spans — to be exe-,Paragraph
cuted with the able assistance of Peter Rice of the Ove Arup engineering firm —,Paragraph
dictated the nature of the structure needed on the exterior to carry the load. Expo-,Paragraph
"sure of the vertical structure of the building, and most all of its infrastructure, was",Paragraph
"intended to maximize the flexibility of the internal space. In turn, each structural",Paragraph
member was then highly thought out. As Rice expressed it: “Each piece was sep-,Paragraph
"arate, an articulated assembly where the members only touched at discrete points.",Paragraph
"As in music, where the space between the notes defines the quality, here it was the",Paragraph
space between the pieces that defined the scale.”” Thus the complexity of the highly,Paragraph
visible structure stemmed from the overarching concept of adaptability and change,Paragraph
that was vital to the proposal.,Paragraph
Circulation,Title
The flow of people from the open plaza through which one entered the ground,Paragraph
"floor of the building emphasized the notion of continuous circulation. The effect,",Paragraph
"both programmatically and theoretically, was a conceptualization of the structure",Paragraph
"as movement: of people, programs, and services. The idea of passage was further",Paragraph
emphasized through one of the most iconic aspects of this building: the painting of,Paragraph
"the different systems on the exterior of the building in diagrammatic colors: blue,",Paragraph
"for instance, illustrated ventilation, or air. Electrical elements were picked out in",Paragraph
"yellow and orange. Plumbing, or water, was demarcated in green. Most of the",Paragraph
"mechanical services made their debut outside of the glass skin on the eastern,",Paragraph
street-side elevation. The transition of people around and through the building,Paragraph
was highlighted in red. The best known of these elements continues to be the,Paragraph
underside of the glass tubes encapsulating the escalator that steps up the west,Caption
facade that faces the plaza. The visibility of the movement of visitors through,Paragraph
the glass corridors that are clipped to the externalized infrastructure also transforms,Paragraph
the people themselves into part of the facade. These corridors are reminiscent of,Paragraph
the “streets-in-the-air” concept that Peter and Alison Smithson popularized with,Paragraph
"their housing projects of the 1950s.’ From inside the glass corridors, one is both",Paragraph
"contained within the building and, at the same time, connected visually to the out-",Paragraph
side world of the plaza and to Paris beyond.,Paragraph
Context,Title
"Ina manner familiar from contemporary site planning in England, transported here",Paragraph
"to densely populated Paris, the building was pushed right to the edge of the site",Paragraph
with the side that faces the city encroaching the outside like a protective wall.* Thus,Paragraph
the experience of approach from the historic city quarter is one of the color-coded,Paragraph
"servicing tubes, while the narrowness of the street guarantees fragmented views of",Paragraph
"the facade. From this vantage point in particular, the Pompidou Center appeared",Paragraph
not even to have the trappings of a traditional building or urban context. Not only,Paragraph
did it stand out in the city fabric and appear to have no architectural referent from,Paragraph
"the past, the building did not follow in the programmatic footsteps for a museum or",Paragraph
"cultural center. Indeed, the architects took a stance on the nature of culture in the",Paragraph
"present age, declaring it to be about the dissemination of information rather than",Paragraph
"the presentation of art. The library, too, unlike most others in France, was designed",Paragraph
so that readers could browse the stacks themselves and have control over access to,Paragraph
knowledge.,Paragraph
"Nonetheless, the Pompidou had acknowledged roots in the history of structural",Paragraph
"and infrastructural innovation, at the larger scale the Crystal Palace (1851) by",Paragraph
"Joseph Paxton and at the domestic one, the Maison de Verre (1932) by Pierre Char-",Caption
eau. Rogers admired both these examples for their groundbreaking conceptualiza-,Paragraph
tion of architecture for a Machine Age that went beyond the aestheticization of,Paragraph
technology. The Crystal Palace famously used prefabricated construction and,Paragraph
the assembly of parts to make up its structure. The association of these kit-of-parts,Paragraph
architectures was clear within architectural culture. In The Language of Post-Modern,Paragraph
"Architecture (1977), for example, Charles Jencks juxtaposed an image of the brand",Paragraph
new Pompidou Center with a text on World’s Fair constructions.’ At the intimate,Caption
"scale, the Maison de Verre was bold in its raw expression of the materiality of steel,",Paragraph
"glass, and rubber. Moreover, the wires for its utilities ran through tubular metal",Paragraph
hannels that were punctuated by power switches and sockets.° Another reference,Paragraph
for the overt expression of infrastructure at the scale of an institutional building was,Paragraph
"the more recent Richards Medical Research Laboratories (1961) by Louis I. Kahn,",Paragraph
"where the service towers appeared prominently, illustrating that architect’s famous",Paragraph
"distinction between served and servant spaces.’ In addition, Piano and Rogers",Paragraph
made their case for the building by associating it with Buckminster Fuller’s argu-,Paragraph
ment for architectural efficiency and flexibility through the application of up-to-,Paragraph
date technologies.,Paragraph
fal,Title
Concept,Title
"Most overtly, however, the Pompidou Center drew visually and conceptually on",Paragraph
the work of the Archigram group from the 1960s. That group — composed of War-,Paragraph
"ren Chalk, Peter Cook, Dennis Crompton, David Greene, Ron Herron, and Mike",Title
Webb — had placed the concept of flexibility of program and structure at the heart,Paragraph
of their architecture. Archigram reacted in words and images to what they,Paragraph
described as the tedium of the built environment and the outdated notion that,Paragraph
"a collection of individual monuments was the life-blood of the city. Instead, their",Paragraph
projects presented the city as a series of unpredictable events that were to be,Paragraph
"accommodated by its architecture. Architecture would only remain relevant, they",Paragraph
"believed, if it was not designed to outlive its relationship to patterns of occupation.",Paragraph
The lack of permanent architectural resolution resulted in a new aesthetic that was,Paragraph
"not based on fixed form. In their first common activity, the Living City exhibition of",Paragraph
"1963, the Archigram group sought to define urban space as primarily a sphere of",Paragraph
"interaction. The forms of the city, defined through the transmission of information,",Paragraph
were implied by the circulatory structure of movement. The shift was toward a,Paragraph
"networked conception of circulation that prioritized distribution, flow, and direc-",Paragraph
"tion, and relied heavily on connection. These qualities are all apparent in the think-",Paragraph
ing that generated the design for the Pompidou Center.,Paragraph
When the British architectural critic Reyner Banham spoke of the Pompidou,Paragraph
"Center, he often cited it as the only realization of an Archigram drawing.* Certainly",Paragraph
Archigram’s most enduring legacy for architectural culture has been predicated on,Paragraph
the strength of its imagery. Archigram’s projects were presented as colorful adver-,Paragraph
tisements for the idea of architectural and urban structure as a scaffold for life’s,Paragraph
activities. The sensibility of their drawings transported the “pop” aesthetic into,Paragraph
architectural discourse. In the images that the six publicized in the nine issues,Paragraph
"of their Archigram magazine, as well as on the pages of other publications and",Paragraph
"through exhibitions, the city was transformed into a place of leisure in which archi-",Paragraph
tecture acted as an enabler of social situations. Through the conflation of collage,Paragraph
"and orthographic drawing, not unlike the one produced by Rogers and Piano for",Paragraph
"their initial submission for the Pompidou Center, Archigram fabricated a visual",Paragraph
language to express the agenda of a reflexive architecture to be populated by peo-,Paragraph
ple who participated in the life of street culture. Often the original drawings were,Paragraph
"highlighted in bright colors, similar in palette to the ones used by Piano and Rogers",Paragraph
to diagram the services of the Pompidou Center. The use of ebullient color in archi-,Paragraph
tectural drawings was uncommon at the time and Archigram’s embrace of the new,Paragraph
tool of Zip-A-Tone and felt-tipped markers to produce these effects was emphatic.,Paragraph
"Indeed, it could be said that Archigram invented the visual language on which the",Paragraph
Center was predicated.,Paragraph
Archigram also used polemical language to make the case for what they argued,Paragraph
would be a more relevant kind of architecture. They famously spoke of the need,Paragraph
for new technologies to stand along the space capsules and disposable commodities,Paragraph
"of anew age. Most importantly, however, the role of architecture was to enable the",Paragraph
liberties promised by the technologies of contemporary life. The language of the,Paragraph
"text written by Piano and Rogers to support their submission, with its ideals of",Paragraph
"social freedom enabled through radical flexibility of structure, was redolent of",Paragraph
Archigram-like prose:,Paragraph
"It is our belief that buildings should be able to change, not only in plan, but in",Paragraph
"section and elevation, allowing people the freedom to do their own things, the order",Paragraph
and scale and grain coming from a clear understanding and expression of the process,Paragraph
"of building, and the optimization of each individual element, its system, of manufac-",Paragraph
"ture, storage, transportation, erection and connection, all within a clearly defined and",Paragraph
rational framework. This framework must allow people to perform freely inside and,Paragraph
"out, to change and adapt, in answer to technical or client needs, this free and",Paragraph
changing performance becoming an expression of the architecture of the building —a,Paragraph
giant Meccano set rather than the traditional static transparent or solid doll’s house.,Paragraph
Exciting things happen when a variety of overlapping activities designed for all peo-,Paragraph
"ple, the old and the young, the blue and white collar workers, locals and visitors all",Paragraph
"meet, opening up the possibility of interaction outside institutional limits. When this",Paragraph
"takes place, deprived areas become dynamic places where all can participate, rather",Paragraph
than less or more beautiful ghettos.”,Paragraph
The common rhetoric embraced the cause for buildings to be more lightweight,Paragraph
"and responsive, acknowledging that culture was in the midst of an electronic and",Paragraph
computer revolution that would push architecture beyond its old terrain of,Paragraph
established answers.'°,Paragraph
The idea of a building as a giant Meccano — or Erector — set was particularly,Paragraph
"reminiscent of Peter Cook’s Plug-in-City (1964), a megastructural proposal in",Paragraph
"which all the components had designated lifespans, from the masts, ties, and con-",Paragraph
"nections of the structure itself, to the clip-on pods that accommodated urban activ-",Paragraph
"ity. In its understanding of culture as information, the Pompidou Center also",Paragraph
harkened back to Archigram’s “Instant City’(1968) project that had as its goal,Paragraph
the delivery of information from the city to the farther flung provinces and vice,Paragraph
versa. Collage illustrations told the story of how the travelling components of,Paragraph
the Instant City would arrive at a “sleeping town” and thoroughly infiltrate the,Paragraph
ocale by creating an event through which a network of information and entertain-,Paragraph
"ment would take over. Thus, cultural activity would be spread far afield from the",Paragraph
"usual concentrations in major cities. Likewise, on the very first page of the",Paragraph
"Pompidou Center competition entry Rogers and Piano, too, proposed that the",Paragraph
building be “developed as a ‘Live Centre of Information’ covering Paris and,Paragraph
"beyond. Locally, it was to be a meeting place for the people. The Plateau",Paragraph
Beaubourg information centre would be linked up with information dispersal,Paragraph
"and collection centers, throughout France and beyond; for example, university cen-",Paragraph
"ters, town halls, etc.”'! Thus, the network of cultural exchange would take over.",Paragraph
The theme of culture presented as the democratization of information and,Paragraph
thoroughly linked to structural flexibility was also directly connected to the work,Paragraph
"of Cedric Price, whom both Archigram and Rogers admired for his commitment to",Paragraph
"indeterminacy at every stage of the design process. For Price, architecture was",Paragraph
"always conceived primarily as program, with a result that may or may not turn",Paragraph
"out to be a building. The Fun Palace (1961-65), in particular, was a source of inspi-",Paragraph
ration for the Pompidou Center. This unexecuted project that Price designed as a,Paragraph
"“people’s theater” for the politically-driven theater company of Joan Littlewood,",Caption
"was, like the Pompidou, conceived of as less of a building and more of an instru-",Paragraph
"ment of social change Price had an ideal client for this sort of proposal, unlike the",Paragraph
governmental agency that Piano and Rogers had to convince about the complex-,Paragraph
"ities of the cultural notions of leisure at this time. From the start, for example, Price",Paragraph
and Littlewood interchangeably used the words “learning” and “fun” to describe,Paragraph
_ 8 Dm,Title
"Littlewood’s ideal theater, improvisation and participation from performers and",Paragraph
audience alike would be encouraged by the environmental conditions surrounding,Paragraph
the activities.,Paragraph
Littlewood wanted a center with no designated program or even a set of fixed activ-,Paragraph
ities. Price translated this “brief” into an “anti-building” with no specific form or fixed,Paragraph
floor plan.’’ There is no doubt that the vision portrayed by Price in the Fun Palace was,Paragraph
more radically flexible than the Pompidou could ever be. While the Pompidou Center,Paragraph
"deployed tensile and compressive structure in a novel way, Price wanted to do more",Paragraph
than reconceive architecture in the light of advanced building technologies. The Fun,Paragraph
"Palace was essentially a system for moving things around, depending on what the",Paragraph
space was being used for at any designated time. With the assistance of the structural,Paragraph
"engineer Frank Newby, the Fun Palace was designed as a structural grid of towers that",Paragraph
contained the circulation and services that allowed for flexibility of program in the,Paragraph
bays. The frame was the only permanent part of the structure. Gantry cranes,Paragraph
"mounted on rails provided the means for redeploying the floor, wall, and ceiling mod-",Paragraph
ules and other variable elements within the spaces. There were even moving walk-,Paragraph
"ways and pivoting escalators. To further increase responsivity, the project drew on the",Paragraph
"expertise of the cybenetician Gordon Pask, who was well versed in the application of",Paragraph
the emerging technologies that Archigram only envisioned. The cybernetic element,Paragraph
allowed the input of feedback into the adjustable system to further its responsivity,Paragraph
"during use. As Price would say about the Fun Palace, it was only meant to be “a",Paragraph
"kit of parts, not a building. I doubt that it will ever look the same twice.”'*",Paragraph
"Banham, who vocally promoted the agendas of Archigram and Price throughout",Paragraph

"their interpretations. In the January 1980 issue of Domus magazine, Manfredo",Paragraph

"century Teatrum Mundi, the reference is purely literary. For Tafuri, the floating",Paragraph
"theater as a “closed and frozen form, destined to appear temporarily as an object",Paragraph
in the polyphonic space of St. Mark’s basin contains in itself a homage to the sense,Paragraph
"of limit, to the Albertian concept of finitio, which is specifically anti-Venetian.””",Paragraph
From this elevated pronouncement Tafuri proceeds to relate the compositional,Paragraph

theory and practice that was not always without tension. At one of the later ANY,Paragraph
"conferences, Koolhaas, for example, would speak of the “Giedion metaphor” in",Paragraph
which thinkers adopted “architects as illustrators of their theories” only to realize that,Paragraph
their theories were “badly explained or imperfectly illustrated.””,Paragraph
One of the key moments during the reformulation of the discipline was the com-,Paragraph

red cubes — structures that he understood as empty huts for unprescribed point-like,Paragraph
"activities, folies in a constructivist red for no specific function but with the spacing",Paragraph
"for events yet to come. In her chapter on the park, Julia Czerniak points out that",Paragraph
Tschumi’s la Villette not only challenged the conventions between form and pro-,Paragraph
gram but that the structures were robust enough to accommodate change and,Paragraph
"were, therefore, most resilient and “likely to survive.”",Paragraph
"As the competition brief demanded, Tschumi and Koolhaas — who had both",Paragraph
"taught at the AA in London — proposed an urban park, responding to the city",Paragraph
and reworking the common notions of the nineteenth-century garden. These pro-,Paragraph
jects no longer escaped urbanity but instead drew from its culture and contributed,Paragraph
"to it. Mining the city with the help of situationist techniques, constructivist visuals,",Paragraph
"and surrealist mentalities led Tschumi to conclude that, just as there is no architec-",Paragraph
"ture without events, there is also “no architecture without the city, no city without",Paragraph
"architecture.”* Or, to put it differently, architecture only exists because of the city.",Paragraph
"The contemporary city became for Tschumi the true inventor of cross-, trans-, and",Paragraph
"dis-programming and, therefore, remained the constant point of reference. This",Paragraph
city of emergent events would not only recast what exists but would also shape,Paragraph
"a different kind of city, together with its buildings, both constructed by events.",Paragraph
"More than recasting what the city is, it would suggest what the city could be.",Paragraph
What the urban manifestos of the 1960s and 1970s speculated was tested in the,Paragraph
"city in the 1980s. Delirious New York, for example, examined the city of flux and",Paragraph
congestion and extrapolated lessons as a retroactive manifesto of “Manhattanism”,Paragraph
"that OMA, in turn, aimed back at the city. Here, selective episodes within",Paragraph
Manhattan and Coney Island (between 1890 and 1940) were viewed as generators,Paragraph
"of architectural experiments that had remained unnoticed, waiting to be theorized.",Paragraph
Koolhaas drew attention to the divide between the unconscious building of met-,Paragraph
"ropolitan architecture inflected by the constraints of the city (as in the policies, laws,",Paragraph
and economies of New York City) versus the conscious construction of theories,Paragraph
without limitations that remain unbuilt (as in the avant-gardes of the 1920s and,Paragraph
1930s). The architectural mutations that the city provoked and Koolhaas excavated,Paragraph
were later reassembled through a kind of constructive surgery in the laboratories of,Paragraph
OMA. What began as “exquisite corpses” in true surrealist fashion developed into,Paragraph
architectures of and for the metropolis by internalizing the city’s delirium.,Paragraph
"Roberto Gargiani’s chapter on OMA’s Kunsthal, for example, describes how",Paragraph
structural “pliable surfaces” were understood as “streets” that simultaneously con-,Paragraph
figured the exhibition spaces and connected the building to the avenue and park of,Paragraph

tectural urbanism. The ground level was devoted to the minutiae of border control,Paragraph
"and the passage of traffic through the building and into the underground parking,",Paragraph
making the structure essentially part of the Berlin Wall that Koolhaas had,Paragraph
previously studied.,Paragraph
"As OMA worked toward completing the building, world-changing events took",Paragraph
place almost overnight. They would radically alter the make-up of the globe. The,Paragraph
fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and Nelson Mandela’s release from prison in 1990,Title
changed the constellation and dynamics of the world order in the subsequent,Paragraph
phases of these developments. The distinct national colorations and sovereignty,Paragraph
of nation-states was increasingly questioned as the large ideological blocs were left,Paragraph
"behind by a new de-territorialized globalization, which had profound effects on",Paragraph
"architecture and urbanism.” In the case of the Checkpoint Charlie Apartments,",Paragraph

"references from earlier constructivist experiments, the distinctions between land",Paragraph
and building became blurred.,Paragraph
Frank Gehry had already investigated notions of fragmentation and diversity to,Paragraph
form not only a new architectural geometry but also a new context for it in his,Paragraph
early buildings in California. According to Richard Sommer’s chapter on the,Paragraph
"Guggenheim Museum of Bilbao, these experiments had a great influence on his",Paragraph
later work in general and the Guggenheim in particular. Gehry’s Bilbao was to uti-,Paragraph
lize the capacities of this work and subsequently transform the image of the city in,Paragraph
"terms of its global perception, from a little known shipbuilding Basque capital into a",Paragraph
globally acknowledged cultural destination. The time span from design to con-,Paragraph
struction (1991-97) neatly coincided with the commercialization and rapid wide-,Paragraph
"spread use of the Internet, which brought images of the shimmering surfaces of",Paragraph

The former amplified a desire for photogenic urban objects (such as Bilbao) in poli-,Paragraph

"in automobile and aerospace technology, eased the manipulation of surfaces and",Paragraph

Repetition of a different kind — the one that interplays with variation in order to,Paragraph

"by Gehry’s intuitive surface modulations was a fascination long in the making,",Paragraph
dating at the very least to Erich Mendelsohn’s dynamic surface transitions and,Paragraph
Frederick Kiesler’s “polydimensional” spatial trials. These disciplinary ambitions,Paragraph
culminated in the mid-1990s in projects such as Toyo Ito’s Sendai Mediatheque,Paragraph
and the Yokohama International Ferry Terminal by Foreign Office Architects,Caption
(FOA). The chapter by Helene Furjan shows how FOA’s winning scheme capita-,Paragraph
lized on architectural visualization techniques and programmatic demands. As she,Paragraph
"writes: “It was not an autonomous entity but a hybrid organization, meshed to its",Paragraph
"environment, in a constant flux of thermodynamic and socio-political intensities.”",Paragraph
The visualization of complex relationships in a technologically saturated and,Paragraph
globally connected world was also on Toyo Ito’s mind when he first thought of,Paragraph
“blurring architecture.” Ito imagined an architecture between the visible (pre-,Paragraph
dominantly static) world of things and the largely invisible (ever increasing) net-,Paragraph
works of information technology. “Can I as an architect provide this ‘invisible,Paragraph

Ito’s ambitions. Not only does the mesh of tubular steel structure hold all the,Paragraph

important is the spatial delineation fostered by the shifts of these members on,Paragraph

A similar poetics and sensuality is at work in the buildings of Tadao Ando.,Paragraph

THE PROJECT AND ITS AFTERLIFE,Title

"ism. Since 1976, when the firstideas competition was held, to the present, its impact and",Paragraph
import have seemed wildly diverse depending upon the lens through which it is,Paragraph
viewed: the socialist agenda of President Francois Mitterrand’s Grands Projets; the,Paragraph
deconstructivist ambitions of architecture at the time; or through its contribution to,Paragraph
"ongoing discussions about the history, theory, and practice of making urban parks.",Paragraph
The aim of this chapter is threefold. The first objective is descriptive: to recount,Paragraph
"the significance of the competition site, the ambitions of the 1982 design competition",Paragraph
"brief, and the intent of and physical proposal for the winning scheme. The second is",Paragraph
to discuss the impact of the proposed design while the park was being built and its,Paragraph
"import still unfolding, evidenced in architectural and landscape publications. The",Paragraph
last is retrospectively to lookat the built work itselfand think forward about its impact,Paragraph
on urbanism and landscape design at the beginning of the twenty-first century.,Paragraph
To look again at La Villette in these ways is to see it with renewed clarity. We are,Paragraph
reminded of its vibrant life during the time of post-structuralism. We also recog-,Paragraph
nize that concerns within landscape and urbanism over the last 20 years allow us to,Paragraph
"project its afterlife. In other words, if its life in theory is over, then what essential",Paragraph
part of its identity — which only time has allowed us to understand — lives on?,Paragraph
Shaping Influence,Title
"La Villette is at once associated with a vibrant, evolving district in Paris’ 19th arrondisse-",Paragraph

influential yet controversial urban landscape. Although the plot of land for the com-,Paragraph
petition and subsequent park is 135 acres (the largest park built since Baron Haussmann,Paragraph
"transformed Paris), the project’s area of influence extends well beyond these edges.",Paragraph
The history of the site can be seen as an evolution of well-connected infrastruc-,Paragraph
"tural improvements. Within the larger landscape, the eighteenth-century suburb of",Paragraph
La Villette grew along two arterial roads situated in a plain between the Butte de,Paragraph
Montmartre and Buttes-Chaumont.’ A nineteenth-century program of public,Paragraph
works continued to transform the site: canals were built to provide drinking water,Paragraph
(1812); the ramparts of Thiers were constructed to secure the city (1859); and a,Paragraph
"centrally combined cattle market and abattoir, linked to a rail network, animated",Paragraph
the area’s economy and urban life (1867). These improvements catalyzed La,Paragraph
Villette as an important industrial hub and its subsequent annexation to Paris.,Paragraph
"The abattoir and market were extraordinarily lively, employing more than 3,000",Paragraph
people and supporting them with shops and restaurants.”,Paragraph
Infrastructural changes transformed the site over time: the rampart was dis-,Paragraph
"mantled, making way for the Boulevard périphérique; large-scale housing was built",Paragraph
"on the abattoir’s edges; and in the early 1970s, with the closing of the abattoirs,",Paragraph
buildings were abandoned and the district began its decline.’ The plot that was,Paragraph
"acquired for redevelopment by the state, and subsequently confronted by",Paragraph

"site, the call of the brief only supported the facts. It already was the city.",Paragraph
The brief for the international design competition for Parc de la Villette was so,Paragraph
advanced in its aspirations that it largely anticipated the results. Its ambitions were,Paragraph
threefold: to be a new model that rethought how parks would appear and perform,Paragraph
in the contemporary city; to provide a complex cultural program; and to act as a,Paragraph
catalyst for the redevelopment of the La Villette area.,Paragraph
"To set a context for a new park model, the brief included thoughtful criticism of",Paragraph
historic French parks. It noted that whereas seventeenth- and eighteenth-century,Paragraph
"parks offered rich places of diverse social exchange, nineteenth-century terrains",Paragraph
offered pleasant spaces to wander away from the discomforts of the industrial city.,Paragraph
"Parks today — the competitors were told — were “simple, impoverished green spaces”",Paragraph
"used mostly by the young and old.” Suggesting that “life and the city are elsewhere,”",Paragraph
"the organizers asked for the new park to “reveal the riches of urbanism,” “exercise",Paragraph
"the body and the mind,” and be “a garden of cultural superabundance.””",Paragraph
This call for a park as “cultural instrument” was enabled by a heterogeneous and,Paragraph
"dense program of both dispersed and concentrated facilities, including kiosks, infor-",Paragraph
"mation centers, discovery gardens, thermal baths, a skating rink, playgrounds, res-",Paragraph
"taurants, snack bars, picnic areas, a post office, a police station, cycle paths, car parks,",Paragraph
and administration offices — a program for which the area of the site could scarcely,Paragraph
provide.’ Not only were competitors confronted with accommodating the pro-,Paragraph
"gram’s variety and day- and year-long use, they were also asked to give the park",Paragraph
"a new image. As part of French culture, gardens (and by extension parks) reflect",Paragraph
a vision of the world.’ The Parc de la Villette competition brief called for innovation,Paragraph
not just in terms of use (how the park worked) but also iconography and symbolism,Paragraph
(how the park looked) — an important point with respect to its current relevancy.,Paragraph
"Finally, the brief expressed political and social aims. Like parks before it, Pare de",Paragraph
la Villette was to be a catalyst for the redevelopment of the adjacent city. Its con-,Paragraph
"nection to transportation infrastructure, to millions of inhabitants, and to housing",Paragraph
"made the plot of land well suited for this role.’ Aptly put by the organizers, the park",Paragraph
"was therefore “no longer the lung but the heart of the district,” a powerful analogy",Paragraph
that continues to serve park making.’°,Paragraph
Over 470 entries from more than 40 countries were submitted to address these,Paragraph
ambitious challenges.'’ In 1983 French-Swiss architect Bernard Tschumi was,Paragraph
awarded the commission for the initial phase of the park’s construction. Tschumi’s,Paragraph
"winning response was conceived as a “large metropolitan venture, derived from",Paragraph
the disjunctions and disassociations of our time” and subsequently described as,Paragraph
“the largest discontinuous building in the world.””” The project cleverly addressed,Paragraph
the briefs numerous unknowns — the complexity and changing nature of the pro-,Paragraph
"gram, anticipated shifts in political structures and social needs, and the chief archi-",Paragraph
tect’s role to coordinate the design contributions of others — by advancing an,Paragraph
organizing structure that could exist independent of use.’,Paragraph
"To this end, Tschumi deployed three organizational systems across the site:",Paragraph
"points, lines, and surfaces. The points (a system of objects) are 26 10 m-cube folies",Paragraph
organized on a 120 m grid. The lines (a system of movement) are a path of thematic,Paragraph
"gardens, allées of trees, and covered north-south and east-west galleries. The sur-",Paragraph
faces (a system of spaces) are large expanses of space for activities such as games,Paragraph
"and markets.'* Although superimposed, each system has its own logic. The folies",Paragraph
"produced an imageable park by their accumulation of red color and cubic form, and",Paragraph
each could be transformed based on specific programmatic needs (from a work-,Paragraph
"shop to a café, for instance). Two axial galleries made important urban connections.",Paragraph
"The north-south gallery, conceived as a public street, connected two metro stops,",Paragraph
"Porte de Pantin to the south and Porte de la Villette to the north, and linked other",Paragraph
park functions.'* The east-west gallery paralleled the Canal de l’Ourcq (which,Paragraph
extends from Claude Nicolas Ledoux’s Villa Rotunda to the suburbs) and acted,Paragraph
as an elevated viewing platform for the park. The system of surfaces consisted,Paragraph
of programmatically determined places with attendant material definition.,Paragraph
Tschumi asserted that the “the overlay of systems creates a carefully staged series,Paragraph
"of tensions that enhances the dynamism of the park,” all the while emphasizing",Paragraph
discovery and variety.'°,Paragraph
"The resulting park is both formal and conceptual. On the one hand, its organ-",Paragraph
izational systems provided a sort of resiliency to its evolution and management.,Paragraph
"The competition text stated, “It was clear that the elements of the program were",Paragraph
interchangeable and that budgets and priorities could be altered.”’” To this end,Paragraph

"concepts such as superimposition, architectural combination, and cinematic land-",Paragraph

"organizing structure that could exist independent of use, a structure without center",Paragraph

Measuring Impact,Title
The winning scheme generated much discussion and debate in architecture and,Paragraph
"landscape architecture circles while its design was developed. In architecture,",Paragraph
the park fueled a debate between theoretically motivated design agendas and more,Paragraph
"traditional approaches to urban design. For landscape architecture, its reception",Paragraph
was mixed. Some welcomed its challenge to the popular understanding of the,Paragraph
appearance and performance of contemporary parks. Others were dismayed at,Paragraph
its dismissal of a rich and complex tradition of park making.,Paragraph
Tschumi himself published extensively on his competition entry’s contribution,Paragraph
to architectural discourse and in so doing articulated two broad ambitions: to desta-,Paragraph
bilize architectural conventions and to rewrite the relationship between theory and,Paragraph
practice. In his book Cinégramme folie (1987) — which includes the project descrip-,Paragraph
"tion he submitted to the jury, essays on the competition submission, and references",Paragraph
to earlier projects that informed it — Tschumi positioned the project in relation to,Paragraph
"the literary theory of deconstruction, particularly the thesis that linguistic meaning",Paragraph
is both over-determined and indeterminate.’ He explained the design’s aim to use,Paragraph
operations such as superimposition and permutation to challenge the convention-,Paragraph
"ally determined relationship between form and program, reconceptualizing it as",Paragraph
“combinatory” event versus designated function.” — “Deconstructing,Paragraph
"architecture,” he wrote, “involved dismantling its conventions, using concepts",Paragraph
"derived both from architecture and from elsewhere — from cinema, literary criti-",Paragraph
"cism and other disciplines.” More specifically, “deconstructing a given program",Paragraph
"meant showing that the program could challenge the very ideology it implied.””""",Paragraph
"To this end, Pare de la Villette was intended to produce conflict, fragmentation, and",Paragraph
"play, and — more broadly — to offer a vision of postmodernity that radically dis-",Paragraph
rupted meaning and established the framework for its social production.”,Paragraph
"As an outstanding example of these ambitions, the project was one of seven fea-",Paragraph

"mi’s ongoing critique of modernism’s principles, but it attracted much criticism.”*",Paragraph
"For instance, historian Robin Evans noted that while Tschumi’s deconstructivist",Paragraph
"claims were adequately demonstrated in words and pictures, “La Villette is far less",Paragraph
transgressive than Haussmann’s planned butchery which it replaces.”””,Paragraph
Evans alluded to another important impact of La Villette. As the editors of The,Paragraph
"SAGE Handbook of Architectural Theory describe it, the project’s self-conscious the-",Paragraph
oretical stance not only launched new discourses through which to critique built,Paragraph

"other words, the project was a system of representation made up of words, draw-",Paragraph
"ings, and the built work.",Paragraph
In an interview with architectural educator Alvin Boyarsky in La Case Vide,Paragraph
"(1985), Tschumi contextualized this point by noting his theoretical thinking behind",Paragraph
La Villette and some ambitions for post-1968 architecture.” He described how his,Paragraph
"earlier competition scheme for Parc de la Villette (1976), disappointing in its tra-",Paragraph
"ditional approach of restitching the city, led to the start of his drawing series",Paragraph

"and program, and objects and events).”* In these ways, La Villette’s programmatic",Paragraph

it more difficult to separate the theory of work — a place in which to develop con-,Paragraph

"Regardless of their theoretical foundation, when T’schumi’s architectural preoc-",Paragraph
"cupations hit the ground they inevitably became a landscape. As such, they encoun-",Paragraph
tered landscape architecture’s typical set of concerns: the role of parks in the city,Paragraph
and the pictorial conventions that define their appearance. The program for this,Paragraph
park was part of a larger system of cultural efforts under President Mitterrand’s,Paragraph
"socialist agenda, which aimed not only to reassert the cultural prominence of Paris,",Paragraph
"but also to produce a new public. In her provocative book on the Grands Projets,",Paragraph
architect and critic Annette Fierro explained that significant interventions in the,Paragraph
public realm — so important to the Parisian consciousness — illustrate “the state’s,Paragraph
responsibility and potential to advance culture over and above that of private enter-,Paragraph
prise.”’® The park was no longer a place to disperse and console discontented fac-,Paragraph
"tory workers, as it was in the nineteenth century, it was to become a place to gather",Paragraph
and educate crowds. Tschumi thought similarly: “the park forms part of the vision,Paragraph
of the city.”*’ His prose describing his competition submission in fact restates the,Paragraph
"missive of the competition brief, favoring a new urban park based on “cultural",Paragraph
"invention, education, and entertainment.”””",Paragraph
Landscape critics received this park variously. Landscape architect James Corner,Paragraph
characterized it as the “single most significant project in terms of forging a new,Paragraph
"architecture of the landscape.”*? Noting its controversy, he still advocates on its",Paragraph
"behalf for the way it challenged the traditional role of nature in the city, “bringing",Paragraph
"the density, congestion, and richness of the city to the park.”** In an essay written",Paragraph
"10 years after the park competition, landscape architect Christophe Girot expresses",Paragraph
less enthusiasm about “dismissing all traditional ideas related to the conventional,Paragraph
"uses of plants and other natural materials in park design,” but nonetheless recounts",Paragraph
the fascination with the project in French landscape architecture circles.*” Perhaps,Paragraph
the strongest reactions to La Villette were ignited by Tschumi’s overt simplification,Paragraph
of and covert disdain for the rich traditions of park making. To those who appre-,Paragraph
"ciated the complex history of parks, statements such as “we oppose the notion of",Paragraph
"Olmsted, widespread throughout the 19% century, that ‘in the park, the city is not",Paragraph
supposed to exist” were inflammatory.*°,Paragraph
Landscape historian and theorist Elizabeth K. Meyer challenges this through a,Paragraph
careful comparison of Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand’s Pare des Buttes-Chaumont,Paragraph
"and La Villette, despite Tschumi’s claim to radically break with tradition. Despite",Paragraph
"their age difference of more than 100 years, both are characterized by systems of",Paragraph
"circulation that acknowledge the presence of the city and, Meyer argues, strategies",Paragraph
"of superimposition — with systems of surfaces, lines, and points. In this way, Meyer",Paragraph
"says, Alphand’s nineteenth-century park “moves beyond the picturesque by fusing",Paragraph
its tradition with the facts of modern urban life.”*” She concludes by arguing that La,Paragraph
Villette’s radicalism lies in its lack of engagement with the specifics of the site; what,Paragraph
she calls a “non-landscape park” that fails to engage the most important system —,Paragraph
"the landscape itself. Meyer’s text confronts misconceptions that were, and continue",Paragraph
"to be, prevalent in the discipline of landscape architecture — namely that the city and",Paragraph
the park are mutually exclusive. This simplification devalues landscape history and,Paragraph
"its nuances. Despite her critique, Meyer acknowledged that La Villette is nonethe-",Paragraph
"less useful for landscape design, a discipline that all too often is “wallowing in kitsch",Paragraph
"and in the image of the picturesque.”** Indeed, seen as a collection of landscape",Paragraph
"representations, La Villette’s innovative diagrams and drawings challenged the pic-",Paragraph
torial tradition in landscape.”,Paragraph
Projecting Import,Title
"On the occasion of La Villette’s 10-year anniversary, the journal Documents’ editor",Paragraph
Miwon Kwon referred to it as “not only one of the largest but probably the most,Paragraph
"talked about, argued over, and publicized urban design project of the late twentieth",Paragraph
"century.”*° More recently, the editors of The SAGE Handbook of Architectural Theory",Paragraph
"offered provocative wordplay, suggesting the importance of acquiring new ways to",Paragraph
"understand it: “With its architectural fabric worn in, there is also an unavoidable",Paragraph
sense that Pare de la Villette’s theory has worn thin.”*”,Paragraph
So what of the possibilities of looking back at La Villette now as a way to think,Paragraph
forward? How has it informed the development of park design at the turn of this,Paragraph
"century and, more importantly, beyond?",Paragraph
The organizational frameworks so intrinsic to La Villette’s identity are now thor-,Paragraph
"oughly absorbed in design culture as a strategy for making parks. Nevertheless,",Paragraph
they have been expanded in important ways. The change and complexity these,Paragraph
frameworks enabled at La Villette — created in space — are now expanded in time.,Paragraph
"An example of this expansion is Downsview Park in Toronto. Second, the compe-",Paragraph
tition’s preoccupations with a park’s performance attempted to suspend questions,Paragraph
ofa landscape’s appearance. La Villette reminds us of important lessons regarding a,Paragraph
"park’s imageability. Finally, and perhaps most unlikely, the seeds of resilient design",Paragraph
— where a park is able to absorb willful and unforeseen change and maintain its,Paragraph
identity — were sown in T’schumi’s winning scheme.,Paragraph
Although La Villette and Downsview Park competition schemes were devel-,Paragraph
"oped almost 20 years apart in vastly different cultural and political milieus, the",Paragraph
merit of comparing them is suggested by what appears to be an autobiographical,Paragraph
diagram in Tschumi’s scheme for Downsview.” This diagram suggests shifts in his,Paragraph
"design work, and perhaps landscape work in general, since Parc de la Villette. One",Paragraph
important shift is that the Downsview competitors almost universally favored the,Paragraph
design of frameworks that organize parks systems over forms that define them.’,Paragraph
These frameworks are both infrastructural and administrative. They appear,Paragraph
"diversely as strategic organizations, dynamic infrastructures, provisional programs,",Paragraph
and participatory processes. The organizational frameworks of T'schumi’s scheme —,Paragraph
"spools (collections of diverse and changing programs), screens (for announcements",Paragraph
"and scintillating images), and digits (fingers of diverse landscapes) — replace the",Paragraph
"superimposition of points (follies), lines (galleries), and surfaces (gardens) that",Paragraph
organized La Villette. Tschumi’s earlier preoccupation with discontinuity is here,Paragraph
"updated in a scheme that advances a continuous landscape enabling flows of water,",Paragraph
"wildlife, and people across it.",Paragraph
The resulting project favors time over space. Its systems enable more contem-,Paragraph
porary concerns of ecological emergence and change — concerns that were devel-,Paragraph
oped in even more sophisticated ways in other submissions to the competition.,Paragraph
"Landscape architect James Corner and architect Stan Allen’s proposal, aptly named",Paragraph
"“Emergent Ecology,” advances a “carefully gauged framework — a matrix of inter-",Paragraph
"acting systems” of “circuits” (which accommodate activity programs, event spaces,",Paragraph
and circulation) and “through flows” (which support all the hydrological and eco-,Paragraph
ogical dynamics of the site) — that is both integrative and flexible.** The proposal’s,Paragraph
"potential for multivalent articulation (flows, for instance, can be a continuous",Paragraph
"meadow, a drift of lights, a drainage system, or a tree line) hence direct and support",Paragraph
a number of potential outcomes. This development of organizational frameworks’,Paragraph
potential continues years later in Corner’s scheme for the Freshkills Landfill,Paragraph

the winning scheme can be articulated by multiple material realities — unlike,Paragraph
"the singularity of Tschumi’s points, lines and surfaces — thus enabling the park’s",Paragraph
"robust identity despite the radical changes that are an inevitable part of any large,",Paragraph
long-term work.,Paragraph
The preoccupation of proposing frameworks over designing form in the Downs-,Paragraph

"mi’s winning scheme, he argues, “represented a quantum leap in the development",Paragraph
of landscape urbanism by formulating landscape as the most suitable medium,Paragraph
through which to order programmatic and political change over time.”””,Paragraph
Such preoccupations with a park’s performance — from the scale of the medium,Paragraph
"to that of the metropolis — raise a compelling question to which, surprisingly, La",Paragraph
Villette might offer clues to an answer. Must landscapes that are conceptualized,Paragraph
and formed through complex processes rely solely on these processes for their,Paragraph
"image, or, can performative agendas be reconciled with representational ones?",Paragraph
Many of the La Villette competitors’ emphases on infrastructural frameworks,Paragraph
"and complex processes try to delay, or even suspend, this question. Certainly",Paragraph
"the growth of habitats within these parks will affect its visual identity, planned",Paragraph
"and unplanned activities will leave traces on the park’s surfaces, and processes",Paragraph
"of soil remediation might temporarily yield fields of clover and alfalfa. Nonetheless,",Paragraph
these effects are subtle and fail to produce strong park identities.,Paragraph
"It is not surprising, therefore, that the winning scheme for Downsview Park,",Paragraph
"Tree City by the Office for Metropolitan Architecture and Bruce Mau, not only",Paragraph
"promised an ecological design that would emerge over time, but also offered",Paragraph
"the park organizers and future users an identifiable image. The signature clusters,",Paragraph
"or dots, that appear in the scheme and its representation are precisely how Tree",Paragraph
"City was popularly recognized. Just as important, a big green dot, understood",Paragraph
"as the park’s logo, gave it an immediate and marketable identity that promised",Paragraph
to stand for the park during the years of its making. The competition organizers,Paragraph
for La Villette asked for a symbol for the park of the twenty-first century. Notwith-,Paragraph
"standing all of La Villette’s other successes, Tschumi’s scheme advances land-",Paragraph
scape’s imaging potential as an asset. The field of red follies is the image of the,Paragraph

resilience is the ability of a system to experience disturbance (such as a fire) and,Paragraph

capacity for resilience lies in the strategic design of its organizational systems —,Paragraph

the park thus enables the addition of buildings (such as the Metropolitan Museum of,Paragraph
"Art), the conversion of space (from the reservoir to the Great Lawn to ball fields), and",Paragraph
the shift of management strategies (that allow the Ramble to be a place for either,Paragraph
people or birds) without the park’s essential character being destroyed.,Paragraph
"La Villette’s superimposed systems (the grid of follies, the ribbon of theme gardens)",Paragraph
can be seen in the same way. They enable a robust structure to which changes can be,Paragraph
made — from the shifting of folie program to the accommodation of other designers’,Paragraph
work — all the while maintaining the park’s winning identity. The park schemes that,Paragraph
"are most resilient to change are the most likely to survive, regardless of whether",Paragraph
"change is initiated through politics, economics, public will, or natural process. To",Paragraph
"think again about La Villette, more than 30 years after the competition, provides",Paragraph
the opportunity to register specific sensibilities of thought and work at the time,Paragraph
and to track their sophisticated development in the contemporary landscape. The life,Paragraph
"of the project — as a competition scheme, as a discourse in publication, and on the",Paragraph
ground as a lived experience — will no doubt continue to unfold.”,Paragraph
La Villette was designed at a time that did not yet foresee the context of global,Paragraph
environmental change in which designers must currently operate. Resilience,Paragraph
"today, not just at the scale of park design but also at the scale of regions, takes",Paragraph
on new meaning. The design community is no longer asking why resilient design,Paragraph
"matters. The challenge is how we innovatively produce and pay for it. To this end,",Paragraph
"philanthropic organizations such as the Rockefeller Foundation, within the context",Paragraph
"of their 100 Resilient Cities Centennial Challenge, offer a contemporary and provoc-",Paragraph
"ative framework for economic, social, and ecologic resilience. The categories",Paragraph
"they advance — “safe failure,” “flexibility,” “spare capacity,” “rapid rebound,” and",Paragraph
“constant learning” — catalyze this important conversation.,Paragraph
"With twenty-first-century events surrounding global warming and sea level rise,",Paragraph
designers’ love affair with change has certainly been recontextualized. Resilience is,Paragraph
now about the survival of some of our most vital landscapes. The innovative design,Paragraph
"of parks certainly has a role to play. Notwithstanding all that it is and all that it does,",Paragraph
it is hard to now imagine Parc de La Villette as “the park of the twenty-first,Paragraph
century.” That project is now our most current and urgent concern.,Paragraph

THE NON-HUMAN,Title
The very first commission of Herzog & de Meuron outside the surroundings of their,Paragraph
"native city of Basel, where they founded their office in 1978, was a vacation house in",Paragraph
the Italian region of Liguria. The project started in 1982 and the building was com-,Paragraph
"pleted in 1988. The house is located near the village of Tavole, about 10 kilometers",Paragraph
"from the Mediterranean coast, halfway between Genoa and Nice. Liguria belongs to",Paragraph
"the south-western extremity of the Alps and is characterized by high mountains,",Paragraph
"steep valleys, and a combination of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation. The area",Paragraph
"near the coastal port towns has been used for the cultivation of olives since antiquity,",Paragraph
but in the late twentieth century the hinterland was struck by depopulation and,Paragraph
"many of the orchards in the old man-made terraces, which structure the landscape,",Paragraph
had fallen into decay. When the building was published under the title of Stone,Paragraph
House in 1988 its resonance among the architectural community was striking.,Paragraph
Together with a handful of other small buildings it triggered Herzog & de Meuron’s,Paragraph
"international breakthrough. Like the Stone House, they all bear characteristic names,",Paragraph
"such as the Blue House (1980), the House for a Veterinary Surgeon (1984), the",Paragraph
"Plywood House (1985), and the House for an Art Collector (1987).",Paragraph
Do these names allow us to look at these buildings from a different angle than,Paragraph
"merely from an architectural perspective? Should we look at them as works of art,",Paragraph
"as characters in a play, or as chapters that stand for different architectural themes? If",Paragraph
"so, what could be the architectural theme evoked by the Stone House? I would",Paragraph
argue that the main issue of the project is the complex relationship between the,Paragraph
"human and the non-human; in other words, the tension between the human scale,",Paragraph
"its everyday surroundings, activities and dimensions, which go beyond the control",Paragraph
and understanding of humans. The key component of the project is obviously the,Paragraph
"material of stone, both in a literal and a metaphorical sense. After all, the house",Paragraph
"mainly consists of rubble and artificial stone, namely poured concrete. Its appear-",Paragraph
"ance, at first sight, is stable. Stones are objects where the man-made and the natural,",Paragraph
"in other words the human and the non-human, meet. Again, they are the result of",Paragraph

trast of spectacular beauty on the one hand and signs of economic decline on the,Paragraph
other? The lot is located on a slope overlooking a valley. It contained the ruins ofan,Paragraph
older building and the remnants of the terraces once used for olive cultivation.,Paragraph
"Herzog & de Meuron started with a concrete skeleton, which literally conquers",Paragraph
and domesticates the abandoned site. Its modular structure seems to arch over,Paragraph
the uneven rocky surface of the terrain and triumph over gravity. The cantilevered,Paragraph
terrace does not touch the ground. The skeleton is obviously man-made and could,Paragraph
theoretically expand over the entire landscape — not unlike the utopian collages of,Paragraph
the Continuous Monument by the Italian group Superstudio in the late 1960s. Its,Paragraph
"orthogonal structure evokes the human dream to rationalize, survey, and control",Paragraph
nature. But the concrete structure not only recalls the age-old aspiration of archi-,Paragraph
tects to expand in space and to dominate the land; it also refers to a much more,Paragraph
"mundane phenomenon, namely, the fact that most new houses on the Italian coun-",Paragraph

pleted houses with half-finished brick walls and reinforcement rods sprouting from,Paragraph
the roughly cast concrete skeleton is a typical sight in the area. Herzog & de,Paragraph
Meuron have repeatedly referred to this everyday phenomenon. In one of the con-,Paragraph
"ceptual sketches by Jacques Herzog one can read the handwritten note, “concrete",Paragraph
skeleton (with structure?) or color.”’ The question “with structure?” in the sketch,Paragraph
probably relates to the way the traces and joints of the pouring process remain vis-,Paragraph
"ible on the surface. In another sketch the details of the cross are colored blue, while",Paragraph
at other instances it is proposed to paint them orange-red. The same cross-shaped,Paragraph
structure governs the organization of the floor plan.,Paragraph
It is no coincidence that Herzog & de Meuron put so much emphasis on the,Paragraph
"articulation of the concrete skeleton. In fact, one could read the cross at the Stone",Paragraph
"House as an ornament, which marks the beginning of Herzog & de Meuron’s",Paragraph
engagement with the ornament as architectural trope. It runs through their entire,Paragraph
"oeuvre and culminated in the Beijing Olympic Stadium, the Bird’s Nest (2008),",Paragraph
where structure and shape unite. Unlike most of their predecessors in the twentieth,Paragraph
"century, and unlike many of their contemporaries, Herzog & de Meuron are open",Paragraph
"to the concept of ornament. In a recent interview, Jacques Herzog reflects on the",Paragraph
"way ornament is utilized: “Seemingly paradoxical, the ornament is what unites and",Paragraph
"brings together the whole. If it reflects or contains the idea, it is an ornamental",Paragraph
"concept. If it doesn’t then it is a decorative appendix, and we have always been",Paragraph
against the notion of the decorative.”,Paragraph
Is it then possible to define the ornament as the mediator between the human and,Paragraph
a non-human human scale? Could it be the element that allows an anthropomorphic,Paragraph
"relationship between the users and the building, the element that facilitates an iden-",Paragraph
tification with phenomena with which humans cannot really cope? This anthropo-,Paragraph
morphic relationship is what seems to have been what art historian Alina Payne had,Paragraph
in mind when she described the role of the ornament in visual culture. She stated,Paragraph
"that the “tertium comparationis that connects scale and sculpture (small or large,",Paragraph

The Stone Membranes and the Concept of the Image,Title
"The concrete skeleton is filled in with rubble stones, which partially stem from a",Paragraph
ruined building on the site. Herzog & de Meuron used the stone walls to produce,Paragraph
"the impression of a massive protection from the outside, almost like a medieval",Paragraph
fortifying — an effect enhanced by the fact that windows and doors recede deeply,Paragraph
"into the wall and are protected with metal shutters. Inside, there is no servicing",Paragraph
"space, such as a hallway, staircase, or lobby. There is no hierarchy of organiza-",Paragraph
"tion, and no primary and secondary spaces; rather there are rooms that appear to",Paragraph
"be added to and juxtaposed with each other, as in the farmhouses of the Enga-",Paragraph
"dine, which the architects studied carefully. While the massive, compact appear-",Paragraph
"ance of the building underlines this organizational logic, the stone walls seem to",Paragraph
dematerialize. The absence of mortar makes the individual stones appear free to,Paragraph
move and be reassembled in another configuration. The closer one looks the less,Paragraph
"certain one becomes about the actual dimension — the facade, or rather, the stone",Paragraph
"membranes of the facade, which are framed by the concrete beams, turn into",Paragraph
images.,Paragraph
Herzog & de Meuron had first worked with the concept of the image in the Blue,Paragraph
"House, where the blue color — a reference to the French artist Yves Klein and his",Paragraph
invention of the Yves Klein Blue — makes the tiny building appear larger than it,Paragraph
"actually is. It was developed further in the facade of Dominus Winery in Yountville,",Paragraph
"California (1998), where stones appear to be floating in metal gabions. Since the",Paragraph
Millennium it has become a common tool in the realm of architecture.‘ The,Paragraph
"arrangement of stones resembles not so much a stack, but an accumulation of pig-",Paragraph
"ments on the surface of a canvas or a plaster fresco — and in the end, pigments are",Paragraph
nothing more than very finely ground colorful stones. The variety of shapes and,Paragraph
colors produces a picturesque effect and the motif of the stone wall evokes various,Paragraph
"examples from the realm of art. The sculptures of Arte Povera come to mind,",Paragraph
"where, for instance, the sculptural work of Jannis Kounellis or Mario Merz, popular",Paragraph
"during the 1970s and 1980s, make use of rubble stones. Another instructive point of",Paragraph
reference may be found in Paul Cézanne’s statement in regard to his paintings of,Paragraph
"the Montagne Saint-Victoire: “nature isn’t at the surface, it’s in depth. Colors are",Paragraph
"the expression, on the surface, of this depth.”* In addition, Robert Smithson has",Paragraph
"written, although with much irony and as a critique of contemporary painting, that",Paragraph
“(tlhe word ‘color’ means at its origin to ‘cover’ or ‘hide.’ Matter eats up light and,Paragraph
‘covers’ it with a confusion of color.”®,Paragraph
The concrete skeleton and the stone infillings are dialectically related. The,Paragraph

"and the optimistic gesture of expansion is confronted with the more pragmatic, or",Paragraph
"nostalgic gesture of recycled material from the past. Again, it would be easy to iden-",Paragraph
"tify a variety of references, such as the existing rubble stones walls in the area or the",Paragraph

"interested in “context,” or the direct mimesis of found shapes, but are searching",Paragraph
for something utterly different. Their project inseparably intertwines the old,Paragraph
and the new and transforms it into a phenomenon without precedent. This oper-,Paragraph
ation prefigures a theme that they will pursue in projects such as Kiippersmitihle,Paragraph
"Museum in Duisburg (1999), the Tate Modern (2000), or the CaixaForum Madrid",Paragraph
"(2008), which all transform existing industrial buildings into art museums. Getting",Paragraph
"back to my initial hypothesis, I would argue that the potentially dangerous effects",Paragraph
"of nature are held at bay by the building’s walls, which, on the other hand, frame,",Paragraph
"absorb, and transform this very nature in an aesthetic phenomenon. The wall with",Paragraph
its frame becomes a membrane that mediates between the non-human and,Paragraph
the human.,Paragraph
Dealing with Discontinuity,Title
The stone walls do not have to carry the tectonic and structural load of the building.,Paragraph
"In fact, they question the very existence ofa “wall,” similar to the cistern-like cover",Paragraph
"of the house. At the same time, the walls do bear much semantic weight. The archi-",Paragraph
tects make very clear how crucial the isolation of the house is in their view. In an,Paragraph
"early sketch it bears the title “Einsames Haus” (lonely house), presumably a title",Paragraph
later discarded in favor of “Stein Haus.”’ In the lower part of the building only a,Paragraph
"few openings pierce the volume, while the upper story has a row of windows that",Paragraph
open up to the spectacular view of the surrounds. Herzog & de Meuron have writ-,Paragraph
ten about the importance of the house’s exposure to nature. Among the documen-,Paragraph
"tary images that they selected for the monograph of their oeuvre, one shows a",Paragraph
trunk in front of the concrete skeleton with the caption: “Tree trunk and concrete,Caption
support visually melt into a common supporting structure. The orientation of the,Paragraph
concrete skeleton toward the existing natural conditions becomes visible.”*,Paragraph
Another photograph shows how the supporting metal beams used during the con-,Paragraph
struction process and the surrounding trees overlap. The caption reads: “During,Paragraph
"the construction phase, nature noticeably invades the shell, as though it could com-",Paragraph

The Stone House is doubly introverted: it closes itself off from the outside and it,Paragraph
focuses attention on the joints between the spaces. It deals with autarky and auton-,Paragraph
"omy, but there is no modernist self-reference or artistic self-reliance. Rather it",Paragraph
"relates to everything else, and triggers chains of associations of real and mental",Paragraph
"images. The Stone House originated from a close reading of the site; namely,",Paragraph
"the morphological, geological, geographical, climatic, historical, and economic",Title
"givens, rather than from the perspective of traditions in architecture. The form",Paragraph
"of the house does not echo any typology, it does not mimic the shape or materiality",Paragraph
"of neighboring houses, and nor does it produce an analogy to existing traditions. In",Paragraph
an explanatory text published in 1997 Gerhard Mack states: “The seemingly clearly,Paragraph
structured classical house is not an object. It opens towards the sky like a rainwater,Paragraph
cistern.”'® What the architects in the 1980s were looking for was no less distant,Paragraph
"from Aldo Rossi’s search for typological anchors, formulated in the 1960s in his",Paragraph
"book The Architecture of the City (1966), than from Alexander Tzonis and Liane",Paragraph
"Lefaive’s concept of “critical regionalism,” articulated in the 1970s. Herzog & de",Paragraph

cultural problem of how to present a cross at a moment when its efficacy has been,Paragraph
severely challenged under the dominance of secularized signs and of even senseless,Paragraph

Sacred Emptiness,Title
The Church of the Light is not the first to embody a restrained religious spatial,Paragraph
"atmosphere. As a modern precedent, one can cite Rudolf Schwarz’s (1897-1961)",Paragraph
Corpus Christi Roman Catholic Church in Aachen (1930). Schwarz’s church is char-,Paragraph
acterized by the sense of “ein Raum” clothed in white thanks to the openness,Paragraph
"between the congregation and the black marble altar. This church that embodies,",Paragraph
"according to one critic, a “spiritual conception of space”' was a figuration of",Paragraph
"Schwarz’s liturgical interpretation of emptiness, an emptiness that he saw as the",Paragraph
place where God dwells.” While it is unclear whether Ando was aware of Schwarz’s,Paragraph
"church at the moment when he was designing the Church of the Light, the two",Paragraph
churches share the same ethos called “sacred emptiness.”’ In the case of Ando’s,Paragraph
"church, the darkness lit by a cross of light grants the numinous to the empty space,",Paragraph
"enveloping the adjacent modest altar, without any podium, and the body of the",Paragraph
congregation.,Paragraph
"Within the chapel, the cross is placed not as an additional installation of religious",Paragraph
identity in an otherwise universal emptiness but as the central party that rivets one’s,Paragraph
attention fully onto itself. The cross takes on shape by excising dramatically the front,Paragraph
"wall (18 m x 6 mx 6m), and through these four cut pieces of concrete a shaft of light",Paragraph
"penetrates into the dark and empty space. When devising the cross, Ando was advised",Paragraph
by aconsultant to shorten its arms to ensure structural stability of the front wall. How-,Paragraph
"ever, Ando eventually rejected this recommendation, and suspended the two upper",Paragraph
pieces to the ceiling. This denial ofa tectonic logic confirms his intention to present the,Paragraph
"cross as the primary and central element. Indeed, the entire chapel — a molding of",Paragraph
"darkness — operates as an optimal setting for an augmented presence of the cross,",Paragraph
confirming unequivocally its status as a valid and definitive symbol in Christianity.,Paragraph
"In comparison with Catholicism, the reductive premise, that eliminates",Paragraph
"anthropomorphic and figurative icons and images from chapels, is well acknowledged",Paragraph
"in Protestantism. Despite this reductive premise, however, it is still normal in Prot-",Paragraph
estant churches to install a cross. This survival of the cross in the process of reduction is,Paragraph
"due to the fact that the cross is a qualitatively different symbol compared to icons,",Paragraph
"images, and figures. The cross is neither a human invention nor a figurative imitation",Paragraph
"of an original in a literal fashion. Rather, it is a symbol of Jesus Christ both in a met-",Paragraph
"onymic relationship, as it was the locus where Jesus was crucified, and in a figurative",Paragraph
"similitude to his body that its horizontal and vertical axes arouse, not in a literal imi-",Paragraph
"tation but in a highly abstracted fashion. In this regard, it is not surprising to find a",Paragraph
cross in the Church of the Light that noticeably espouses the reductive premise. In,Paragraph
"this church, however, the cross has not simply survived. This is because its symbolic",Paragraph
"status has now been revived and augmented. And, this is so precisely through the",Paragraph
reductive premise that operates as a prerequisite for the re-presentation of the cross.,Paragraph
"The position of the cross is remarkable. Piercing the front wall, the cross stands",Paragraph
"between the inside and the outside. Accordingly, the cross operates as a slit for the",Paragraph
introduction of light to the chapel. This position of the cross and its role as a vehicle,Paragraph
for light are exceptional. It is true that Ando always sought out a special location for,Paragraph
"the cross throughout his religious or pseudo-religious works. For instance, in the",Paragraph
"Church on the Water (1988), a wedding hall with intermittent Christian services,",Paragraph
"the cross was positioned in the middle of an artificial pond. In conjunction with this,",Paragraph
he rendered the front to be completely transparent and made the glass operable,Paragraph
"laterally to dramatize one’s perception of the cross from the interior. This cross,",Paragraph
"which stands at the outside of the chapel and in the middle of water, demonstrates",Paragraph
influence taken from the cross found in Kaija and Heikei Siren’s Technical Univer-,Paragraph
"sity Chapel (1957) in Otaniemi, Finland. Its reference is also traditional, as it",Paragraph
"reminds one of the tori of the Itsukushima shrine. However, the cross in the Church",Paragraph
"of the Light is different. Unlike the cross in the Church on the Water, it stands nei-",Paragraph
"ther inside nor outside, but in-between. Looking back at the history of Japanese",Paragraph
"Christian architecture, a similar “in-between” cross can be found in Kenzo Tange’s",Paragraph
(1913-2005) St. Mary’s Cathedral (1963) in Tokyo. This monumental church has a,Paragraph
"slit on the ceiling in the form of the cross, and light thus comes in from above.",Paragraph
"However, Ando was critical of this cross, claiming that the church was predicated",Paragraph
upon Western vertical conception of light. In contrast with Tange’s unambigu-,Paragraph
"ously vertical light, Ando’s empty cross on the front wall in the Church of the Light",Caption
"invites a penetrating beam of light, a beam that is horizontal or diagonal.",Paragraph
"In reference to the chapel’s effect of light created by the cross, the smooth con-",Paragraph
crete wall surfaces of the Church of the Light are significant as well. Ando adopted,Paragraph
several tactics to formulate a refined surface. Any release agent on the surface of the,Paragraph
"veneer form boards was forbidden, to prevent disagreeable marks on the surface.",Paragraph
"Instead, Ando preferred to paint the surface of the boards, and in this fashion he",Paragraph
minimized the wooden grain traces on the concrete. The positions of steel bars,Paragraph
were determined as accurately as possible with the aim of securing sufficient cover,Paragraph
thickness between the outermost steel bars and the boards. Ando had concrete,Paragraph
"blended, not with rough and crude aggregates but with well-rounded pebbles.",Paragraph
"When the concrete was poured, Ando dispatched his employees to the construc-",Paragraph
tion site to assist in the vibrating process manually. The purpose of this was to,Paragraph
remove as many vapors as possible so that a smooth surface of non-porous solidity,Paragraph
might come into being. Even when a flaw was discovered after the boards were,Paragraph
"taken apart, patching it was forbidden in order to keep homogeneity of the surface.",Paragraph
It was through these tactics that Ando was able to formulate exquisitely smooth,Paragraph
and polished surfaces.,Paragraph
Material Light,Title
Ando explained his reasons for taking these extra measures to formulate smooth-,Paragraph

"in through the cross of light, rushes and collides. The shiny, sensitive, and refrac-",Paragraph
"tory finish renders the beam of light corporeally present: palpable, tangible, touch-",Paragraph

optimizes its reflection back to the chapel. Light requires a smooth wall to get effec-,Paragraph

"heart of darkness can be realized. At this moment of interaction, the wall appears in",Paragraph
"its luminosity, for instance, as if gilded. In other words, the wall transcends its literal",Paragraph
status as a dreary concrete wall to appear in a fictive fashion that is meaningful in,Paragraph
the context of Christian spirituality.,Paragraph
This fictive presence of the wall — it appears as if it were gilded — allows us to,Paragraph
"compare Ando’s approach to light with a historical case. For instance, Abbot Suger",Paragraph
"(1081-1151), who administered the erection of a new chevet to replace the aged",Paragraph

"ventionally, light hides itself in the field of the everyday through the very form of",Paragraph

"sion. Ando retained a similar stance, as he wrote that “light does not become objec-",Paragraph
tified and is not itself given form until it is isolated and accepted by physical,Paragraph
"objects.”* Accordingly, in bringing this selfsecluding light to visibility, an",Paragraph
"architect’s task would be to formulate an agency, such as placing costly gilded",Paragraph
"objects in the case of Suger. In the case of the Church of the Light, the construction",Paragraph
"budget was modest. Placing gilded objects or gilding the wall, as Suger would have",Paragraph
"done, was not an option. It is from this angle that one needs to understand Ando’s",Paragraph
painstaking efforts to smooth and polish the surface of the concrete wall to the,Paragraph
point where it became a kind of depthless mirror. In the church purged of gilded,Paragraph
"objects, light meets the polished surface of the prosaic concrete walls instead. The",Paragraph
effect of the efforts is extraordinary. The dull concrete wall turns into an efficacious,Paragraph
agency and produces an effect similar to that accomplished by Suger’s gilded,Paragraph
"objects or walls. In its fictive performance, refined concrete operates like gold.",Paragraph
Thermal Atmosphere,Title
There is another effect of light: thermal atmosphere. Partially due to the limited,Paragraph
"construction budget, the church was built without insulation, and it is cold inside",Paragraph
"the church during the winter days. This coldness, however, is not merely a physical",Paragraph
phenomenon. It has a spiritual and cultural significance as well. It keeps the believ-,Paragraph
ers awake and alert. It also keeps them from becoming overly ecstatic to the point,Paragraph
that the conscious and rational commitment to Jesus is supplanted by overheated,Paragraph
"and hyperbolic proclamations and ambitions. Indeed, this emphasis on the intellec-",Paragraph
"tual aspect of belief characterizes Japanese Christianity as the religion of the literate,",Paragraph
"compared to, for instance, Shintoism, or the religion of the public. In particular, it is",Paragraph
"well known that the Non-Church Movement, a remarkable indigenous Christian",Paragraph
"movement established by Uchimura Kanzo (1861-1930), puts emphasis on the",Paragraph
"rational side of belief. In Ando’s church, the thermal tactility of coldness, which",Paragraph
"keeps the believers alert, concretizes this emphasis on the rationality of Japanese",Paragraph
Christianity. One’s being embraced by coldness as one enters the Church of the,Paragraph
Light thus has a ritualistic dimension.,Paragraph
"Just as the darkness renders the beam of light more efficacious, so it is with cold-",Paragraph
ness. The light that is introduced to the Church of the Light shines through the,Paragraph
"coldness. Its warmth is augmented thanks to this coldness. Put differently, the",Paragraph
pre-presence of coldness enhances the warmth of light. As coldness is not merely,Paragraph
"a physical fact but a spiritual quality, warmth, also, embodies a spiritual signifi-",Paragraph
cance. Warmth analogizes itself with Jesus and his unfathomable love that any,Paragraph
"rational effort to understand is destined to fail. The inexplicable Kenosis, or the",Paragraph
"Absolute Irrationality, that a divine being emptied Himself to become like one",Paragraph
"of His own creatures and to suffer on the cross for the sins of His own creatures,",Paragraph
"tests any humane, rational approach to apprehend Christianity. In a way, the cou-",Paragraph
pling of coldness and warmth in the church is that of the rationality of Japanese,Paragraph
"intellectuals who reason the cause of Christianity on the one hand, and the irra-",Paragraph
"tional, unfathomable warmth of the divine love on the other. Ando’s church is thus",Paragraph
where two different corporeal engagements — one breathing cold air and the other,Paragraph
feeling warmth — are collated to connote spirituality. Upon the moment when one,Paragraph
"is corporeally drawn to warmth on account of pre-given coldness, one spiritually",Paragraph
renounces rationality in favor of an ultimate unconditional acceptance of the,Paragraph
incomprehensible divine love.,Paragraph
"As these observations imply, the spatial emptiness of the chapel in the Church of",Paragraph
"the Light is not a geometrically defined, neutral setting but one that is imbued with",Paragraph
atmospheric qualities such as darkness and coldness. These qualities in turn oper-,Paragraph
ate as a prerequisite for the re-presentation of the cross with equally atmospheric,Paragraph
"qualities such as brightness and warmth. In other words, Ando’s church utilizes the",Paragraph
dark and cold emptiness to re-present the cross that is bright and warm. It is a,Paragraph
re-presentation of the cross in and through a dialectical setting where contradictory,Paragraph
and compensatory qualities are brought toward each other. Such an approach,Paragraph
entails a criticism of the degraded status of symbols and icons into hackneyed,Paragraph
"and prosaic kitsch in contemporary culture. In contemporary Japan, the perception",Paragraph
of the cross is never free from romanticism. A good testament to this is the post-,Paragraph
war surge of cross-bearing wedding chapels built exclusively for commercial pur-,Paragraph
"poses. Regardless of religious orientation, young couples marry in such places",Paragraph
"partially because they regard the wedding style as fancy. Interestingly, Ando is",Paragraph
not exempt from this secularized perception of the cross. He himself also designed,Paragraph
"several wedding chapels, including the Church on the Water and the Church on",Paragraph

"zation, where empty, referent-free signifiers float around aimlessly to form a",Paragraph

Blankness,Title
What is also important in understanding the status of the cross in Japan is the way it,Paragraph
is viewed by Zen Buddhism. Even when the cross could successfully convey the,Paragraph
"suffering of Jesus, it was often considered as an emblem of inhumanity. The char-",Paragraph
"acterization made by Daisetz T. Suzuki (1894-1966), the most influential Zen",Paragraph
"scholar of the twentieth century, is a primary example. Comparing Christianity",Paragraph
"and Shin Buddhism, he defined the cross as “the symbol of cruelty or of inhuman-",Paragraph
"ity.”° When Suzuki used this phrase, he most likely had a baroque crucifix in mind,",Paragraph
and even imagining Jesus under crucifixion must have been too painful. Being a,Paragraph
"Buddhist, his conception of sacrifice was anything but bloody. Indeed, even after",Paragraph
"mortification, Sakyamuni was not bleeding, but astringent and dignified.” In addi-",Paragraph
"tion, according to Suzuki, even when death is concerned, death for a Buddhist is not",Paragraph
"anguish, distress, and pain but rest and peace.® What epitomizes this difference in",Paragraph
"the conception of death is the posture, Buddha’s horizontal posture on the death-",Paragraph
bed contrasting with the Jesus hanging on the cross.” It is within this cultural con-,Paragraph
text that the “cross of light” takes on greater significance. Ando’s cross confronts,Paragraph
"Zen Buddhists’ characterizations. By eliminating materiality from the cross, Ando",Paragraph
brings forth an unexampled cross that is diametrically opposite to that of the,Paragraph
baroque crucifix. This cross thus shapes a state of what one might call pure or,Paragraph
"non-materialistic iconicity, and has the effect of radically Protestantizing the univer-",Paragraph
"sal symbol of Christianity. The blankness of this cross, or its dimension of the invis-",Paragraph
"ible, is thus a distinctive cultural achievement.",Paragraph
This blankness takes on further importance. Blankness conditions the cross’s per-,Paragraph
formance as a channel for the introduction of light. Thanks to the strong presence,Paragraph
"of the phenomenal light in darkness, the cross oscillates between two values: the",Paragraph
referential value of the cross as the universal symbol of Christianity and its vehic-,Paragraph
ular value for the introduction of light. This alternation is neither vicious nor point-,Paragraph
less. It enriches the perception of the cross as both a gestalt and penetrating light.,Paragraph
"This oscillation renders the cross to be the penetrating light, and the penetrating",Paragraph
light to be the cross. The cross carries out integration between the iconic and the,Paragraph
"phenomenal. The substantial, permanent, and enduring aspect of the cross as an",Paragraph
"icon is inseparably joined with the tangible, ecstatic, and transformative nature",Paragraph
of the phenomenal light. This union of the phenomenal with the iconic is effica-,Paragraph

Shintai,Title
"For Ando, any engagement with an architectural setting and its components is con-",Paragraph
"ducted through shintai, or the Japanese notion of the body. Underneath Ando’s",Paragraph
clear statement about the role of shintai lies a distinctive philosophical tradition,Paragraph
"called Kyoto Philosophical School, which dwelled upon shintai extensively during",Paragraph
the modern period. In particular the theory of perception and body in the philos-,Paragraph
"ophy of nothingness by Kitaro Nishida (1870-1945), the foremost thinker in mod-",Paragraph
"ern East Asian intellectual history and the father of the Kyoto Philosophical School,",Paragraph
"is noteworthy. Nishida understood shintai as an active, pre-reflective, sensational",Paragraph
capacity to embrace and feel the world as the content of the very self. Shintai is,Paragraph
"an active, sensational vessel by which the self empties selfhood out to accept",Paragraph
"the world as his or her very content. Shintai is an agency of creation, too, at the",Paragraph
"moment when this sensational encounter is asymmetrical, as what the world offers",Paragraph
"is greater than what shintai can internalize. At this moment, shintai transcends the",Paragraph
horizon of sensation and enters into the realm of creative act to accommodate the,Paragraph
sensational surplus.’° A piece created through shintai is thus not a sign that would,Paragraph
"materialize an author's ideas, intentions, and conceptions. Rather, what is created is",Paragraph
"the overturning of the self, or the exposure of the limits of the self armed with",Paragraph
"ideas, intentions, and conceptions to regulate, apprehend, and measure the world.",Paragraph
"Accordingly, what is created operates as a contradictory compensation of the self.",Paragraph
What is created and the self form a paradoxical ensemble of a contradictory union.,Paragraph
"This union is more solid than any other type of union, as it is contradictory by its",Paragraph
nature.,Paragraph
"Emerging from this cultural tradition of the body, Ando discussed shintai not from",Paragraph
"the perspective of any dichotomous severance between body and mind, but from the",Paragraph
"perspective of a corporeal totality, totality that he expressed variably as “a union of",Paragraph
"spirit and flesh” and “a maximum effect of equilibrium.”’! Furthermore, Ando",Paragraph
understood shintai as the locus of the self that concretizes the reciprocal matrix,Paragraph
between the outside world and the interiority of the self. While Ando did not develop,Paragraph
"this thesis on shintai to the extent of Nishida, this matrix is the condition for the emer-",Paragraph
gence of a creative postural articulation in resonance with that which will comple-,Paragraph
ment any sensational surplus present in the matrix. An element discovered or created,Paragraph
"in this fashion is not a sign, but an extension of shintai that heightens its capacity in",Paragraph
encountering and embracing the world sensationally. Before it is a representational,Paragraph
"figure to be screened by the semiotic gaze ofhegemonic and instrumental attitude, it",Paragraph
is a figure of the corporeally and pre-reflectively apprehended domain.”,Paragraph
"Accordingly, shintai is also a key in apprehending the perceptual and situational",Paragraph
significance of the Church of the Light. Ando positioned the church in such a way,Paragraph
that access to the chapel from the outside is labyrinthine. This labyrinthine approach,Paragraph
is met dramatically by an axial composition of the dark and intimate chapel whose,Paragraph
terminus is marked by the cross of penetrating light. This integration between the,Paragraph
"labyrinthine and the axial is intentional. Thanks to the former, the latter refreshes its",Paragraph
"significance. The axial is no longer a hackneyed compositional technique. Rather, it",Paragraph
comes alive to coincide with and guide the movement of the body that orients,Paragraph
"toward and faces things axially. One’s gradual procession toward the holy, an indis-",Paragraph
"pensible part ofa ritual, is refreshed and enhanced in the Church of the Light. Shintai",Paragraph
—the actively knowing body through its sensational internalization of what is offered,Paragraph
"— moves along the axis and encounters the cross. Curiously, in the church, the pro-",Paragraph
cession along the central aisle of the chapel is simultaneously an act of descending,Paragraph
"toward the cross. The more one proceeds, the more towering and prominent the",Paragraph

THE PLIABLE SURFACE,Title
By the end of the 1980s a transformation had taken place in the organization of the,Paragraph
Office of Metropolitan Architecture (OMA). One of the key factors was the departure,Paragraph
"of Elia Zenghelis from the firm, which was originally led by Rem Koolhaas, Madelon",Paragraph
"Vriesendorp, Elia Zenghelis, and Zoe Zenghelis. In addition, projects in 1987-88",Paragraph
seemed to conclude a phase in OMA’s work that heavily polemicized its relationship,Paragraph
to the postmodern project and realigned the work with the modern avant-gardes.,Paragraph
Koolhaas was increasingly dissatisfied with architecture’s standard replies to com-,Paragraph
mon urban and structural problems. Concluding a two-year teaching commitment,Paragraph
"at the Technical University of Delft, he took part ina conference entitled “How Mod-",Paragraph
ern is Dutch Architecture?” Koolhaas took this call for presentations as an opportu-,Paragraph
nity to criticize OMA’s master plan and contribution at Amsterdam’s large IJ-plain,Paragraph
social housing project. This self-criticism developed against the backdrop of the,Paragraph
"decline of socialism signaled by the fall of the Berlin Wall, which disrupted the func-",Paragraph
"tioning ofa part of their building at Checkpoint Charlie, designed when the Wall was",Paragraph
"still standing. At the conference, Koolhaas rhetorically asked: “How is it possible, for",Paragraph
"the love of God, ina century entirely marked by instability and change ... that in spite",Paragraph
"of all, these buildings constructed at a distance of almost one century can so closely",Paragraph
resemble each other?” Dutch architecture had achieved a perfectly functional way of,Paragraph
"building, but one that was without the ideal impulses, the sentiments of “grandeur”",Paragraph
and “mythology” of the experimental daring of the avant-gardes. Koolhaas con-,Paragraph
"cluded, “we can talk about the Dutch architecture of today as an architecture without",Paragraph
"intentions, a triumphalist Modernism, totally inoffensive, toothless, sterile. It won’t",Paragraph
"prevent our sleep at night, nor will it awake us from slumber.”’",Paragraph
In 1989 a new synthesis of the principles outlined in Delirious New York (1978),Paragraph
surfaced in the work of OMA that related more directly to design narratives,Paragraph
"and structural forces. After many competition entries, several housing commis-",Paragraph
"sions, and two major projects (Berlin’s Checkpoint Charlie Apartments and The",Paragraph

"rary art exhibitions at the end of 1987. What would become known as the Kunsthal,",Paragraph
"located on Maasboulevard at the southern end of a park, was a new kind of project",Paragraph
"for OMA, which continued in the design for the Educatorium building that was",Paragraph
constructed a few years later in Utrecht.,Paragraph

"classification system — the building is a box with a square plan, raised from the",Paragraph
ground like a boat moored to the escarpment of the Maasboulevard. Access to,Paragraph
the box is from the quay-like roof of the lance-shaped volume placed up against,Paragraph
the escarpment. This volume contains service spaces and offices. Its overall volume,Paragraph
is shaped by the contours of the vehicle road that descends to the level of the park.,Paragraph
The elevated box contains a single vast room and has three glass facades. The light-,Paragraph
ing of the central zone is provided by a skylight that looks like a prism inserted in,Paragraph
"the box. The conference room, café, and other spaces are inserted in a long volume",Paragraph
"hat protrudes beyond the flat roof, perpendicular to the Maasboulevard.",Caption

"tions in Kunsthal I. Thus, a continuous path of ramps, including the inclined slab",Paragraph
"of the auditorium, would connect all the exhibition spaces on the various levels.",Paragraph
"The ramp connecting the avenue and the park, along with the vehicle road —",Paragraph
respectively labeled “Street” and “Road” in the drawings — cut across the square,Paragraph
"plan, generating a large square exhibition space, two orthogonal bands for a hall",Paragraph
"and offices, and an exhibition gallery. In some of the design schemes an ovoidal",Paragraph
"structure bridged the Road, connecting the hall to the square room; in others",Paragraph
"the Road is open to the sky, while an arched covering is placed over the street,",Paragraph
symbolizing (like a Venturi and Scott Brown “Decorated Shed”) the position,Paragraph
and role of the Kunsthal as a bridge between the dike and the park.,Paragraph
The latter was also designed by OMA in collaboration with the landscape,Paragraph
"designer Yves Brunier, who divided the terrain into orchard, podium, and park,",Paragraph
breaking with the traditional criteria of garden design. The apple orchard with trees,Paragraph
"planted in diagonal rows on a surface of white stones, with their trunks painted",Paragraph
"white, forms a luminous vestibule. The podium is a raised surface covered with",Paragraph
"black tarmac, a stage for performances. Separated by a wall with a reflecting sur-",Paragraph
"face, the orchard and the podium appear as abstract suprematist compositions in",Paragraph
"black and white, when seen from above. The trees are planted more densely to",Paragraph
create the park in front of the Kunsthal (climbing plants conceal the differences,Paragraph
"between new and old trunks), while the ground is transformed into a surface scat-",Paragraph
tered with multicolored flowers. The work evokes not only suprematist but poin-,Paragraph
"tillist compositions, to be admired from an art promenade whose ends are the",Paragraph
"square and the triangle of the works of architecture by OMA, a garden symbolizing",Paragraph
a Dutch Secession.,Paragraph
The final design of the Kunsthal was built between 1991 and 1992. While the,Paragraph
"standard drawings show a square plan, the often-published axonometric diagram",Paragraph
"reveals that a circulation spiral occupies the volume. In addition, this spiral is",Paragraph
intercepted in one direction by a vehicle road and in the other by a pedestrian,Paragraph
ramp that connects the park and the Maasboulevard. These two passages remain,Paragraph
always open and as such give the building a porosity that occasionally reveals,Paragraph

"is achieved through the complex layering of surface configurations, the move-",Paragraph
"ment through the building becomes a structural device that organizes, transi-",Paragraph

"between 1995 and 1997. While these projects aimed at a spatial continuity, struc-",Paragraph
tural challenges often stood in the way of freely developed architectural spaces as a,Paragraph
"circulation path. By closely collaborating with Cecil Balmond, structural engineer",Paragraph
"at Arup, OMA began to find new structural logics that worked hand-in-hand with",Paragraph
"the desired spatial conditions. For the Kunsthal, Balmond proposed Vierendee",Paragraph
"beams at the same height as the building, with vertical poles placed at different",Paragraph
"intervals to avoid the spatial effects of repetition, and horizontal poles hidden in",Paragraph
the thickness of the slabs. This breakdown of the poles and beams generates col-,Paragraph

"for the Kunsthal. Rather than searching for the minimization of structure, the addi-",Paragraph
tion of other responsibilities would lead to an inhabitable structural system that,Paragraph
became integral to the building.,Paragraph
"“In section,” Balmond writes, “it may look hopelessly out of balance. But the",Paragraph

while certain pillars do not enter the ground floor thanks to the use of,Paragraph

"neering conceptual drawings by August Perret’s theater at the Champs-Elysées,",Paragraph
"which, in turn, became the basis for Le Corbusier’s Dom-ino diagram, they depart",Paragraph
in their configuration from one another and differ in size. In OMA’s design for the,Paragraph
Deux Bibliothéques at Jussieu the earlier skeletal schemes are seemingly placed on,Paragraph
top of one another. OMA’s return to the canonical skeleton implies a reformulation,Paragraph
of the Plan Libre as well as the common stratification of floors. Here the floors are,Paragraph
"transformed into a continuous ascension —a “trajectory,” Koolhaas called it — which",Paragraph
"is simply the latest segment of a sequence through Paris, where Koolhaas envisions",Paragraph
"“[the visitor becomes a Baudelairean fldneur, inspecting and being seduced by a",Paragraph

"and variety, the effect of the inhabited planes becomes almost that of a street; this",Paragraph

Syncopated Rhythm,Title
"Each floor was to be understood as a pliable surface, or, “social magic carpet” that",Paragraph
continues into the next to become one of the segments of the “trajectory.” At times,Paragraph
"a slab is bent to produce lanceolate sections that cannot be utilized, with an almost",Paragraph
baroque spatial effect. OMA had already built similar continuously bent surfaces in,Paragraph
"the Kunsthal, where the path of the visitor winds along an interior spiral in a syn-",Paragraph
"copated rhythm. The spiral even continues outdoors, along the elevated garden,",Paragraph
"and terminates at the flat, only partially accessible, roof. The brusquely truncated",Paragraph
"spiral guides the visitor through the building in a sequence of scenarios, following a",Paragraph
"narrative thread, “a story,” as Koolhaas put it, that “does not have to be told in",Paragraph
"words, but is simply shown by movement, so that the path has a beginning,",Paragraph
"and leads somewhere.” The stereometric prism, crossed by a complex continuous",Paragraph
"path, was continuously reworked by OMA, always in pursuit of different solutions",Paragraph
for joining successive levels. The diagram of the spiral in the form of a long con-,Paragraph
"tinuous strip composed of different segments, similar to an “exquisite corpse,”",Paragraph
would become a constant in the work of OMA that also called for new ways of,Paragraph
representation.,Paragraph
Attempts to express the notion of continuity in the design of the Deux Bibliothé-,Paragraph
ques resulted in a series of model photographs and drawings. The most striking of,Paragraph
"these focuses solely on the trajectory, unraveling the entire building as a continu-",Paragraph
"ous path without showing the rest of the structure. This, of course, was a true",Paragraph
"departure from Perret and Le Corbusier’s diagrams of the skeleton, for now the",Paragraph

vated its different speeds. The rigidity of the Dom-ino skeleton is here sublimated,Paragraph
"by a dynamic energy, similar to that unleashed by the lines in the drawings by Paul",Paragraph
"Klee and analyzed by Gilles Deleuze in his writings on Leibniz.” In fact, Koolhaas’",Paragraph
project witnesses the “mixture” of the “straight line” (the Dom-ino grid) and the,Paragraph
“curve” (the bent slabs) as discussed by Deleuze with reference to the “baroque,Paragraph
mathematics” of Leibniz and Klee.*,Paragraph
A film-like sequence of photographs showing hands that hold a sheet of paper,Paragraph
that is then cut by a pair of scissors demonstrates the design process through which,Paragraph
"the parvis of the university pavilions of Edouard Albert is raised, repeatedly folded,",Paragraph
and cut to give rise to the “trajectory” of the Deux Bibliothéques. The photographs,Paragraph
"of this technique, as in the works of Lygia Clark,’ illustrate much better than the",Paragraph

was introduced only to support the many facets of the “surface pliable.” The com-,Paragraph

the roof.,Paragraph
"In other preliminary solutions for the Educatorium, OMA even tested a contin-",Paragraph
"uous S-shaped folding, which had to be rejected due to the excessive height",Paragraph
between the first segment of “pliable surface” and the upper level. This led to,Paragraph
"the solution of two interpenetrating U-shaped slabs, partially reflecting the",Paragraph

of the two forms generated a subdivision of the building to fit the lecture halls on,Paragraph

The effect of a continuous plane (that transforms from floor to wall to ceiling),Paragraph
is accentuated by the outer finish of the slab in visible reinforced concrete. In,Paragraph

A SECULAR CATHEDRAL OF ART,Title
"In the middle of the twentieth century, Frank Lloyd Wright famously designed a",Paragraph
"museum for Solomon R. Guggenheim, the main volume of which was comprised",Paragraph
"of a continuous, spiraling, nautilus-like space. First commissioned in 1943, Wright’s",Paragraph
"Guggenheim was not completed until 1959, following the architect’s death. The",Paragraph
curving walls were seen by critics as inhospitable to traditional ways of displaying,Paragraph

that should play an active role in the museum experience. The Guggenheim proj-,Paragraph
ect pitted the visionary architect against New York City and the art world of mid-,Paragraph
century America.,Paragraph
"In 1960, a year after the Guggenheim Museum opened, Claus Oldenburg",Paragraph
"mounted his improvisational art-performance, “The Street,” in a borrowed space",Paragraph
on New York’s Bowery. Among the messages scrawled on the walls of Oldenburg’s,Paragraph
installation was: “Frank Lloyd Wright tried to eliminate painting and we are getting,Paragraph
"even by eliminating architecture.” Oldenburg’s friend, Jim Dine, added “The",Paragraph

enburg was voicing a sentiment that was to animate much of the important art of,Paragraph
the 1960s.’ Oldenburg also set out a conceptual challenge that Frank Gehry later,Paragraph
took up for architecture.’,Paragraph
Warehouses for Art and Spectacle,Title
"A half-century after the original Guggenheim project was initiated, Thomas Krens",Paragraph
was hired to renew the Guggenheim Foundation’s mission. Krens set out to collect,Paragraph
important works of minimalist and post-minimalist art from the 1960s and 1970s.,Paragraph
He pursued a global program of building and blockbuster exhibitions that could,Paragraph
"capture the expanded size, physicality, and diversity of media associated with post-",Paragraph
"war art. In an age when museums, at least in North America, came to depend more",Paragraph
"and more on attendance, fees, and private philanthropy to survive, museum-",Paragraph
visiting was undergoing a change from an expression of cultivated connoisseurship,Paragraph
"to experiences of popular entertainment, touristic pleasure, sociability, and the con-",Paragraph
sumption of goods and services. Although it had never been particularly useful for,Paragraph
"mounting exhibitions, Krens understood the powerful potential of Wright's icon",Paragraph
"on Manhattan’s Museum Mile as a spectacle for engaging this new reality, and",Paragraph
sought to reproduce that potential in a more contemporary manner elsewhere.,Paragraph
"Earlier, Krens had developed the idea of repurposing a large, recently abandoned",Paragraph
"nearby factory, the Sprague Electric Plant in North Adams, Massachusetts, to",Paragraph
become the largest contemporary art museum in the world. The museum would,Paragraph
be funded with state redevelopment subsidies and private donations of cash and,Paragraph
art. He continued to pursue this idea after he was hired by the Guggenheim Foun-,Paragraph
dation. Although the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (Mass MOCA),Paragraph
"was eventually achieved in Adams by others, it became the model for creating a",Paragraph
"satellite Guggenheim in Bilbao, Spain (there was already the Peggy Guggenheim",Paragraph
"Gallery in Venice, Italy). Like Mass MOCA, the Bilbao project was first conceived",Paragraph
"to reoccupy an old building in a dying industrial town, leverage public and private",Paragraph

"confined quarters of New York City. In June 1991, Frank Gehry, Coop Himmel-",Paragraph

"By his own telling, Gehry, with Krens, convinced officials in Bilbao to move the",Paragraph
project from a nineteenth-century building within an historic quarter to a prominent,Paragraph
geographic knuckle in the town on the south bank of the Nervion River. The,Paragraph
"museum was intended to take advantage of its adjacencies to the Old Town Hall,",Paragraph

Gehry’s “Artsploitation” Architecture,Title

"assignment. Nevertheless, there is a no small irony in Bilbao Guggenheim’s",Paragraph

"bringing artistry to mundane assignments, seeing the latent possibilities of a cheap-",Paragraph
"scape postwar America, and in so doing, drawing architecture out of ordinary pro-",Paragraph
jects where it might be least expected.,Paragraph
"Gehry’s engagement with the art and architecture scene in Los Angeles, and",Paragraph
"with the particular built geography of Southern California, beginning in the late",Paragraph
"1950s, is critical to understanding his later success at Bilbao and beyond. He first",Paragraph
"practiced with Victor Gruen Associates. Gruen, a Viennese émigré to Los Angeles,",Paragraph
"who had developed a large, successful practice based in large part on his concept of",Paragraph
"the shopping mall; particularly, the role that the new mall could play in the North",Paragraph
"American suburb, akin to what town centers had been in European countries.‘",Paragraph
The architectural sleights of hand needed to make effective retail architecture,Paragraph
"with temporary materials and limited budgets, and the ersatz urbanism of the",Paragraph
Gruen mall formulae are both foundational to the innovations associated with,Paragraph
"Gehry’s work beginning in the 1970s. Even earlier, in work done soon after Gehry",Paragraph
"established his own practice in 1962, one can find the mining of cheap materials for",Paragraph
sensual and symbolic effects and the use of theatrical effects associated with shop-,Paragraph
"ping environments.” Projects for the Joseph Magnin Department Stores (1968-69),",Paragraph
"the O’Neil Hay Barn (1968), and other more explicitly experimental early projects",Paragraph
"such as the Danziger Studio and Residence (1964-65), reveal similar traits during",Paragraph
this first phase of his career. They were influenced by the artists and gallery owners,Paragraph
"with whom Gehry forged relationships in the 1960s: Robert Irwin, Ed Ruscha, Ed",Paragraph
"Kienholz, Ed Moses, and later in the 1980s, Richard Serra and Claes Oldenburg. All",Paragraph
of these artists were turning a new eye to the seeming detritus of modern industrial,Paragraph
"andscapes such as Los Angeles, repurposing common materials and reconsidering",Paragraph
the broader landscape and environment as aesthetic phenomena.,Paragraph
Gehry’s work has been taken very seriously by architects and critics since at least,Paragraph
"1978, after the house he transformed for his family in Santa Monica was widely",Paragraph
"published. In the late 1970s Claes Oldenburg, with whom Gehry previously had",Paragraph
"only limited contact, and his collaborator, Coosje van Bruggen, whom Gehry",Paragraph
"had never met, paid a visit to the Santa Monica house. They quickly recognized",Paragraph

THE FIFTH PLAN,Title
In recent architecture a new type of plan has been afoot. It has been stealing into,Paragraph
"architecture for a decade or two, perhaps longer, alternately announcing and",Paragraph
obscuring its arrival via the paroxysms that come with a long gestation. Does this,Paragraph
"plan signal a significant architectural turn? It is hard to say, for as yet it is more ofa",Paragraph
"twinkle in its parents’ eye than an established progeny, insinuating its potential",Paragraph
"without yet assuring us of its longevity, or even its vivacity. Nonetheless, this plan",Paragraph
has made it far enough along an accelerating arc to make it worth looking at its,Paragraph
"origins, its manifestations, and (most importantly) its promises.",Paragraph
"Arriving at the tail end of a century’s evolution, this new plan descends from",Paragraph
four antecedents: the premodern plan (through the nineteenth century: line-‘em-up-,Paragraph
just-so); the modern plan (early twentieth century: give-me-liberty-or-give-me-death);,Paragraph
the postmodern plan (1960s/1970s/1980s: we-used-to-do-it like-this-plus-je-ne-sais-,Paragraph
quoi); and the sequel-modern plan (from the 1980s through the turn of the twenty-first,Paragraph
"century: modernity-non-chalant). On the heels of these four plan iterations, this new",Paragraph
plan arrives as a fifth generation — a fifth plan.,Paragraph
While each of the four preceding plan types had tendencies toward self-,Paragraph
"definition — the architects of each self-consciously, and usually zealously, distin-",Paragraph
guished “their” particular plan predilections from any antecedents — the fifth plan,Paragraph
"appears without Oedipal angst. It uses, discards, adapts, and mixes plan attributes",Paragraph
from the entire genome of the preceding century. It unflinchingly cross-fertilizes,Paragraph
"“free,” “open,” “dense,” “axial,” “figured,” “serial,” “serendipitous,” “functional,”",Paragraph
"or other techniques, employing the seemingly hardened ideologies of its ancestors",Paragraph
in surprisingly malleable ways. Free-plan spanning systems are filled with high-,Paragraph
density programs. Exuberant form runs alongside ultra-rational technological orga-,Paragraph
nizations. Volumes are surfaces and surfaces are volumes. The fifth plan is not only,Paragraph
"comfortable in its skin, it revels in its mongrel lineage. Without looking like a mutt",Paragraph
"(at least on its better days), the fifth plan is indebted to the full and ostensibly dis-",Paragraph
parate spectrum of its pedigree.,Paragraph
Where can this new plan be found? Differing strains of it appear in a range of,Paragraph
contemporary practices including those of Michael Maltzan (Pittman Dowell,Paragraph
"House, Malibu Beach House), FANStudio (Fat Flat), Johnston Marklee (View",Caption
"House), Mansilla & Tufién (MUSAC), Sou Fujimoto (Musashino Library, Chil-",Caption

"de Meuron (Cottbus Library), SANAA (IT Student Center, Toledo Glass",Caption
"Museum), OMA (Casa de Musica, Zeebrugge Ferry Terminal, National Art",Caption
"Museum of China), and, of course, Toyo Ito (Sendai Mediatheque, U House).",Paragraph
"No single practice lays claim (or, for that matter, is trying to lay claim) to this",Paragraph
"new plan type, and none of them can be said to deploy it consistently. Still, when",Paragraph
scanning these projects an increasingly forceful exhibition of evolved plan thinking,Paragraph
"comes into focus. The fifth plan’s presence might be found in a single building, in a",Paragraph
"part of a building, across a string of projects produced by a particular practice, or in",Paragraph
a cross section of work by many architects. It may well be that this plan’s lack of,Paragraph
singular origin or ownership is what allows it to appear in so many different archi-,Paragraph
"tectural contexts: across scales of work, types of programs, geographies, practices,",Paragraph
"economies, and social worlds.",Paragraph
What Is The Fifth Plan?,Title
"The fifth plan is compound, a fact that tints all other definitions that might be",Paragraph
"ascribed to it. As will be elaborated below, the fifth plan’s propensity to combine",Paragraph
rather than distill is especially true regarding its tethering of program to form.,Paragraph
"Without a doubt, the fifth plan’s breadth-mandate is at least in part an echo of",Paragraph
today’s de rigueur rejection of any form of cultural singularity. But the fifth plan,Paragraph
"moves well beyond representing multiplicity. Already half a century ago, with",Paragraph
"the introduction of collage, juxtaposition, and complexity, Venturi and others",Paragraph
let us know that modernism’s singular definitions of architecture had run their,Paragraph
"course, opening the floodgates of architectural diversification. The fifth plan is only",Paragraph
that much more multiple. And yet its multiplicity is of a resolutely synthetic sort. It,Paragraph
is often impossible to discern where free-plan ends and figure begins in these new,Paragraph
"plans, or what is primary and what is secondary, or even where they sit in relation",Paragraph
"to commodity, firmness, and delight.",Paragraph
The fifth plan’s contribution to contemporary architecture lies not in its valida-,Paragraph
tion of ever more heterogeneity but rather in the unified condensate that emerges,Paragraph
when these several spatial states are brought together. In an almost alchemical,Paragraph
"sleight of hand, the fifth plan’s mash-up of origins produces a coherent organization",Paragraph
of parts that sidesteps any indexing of difference without becoming singular.,Paragraph
"With this alchemy of paradigms humming in the background, the fifth plan’s",Paragraph
"parts and their interactions can be collected under a set of plan traits: viscosity,",Paragraph
"cropping, and susceptibility. While these traits are broad and regularly overlap",Paragraph
"one another, they are nonetheless a helpful set of lenses through which to look",Paragraph
at the contemporary plan.,Paragraph
"In what follows, each of these fifth plan traits will be discussed across two",Paragraph
threads. The first will lay out kinships: what are the primary inheritances of the,Paragraph
fifth plan? The second will discuss new manifestations: where are particular tech-,Paragraph
niques present in the contemporary plan and what are the implications of these,Paragraph
"techniques? This structure is meant to suggest that while the fifth plan is new,",Paragraph
its newness does not depend on distinguishing itself from what came before.,Paragraph
The fifth plan’s newness arises from the last century’s many sustenances now coa-,Paragraph
"lescing into plan-based configurations that are, in toto, unfamiliar.",Paragraph
"The examples below include, for the most part, versions of all of the traits above",Paragraph
(small scale work — houses — present these characteristics in a different way simply,Paragraph
because of their size). These traits are not yet capable of defining a fifth plan hand-,Paragraph
"book, though they might be seen as a manual in the making. Together, they are",Paragraph
"meant to identify organizational and formal strains circulating in plans today, to",Paragraph
"highlight them at times and, more ambitiously, to advance their combined possi-",Paragraph

their respective sensibilities. Mies’ building mirrors work that he had been doing,Paragraph
since at least the mid-1950s and Moneo’s emanates from discourses running,Paragraph
through architecture as early as the 1960s. The late appearance of exclusively open,Paragraph
or defined approaches in these projects exposes the tenaciousness of the debate.,Paragraph
"Among architects, this debate has a tendency to be framed in unusually profound",Paragraph
"(even moral} terms, obliging us to align our sympathies and leaving us with little",Paragraph
"middle ground. There are those who side with flexibility, the virtues of technolo-",Paragraph

"who align with functional discretion, the rhetorical value of rooms, and the stabi-",Paragraph

inous spatial system that slows down the dynamics of its larger organizational,Paragraph

A different version of the fifth plan’s viscosity occurs in Kazuyo Sejima’s entry,Paragraph
"for the IIT Student Center competition. In this non-winning scheme, Sejima con-",Paragraph
fronted Miesian universal space by replicating that very space with her own big box,Paragraph
"and then relentlessly over-packing that box with program. Imagine, for a moment,",Paragraph
"Mies’ Neue Nationalgalerie filled to the brim with a mini-mall, albeit a mini-mall",Paragraph
saturated with the material /technological /aesthetic affections that an architect like,Paragraph
Sejima would of course lavish upon Mies. The project’s aformality no doubt halted,Paragraph
it at the starting gate vis-A-vis the competition (the scheme was presented in a set of,Paragraph
ink line drawings so delicate that it read as little more than a vaporous cloud of,Paragraph
"hair-like marks hovering over paper). The Sejima IIT proposal is, nonetheless, a",Paragraph
radical repackaging of Mies’ universalism and Koolhaas’ congestion in a single,Paragraph
"architectural prism, producing fifth plan viscosity through extreme functional",Paragraph
compactness.,Paragraph
New viscosities have risen out of our pursuit of closer program-form relation-,Paragraph
ships. With so much airtime given over to arguing the merits of program or form in,Paragraph
"recent years, the mere fact of these two interests coinciding marks an evolution in",Paragraph
"plan thinking. Beyond this realignment, however, the program-form merger has",Paragraph
"given us a means of being unabashedly geometric and willfully programmatic,",Paragraph
which is to say these projects suggest a shift away from our recent (over)indul-,Paragraph
gences of indeterminacy and flexibility as architectural paradigms. The merger,Paragraph
"of form and program leads directly to the thickening of relationships and, what",Paragraph
"is more, directly to an explicit declaration of organizational subjectivity. New",Paragraph
"viscosities are filled with programmatic densities and intensifications, common turf",Paragraph
over recent decades. But the fifth plan inscribes in this mix the force of deliberate-,Paragraph
"ness, an open assertion concerning a plan’s artifice (its partiality) and a chance to say",Paragraph
“this isn’t all worlds; this is a world that I think is better.”,Paragraph
Cropping,Title
"Over the last century, countless black lines have been laid down on countless sheets",Paragraph
of white paper with the sole purpose of laying claim to what an architectural perim-,Paragraph
eter should do. These lines at times focus on the relationship between interior and,Paragraph
exterior. At other times they articulate the form of a building or its functional ethos.,Paragraph
"Regardless of what we intend when we draw them, these lines have been",Paragraph
enmeshed in our conception of the plan with one of two inevitable outcomes: a,Paragraph
perimeter that is definite (high contrast) or a perimeter that is indefinite dow,Paragraph
contrast).,Paragraph
"As endgames, high and low contrast perimeters depend on how one chooses to",Paragraph
inscribe form and program relative to one another. This choice represents a fork in,Paragraph
the road for architects: either “architecture = stabilizing vis-a-vis life” or “architec-,Paragraph
"ture = vulnerable vis-a-vis life.” This choice is, to say the least, loaded. It is the",Paragraph
"undercurrent running beneath many of our ideological directives and, as such,",Paragraph
is how we edit (bias) architecture’s otherwise too-expansive cultural resonances,Paragraph
in directions that we “believe in.” One might see form and program as concentric,Paragraph
(i.e. Frank Gehry’s shrink-wrapped EMR Communication and Technology Center),Paragraph
or one might see them as cross-grained (i.e. Mies van der Rohe’s pin-wheeling Brick,Paragraph
Country House). Concentric sensibilities produce high contrast perimeters and,Paragraph
"cross-grained sensibilities produce low contrast perimeters. Curiously, making this",Paragraph
decision has little to do with deciding to “be formalist” or “be functionalist” —,Paragraph
Gehry’s UTS Business School is cross-grained at times and Mies’ latter career work,Paragraph
"(Farnsworth House, Crown Hall, etc.) is decidedly concentric. What this decision",Paragraph
does do is inscribe a reciprocal relationship between form and program in the way,Paragraph
that we access architecture. A concentric form/ program sensibility leads us to “see”,Paragraph
form and “intuit” program while a cross-grained form/program sensibility directs,Paragraph
us to “see” program and “intuit” form.,Paragraph
Our penchant for high or low contrast decisiveness along architecture’s outer,Paragraph
boundaries has disappeared. This change is not about indecisiveness. Neither is,Paragraph
"it about one or the other boundary types having won the war. In fact, any number",Paragraph
of recent projects can be said to depend on a calculated cohabitation of these traits.,Paragraph
"These projects include Herzog & de Meuron’s Cottbus Library, Michael Maltzan’s",Paragraph
"unbuilt Malibu Beach House, Gintautas Natkevicius’ Family House in Birstonas,",Caption
"SANAA’s Kanazawa Museum, and Toyo Ito’s Sendai Mediatheque as well as his",Paragraph
"Tama Art University Library, among others.",Paragraph
"Each of these projects crops plan relations into new sub-states, using the overlay",Paragraph
of a knife-like line to compress some proximities while atomizing others. Cropping,Paragraph
"amplifies unevenness in these plans, which is to say cropping confronts head-on any",Paragraph

ing’s seven floors; their slight variations are alone unable to produce significant,Paragraph
affectations of each plate’s organization. But the lines that Ito introduces on each,Paragraph
level — the walls and scrims that slice across and lasso subsets of column-spotted,Paragraph
space — convert each floor into its own biased world. The ground floor’s “open,Paragraph
square” is formed with the sharpest of lines...one that is little more than a virtual,Paragraph
indicator of this space’s status as a programmatic no-man’s land. On the second,Paragraph

ingly flippant line is etched among the columns so as to profoundly prejudice the,Paragraph

"Herzog & de Meuron’s Cottbus Library also depends on cropping, though here",Paragraph
the technique plays out primarily on the building’s perimeter in contrast to the,Paragraph
Mediatheque’s use of cropping as an exclusively interior technique. Cottbus holds,Paragraph

modulation has a fistfight with order (Venturi’s Hanna Venturi House); sequel-,Paragraph
modern: modulation and order take a time-out (OMA’s Netherlands Architecture,Title
Institute); fifth plan: modulation makes order susceptible.,Paragraph
"In short, modulation and order have never been far apart but they have regularly",Paragraph
changed their posture relative to each other. Their perceived estrangement appears,Paragraph
"with postmodernism, when modulation and order take up adversarial positions,",Paragraph
"producing a surfeit of anti-hegemony, anti-total, anti-object, anti-you-name-it archi-",Paragraph
"tectures. In fact, postmodernism’s adversarial repositioning of modulation and",Paragraph
order allowed us to conduct countless fruitful architectural experiments leading,Paragraph
"to a plethora of alternative-orders in architecture, all the while requiring us to",Paragraph
mutter the second part of that hyphenated phrase — “orders” — under our breath,Paragraph
to avoid persecution.,Paragraph
The fifth plan establishes another new posture in the order-modulation sequence,Paragraph
"of relationships: a modulated order whose aim is susceptibility, not firmness. This",Paragraph
"posture amounts to, on the one hand, a resurrection of order as a positive attribute",Paragraph
"and, on the other, a deployment of that order in a way that runs entirely contrary to",Paragraph
"its legacy as a civilizing/ stabilizing agent. In the fifth plan, order is always there but",Paragraph
"always volatile, unpredictable, and sometimes woolly. It is also legible, coherent,",Paragraph
and even reasonable.,Paragraph
The most important attribute of this new susceptibility is the ability of contem-,Paragraph
porary modulating systems to generate relationships that exceed their systemic,Paragraph
terms (in contrast to modern or classical systems that work diligently to reinforce,Paragraph
their systemic underpinnings). The Mediatheque’s 13 columns are arrayed across a,Paragraph
"four-by-three near-grid, with a single exceptional column intruding on its southern-",Paragraph
"most near-grid column line. This grid’s wobbliness — it teeters it in the X, Y, and",Paragraph

"from modulation, with comparably extreme implications for what we intend as",Paragraph
"order. Ona spatial level, the inebriations of these columns heighten their independ-",Paragraph
"ence from one another, making each of them susceptible to absorption into local",Paragraph
"circumstances. They are variously enmeshed in rooms (floors two, three, and",Paragraph
"seven), border markers (floors one, three, five, and six), and free agents (floors",Paragraph
"two, three, and four). As conduits of gravity, their intoxications are kept in check",Paragraph
by the physics of plate tectonics — the span of Matsuro Sasaki’s extraordinary,Paragraph
webbed floor system was constrained by a 40 cm depth requirement. Programmat-,Paragraph
"ically, in other words, the soft modulation of these columns allows their systemic",Paragraph
role to entirely dissolve while technically these same modulations unload an almost,Paragraph
heroic structural obligation onto the spanning and design requirements of the,Paragraph
webbed floor system. The former is a system that produces its own disappearance,Paragraph
"and the latter is a system that incites an extreme rationality elsewhere. And, almost",Paragraph
"miystically, the two systems are one and the same, a single set of wobbly columns.",Paragraph
Mansilla & Tufién’s MUSAC building announces an alternate version of a,Paragraph
modulating system that consumes itself. MUSAC is astonishingly consistent in,Paragraph

transformations in our thinking about architecture are taking place and many of,Paragraph
those changes will find their greatest potential among the marks that make up,Paragraph

"under which the fifth plan will continue to evolve. Nonetheless, regardless of",Paragraph
"how these labels might be applied, their net effect is to illuminate a series of recent",Paragraph
speculations leading to new conceptualizations of architecture.,Paragraph

Glass,Title
"Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa, founders and partners at SANAA, have",Paragraph
worked on a number of designs for museographic institutions for the past 20 years.,Paragraph
"The most significant and realized designs include the N Museum in Wakayama,",Paragraph
"Japan (1995-97), the Glass Pavilion at the Toledo Museum of Art, Ohio",Caption
"(2001-06), the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York (2003-07), the",Paragraph
"Serpentine Gallery Pavilion in London (2009), the Teshima Art Museum in Japan,",Paragraph
"and the Louvre-Lens in Lens, France, completed in 2012.",Paragraph
"Among these designs, the Kanazawa museum may be considered their first",Paragraph
"major realized commission, designed and built between 1999 and 2004. In this case,",Paragraph
there was a close collaboration between the architects and the art director of the,Paragraph
"institution, Yuko Hasegawa. Hasegawa wanted the museum to showcase recent",Paragraph
"art, from 1980 onward, and at the same time to reflect the local, Kanazawa tradition",Paragraph
"of pottery and craftwork, which has a smaller presence in the museum’s collection.",Paragraph
She coined the term “new flexibility” to refer to the spatial quality of the museum,Paragraph
"as articulated through a large number of spaces of different size, instead of a few",Paragraph
large areas that could be partitioned in temporary ways.,Paragraph
"This is a fresh concept in museographic design, and one that framed the resulting",Paragraph
decision of conceiving Kanazawa as a dense cluster of rooms. Any exhibition or,Paragraph
"display would therefore need to be adapted to the sequence of rooms, which pro-",Paragraph
"vide different conditions of volume, height, light, and so on. SANAA expressed that",Paragraph
"this engagement of the museum’s director was crucial to the design process, and",Paragraph
"was much appreciated by the architects. Indeed, Kazuyo Sejima pointed out during",Paragraph
an interview that new museums are too often designed before a museographic,Paragraph
project is in place. This programmatic vacuum translates into a tendency to overly,Paragraph
"emphasize the need for flexibility in the architectural result, so that when the cura-",Paragraph
"torial team would later start working on their project, the building would also need",Paragraph
to adapt to its spatial requirements. In Sejima’s words:,Paragraph
"In Japan, the client usually requires that the architect create big exhibition spaces that",Paragraph
"use movable walls, so we [SANAA and Hasegawa] decided against making two or",Paragraph
"three big spaces and designed eighteen smaller spaces. The circulation is flexible,",Paragraph
"so that she can arrange the exhibition spaces in different ways, according to the needs",Paragraph
"of each show... This allows them to run separate, smaller shows simultaneously, or to",Paragraph
use the whole museum. It’s very different from the usual way of operating.’,Paragraph
The design started as a grouping of rectangular spaces of different sizes and,Paragraph
"shapes, tightly clustered and held together by a circle in plan, a low cylinder that",Paragraph
"constitutes the limit and facade of the building. In volume, the 18 rooms emerge",Paragraph
"over the level of the general rooftop with different heights, so that the complex",Paragraph
appears as a micro-city contained by a disc of glass.,Paragraph
SANAA’s other museum designs also conceive the entire building as a grouping,Paragraph
of independent volumes. The New Museum in New York City appears as an irreg-,Paragraph

a complex yet neatly organized food tray. As a reference to the glass objects being,Paragraph
"exhibited, all volumes are shaped with rounded edges, and this geometry allows for",Paragraph
a more fluid connection between the units.,Paragraph
"As Akos Moravanszky has noted, the frequent use by SANAA of curved glass",Paragraph
