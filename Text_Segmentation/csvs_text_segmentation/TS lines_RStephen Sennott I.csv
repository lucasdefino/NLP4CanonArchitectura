BOOK RStephen Sennott I.pdf,Caption
INTRODUCTION,Title
"In its broad coverage of architecture produced between 1900 and 2000, the provides",Paragraph
"a three-volume, English-language reference work for scholars, professionals, students,",Paragraph
and the general public seeking a basic understanding of interdependent topics that define,Paragraph
"the production of architecture in the developed cities, countries, and regions of the world.",Paragraph
"Seeking the breadth and diversity of any encyclopedic endeavor, the project extends its",Paragraph
coverage beyond the conventional study of prominent architects and their buildings to,Paragraph
address important related facets of 20th-century architectural production that motivate,Paragraph
architects and their clients and give form and meaning to their buildings.,Paragraph
"Arranged in alphabetical order, the entries fall into three broad areas: persons, places,",Paragraph
"and architecture topics. Persons include architects and firms, critics, and historians;",Paragraph
"places include countries and regions, cities, specific buildings and sites, and unbuilt",Paragraph
"projects; architecture topics include materials and building technology, building types,",Paragraph
"stylistic and theoretical terms, schools and movements, architectural practice and the",Title
"profession, and planning. Ranging in length from 1,000 to 4,000 words, each article is",Paragraph
written for the well-informed general reader and signed by an established scholar or,Paragraph
"professional with expertise in the subject. In addition, each architecture topic and places",Paragraph
"entry includes a selected bibliography; each person’s entry includes a capsule biography,",Paragraph
"a list of selected works, and a selected bibliography. The bibliographies consist of",Paragraph
standard works and recent scholarship to enable the student or scholar to expand his or,Paragraph
her research.,Paragraph
This project set out in 1998 in Chicago with the editorial staff of Fitzroy Dearborn,Paragraph
Publishers to shape a broad and inclusive reference work designed to provide description,Paragraph
"and analysis of 20th-century architects, buildings, and places from a global perspective.",Paragraph
"In its review of an enormously inventive century of ambitious architectural production,",Paragraph
the editorial team quickly recognized that the most useful reference work would include,Paragraph
far more than buildings and architects alone. The therefore aims to explain the range,Paragraph
"of technological, professional, and historical factors that the architectural process entails,",Paragraph
from drawings to the completed building. The far-reaching influence of important,Paragraph
"architects, sustainability and new materials, new digital technologies, and global",Title
"proliferation of large-scale building types, for example, has altered the scope of modern",Paragraph
"architectural practice. Moreover, 20th-century architecture profoundly engaged many",Paragraph
"new constituencies, including the general public. In its efforts to provide a broader",Paragraph
"audience with a more inclusive understanding of architectural practice, the project seeks",Paragraph
to frame a vast scope of selected topics that have defined and directed 20th-century,Paragraph
architecture and its consumption worldwide.,Paragraph
"The practice of architecture has become enormously complex, as modern airports and",Paragraph
"skyscrapers make clear. Wherever constructed, a single building requires the design team",Paragraph
"to understand traditional and innovative materials, new construction technologies,",Paragraph
"building types, historic precedent, and related planning needs. Readers of the will",Paragraph
benefit from an understanding of these interconnections. It is the editorial team’s belief,Paragraph
that one strength of this project is the selective inclusion of a diverse range of architecture,Paragraph
subjects rarely examined together with important buildings and their architects. To,Paragraph
"facilitate these connections, the book provides readers with extensive internal cross-",Paragraph
"references in the majority of entries and a comprehensive, analytical index.",Paragraph
International coverage required a variety of critical perspectives from a diverse group,Paragraph
"of scholarly and professional experts. From the start, the task of defining the scope and",Paragraph
content of this project reiterated the complexity of architectural production in the last,Paragraph
hundred years. Consulting for several months with a distinguished international advisory,Paragraph
"board of scholars and architects, architectural historian and volume editor R.Stephen",Caption
Sennott has organized a far-reaching investigation of architecture from all regions of the,Paragraph
world. The final selection of topics found in these three volumes is the result of a long,Paragraph
and careful evaluation of a much longer list of proposed topics.,Paragraph
"To the benefit of this project, the advisory board’s contributions were both",Paragraph
contradictory and consistent in their careful explanations of what should be included or,Paragraph
excluded from these pages. This debate served to balance the book’s perspective and,Paragraph
"content. In short, the principal criteria for inclusion were, first, that the individual or topic",Paragraph
"had had a lasting or formative effect on architecture or, second, that the individual or",Paragraph
topic reinforced the international scope of the encyclopedia. One strength of this,Paragraph
reference work is its deliberate effort to accommodate these differences and,Paragraph
contradictions by including a diverse range of advisors and a balanced variety of expert,Paragraph
writers able to recognize the global character of architectural practice in the 20th century.,Paragraph
"In concert with the advisory board’s recommendations, the book profiles this century’s",Paragraph
vast chronicle of architectural achievements within and well beyond the confines of mid-,Paragraph
"century modernism. Even so, and with apologies to readers who note the absence of a",Paragraph
"subject they hold as significant, it has obviously not been possible to include every",Paragraph
"architect, building, or topic of architectural significance. Indeed, following this",Paragraph
"challenging editorial process, and in light of compelling scholarship of the last 15 years,",Paragraph
it is the editorial team’s collective hope that this project will encourage further study of,Paragraph
"the global, interconnected character of architecture and its production. The encyclopedia",Paragraph
will provide an effective starting point for researchers and readers for years ahead.,Paragraph
"Whatever the risks of this ambitious reference work, an international team of 300",Paragraph
"writers—architectural historians, architects, engineers, preservationists, urban historians,",Paragraph
"critics, and independent scholars—has presented a wide-ranging and critical assessment",Paragraph
"of buildings, architects, cities, and related architecture topics to provide professionals and",Paragraph
general readers alike with an integrated view of architectural production around the,Paragraph
world. Scholars and practitioners from related design and building professions have,Paragraph
written more than 700 entries that collectively provide readers with a distinct approach to,Paragraph
"20th-century architecture’s materials, theory, design, and practice. Such a broad and",Paragraph
sweeping study invites complexities and risks; to leave some of these as unresolved,Paragraph
defines some aspects of modern and contemporary architectural practice. This diversity,Paragraph
of authorship and critical viewpoints makes this a requisite source for general readers and,Paragraph
the architectural profession alike as they seek basic information about 20th-century,Paragraph
"architecture. Given its expansive sweep, the is directed at a diverse readership and",Paragraph
provides a wide variety of information on a great number of subjects.,Paragraph
Architectural Topics (179 entries),Title
"From broad and inclusive entries to shorter entries, topics have been selected because of",Paragraph
"their generally acknowledged importance in directing architectural form, fulfilling",Paragraph
"programmatic needs, directing style and change, and otherwise affecting the practice of",Paragraph
architecture during the 20th century. Entries describe the topic and evaluate its effect on,Paragraph
"buildings, architects, or places around the world.",Paragraph
Materials and Building Technology (35 entries),Caption
"Entries on traditional or innovative materials describe the origins, needs, and purposes of",Paragraph
"an important building material as it evolved during the 20th century (e.g., Aluminum,",Paragraph
"Reinforced Concrete, and Truss Systems). For example, concrete has a long history;",Paragraph
"however, its dramatic new capacities have generated new construction methods as well as",Paragraph
innovative architectural form. The 20th century witnessed the invention of many new,Paragraph
"building technologies and systems, making significant contributions to architectural",Paragraph
"function. For example, air conditioning has allowed large-scale buildings to be built with",Paragraph
new standards for comfort in extreme climatic conditions.,Paragraph
Building Types (53 entries),Title
"Building types vary in their associations with form, function, or program. Many types",Paragraph
"resulted from new needs that served new methods of transportation or evolving social,",Paragraph
"industrial, recreational, or economic needs. Entries describe the building types’ forms and",Paragraph
"uses, with focus on how established building types changed during the 20th century (such",Paragraph
"as Church, House, School, Skyscraper). For example, the skyscraper has been exported",Paragraph
"from American cities to rapidly developing cities in Asia, and the resulting designs have",Paragraph
transformed the scale and appearance of these corporate emblems.,Paragraph
Stylistic and Theoretical Terms (34 entries),Caption
"Entries vary among stylistic categories and theoretical ideas that have guided architects,",Paragraph
"their clients, and recent writers and critics. Brief essays on stylistic terms characterize the",Paragraph
"features that define the style (e.g., Craftsman Style, Prairie School) while contextualizing",Paragraph
their subject within broad regional or global applications. Longer essays on theoretical,Paragraph
"terms (e.g., Art Deco, Modernism, and Postmodernism) seek to synthesize the generally",Paragraph
"accepted meaning of these terms for the general reader, identifying key writers,",Paragraph
"architects, and representative buildings as examples.",Paragraph
Schools and Movements (12 entries),Title
"Frequently, like-minded architects and supportive critics or historians have banded",Paragraph
"together to form groups, schools, and movements (both organized and loosely collective)",Paragraph
"to promote their design ideals, or retrospectively, historians have designated members of",Paragraph
"a movement on the basis of formal and historical analyses. These types of entries (e.g.,",Paragraph
"Constructivism, De Stijl, Memphis Group) identify significant leaders and explain the",Paragraph
"goals or intentions of these groups, where and for how long each school or movement has",Paragraph
"been influential or successful, and their contributions to subsequent generations.",Paragraph
Architectural Practice and the Profession (20 entries),Caption
"In its attention to 20th-century architectural practice and education, this section includes",Paragraph
topics that examine some of the important changes in the profession and its,Paragraph
"administration. Similarly, entries address how architects and their buildings are evaluated",Paragraph
"and awarded (e.g., Architectural Drawing, Education of Architects/Schools,",Paragraph
"Environmental Issues, Pritzker Architecture Prize).",Paragraph
Planning (24 entries),Title
The 20th century is marked by the evolution of the planning profession in response to,Paragraph
new and large-scale transportation and infrastructure needs. Architects and planners have,Paragraph
"often collaborated to bring about new kinds of urban, suburban, and rural development.",Paragraph
"Examples of these entries include Campus Planning, Garden City Movement, New",Paragraph
"Urbanism, and Plan of Chicago.",Paragraph
Persons (292 entries),Title
Individuals have been chosen because they have contributed significantly to the history of,Paragraph
"20th-century architecture. Regardless of where they practice in the world, individuals",Paragraph
have typically been recognized as founders or leaders in their own time or documented as,Paragraph
"highly influential practitioners for subsequent generations. Typically, they have been",Paragraph
"recognized professionally by well-known awards, prizes, or other honors. These entries",Paragraph
"consist of a signed critical essay, a capsule biography, a list of important buildings (in the",Paragraph
"case of architect entries), and a bibliography of useful sources.",Paragraph
Architects and Firms (267 entries),Caption
Architects and firms have been chosen because of their important contributions,Paragraph
throughout the world or within the boundaries of the country or regions where they,Paragraph
"practice. In addition to the world’s well-known architects and firms, the editor and",Paragraph
advisory board sought to include a diverse group of architects not frequently included in,Paragraph
standard reference works. Their work has often been recognized by their peers and juries,Paragraph
"for the superior quality of their architectural designs at a regional, national, or",Paragraph
international level.,Paragraph
Critics and Historians (25 entries),Title
"In these entries, influential critics and historians represent ways in which primary",Paragraph
writings and assorted publications have significantly affected 20th-century architecture,Paragraph
and its reception within professional circles and the public realm.,Paragraph
Places (277 entries),Title
"Given the rapid changes that define this century’s political and geographical boundaries,",Paragraph
the advisory board chose to blend regional and national surveys with the project’s,Paragraph
deliberate focus on major and progressive cities around the world that can be evaluated,Paragraph
for their architectural significance. These essays will inevitably privilege the most well-,Paragraph
"known places (including countries and major cities), but they also will provide a far more",Paragraph
diverse selection than currently is available in architecture reference works.,Paragraph
With the 2002 acquisition of this project from Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers by the,Paragraph
"Taylor and Francis Group, an inspiring and experienced editorial team at Routledge",Paragraph
"Reference brought this to fruition. In the course of editing and producing this book,",Paragraph
they have researched and assembled over 500 photographs and illustrations that trace the,Paragraph
"developments in architecture around the globe and across the 20th century. In addition,",Paragraph
each of the three volumes has an eight-page insert of color photographs. The result is an,Paragraph
encyclopedia that provides not only depth and breadth of scholarship but also beautifully,Paragraph
illustrates the many facets of 20th-century architecture.,Paragraph
The few existing reference works related to architecture include dictionaries of,Paragraph
"individual architects or individual countries and a range of encyclopedia topics; however,",Paragraph
the is distinguished by its global scope and purposeful integration of architects and,Paragraph
buildings with a selected set of highly important architectural topics. It is the hope of the,Paragraph
"practicing architects and engineers, architectural historians, preservationists, and other",Paragraph
"experts, who have together created this multilayered examination of 20th-century",Paragraph
"architecture, that this reference work will be an indispensable addition to any art,",Paragraph
"architecture, or history library.",Paragraph
A,Title
"AALTO, ALVAR 1898-1976",Title
"Architect, Finland",Title
"Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto, whose architecture is often described as organic and close",Paragraph
"to nature, is regarded as one of the most significant architects of the 20th century. The",Paragraph
majority of historians and critics emphasize three aspects in Aalto’s architecture that set it,Paragraph
apart from any other architect’s work and explain his importance: his concern for the,Paragraph
"human qualities of the environment, his love of nature, and his Finnish heritage.",Paragraph
It seems that Aalto’s architecture is a socially refined reflection of Le Corbusier’s,Paragraph
"work, a masterly connection of avant-garde culture with traditional values. Despite being",Paragraph
"well integrated into the art world, apparently Aalto did not hesitate to include in his",Paragraph
designs unfashionable issues that were dismissed by other architects of his time:,Paragraph
"individuality in mass housing, social equality in theaters, and his foible for details, such",Paragraph
"as extreme, carefully planned light systems in public buildings. From this angle, Aalto",Paragraph
"turns out to be a pure dissident of the avant-garde, emphasizing the complexity of",Paragraph
architecture by leaving aesthetic values behind him.,Paragraph
"Even before adopting the language of modernist architecture, the young Aalto was",Paragraph
"determined to be as avant-garde as possible, which in Scandinavia in the early 1920s",Paragraph
meant a sophisticated and mannerist neoclassicism. His early work shows the influence,Paragraph
of anonymous irregular Italian architecture and neoclassical formality as developed by,Paragraph
"19th-century architects such as Carl Ludwig Engel, and these strategies were to remain",Paragraph
important throughout his career. His most interesting buildings from this time are the,Paragraph
"Jyvaskyla Workers’ Club (1925), the church (1929) in Muurame, and the Seinajoki Civil",Paragraph
Guard Building (1926) and the Defense Corps Building (1929) in Jyvaskylé. Aalto,Caption
organized the facade of the Workers’ Club like the Palazzo Ducale in Venice by setting a,Paragraph
"heavy, closed volume on airy Doric columns on the ground floor. The almost",Paragraph
"symmetrical facade is challenged by a Palladian-style window that is shifted to one side,",Paragraph
"marking the location of a theater on the first floor. The church in Muurame, which also",Paragraph
"recalls an Italian motif, namely, Alberti’s Sant Andrea at Mantua, is on the outside very",Paragraph
"much into the neoclassical tradition, whereas its interior emphasis on light anticipates",Paragraph
"later church designs, such as the churches in Imatra and Wolfsburg.",Paragraph
"In 1924 Aalto traveled to Vienna and Italy with his wife and partner Aino Marsio,",Paragraph
"where he made several sketches that had a great effect on their later work. However,",Paragraph
"Aalto did not ignore the development in continental Europe, either, and his conversion to",Paragraph
"international functionalism can be traced back to the autumn of 1927, when he and Erik",Paragraph
Bryggman jointly designed a modernist proposal for the Kauppiaitten Osakeyhtié office,Paragraph
building competition. Le Corbusier’s reputation among Scandinavian architects had been,Paragraph
"widely disseminated by a 1926 article in the Swedish magazine by Uno Ahren, and",Paragraph
"Aalto’s first functionalist buildings, the Standardized Apartment Building in Turku",Paragraph
"(1928) and, more important, the Turun Sanomat office building (1929), demonstrated al",Paragraph
of Le Corbusier’s five points.,Paragraph
"The beginning of international recognition was marked in 1929, when Aalto was",Paragraph
invited to join the newly founded CIAM (Congrés Internationaux d’Architecture,Paragraph
Moderne) and he attended the second congress of CIAM in Frankfurt on the theme of,Paragraph
“Housing for the Existenzminimum.” Other masterpieces of functionalism were created,Paragraph
"by Aalto in the following years, including the Paimio Tuberculosis Sanatorium (1933)",Caption
"and the Viipuri Library (1935). During this time, Aalto started designing bent-plywood",Paragraph
"furniture, which he later developed into standard types. From 1942 Aino Aalto directed",Paragraph
"the Artek Company, which had been set up in 1935 for the manufacture of this furniture.",Paragraph
"These experiments also affected the architectural designs: in the mid-1930s, Aalto",Paragraph
"introduced the famous curved, suspended wooden ceiling as an acoustical device for the",Paragraph
lecture room of the Viipuri Library. Although the functioning of this element is very,Paragraph
"questionable, curved walls and ceilings became typical of his later work.",Paragraph
"In the 1930s, surprisingly enough, Aalto, who had until this point been known as the",Paragraph
"most modern of Finnish architects, began returning to the vernacular tradition. With the",Paragraph
"Finnish Pavilions to the World Exhibitions in Paris (1937) and New York (1939), he",Paragraph
infused functionalism with his own organic alternative and radically parted ways with,Paragraph
"mainstream International Style. The critics appreciated this move, for they saw Aalto’s",Paragraph
primitivism in connection with his origin in the exotic and unspoiled Finland.,Paragraph
Most important for Aalto’s architectural reputation was Sigfried Giedion’s analysis in,Paragraph
"the second edition of (1949). Giedion’s interpretation of Aalto’s work as Finnish,",Paragraph
"organic, and irrational helped Aalto to achieve worldwide fame after World War IL The",Paragraph
integration of building and nature emerged as a central theme in Aalto’s work; this is,Paragraph
exemplified in his designs for the Sunila pulp mill (1937) and the Sunila housing for,Paragraph
"employees (1939). In the engineering staff housing, the first fan-plan motif appears,",Paragraph
which became a crucial element in his designs. Characteristic of this period is his interest,Paragraph
"in natural materials, such as wood, brick, and grass roofs, as he demonstrated in one of",Paragraph
"his masterpieces, the Villa Mairea (1939) in Noormarkku. The villa is often praised for its",Paragraph
"harmonious relationship with nature and reference to old Finnish farmsteads. However,",Paragraph
"Finnish critics did not originally recognize Aalto’s buildings as particularly Finnish but,",Paragraph
"rather, as Le Corbusiersian with Japanese touches. Gustaf Strengell noted that the",Paragraph
interiors of the Viipuri Library exhibited strikingly Japanese characteristics in their use of,Paragraph
light wood in its natural state. The Villa Mairea was originally a collage of Le Corbusian,Paragraph
"modernism with Japanese tearooms, African columns, Cubist paintings, and continental",Paragraph
Heimatstil until it slowly became a paradigm of “Finnish” or “natural” architecture in the,Paragraph
modern architectural discourse.,Paragraph
After the war Aalto was again commissioned by the Massachusetts Institute of,Paragraph
"Technology to build a student dormitory, where brick was a typical material for the other",Paragraph
"campus facades. The Baker Dormitory (1949) was Aalto’s first experiment with brick,",Paragraph
"and throughout the 1950s his oeuvre was dominated by the use of red brick. Later, he",Paragraph
"used the brick as a metaphor for standardization, claiming that the cell was the module of",Paragraph
"nature, and the brick would occupy an analogous position in architecture. His most",Paragraph
important works of this period include the Expressionist House of Culture (1958) and the,Paragraph
"National Pensions Institute office building (1957), both in Helsinki. The House of Culture",Caption
"consists of a curvilmear theater and a rectangular office block, a typical Aalto",Paragraph
"arrangement of organic versus orthogonal shapes, where the public space is articulated in",Paragraph
a free form and more private functions are placed in rectangular shapes. As in most of his,Paragraph
"designs, all elements including the apparently free form follow a hidden geometric grid,",Paragraph
"with the center being a fountain in the courtyard, where a giant hand presents a tiny",Paragraph
"model of the building. Inside the theater, he experimented again with the acoustic ceiling",Paragraph
but also drew on references to the facade of Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye. The Saynatsalo,Paragraph
"Town Hall (1952), another brick building, is a small version of the piazza theme that",Paragraph
Aalto elaborated further in the town center of Seinajoki (1956-69). After the death of,Paragraph
"Aino in 1949, Aalto married the architect Elissa Makiniemi, for whom he built the",Paragraph
"Muuratsalo Summer House (1953), or experimental house with an inner courtyard. The",Paragraph

Although Aalto’s brick buildings from the late 1940s and 1950s won international,Paragraph
"critical acclaim, for his commissions in Germany—the Hansaviertel House (1957) in",Paragraph
"Berlin, the Neue Vahr Apartment building (1962), and the parish centers in Detmerode",Paragraph
(1968) and Wolfsburg (1962)—he chose international white modernism while at the,Paragraph
same time continuing to use brick in the Otaniemi (1974) and Jyvaskyla (1971),Paragraph
"universities. This choice may seem surprising, given that brick had a strong regional",Paragraph
"connotation in Hanseatic cities, whereas in Finland the dominant building material was",Paragraph
"wood. Hence, Aalto’s use of brick in Finland cannot be understood as primitive or",Paragraph
"regional, and he himself connected brick rather with Central Europe, whereas Finnish",Paragraph
architects of around 1900 tended to view it as Russian. Aalto did not want to simply,Paragraph
"reproduce tradition, and so he worked in both Finland and Germany explicitly against",Paragraph
tradition and concentrated more on the symbolic selfidentity of the community than on,Paragraph
local traditions or building techniques.,Paragraph
"The German project Neue Vahr, a slender skyscraper in a suburb of Bremen and the",Paragraph
"most daring use of the fan plan, is odd in another way. Although in 1934 he had proposed",Paragraph
"high-rise housing for Munkkiniemi, Helsinki, Aalto was generally known as an",Paragraph
"outspoken critic of tall buildings. He argued that high-rise apartments were, both socially",Paragraph
"and architecturally, a considerably more dangerous form of building than single-family",Paragraph
"houses or low-rise apartments, and therefore they needed a more stringent architectural",Paragraph
"standard and greater artistry and social responsibility. Despite these reservations, in June",Paragraph
1958 he was appointed to build the 22-story tower Neue Vahr and later the Schénbiihl,Paragraph
"high-rise block of flats (1968) in Lucerne, Switzerland. However, his solutions were",Paragraph
"praised as outstanding examples of modern housing, and both the Hansaviertel House and",Paragraph
the Neue Vahr supported his reputation as a humanist architect among his modernists,Paragraph
colleagues.,Paragraph
In 1959 he received the commission for the Enso-Gutzeit headquarters on a prestigous,Paragraph
site next to the harbor of Helsinki. In this work he referred partly to the notion of an,Paragraph
Italian while at the same time responding to Engel’s neoclassical harbor front. With its,Paragraph
"location right next to the Russian Orthodox Uspensky Cathedral, the strange composition",Paragraph
of the House of Culture is repeated: a rectangular modernist office building adjacent to a,Paragraph
curved public brick building. Aalto’s public buildings of this time are in the tradition of,Paragraph
Bruno Taut’s Stadtkrone: they are meant to support the identification of the individual,Paragraph
with the community and—appropriate for monuments—are usually cladded with marble,Paragraph
tiles. The striped marble facade of the Cultural Center (1962) in Wolfsburg is reminiscent,Paragraph
"of Siena, whereas the white Finlandia hall (1971) looks more like a snowy hill. Both the",Paragraph
"Finlandia and the Essen Opera House (competition 1959, completed 1988) are very much",Paragraph
in the Expressionist tradition and seem to celebrate the social event of visiting a theater,Paragraph
rather than responding to the functional needs of an opera.,Paragraph
"Aalto’s image in crticism does not really reflect his sensitivity to region, nature, or the",Paragraph
human being in an abstract sense but rather in the context of critical debates on the lack,Paragraph
"of regional, natural, and human qualities in international modernism. Thus, in Géran",Paragraph
"Schildt’s characterization of Aalto as the secret opponent within the Modern movement,",Paragraph
the word “within” should be emphasized. Aalto did not undermine the cultural field of,Paragraph
"modermism but exercised his critique internally. Many of his 1950s buildings, for",Paragraph
"example, addressed the placelessness of modern architecture, which critics had",Paragraph
"complained about. His Rautatalo office building (Helsinki, 1955) in particular was",Paragraph
singled out by critics as a successful example of contextualism because the brick corner,Paragraph

The Austrian-born architect Raimund Abraham has played an influential role in,Paragraph
architectural discourse and education over the last four decades. His challenging oeuvre,Paragraph

drawing and collage that would suffuse his later work.,Paragraph
In 1964 Abraham moved to the United States to further a career in architectural,Paragraph
"education, taking up a position as assistant professor at the Rhode Island School of",Paragraph
Design. Since 1971 Abraham has been involved in education at a range of major,Paragraph
"international universities, holding professorships at the Cooper Union, the Pratt Institute,",Paragraph
"and the graduate schools of Yale and Harvard. In 30 years of academic life, he has also",Paragraph
"held visiting professorships at the University of California, Los Angeles; the",Paragraph
Architectural Association; and various other North American and European universities.,Paragraph
"Abraham’s attitude to education, and his architectural practice, is subversive, and his",Paragraph
position is often critical of the architectural establishment and its compliance with the,Paragraph
principles of modern architecture. Abraham sees in modern architectural discourse a,Paragraph
rupture with history that has prevented architects from understanding completely the,Paragraph
"elemental process of architecture. For Abraham, the 20th-century preoccupation with",Paragraph
fashion and style has prevented a thorough understanding of the principles of building,Paragraph
and the clarity of thought that they demand. Abraham urges a return to the a priori,Paragraph
"principles of construction concerned with the nature of materials, site, and program.",Paragraph
"Abraham posits architectural drawing as an equivalent means of expression, where the",Paragraph
paper becomes a site for the poetry of architecture. The intellectual act of building,Paragraph
"surpasses the ultimate physical product. For Abraham, built architecture is often endemic",Paragraph
to the forces of compromise.,Paragraph
"Throughout the 1970s, Abraham galvanized his theoretical position by undertaking an",Paragraph
extensive series of unbuilt houses concerned primarily with Heidegger’s notion of,Paragraph
"dwelling. Abraham maintains that “collision” is the “ontological basis of architecture,”",Paragraph
offering as an example the horizon as the most basic junction between the earth and the,Paragraph
"sky. Abraham defines the process of architecture as either digging into the earth, or",Paragraph
reach-ing for the sky—all building is intrinsically related to these primordial elements.,Paragraph
"These elements become central to many of Abraham’s designs of the period, such as",Paragraph
House for the Sun and House with Two Horizons. The abstract house designs sought to,Paragraph
"strip architecture down to its most essential state, arranging architectonic elements within",Paragraph
a formal language of rectilinear forms often embedded within the topology of a generic,Paragraph
"natural site. Presented largely in rendered axonometric projection, the designs crystallized",Paragraph
"complex theoretical principles into simple spatial meditations, as is evidenced by titles",Paragraph
"such as House without Rooms, House with Three Walls, and House for Euclid.",Paragraph
"In the 1980s Abraham’s attention turned toward monuments, concentrating on historic",Paragraph
"European centers such as Venice, Berlin, and Paris. Abraham’s unbuilt projects from this",Paragraph
period interweave themes of juxtaposition and subversion to arrive at a new,Paragraph
monumentality capable of questioning the historical significance of architectural form.,Paragraph
The instability inherent in Abraham’s immersion within the historical landscape is most,Paragraph
"evident in his projects for the city of Venice, the Les Halles Redevelopment in Paris, and",Paragraph
the competition entry for the New Acropolis Museum in Athens (for which he was short-,Paragraph
listed).,Paragraph
One of the most poignant projects from this period is the Monument to a Fallen,Paragraph
"Building, completed in 1980. The project commemorates the collapse of the Berlin",Paragraph
"Congress Hall in the same year, proposing a prism-like vault in which traces of the",Paragraph
former structure are symbolically revealed. Similar themes are inherent in his 1981,Paragraph
project for a Monument to the Absence of the Painting which mourns the loss of,Paragraph
Picasso’s masterpiece from its provincial base to another larger museum in Spain.,Paragraph
Abraham also addresses the issue of ownership in his project of 1982 for a monumental,Paragraph
"church that would straddle the Berlin Wall, bringing a transcendental spirituality to the",Paragraph
contested space of the wall. All of Abraham’s projects from this period deeply question,Paragraph
the foundations of architecture and languish after a lost or forgotten meaning in,Paragraph
architectural discourse.,Paragraph
"As well as his portfolio of unbuilt work, Abraham has also contributed important",Paragraph
buildings both in America and in his homeland of Austria. These include individual,Paragraph
"houses, low-cost housing, and several commercial buildings. The completed buildings",Paragraph
"demonstrate a fascination similar to his unbuilt work, using archetypal forms, layering,",Paragraph
and concision to question conventional architectural form.,Paragraph
In 1988 Abraham was runner-up to Daniel Libeskind in the competition for the,Paragraph
"extension to the Jewish Museum in Berlin. Two years later, he successfully won the",Paragraph
commission to build the New Austrian Cultural Institute in Manhattan (other nominees,Caption
included Hans Hollein and Coop Himmelb(l)au). The recently completed 20-story tower,Caption
rises in the shape of a dramatic wedge from a narrow and heavily constrained site,Paragraph
obscured almost entirely by neighboring buildings. The front facade is layered with a,Paragraph
sloping curtain of cascading planes of glass punctuated by solid elements. Celebrating the,Paragraph
"link between earth and sky, the powerful form of the tower and the heavy plinth of the",Paragraph
podium reinforces Abraham’s intention to return architecture to its most basic and,Paragraph
primeval elements.,Paragraph
Abraham’s challenging and often confronting work occupies an important place,Paragraph
"within architectural discourse, fostering principles of resistance and legislating against",Paragraph
mediocrity. His attempts to return architecture to its philosophical origins in both built,Paragraph

ABSTRACTION,Title
The 20th century is indelibly marked by the new vision realized by modern art. This,Paragraph
"vision is no doubt a response to the success of material science, but it is also a cultural",Paragraph
"phenomenon, an invention that helps us adjust to the new and often daunting horizons",Paragraph
that science and technology have opened up. Architecture has benefited as much from,Paragraph
"that new artistic vision as it has from directly adopting new technology, and the invention",Paragraph
of abstract art is one of the important strands of this development.,Paragraph
Abstract art is a product of modern times. It can be seen to follow from the loss of,Paragraph
"conviction sustained by the ancient view of art as imitation, or mimesis, that is,",Paragraph
representing the visible world and placing humanity into a visible narrative. To say that,Paragraph
"photography supplanted representational art would be to oversimplify the story, but it",Paragraph
"certainly played a part, and throughout the 19th century one can trace the steps by which",Paragraph
another standard gradually took the place of the time-honored one. In British Romantic,Paragraph
painter J.M.W.Tumer’s tumultuous landscapes and in the Impressionist Claude Monet’s,Paragraph
"freely composed water lilies, we see a progression in which more and more weight is",Paragraph
"given to the artist’s feelings in front of the motif, or the subject. It is through personal",Paragraph
selection that the artist abstracts the aspects that he or she desires to emphasize and out of,Paragraph
"them constructs the composition, no longer bound by verisimilitude. Abstract art thus has",Paragraph
two principle components: abstraction and expression.,Paragraph
It was perhaps the fin-de-siécle French painter Paul Cézanne who brought the,Paragraph
movement to its point of precipitation since it was largely he who substituted the actual,Paragraph
vertical plane of the canvas for the virtual horizontal plane of Renaissance perspective.,Caption
His painting of a curve in the road creates a feeling about the road disappearing from,Paragraph
"view, not through perspective but by the multiple relations invented in a flat composition",Paragraph
"( 1882, Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Massachusetts). Equally, it was Vincent van",Paragraph
Gogh who painted with swirling pigment what he felt rather than what he saw. By 1907,Paragraph
the promptings of popular science were suggesting that physical reality must be quite,Paragraph
"different from appearance, the search was on for the “fourth dimension,” and the time",Paragraph
was ripe for the invention of Cubism. Analytical Cubism allowed the artist to give a,Paragraph
"metaphysically complex visual account of the subject, and Synthetic Cubism introduced",Paragraph
"fragmented material from the world (newsprint, textiles, paper, string) into the picture",Paragraph

"weightless rectangles of Kasimir Malevich, who opened a perspective with Russian",Paragraph
Suprematism that reaches through to the end of the century in the language of abstract,Paragraph

Architecture in the 20th century made its first steps in the shadow of the Arts and,Paragraph
"Crafts tradition, with Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Josef Hoffmann, and Michel de Klerk,",Paragraph
"among others. Architecture was as much in need of liberation as the plastic arts, but it",Paragraph
"was at the same time in need of a new authority to replace ancient authority, something",Paragraph
more compelling than the intuition of the artist. One answer was found in the authority of,Paragraph
"science. For architects, the innovative language of abstraction was not so much a gateway",Paragraph
to freer personal expression as an escape from the conventions of traditional construction.,Paragraph
It was no longer necessary to affix the Antique orders to facades or to follow academic,Paragraph
rules of ordonnance and symmetry in drawing plans. Abstract forms opposed no,Paragraph
difficulties of a formal kind to the idea of a plan freely following the program and so,Paragraph
"freed architecture to create its own myth, that of functionalism. To the subjective",Paragraph
"intuition of the artist, functionalism opposed a firm objective law similar to the laws of",Paragraph
nature.,Paragraph
"There was a short time, hardly more than a year, when architecture came close to",Paragraph
"sharing with art a complete autonomy of form. The year was 1923-24, when De Stijl",Paragraph
leader Theo van Doesburg collaborated with the architect Cornelius van Eesteren in,Paragraph
"designs for villas. In projects such as of 1923, his use of axomometric projection",Paragraph
obscures for a moment the difference between an art composition created on the flat,Paragraph
plane of the canvas for contemplation and the threedimensional equivalent constructed in,Paragraph
real life for use. When van Doesburg designed the interior for the dance hall L’ Aubette in,Caption
"Strasbourg, using dramatic rectangles set diagonally on the walls and ceiling, he could",Paragraph
"not compensate for the ordinariness of banal adjuncts, such as balcony rails and fixed",Paragraph
"seating, which seem to remove the viewer completely from the world of contemplation",Paragraph
"proper to fine art. An even more poignant case is that of the Schréder House in Utrecht,",Paragraph
"where Gerrit Rietveld’s exterior, like his famous chair, can certainly be contemplated as a",Paragraph
"kind of artwork, while the interior is mediated by the dynamic use of movable screens for",Paragraph
"privacy, reducing the object of contemplation to a practical convenience.",Paragraph
The paradox was fed by the polemical ideology of such protagonists of the Modern,Paragraph
"movement in architecture as J.J.P.Oud and Le Corbusier, who led the way in identifying",Paragraph
"architecture with engineering, thereby conceptualizing it as a subject that develops",Paragraph
"through research and discovery, in which the interest will always be in the novel and not",Paragraph
"in the already known. According to the credo of International Style, decisions in",Paragraph
"architectural design should result from rational analysis of the functions, replacing the",Paragraph
"traditional practice of starting from precedent, which was suffused by convention and",Paragraph
custom.,Paragraph
"For some, the architect could not claim to shape his building from his inner",Paragraph
perceptions; it had to be shaped from something more socially relevant. Functionality,Paragraph
"provided a rule apart from the purely subjective, and it was a rule that had little precedent",Paragraph
in the visual arts. The impact of abstraction within architecture was to create a new duty,Paragraph
toward the social function of the building and toward the physical material of,Paragraph
"construction. Empirical needs would guide form, and form would be free to follow",Paragraph
"function in the ecstatic exercise of liberation. Within architecture, then, abstraction and",Paragraph
functionalism appeared to share a common destiny.,Paragraph
"In fine art, Mondrian remained the most extreme purist, and there is no question that",Paragraph
he identified avoidance of figuration as an expression of spirituality. In the heroic 1920s,Paragraph
"and 1930s, artists such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse preferred to distort",Paragraph
"appearances rather than abandon them. In the case of Fernand Leger, his Communist",Paragraph
"sympathies kept him firmly focused on the essence of the worker, and between (1918)",Paragraph
"and (1919), there is only a difference of degree; the figure remains. This enables us to",Paragraph
"say something clear about abstraction, namely, that it is not exclusive. It is clearly",Paragraph
possible to employ abstraction in due measure without abandoning figuration.,Paragraph
The nascence of abstract art seemed to suggest a solution for architecture by,Paragraph
redefining nature itself as a kind of artist. This was the argument advanced in an,Paragraph
"influential book by D’Arcy Thompson, (1917). Thompson conceived of nature as the",Paragraph
"supreme designer, producing functional structures that were also intrinsically beautiful.",Paragraph
"Not only do the skeletons of dinosaurs follow engineering principles, but the patterns of",Paragraph
"growth in hard-shell mollusks observe strict mathematical rules, as the strictly",Paragraph

"approached nature in following natural law, it could appropriate nature’s beauty. In the",Paragraph
"book edited by Leslie Martin, Ben Nicholson, and Naum Gabo (1937), it is clear that",Paragraph
abstract form had taken on an aura of objectivity at odds with the reality of its subjective,Paragraph
origins.,Paragraph
It is not until De Stijl in the Netherlands and the Abstract Expressionists of the New,Paragraph
"York School in the 1950s that one finds another impulse to abandon figuration, above all",Paragraph
"with the mural-scale abstract canvases of Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, and Mark",Paragraph
"Rothko. In postwar painting the expressive gesture generated the source of meaning, and",Paragraph
"the authenticity of that gesture became the guarantee of artistic truth. However, this",Paragraph

"marked with renunciation, and renunciation is truly difficult to reconcile with",Paragraph
"functionalism. In art, all arguments are ad hominem, and what one person can do is",Paragraph
always exceptional. The idea that abstract art approached a deeper level of reality than,Paragraph
"figurative art proved difficult to sustain as a general principle, and to this extent it seemed",Paragraph
that the hopes of objective validity pinned on bringing abstraction into architecture have,Paragraph
proved illusory.,Paragraph
"During the crystallization of Modernism in the 1930s, it was simply not possible to",Paragraph
eliminate appearances; as long as buildings had to have openings such as doors and,Paragraph
"windows, as long as they could be entered and used, they clearly served as utilities. Use",Paragraph
"created meaning, at the most basic level, because doors not only permit entry but also",Paragraph
"denote entry. The struggle for purity turned into a struggle to eliminate ornament, and this",Paragraph
was accentuated by the belief that only through standardization could the building’s,Paragraph
"economy be fully realized. To match transparency in art, we have austerity in",Paragraph
"architecture, epitomized by the German architect Mies van der Rohe. Standardization was",Paragraph
considered the key to realizing the full benefits of mass production. With standardization,Paragraph
"went repetition, and the monotony of the curtain wall in identical glass panels reduced the",Paragraph
"possibility of expressive form. It was enough that buildings were massive and impressive,",Paragraph
"tailored to the demands of modern business, and expression was demonstrated in seeing",Paragraph
which city had the tallest building.,Paragraph
"From the pluralism of Postmodernism, it became evident that standardization was not",Paragraph
as effective in economic terms as marketing. The appearance of a steel-frame building,Paragraph
could be changed at will in order to present a spectacular image; the facade became a,Paragraph
"surface of signification, and irony, humor, and eclectic style were manipulated in such a",Paragraph
transformation. Strict economy of construction held less expressive importance. With the,Paragraph
"end of the 20th century, it became possible to see that the authenticity attributed to",Paragraph
abstract forms was balanced by the freedom they conferred upon expression. This was,Paragraph
"manifest in the 1960s and 1970s within fine art but not within architecture. Today, in the",Paragraph
"work of Frank Gehry, Peter Eisenman, Daniel Libeskind, and Zaha Hadid, there is no",Paragraph
longer any concealment of the expressive gesture.,Paragraph
"Except in extreme cases, such as aircraft design, forms are primarily derived not from",Paragraph
a scientific analysis of the functional requirements but from the creative feelings of the,Paragraph
"designer. The architect can have feelings about the function as well as everything else,",Paragraph
but he or she is now permitted to sublimate these into a more general concept of the,Paragraph

and relieve ethnic tensions among the 250 cultural groups that constitute the Nigerian,Paragraph
"nation. Abuja and its architecture, it was believed, would also remove the colonial",Paragraph
identity that the erstwhile capital city of Lagos was thought to bestow on the Nigerian,Paragraph
people.,Paragraph
"As a result, the role of Lagos as the federal capital of Nigeria has been in question",Paragraph
"from 1960, when Nigeria became independent, to 9 August 1975, when General Murutala",Paragraph
Mohammed set up an eight-member Committee on the Location of the Federal Capital of,Paragraph
Nigeria. The task of the committee was to review the multiple roles of Lagos as the,Paragraph

The committee concluded that a new federal capital would improve Nigeria’s national,Paragraph
"security, enhance Nigerian interior development, encourage the decentralization of",Paragraph
"economic infrastructures from Lagos, and enhance the development of an indigenous",Paragraph
"Nigerian building culture and industry. Finally, the new capital would emphasize",Paragraph
"Nigeria’s emergence from the civil war of 1967-70 as a more united, stable, and",Paragraph
confident country. Nigerian lawmakers who shared the opinions of the committee,Paragraph
justified the idea of developing a new federal capital by suggesting that there existed a,Paragraph
fundamental need for a place where all Nigerians could come together on an equal basis,Paragraph
"to help foster national unity. Moreover, advocates of a new federal capital city raised the",Paragraph
problems of overcrowding and lack of land for future expansion at Lagos as well as the,Paragraph
"existence of severe social inequality in the colonial cities of Nigeria. As a result, Abuja",Paragraph
"was conceived as a place that symbolized Nigeria’s autonomy from British colonization,",Paragraph
"urban segregation, and a federal character that all Nigerians could share in regardless of",Paragraph

Military dictators interpreted Abuja’s master plan as a document that required the,Paragraph

ACOUSTICS,Title
"As Charles Garnier prepared the design for the Paris Opera House in 1861, the lack of",Paragraph
acoustical design information and the contradictory nature of the information that he,Paragraph
found forced him to leave the acoustic quality to chance and hope for the best. With few,Paragraph
"exceptions, this was the condition of architectural acoustics at the beginning of the 20th",Paragraph
"century. In 1900, with the pioneering work of Wallace Clement Sabine, the dark",Paragraph
mysteries of “good acoustics” began to be illuminated. In his efforts to remedy the poor,Paragraph
"acoustics in the Fogg Art Museum Lecture Hall (1895-1973) at Harvard University,",Caption
Sabine began experiments that revealed the relationship among the architectural materials,Paragraph
"of a space, the physical volume of the space, and the time that sound would persist in the",Paragraph
space after a source was stopped (the reverberation time). Predicting the reverberation,Paragraph
time of a room provided the first scientific foundation for reliable acoustic design in,Paragraph
architecture. This method is still regularly used as a benchmark to design a range of,Paragraph
"listening environments, from concert halls to school classrooms.",Paragraph
The first application of this new acoustical knowledge occurred during the design of,Paragraph
"the Boston Symphony Hall (1906) by McKim, Mead and White. Original plans for the",Caption
"hall called for an enlarged version of the Leipzig Neues Gewandhaus (1884), a classical",Paragraph
"Greek Revival theater. The increased size would have been acoustically inappropriate, as",Paragraph
"it doubled the room volume, leading to excessive reverberation. Sabine worked with the",Paragraph
architects to develop a scheme with a smaller room volume in the traditional “shoe box”,Paragraph
concert hall shape. The Boston Symphony Hall remains one of the best in the world.,Paragraph
Adler and Sullivan’s Auditorium Building (1889) in Chicago was praised for its,Paragraph
architectural and engineering achievements as well as for the theater’s superb acoustics.,Paragraph
"As the profession of acoustical consulting emerged in the design of listening spaces, the",Paragraph
"firm of Bolt, Beranek and Newman made a significant impact on the development of",Paragraph
architectural acoustics in the 20th century. Their work with architects Harrison and,Paragraph
Abramovitz on Avery Fisher Hall (1962) in New York City represented a legitimate,Paragraph
attempt to incorporate new scientific principles of acoustical design rather than merely,Paragraph
copying previous halls that were known to be good. Although it presented several,Paragraph
"failures, one key acoustic point gleaned from a study of European halls for Avery Fisher",Paragraph
"Hall was that the room should hold 1,400 to 1,800 seats. Yielding to economic pressures,",Paragraph
"the architect increased seating to almost 3,000.",Paragraph
A more successful implementation of modern acoustical theories is the Berlin,Paragraph
Philharmonic (1963). Architect Hans Scharoun’s vision of a hall in the round blurs the,Paragraph
traditional distinction between performer and audience. The approach posed quite an,Paragraph
"acoustical challenge, given the directionality of many orchestral instruments; it required",Paragraph
an extremely unconventional acoustical design. The resulting “vineyard terrace” seating,Paragraph
arrangement resolved many potential acoustical difficulties while creating a spatial,Paragraph
vitality that resonates outward to form the profile of the building. This collaboration,Paragraph
between Scharoun and the acoustic consultant Lothar Cremer engendered a truly inspired,Paragraph
architectural design.,Paragraph
Possibly inspired by the failure of Avery Fisher Hall and the desire to understand what,Paragraph
"went wrong, concert halls, as the crucible for applying sonic theories, gave rise to an",Paragraph
acoustical renaissance in the latter part of the 20th century. Acoustically designed spaces,Paragraph
"need high-quality direct sound, strong sound reflections from the ceiling and side wal",Paragraph
"surfaces soon after the direct sound, a highly diffuse and controlled reverberance, and",Paragraph
"heavy solid sound reflecting materials. Formerly thought to be mutually exclusive, these",Paragraph
sonic properties exist together in the latest halls of the 20th century through an integration,Paragraph
of both historic precedent and new understandings of room acoustics and listening. An,Paragraph
"extraordinary example of this union is the 1,840-seat Concert Hall in the Cultura.",Paragraph
"Congress Center (1999) in Lucerne, Switzerland, by architect Jean Nouvel and acoustic",Caption
consultant Russell Johnson.,Paragraph
New techniques for improved acoustic environments are applied in many building,Paragraph
"types, including school classrooms, music practice rooms, church sanctuaries, movie",Paragraph
"theaters, transportation hubs, and industrial facilities. Simultaneously, with more and",Paragraph
"more exposure to digital-quality sound, clients have become keenly aware of their sonic",Paragraph
environment and expect high levels of performance. Speech intelligibility in classrooms,Paragraph
"has been related to learning, with efforts to reduce excessive background noise from",Paragraph
mechanical equipment. The issue has become the focus of a U.S. federal government,Paragraph
"assessment and proposal for a nationwide acoustical standard for schools. Additionally,",Paragraph
"careful selection of materials, their quantities, and their locations in classrooms are",Paragraph
important to enhance speech intelligibility. Music practice spaces require adequate room,Paragraph
volume with both soundabsorbent and sound-diffusing materials to control loudness and,Paragraph
reduce the risk of noise-induced hearing loss to musicians and teachers. Religious liturgy,Paragraph
"relies more heavily on intimate spoken sermons, cathedral-like choir singing, and high-",Paragraph
"powered amplified music in many denominations. These trends, coupled with a",Paragraph
"prevailing increase in sanctuary size and the desire for more congregational interaction,",Paragraph
have demanded sophisticated sound reinforcement systems and carefully configured,Paragraph
room acoustic design strategies to strike a balance among divergent sonic criteria. Digital,Paragraph
"surround sound, the new standard in movie theater entertainment, incorporates the",Paragraph
"environmental acoustic character as part of the movie sound track, which should not be",Paragraph
"colored by the theater space. This requires very low reverberance, low background noise",Paragraph
"levels from mechanical equipment, and exceptional sound isolation from adjacent",Paragraph
"theaters. Unintelligible announcements, the bane of transportation hubs, have been the",Paragraph
"focus of many recent acoustical studies, affirming the need to consider room geometry,",Paragraph
"size, and material selection as they play as great a role as the actual announcement system",Paragraph
itself in the success of these spaces.,Paragraph
Many meaningful advances in acoustic knowledge were made in the 20th century. The,Paragraph
application and integration of this information within architectural design leaves much,Paragraph
room for advancement. Alvar Aalto’s famous acoustical ray tracing diagrams for the,Paragraph
"lecture room of the Viipuri Public Library (1933-35) in Viipuri, Finland, represent",Caption
acoustical thinking in the earliest phases of design. Developing sophisticated methods to,Paragraph
assimilate newer acoustical knowledge as part of the architectural design process is the,Paragraph
work at hand in the 21st century.,Paragraph

ADAPTIVE RE-USE,Title
"Buildings often outlive their function; however, their inherent durability often gives the",Paragraph
building another life. There is a long tradition of buildings being adapted to suit new,Paragraph
functions. Roman basilicas were converted to serve as worship spaces for the nascent,Paragraph
"Christian church. In medieval times, Roman fortifications were resurrected to form part",Paragraph
of the fabric of the mercantile cities. It was not until the advent of ready demolition and,Paragraph
the mechanization of the building process during the Industrial Revolution that the,Paragraph
practice of adapting old buildings to new uses became less the norm.,Paragraph
"Following World War IL the pace of change in urban form, precipitated by",Paragraph
"technological advances and social upheavals, quickened. As buildings became obsolete",Paragraph
"and shifting land values directed economic development away from central cities,",Paragraph
"particularly in North America, large-scale demolition became commonplace. In some",Paragraph
"cases, well-built warehouses and industrial structures stood on land that had become",Paragraph
"more valuable for other commercial and office uses, further accelerating demolition.",Paragraph
Housing that stood in the pathway of proposed highways was also torn down. Urban,Paragraph
"renewal stopped short of its promise, and vacant buildings quickly became vacant land.",Paragraph
"To combat these failures, preservation strategies were developed that employed the",Paragraph
existing built environment to suit new uses.,Paragraph
There are four distinct building types in which adaptive re-use of older structures can,Paragraph
"be seen. Public buildings, which includes large transportation facilities like train stations",Paragraph
and civic buildings built in the 19th and 20th centuries being converted to new public and,Paragraph
"private uses. Industrial buildings, with their large clear structural spans and, typically,",Paragraph
"large expanses of windows or skylight, lend themselves particularly well to housing an",Paragraph
"enormous variety of new use groups. Private buildings, like large houses, can serve",Paragraph
"multiple functions because of the inherent flexibility of the prototype. Finally,",Paragraph
"commercial buildings, the structures that are so emblematic of the advances in",Paragraph
"architectural technology in the 20th century, are being recycled with different uses,",Paragraph
"presenting unique preservation problems, as architects must address issues related to",Paragraph
preserving buildings that employed contemporary technology.,Paragraph
The U.S. government owns many magnificent historic structures and has taken the,Paragraph
"lead in finding new uses for its stock of buildings, serving as an example for private",Paragraph
"sector development. In Washington, D.C., the Pension Building, an imposing brick",Caption
"edifice, was constructed shortly after the Civil War to provide office space for agencies",Paragraph
distributing pensions to war veterans and their families. Its primary distinctive feature is a,Paragraph
"large, central skylit atrium space that allows the ring of offices access to natural light.",Paragraph
The building stood dormant for many years until a major restoration project started in,Paragraph
"1984 enabled the National Building Museum to occupy the lower floors of the building,",Paragraph
with the bulk of the building retained for government offices. The soaring splendor of the,Paragraph
building’s interior serves as an excellent advertisement of its function as a museum for,Paragraph
the built environment.,Paragraph
"Also in Washington, D.C., is the Old Post Office Building, another atrium building.",Paragraph
"Completed in 1899, the neoRomanesque building was almost demolished in the early",Paragraph
"1970s. Fortunately, as a result of the dedicated efforts of local preservationists and the",Paragraph
"daunting cost of demolishing such a huge structure, the building was renovated in 1978.",Paragraph
"The three lower levels of the building, including the atrium, were converted to restaurants",Paragraph
"and retail, with the perimeter of the building on the upper level retained as office space.",Paragraph
One of the most well-known re-uses of a dormant train station is Gae Aulenti’s,Paragraph
remaking of the in Paris as the national museum of art and civilization. Originally,Paragraph
"opened for train traffic in 1900, both the building’s short platform lengths and changes in",Paragraph
travel patterns lead to the abandonment of the station shortly after World War II.,Paragraph
"Reopened as a museum in 1986, the renovation makes use of the original attached hotel",Paragraph
within the head house as exhibition space. Built within the volume of the train shed are,Paragraph
smaller structures that house more intimate display space for sculpture. Despite the,Paragraph
"somewhat awkward intrusion of these galleries within the shed, the sense of the original",Paragraph
great volume of the space is still preserved.,Paragraph
"In the United States, the nation’s private railroad system developed a legacy of",Paragraph
magnificent structures throughout the country. When train traffic declined following,Paragraph
"World War II, these buildings, centrally located in the downtowns of virtually every",Paragraph

lobby and entrance to a multiuse complex that includes a parking garage and a restaurant,Paragraph
"and retail center within the former train shed. The shed, the largest of its type ever built,",Paragraph
is organized into “neighborhoods” to make the integration of the building’s multiple,Paragraph
"functions more coherent. When Union Station was renovated, the ornate and eclectic",Paragraph
spaces within the head house were restored and glass was inserted into the vaulted train,Caption
"shed, flooding the interior with natural light.",Paragraph
"In Philadelphia, a large commuter train station built for the Reading Railroad in 1893",Paragraph
"became redundant in 1984 when a subterranean tunnel was constructed below it, linking",Paragraph
the area’s railways to a regional network. The beautiful steel and glassvaulted shed and,Paragraph
Renaissance revival terra-cotta facade were empty for several years as several different,Paragraph
alternatives were studied for a possible re-use. Critical to the success of the project was,Paragraph
the maintenance of the historic food market below the train shed. The Pennsylvania,Caption
"Convention Center, built in 1992 (Thompson, Ventulett, Stainback and Association),",Paragraph
"incorporates the Reading Terminal into the new construction, maintaining both this vital",Paragraph
piece of urban architecture and the market’s social importance in the city fabric. The head,Paragraph
house serves as the ceremonial entrance for the convention center as well as a hotel. The,Paragraph
train shed links the entrance from the principal street to the new large convention center,Paragraph
that spans over two adjacent blocks.,Paragraph
"The first International Style skyscraper, the PSFS Building (George Howe and",Paragraph
"William Lescaze), also in Philadelphia, was constructed in 1932 and served for many",Paragraph
years as the headquarters for a local bank and office building. The building had retail on,Paragraph
the ground floor with a cool modern banking hall on the second floor. After the bank,Caption
"went out of business in the early 1990s, the building stayed dormant for many years.",Paragraph
"Despite the high esteem held for the building locally, its relatively small floor plate did",Paragraph
not attract the interest of businesses seeking space where the need for a large floor,Paragraph
"negated the desire to have ready access for natural light. Fortunately for the building,",Paragraph
developers converted it to a hotel that uses the original banking hall as a multipurpose,Paragraph
room. The former retail space now serves as a ground floor lobby and restaurant. The,Paragraph
"renovation is truly successful and the building retains its landmark neon sign, first lit to",Paragraph
advertise the bank during the depths of the Depression.,Paragraph
Private buildings that have been adaptively re-used range in size and character from,Paragraph
urban townhouses to urban palaces and castles set alone in the countryside. Museums are,Paragraph
"the most common new use for these buildings, often commemorating the house and",Paragraph
"holdings of the original occupant, as in the Hearst Castle in San Simeon, California, and",Paragraph
"the Biltmore House in Asheville, North Carolina. Alternatively, the urban mansions are",Paragraph
"often converted to art museums, making use of the variety of spaces, both small and",Paragraph
grand. Institutions like the CooperHewitt Museum in the former Carnegie mansion and,Paragraph
"the Frick Museum, both in New York City, serve as excellent display space for sculpture",Paragraph
"and paintings of all manners of style and size. In European countries like France, Spain,",Paragraph
"and Portugal, chateaus and castles have been converted into hotels. The Spanish",Paragraph
"government, in particular, has made the conversions of these castles into for the latter",Paragraph
half of the 20th century a matter of restoration policy.,Paragraph
Industrial buildings offer the most flexible typology for conversion. Mills and old,Paragraph
factory structures are typically solidly built and often offer large expanses of natural light.,Paragraph
"Industrial buildings are generally anonymous buildings that, in the early part of the 20th",Paragraph
"century, were executed, if not by architects, then by highly competent vernacular",Paragraph
"builders. The prototype was a relatively recent phenomenon, and the pace of construction",Paragraph
of these buildings accelerated during the time of great urban industrialization that,Paragraph
"coincided with a particularly eclectic period in architecture. Consequently, these",Paragraph
buildings hold important social and physical significance in the urban context. The solid,Paragraph
structures of these buildings may have contributed to their longterm survival; in some,Paragraph
"cases, the cost of demolition made their destruction not as viable an option, allowing time",Paragraph
for alternative uses to be found.,Paragraph
"Housing has been a popular choice to occupy these spaces. In the United States, the",Paragraph
vanguard of the movement to convert former industrial properties to housing was the,Paragraph
SoHo neighborhood in New York City. What started as flexible and inexpensive space,Paragraph
serving as artist studios became coveted by those looking for expansive living quarters in,Paragraph
"neighborhoods that the artists had helped to become fashionable. Outside of New York,",Paragraph
one of the better-known early preservation and conversion projects is Lowell Mills in,Paragraph
"Lowell, Massachusetts, a mixed-use complex that helped to revitalize a portion of that",Paragraph
moribund town.,Paragraph
These mill buildings are now also adapted to house the industries of the information,Paragraph
"age, the economic successor to the industrial revolution. Offices for computer technology",Caption
"firms, professional offices, and material and product showrooms in early 20th-century",Paragraph
industrial loft buildings are such a commonplace sight in urban centers that it is often,Paragraph
forgotten that those buildings were not originally constructed to house those functions.,Paragraph
"One particularly striking conversion is the Templeton Factory in Glasgow, Scotland, a",Paragraph
former carpet mill built in a colorful and stylized Venetian Gothic style in 1898. The,Paragraph
building complex was considered for demolition following its abandonment in 1978 as,Paragraph
the result of changes in manufacturing technology. Preservation as a museum was,Paragraph
"rejected. In the early 1980s, a scheme was devised to convert the building into a hybrid",Paragraph
research and business incubator center run by a local government development agency.,Paragraph
Winston Churchill’s aphorism—‘We shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us”—,Paragraph
rings true. Preservationists seeking to link the past with the future take exception to this,Paragraph
"rule as we continue to shape our buildings, adapting them to new functions. Adaptive re-",Paragraph
"use as a tool used by architects, like the larger preservation movement, is a 20th-century",Paragraph
phenomenon. The preservation of older buildings by giving them new uses also serves as,Paragraph
"part of an overall strategy for urban designers, city planners, and the consortium of public",Paragraph
and private forces that view this approach as a tool of economic development. The supply,Paragraph
of older and significant buildings is a source of sound urban ecological regeneration. As,Paragraph
"preservation practice evolves, the emphasis is shifting away from strict restoration to an",Paragraph
attitude that frees the building from its former use.,Paragraph

Henry Dangler’s death in 1917 left both a personal and a professional void in Adler’s,Paragraph
"life, for he had lost not only his partner but also his best friend. Adler was not certified to",Paragraph

Largely misunderstood by the historians of the Modern movement who celebrated it as,Paragraph
the first major work of frank industrial architecture endowed with exceptional “functional,Paragraph
"directness,” the AEG Turbine Factory—designed by Peter Behrens and Karl Bernhard",Paragraph
and completed 1910—remains the most admired and most influential of Behrens’s works.,Paragraph
Designed between 1908 and 1909 for the Allgemeine Elektricitats Gesesells (AEG)—,Paragraph
a German electrical concern founded by Emil Rathenau in 1883—the factory was placed,Paragraph
strategically at the southern edge of the factory complex along Huttenstrasse and,Paragraph
"Berlichingenstrasse, facing Berlin and the world as a show front of the prosperous",Paragraph
industrial magnate. Complying with such expectations and following his own ideological,Paragraph
"stance, Behrens built a magnificent iron and glass hybrid of two eminently classical",Paragraph
temple traditions—the Greek and the Egyptian—meant to glorify industrial might.,Paragraph
"In accepting the challenge of designing his first industrial building, Behrens’s concern",Paragraph
"was not to recast all of architecture in terms of industry and the machine, as was most",Paragraph
"often the case with the next generation of modern architects. Rather, “his concern",Paragraph
was...levating so dominant a societal force as the factory to the level of established,Paragraph
"cultural standard” (see Anderson, 1977).",Paragraph
"As an adept of the Austrian art historian and critic Alois Riegel’s theory of (literally,",Paragraph
“artistic will” or the evolutionary force of style) and of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s,Paragraph
"aesthetic historicism, exemplified in the concept of the Zeitgeist, Behrens applied in the",Paragraph
design of the Turbine Factory the principles that he had evolved as the leader of the,Paragraph
Darmstadt artists’ colony after 1901. In direct opposition to Gottfried Semper’s,Paragraph
"“materialism,” central to Behrens’s approach was belief in the force of the artist, and art,",Paragraph
to transform brute everyday life into a dignified existence. Akin to the carbon,Paragraph
"transformed under extreme conditions into a praised diamond, everyday life—and in this",Paragraph
"case raw industry, the factory, and the machine—could be transformed under the artist’s",Paragraph
"into an entity of high culture. Such an ideological position, applied to industry, spread",Paragraph
into a number of aesthetic and symbolic themes clearly reflected in the Turbine Factory.,Paragraph
"Far from depending on primary concerns for material, technical, and functional purposes,",Paragraph
"the factory was, in Behrens’s mind, the result of a specific concretization of selected",Paragraph
"industrial features, filtered through the artist’s transcendental will to form. The result was",Paragraph
a vast crystal symbolizing the victory of art over the banality of life in an emerging,Paragraph
"machine society. If the industrial fact at hand could not be ignored, it was not the role of",Paragraph
"the artist to succumb to it helplessly, either. It is largely because of this position that",Paragraph
Behrens’s first industrial building was unprecedented in industrial architecture and,Paragraph
design.,Paragraph
"In aesthetic terms, the central conflict that Behrens faced in the design of the Turbine",Paragraph
"Factory was the tectonic character of the ferro-vitreous wide span offered by his engineer,",Paragraph
"Karl Bernhard, as the necessary solution for mastering the vastness of the structure and",Paragraph
Behrens’s adherence to the concept of since his 1905 pavilions at the Oldenburg,Paragraph
"Northwest German Art Exhibition. The challenge was, therefore, to find a solution that",Paragraph
would be flexible enough to accommodate the dictates of a particular technology—,Paragraph
including the use of given industrial materials—while preserving architecture as the,Paragraph
eminent symbol of established cultural values of a modern capitalist state. The,Paragraph
culmination of this synthetic process was expressed in the factory’s triumphal templelike,Paragraph
facade with its crystalline central window of staggering dimensions that only advanced,Paragraph
technology could have brought about.,Paragraph
"With his limited knowledge of any kind of building technology, Behrens had to rely",Paragraph
on the support of an engineer for such a vast and technically complex building. The,Paragraph
shifting priorities between ideology and technology in the conception of the building,Paragraph
necessarily resulted in a series of ambiguities and concealments that Behrens provoked,Paragraph
rather than avoided in a strained collaboration with Bernhard.,Paragraph
The structural makeup of the factory consists of an asymmetrical three-hinged arch,Paragraph
reinforced by a transversal tie-rod. The longer half of the arch springs vertically up to the,Paragraph
second hinge and then breaks in three facets before reaching the third hinge at the apex of,Paragraph
"the arch. In properly structural terms, there was no reason for breaking the second arm",Paragraph
into segments. The decision was a willful intervention in the engineer’s work by Behrens,Paragraph
"the artist. Historically, a variety of reasons have been advanced as an explanation for such",Paragraph
"a move. Whereas Kenneth Frampton, for example, refers to a rather improbable desire to",Paragraph
"create the shape of a farmer’s barn with its typical polygonal gable, Reyner Banham",Paragraph
offers a technological explanation: the need for clearance for the huge internal traveling,Paragraph
crane—even though the section shows that the tying rods forced the crane to run much,Paragraph
lower.,Paragraph
"The chiseled gable was, in fact, the result of two specific exigencies of Behrens’s the",Paragraph
"urge for enforced and the evocation of (sign), the crystalline symbol of life as art.",Paragraph
"Indeed, the comparison between Behrens’s earlier representation of the priestess of",Paragraph
"Darmstadt carrying the redemptive crystal high above her head, as well as the majestic",Paragraph
"front of the temple-factory, remforces the idea of a crystalshaped gable springing high",Paragraph
above the ground in delicate balance over the equally crystalline abstracted robe of a,Paragraph
priestess.,Paragraph
"Furthermore, using the given technology for more ambitious aims, Behrens concealed",Paragraph
the fact that the actual structural system of the factory was made up of a series of hinged,Paragraph
arches by capping the building with a voluminous cornice cutting the arch at the top of its,Paragraph
"vertical member. In so doing, Behrens created the visual impression of a trabeated system",Paragraph
in which the vertical members of the arches represented so many columns of a classical,Paragraph
"temple. By the same token, the somewhat inwardly inclined glazed surfaces between the",Paragraph
"structural members of the side elevation, along with the blown-up roofline and the",Paragraph
massive concrete nonbearing “corner stones” wrapping around a streamlined trapezoida,Caption
"silhouette, created a convincing case of a perfectly “stereotomic” volume inflated with",Paragraph
"space. Thus undermining the iron framing, Behrens prevented the construction from",Paragraph
dematerializing into a dispersed tectonic grid—as would have been the case with the,Paragraph
Dutert-Contamin Gallerie des Machines—and clearly subverted any engineering,Paragraph
"directness. The formulation of a symbolic structure, however, did not preclude Behrens",Paragraph
from addressing forcefully the nature and purpose of the building.,Paragraph

"Still remaining in the realm of powerful symbolism, Behrens allowed the function of the",Paragraph

"conservation, and environmentalism. One of the principles of the Aga Khan Foundation",Paragraph
has been to encourage sustainability whereby recipients of the Aga Khan’s largesse,Paragraph

Khan’s influence is widespread and includes the establishment in the United States of the,Paragraph
"Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture (1979), jointly run by the Massachusetts",Paragraph
"Institute for Technology and Harvard University, and the creation of the Aga Khan",Paragraph
Award for Architecture.,Paragraph
In 1976 the Aga Khan announced that he would establish an architectural award as a,Paragraph
means of fostering the growth of a modern and vibrant Islamic architecture within the,Paragraph
"context of rich and valuable traditions. In spanning political and geographical boundaries,",Paragraph
a major objective of the award was to create an overarching sense of unity for the Muslim,Paragraph
"world, in spite of distinctive and sometimes disparate cultures. “Excellence in",Paragraph
"architecture” was attributed not only to examples of finely designed architecture, but also",Paragraph
"to community projects, such as housing for the poor and civil engineering works, clearly",Paragraph
demonstrating the future direction of the Aga Khan Award for Architecture.,Paragraph
"In 1988, the Aga Khan reorganized his network of philanthropic institutions. The Aga",Paragraph
Khan Award for Architecture was transferred from the Aga Khan Foundation to the,Paragraph
"newly established Aga Khan Trust for Culture, also responsible for the Historic Cities",Paragraph
Support Programme and the Education and Culture Programme. The goals of these,Paragraph
cultural agencies were aligned with the Aga Khan’s original list of challenges for the,Paragraph
"Islamic world—pursuit of excellence in architecture and related disci-plines, conservation",Paragraph
"and re-use of historic buildings and spaces, and education for architects and urban",Paragraph
planners. A fourth objective of the Trust for Culture was to encourage the interchange of,Paragraph
ideas to enhance awareness of the relationship between historic and contemporary,Paragraph
Muslim cultures and their built environments.,Paragraph
"On occasion, the Aga Khan has bestowed a special Chairman’s Award to recognize",Paragraph
outstanding achievement in Muslim architecture. In 1980 the first was presented to,Paragraph
"Egypt’s Hassan Fathy, architect, artist, and poet, particularly acknowledging his",Paragraph
encouragement of vernacular building systems and his work improving the built,Paragraph
environment of impoverished peoples. Others have followed and include Rifat Chadirji of,Paragraph
Iraq and Geoffrey Bawa of Sri Lanka.,Paragraph
"Recipients of the Aga Khan Award for Architecture have now totalled 80, and they",Paragraph
have been as diverse as the cultures they represent. One of the most prevalent themes,Paragraph
throughout the history of the award has been the social responsibility of architecture. This,Paragraph
"was reflected in the 1980 award to the Kampung Improvement Programme in Jakarta, the",Paragraph
"Grameen Bank Housing Programme in Bangladesh (1989 award), and the multiphased",Paragraph
Hafsia Quarter project in Tunis (1983 and 1995 awards). Such humanitarian,Paragraph
"considerations were also evident in awards given for educational and medical facilities,",Paragraph
"such as the Medical Centre in Mopti, Mali (1980 award) and the Lepers Hospital,",Paragraph
"Maharashtra Province, India (1998 award). Another major award theme was heritage",Paragraph
"preservation, as evidenced by the awards for restoration of Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque",Paragraph
"(1986 award), conservation of Old Sana’a in Yemen (1995 award), and restoration of",Paragraph
"Bukhara Old City, Uzbekistan (1995 award). Juries concerned with self-sustainability",Caption
often appreciated projects demonstrating the viability of vernacular construction,Paragraph
techniques and traditional building forms or the use of locally available materials. This,Paragraph
"priority is evident in the Yaama Mosque in Tahoua, Niger (1986 award) and the Stone",Paragraph
"Building System employed in Dar’a Province, Syria (1992 award).",Paragraph
Despite the fact that the Aga Khan Awards for Architecture have so far been,Paragraph
"principally bestowed on projects in North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia (the only",Paragraph
"central European recipient was the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris), the international",Paragraph
architectural community has steadily developed an interest in the awards. Because,Paragraph
"cultural, religious, and economic conditions in most Muslim countries differ so much",Paragraph
"from Western societies, a lack of sympathy for the priorities of the award program",Paragraph
"persists, although the expanding cadre of skilled Islamic architects and planners is",Paragraph
helping to alleviate this.,Paragraph
This awards program has significantly inspired the architectural representation of,Paragraph
Islamic culture during the past 25 years. At a time when many of these cultures were,Paragraph
"threatened by Western influence, by economic failure, and by political violence, the Aga",Paragraph
Khan’s initiative reminded everyone of the quality of this cultural heritage. At the same,Paragraph
"time, the award’s broad scope, with its emphasis on alleviating living conditions of the",Paragraph
"poor, on sustainability, and on the environment, has encouraged innovative solutions to",Paragraph
rapidly worsening societal problems. Although this award does not fit the mold of,Paragraph
"Western architectural perceptions, its initial priorities were clearly established and are",Paragraph
constantly evolving to meet the needs of many cultural communities. Emphasizing not,Paragraph
"only contemporary architecture, but also historic architectural traditions threatened by",Paragraph
"reconstruction and development, the Aga Khan Award for Architecture has helped to",Paragraph
create a means of expressing Islamic ideals in a modern context. The award promotes a,Paragraph

AGRICULTURAL BUILDINGS,Title
The critic Robert Venturi has referred to gas stations and other vernacular structures,Paragraph
"located along commercial strips as “decorated sheds.” His use of the name of a utilitarian,",Paragraph
"work-oriented structure suggests that sheds, barns, and other such structures are most",Paragraph
"importantly utilitarian; nevertheless, they also possess meaning that is based on a",Paragraph
definable structural program. Buildings used in American agriculture possess clear,Paragraph
"structural forms, but their emphasis as work buildings also allows them to function as a",Paragraph
material artifact of changes in the social and economic context of labor on the American,Paragraph
farm.,Paragraph
The agricultural landscape is a composite of many structures designed around the,Paragraph
"natural cycles of planting, harvest, and maintenance that define farm labor. Such",Paragraph
component structures might include those designed for a specific animal (such as chicken,Paragraph
"houses), specific storage (milk houses or springhouses), limited processes (smokehouses,",Paragraph
"summer kitchens, sugarhouses, evaporators), grain and fodder storage (granaries,",Paragraph
"corncribs, silos), and even fencing. Most important, however, such structures are",Paragraph
sublimated in the overall layout to the central barn. The American plantation serves as an,Paragraph
example that did not use the central barn and instead relied on sprawling compounds of,Paragraph
"smaller buildings around one central home (the big house); most American agriculture,",Paragraph
"however, operates on a central plan defined by the barn.",Paragraph
The American barn is one of the nation’s most ubiquitous architectural signifiers. In,Paragraph
"addition to its obvious utilitarian function, to many observers the barn is a symbol of the",Paragraph
rugged individualism that Thomas Jefferson and others connected to the American,Paragraph
yeoman farmer. The barn and the farm that it supports became one of the most flexible,Paragraph
mechanisms for American expansion. A closer analysis of specific barn styles and types,Paragraph
"reveals overall diversity while suggesting continuity between region, ethnic groups, and",Paragraph
general agricultural function.,Paragraph
"Prior to 1900, barns were primarily wood, although sometimes constructed from brick",Paragraph
"or stone. Most barns function as a mixed-use facility, prioritizing storage, shelter, and",Paragraph
"ventilation. Many barn styles integrated stables and other areas to shelter animals. Often,",Paragraph
"silos or areas in which to store feed were then also integrated into the site. Crib barns, for",Paragraph
"instance, contained storage facilities within the structure; more often, tall, cylindrical",Paragraph
silos would be incorporated into the overall plan in order to free up the interior space for,Paragraph
storing machinery. Thus the program of the American barn prioritizes functionality.,Paragraph
"Barns, like many of the site’s supporting structures, followed the most general design",Paragraph
"patterns. Plank framing supported expansive walls, which were then normally covered in",Paragraph
planking. Traditional Anglo-American joining (based on carving joints to make them,Paragraph
"interlock), of course, served as the ancestor of the better-known balloon frame, which",Paragraph
"replaced such joints with nails. Standardized parts, simplified joints, and two-story studs",Paragraph
"and bearers link the balloon-frame form to traditional carpentry. In such a design,",Paragraph
"studding was placed at a minimum. As tools and mechanization changed by 1900,",Paragraph
"balloon framing became a standard form, and even as materials changed in the 20th",Paragraph
"century, the balloon frame remained the norm. Although many farmers or agricultural",Paragraph
corporations have opted for manufactured buildings sided in fiberglass or aluminum,Paragraph
"panels, the structural support remains extremely similar to the original balloon frame.",Paragraph
"Flooring, however, has added structural support by incorporating a solid cement founding",Paragraph
where formerly dirt or planks served the facility.,Paragraph
"Prefabrication, as an architectural pattern, grew out of increased technology. By the",Paragraph
"turn of the century, the timber-rich Pacific Northwest, upper Midwest, and Southeast",Paragraph
"were the headquarters of corporations that sold prefabricated, mail-order farm buildings",Paragraph
"and commercial structures. During World War IL the Seabees, a portion of the U.S.",Paragraph
"Navy, created prefabricated, all-purpose buildings that could be manufactured in the",Paragraph
United States and shipped anywhere. The Quonset hut was made from preformed wooden,Paragraph
ribs sheathed with corrugated sheet steel and fitted with pressed-wood interior linings.,Paragraph
"After use in the war, more than 170,000 of these structures would return to the United",Paragraph
States for use in agriculture and industry. Prefabrication had even more application in the,Paragraph
"utilitarian world of agricultural structures than in the suburban countryside, where it",Paragraph
would be applied by William Levitt (1947) and others.,Paragraph
"As agriculture expanded westward, infrastructural links became major components in",Paragraph
connecting the agricultural hinterland to railroad corridors. Following the completion of,Paragraph
"the transcontinental railroad in 1869, the entire American West would be linked by",Paragraph
technology as “hinterland” to Chicago and other developing shipping centers. The,Paragraph
"program of the rural, agrarian landscape remains dominated by this economic",Paragraph
"relationship. Most prolific, grain elevators serve as tremendous storage facilities at",Paragraph
railroad termini. Industrial architecture of the early 1900s was widely influenced by,Paragraph
"European modernism and particularly Walter Gropius, including these massive",Paragraph
compounds for grain storage and transshipment of steel or concrete tubes (from one to,Paragraph
"hundreds). Located in towns and shipping ports, these facilities became fully automated",Paragraph
with electricity in the 20th century.,Paragraph
Technology has allowed the contemporary agricultural landscape to sprawl over land,Paragraph
"often hostile to farming. Hydraulic management allows vast tracts of the American West,",Paragraph
"particularly the Great Plains and California’s Central Valley, to produce enough goods to",Paragraph
"feed the entire world. Located west of the isohyetal line of 20 inches, such locations lack",Paragraph
the necessary rainfall for agriculture. Building on hydraulic concepts developed by,Paragraph
"natives of the Southwest and of Utah Mormons, federal subsidies initiated by the 1902",Paragraph
Reclamation Act have helped to finance infrastructure that spreads the limited water,Paragraph
"resources of the West among the arid regions. Additionally, many farmers in the Great",Paragraph
"Plains have drilled into aquifers, including the Ogallala, and then planted circular fields",Paragraph
irrigated by center-pivot watering systems. The extension of agriculture into such regions,Paragraph
"is a technological wonder of American society; however, it also makes farmers",Paragraph
precariously dependent on the management of a limited resource.,Paragraph
Patterns in agricultural buildings have not all solely followed a program of utility. As,Paragraph
large agricultural corporations have taken over lands of the midwestern and western,Paragraph
"United States, preservationists throughout the nation have sought to preserve the image of",Paragraph
"the independent yeoman farmer. Most often, this effort has seen organizations such as the",Paragraph
National Farmland Trust raising funds to preserve older farmsteads that are threatened by,Paragraph
suburban or urban expansion. Another social change to the farm structure relates to,Paragraph
"Venturi’s idea of the decorated shed. For many years, the largest shed, the barn, was",Paragraph
viewed as a billboardin-the-making. Tobacco companies often painted an entire side of,Paragraph
the barn with advertisements for Mail Pouch or Red Man. As part of the antismoking,Paragraph
"furor of the late 1990s, these billboards were banned and removed. The barn has",Paragraph
consistently belied its status as purely a utilitarian structure to inspire and exhibit social,Paragraph
ideas and ideals.,Paragraph

Foundations of 20th-century architecture of Ahmedabad are primarily Western in,Paragraph
"origin, beginning in the early 19th century, when the British took control of the city from",Paragraph
the Maratha kings. They established a military cantonment to the northeast of the Old,Paragraph
City in 1830. The railway was introduced in the 1860s with the first textile mill. In the,Paragraph
"1870s, new gates were opened in the city wall, and large portions of it were pulled down",Paragraph
after World War I. Early expansion of modern Ahmedabad occurred on the side of the,Paragraph

"of Gujarat College (c.1890), an eclectic Public Works Department project with Gothic,",Paragraph
"Tudor, and local touches, where the George V Hall (1910) was renamed Mahatma",Paragraph

AIRPORT AND AVIATION BUILDING,Title
Airports were a novel development without precedent. Although similar to railway,Paragraph
"stations, aircraft had quite different architectural requirements to passenger trains. This",Paragraph
did not deter designers in the early 20th century from using the styling of train stations,Paragraph
and train interiors in their designs for the new airport terminals and aircraft cabin,Paragraph
interiors. Much as the great railway stations encapsulated the engineering achievements,Paragraph
"of the 19th century, airport terminals were to become highly visible indicators of",Paragraph
technological advancement for nations and global cities in the 20th century.,Paragraph
"The symbolism of airport terminals was present almost from the outset, but it has",Paragraph
"undergone significant alteration over time, from the oversized modern designs of the",Paragraph
"1930s; to expressive structures such as Eero Saarinen’s eaglelike TWA Terminal,",Paragraph
"Idlewild, New York (1962); to the futurist high-tech terminals of the 1980s and 1990s. In",Paragraph
"the mid-1960s, Paul Andréau’s centralized Terminal | at Charles de Gaulle International",Paragraph
"Airport, Roisy-en-France (1974), demonstrates how air terminals had evolved into large",Paragraph
complex megastructures that were purely sys-tems to deal with enormous numbers of,Paragraph
travelers. The air terminal type embodied an inevitable romanticism about flight and,Paragraph
movement in contrast with the reality of scale and flexibility in an environment subject to,Paragraph
rapid unrelenting change.,Paragraph
"Aircraft have changed enormously since that first flight at Kitty Hawk, North",Paragraph
"Carolina, in 1903. The changes in commercial aircraft design over the 34 years that",Paragraph
separate the Douglas DC-3 (1935) from the Boeing 747-100 (1969) have been,Paragraph
staggering; airports raced to keep up with the new aircraft and airline needs. The much,Paragraph
"increased seating capacities, safety, reliability, speed and range of aircraft lowered costs",Paragraph
"and increased the popularity of air travel, which encouraged ever greater numbers to fly;",Paragraph
"in turn, airport terminals around the globe were confronted by new pressures to expand",Paragraph
"facilities. The one constant factor in airport terminal design was change—swift,",Paragraph
"unrelenting, and unpredictable. Airport terminal design is a contest between the rival",Paragraph
"claims of centralization and dispersal, between providing minimum passenger walking",Paragraph
distances on the landside and dispersal on the airside to take advantage of the,Paragraph
maneuverability of airplanes.,Paragraph
The challenge of mass air travel in the 1990s led to the building of extremely large,Paragraph
terminals to handle upward of 35 million passengers per year in an unprecedented,Paragraph
expansion of airports around the world that culminated in a stunning new architectural,Paragraph
"synthesis. This new generation of terminals were hugely complex, giant high-tech steel",Paragraph
sheds that responded to the demands of extreme efficiency and a renewed emphasis on,Paragraph
"architectural expression. Indeed, it is hardly an original observation to say that much as",Paragraph
"train stations were the great popular monuments to 19th century industrialism, in the 20th",Paragraph
"century, these extraordinary airport terminals similarly express the pinnacle of 20th",Paragraph
century achievement in architecture and construction.,Paragraph
"The new terminals are almost cities unto themselves, albeit rampant metropolitan",Paragraph
"fragments, populated by hoards of transient nomads. The introduction of lightweight tent",Paragraph
"and tensile forms in Saarinen’s elegant terminal at Dulles International Airport,",Paragraph
"Washington, D.C. (1962), and later in the new Haj Terminal, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Caption

international terminals reinforced this incipient nomadic connection.,Paragraph
Whether the strategy of building ever-larger terminals proves effective and they are,Paragraph
"the forerunners of even larger terminals in the future, or whether other factors—air traffic",Paragraph
"density, weariness of the traveling public—intervene to limit size, time alone will tell.",Paragraph
The great size and cost of the new terminals may yet prove to be their undoing. Of all the,Paragraph
"new building types to emerge in the 20th century, and notwithstanding the skyscraper,",Paragraph
these new terminals speak more vividly and eloquently than any other mass movement by,Paragraph
"peoples across the globe. Starkly contrasting with the tragic events of the 20th century,",Paragraph
"the horizontal steel-and-glass terminal is a cathedral whose standardized open space,",Paragraph
"immersed in light, encapsulates mankind’s dream of freedom.",Paragraph
The earliest airline routes—both national and international—began across Europe in,Paragraph
"spring 1919. The first generation of airfields was primitive, little more than grassy",Paragraph
fields—unobstructed flat surfaces used for recreational purposes at the weekend or for,Paragraph
military training and parades. The Dugny-Le Bourget (Paris) and Croydon (London),Caption
"airports, which opened in 1920, signaled the arrival of second-generation airports having",Paragraph
"purpose-built terminals, the beginning of the concept of the modern air terminal complex.",Paragraph
"The second-generation terminal, unlike the earlier primitive landing fields, comprised a",Paragraph
multifunctional building that was normally separated from the hangars and workshops,Paragraph
"but that usually incorporated the control tower. Except for this control tower, the building",Paragraph
"had a low profile to avoid obstructing flight passes, and the roofs were designed on the",Paragraph
airfield side as flat platforms for use by the public at air shows.,Paragraph
Terminals often resembled grandstands with tiered viewing terraces for the public to,Paragraph
"watch air shows. More monumental than necessary, in Europe, architectural",Paragraph
overstatement was usually a product of local ambition or national pride. The air terminal,Paragraph
and modern architecture thus emerged concurrently. Terminal architecture was frequently,Paragraph
"uncompromisingly modern, with examples such as the Schipol International Terminal",Paragraph
"(1928) by Dirk Roosenberg serving as models. Schipol had an L-shaped layout, with a",Paragraph
tall control tower as a central feature and roof terraces for visitor viewing. The,Paragraph
importance of the tower was typical: At Lyon’s V-shaped terminal by Antonin Chomel,Paragraph
"and Pierre Veriere (1930), the control tower is on the corner and advances toward the",Paragraph
"field, and at Birmingham (1939), by Graham Dawbarn and Nigel Norman, the tower",Caption
sprouts sheltering wings on either side.,Paragraph
"Gatwick terminal (1936), designed by Hoar Marlow and Lovett, was circular, with the",Paragraph
control tower mounted on top in the center. It had rail-mounted telescopic passageways,Paragraph
connected to the gates of the beehive to protect passengers from the weather and from,Paragraph
"propellers. Gatwick was the first airport with a railway connection, and it initiated the",Paragraph
"satellite concept for airport terminals. Significantly, Gatwick’s canvas passageways",Paragraph
connecting to aircraft are precursors of modern telescopic passenger-loading bridges or,Paragraph
jetties.,Paragraph
The postwar terminals coincided with the engineering and machine aesthetic of,Paragraph
"modern architecture as expressed succinctly by Le Corbusier in —_ (1923), in which he",Paragraph
dedicated an entire chapter to airport architecture. Aircraft fascinated other architects as,Paragraph

"The history of American air transport policy contrasts with that of Europe, where the",Paragraph

nearly always rested in the hands of each country’s central government. In America,Paragraph
airport designers generally simulated ideas from the architects and engineers of railway,Paragraph

"that became common features in later decades. On occasion, a regional style was chosen",Paragraph

After 1927 increases in flight movements and passenger capacities and the weight of,Paragraph
commercial aircraft placed new demands on concepts for the buildings and for the entire,Paragraph
airfield and caused the third generation of airport construction. Expensive take-off and,Paragraph
"landing strips with paved surfaces, standard at all airports in the United States since 1928,",Paragraph

to varying wind directions. The airport at Bromma near Stockholm became the first to be,Paragraph

"and in 1929, the French proposed the idea of a wedge-shaped building zone projecting",Paragraph
"forward from the edge of the airport into the center of the airfield, leaving more than 80",Paragraph

Resulting from the tremendous advances in aviation made during World War II and,Paragraph
"the introduction of new types of commercial aircraft carrying 80 to 100 passengers,",Paragraph
existing arrival and departure halls were rendered inadequate. Airport construction and,Paragraph
modernization was delayed in the immediate postwar period and only got going properly,Paragraph
in Europe in the 1950s. The frontal system or transporter configuration of terminal design,Paragraph
"dominated: Aircraft stood out on aprons, separate from the terminals, and passengers had",Paragraph
to walk out across the tarmac to the planes. The Zurich International Airport (1953) by,Paragraph
Alfred and Heinrich Oeschger is typical of this fourth generation of airports. Other,Paragraph
"examples are Heathrow (1956, London) and Orly (1961, Paris), which had a terminal",Paragraph
"located at the center with two fingers on either side, stretching 2,300 feet from end to",Paragraph
end.,Paragraph
Finger- and star-shaped terminals arrived in the 1950s in the United States and soon,Paragraph
"afterward in Europe. The terminal at London’s Gatwick Airport in 1958, a rectangular",Paragraph
"building with a single finger, was the first example of a fifth-generation airport, with two",Paragraph
"more added in 1964; Rome, Milan, Copenhagen, London, and Amsterdam soon adopted",Paragraph
the system. Toronto airport (1961) in North America and Geneva’s Cointrin airport,Paragraph
(1968) and the Cologne-Bonn airport (1970) in Europe are leading examples of satellite,Paragraph
terminal design.,Paragraph
The basic assumption inherent in fifth-generation airports—minimum distances,Paragraph
between landside and airside—came under great pressure in the 1970s when international,Paragraph
"terrorism surfaced. Since then, airports have been subject to strict safety regulations.",Paragraph
"The main feature of the next, sixth, generation of airports, dealt with the terrorist threat",Paragraph
"by applying the bottleneck principle, with the arrival and departure halls once again",Paragraph
"centrally located (often on separate floors), in combination with a strict division between",Paragraph
"the “secure” area and the “open” area. As a consequence, well-designed terminals assure",Paragraph
"a discreet transition from public area to a zone of differentiated security, thereby avoiding",Paragraph
any feeling of restricted freedom.,Paragraph
The 1990s brought a climax in terminal design with the creation of some 40 major,Paragraph
"new terminals around the globe, replacing older obsolete facilities for cities as far apart as",Paragraph
"Osaka, Hong Kong, Bilbao, London, Paris, Inchon, Barcelona, Seville, and Shanghai.",Caption
"Although they are very varied architecturally, they share many common features; namely,",Paragraph
"great size, openness, lightweight construction, high-tech detail of structure and services,",Paragraph
and a new lyrical freedom. The new high-tech megaterminals frequently combine,Paragraph
"extensive areas of retail, hotel and conference facilities, bars, and movie theaters. At a",Paragraph
"minimum, the 1990s terminals are the products of a 40-year evolution and, hence, bring",Paragraph
together many existing trends in a striking new synthesis. Constructional ingenuity and,Paragraph
"bravado, large, curved, roofs, the application and celebration of advanced technology—",Paragraph
all this and more has been applied obsessively to every facet of terminal performance.,Paragraph
"Although the dominant high-tech expression was not confined to air terminal design,",Paragraph
"there is an immediate appropriateness about its use. Sir Norman Foster and Partners, Sir",Paragraph

ALUMINUM,Title
Aluminum is such a ubiquitous material in 20th-century architecture that it is hard to,Paragraph
appreciate how relatively late it came on to the scene. Aluminum had considerable,Paragraph
"advantages, including its light weight, its malleability, its corrosion resistance, and its",Paragraph
"alloyability for special properties. For the first third of the 20th century, however, it had",Paragraph
"to compete with similarly reliable materials, especially steel. Nevertheless, aluminum",Paragraph
"was seen as a thoroughly modern material without historical associations, making it",Paragraph
indispensable to the Modern movement. This did not preclude some designers from using,Paragraph
"the material for historicist styles, but its functional role in architecture kept pace with",Paragraph
architectural design and building technology.,Paragraph
The particular strengths of aluminum were proven during World War II in a wide,Paragraph
"range of applications. However, after the war, the primary producers put aluminum into",Paragraph
"large-scale market development to advocate for its use in all sectors, architecture being",Paragraph
"no exception. In fact, by 1965 an estimated 905,000 tons of aluminum were used in",Paragraph
"building construction in the United States, more than in any other field of application.",Paragraph
Aluminum’s most significant and specific contributions to 20th-century architecture have,Paragraph
"been in windows, storefronts, and curtain walling. Aluminum has also been widely",Paragraph
"employed in decorative features and hardware, windows and doors, and siding for a range",Paragraph
of structures.,Paragraph
"Although aluminum had been known for much of the 19th century, one of its first",Paragraph
"architectural uses was for the capping of the Washington Monument (Robert Mills,",Paragraph
"1884). Aluminum was introduced commercially after 1886, when American Charles Hall",Paragraph
and Frenchman Paul Héroult independently and almost simultaneously discovered that,Paragraph
"alumina, or aluminum oxide, would dissolve in fused cryolite, which could then be",Paragraph
"decomposed electrolytically to become a crude molten metal. A low-cost technique, the",Paragraph
Hall-Héroult process remains as the major method used for the commercial production of,Paragraph
aluminum.,Paragraph
"Another early application of aluminum in architecture came in 1891, when Burnham",Paragraph
and Root used the material for the interior fittings of the Monadnock Building (1889-91),Paragraph
in Chicago. In 1897 Raffaele Ingami used unalloyed aluminum sheets with aluminum,Paragraph
rivets to surface the cupola of the Church of San Gioacchino (1897) in Rome. In the same,Caption
"year in Montreal, the Canada Life Building (Brown and Vallance, 1897) was finished",Paragraph
"with a decorative aluminum cornice. In all these cases, the metal was used as a practical",Paragraph
substitute and did not contribute significantly to the design.,Paragraph
The Austrian Otto Wagner developed the use of aluminum as a deliberate and specific,Paragraph
architectural feature in his Post Office Savings Bank (1904-06) in Vienna. He used,Paragraph
"aluminum bolts to hold the exterior marble panels, and he used aluminum for interior",Paragraph
"cladding and details, such as the grilles and vents. Although it would be some 30 years",Paragraph
"before the material came into the mainstream of architecture, Wagner’s designs",Paragraph
"represented a breakthrough and began to establish aluminum as a modern material, one",Paragraph
"that could be associated with the ideals of modern architecture, including technology and",Paragraph
theories of modernism.,Paragraph
"Despite these early precedents, aluminum’s large-scale application as a constructive",Paragraph
and decorative architectural material was developed most significantly during the 1930s.,Paragraph
"Even in Pittsburgh, the aluminum capital of the United States, the tower of the Smithfield",Paragraph
"United Church (Henry Hornbostel, 1926) used aluminum, but still only as a substitute for",Paragraph
other metals and in a design that was strangely traditional and imitative.,Paragraph
Modernist architects began to value aluminum as a building material with vast,Paragraph
"potential. With the development of steelframed skyscrapers and curtain walls, architects",Paragraph
"used aluminum for glazing bars and spandrels. Aluminum could save space, reduce",Paragraph
"weight, and shorten building time. Aluminum’s strengthto-weight ratio meant that thinner",Paragraph
"and lighter sections could be used for spandrels and windows, thus significantly",Paragraph
"increasing rentable floor area. In addition, these elements could be prefabricated and",Paragraph
"hoisted into position on-site, thus saving considerable time and money over conventional",Paragraph
materials. These factors were directly related to considerations of industrial building and,Paragraph
mass production of component parts. Many skyscrapers were fitted with aluminum,Paragraph
"spandrels in the 1930s, including the panels of the Empire State Building (Shreve, Lamb",Caption
"and Harmon, 1930). The Daily Express Building (1931) on London’s Fleet Street by Ellis",Caption
and Clarke combined glazing bars with glass panels. Another noteworthy use of,Paragraph
"aluminum was in the fabrication of storefronts and window frames. During the 1930s, the",Paragraph
American Kawneer Company developed extrusion technology that was particularly,Paragraph
appropriate for fabricating metal windows and storefronts. The combination of reduced,Paragraph
"maintenance, technical efficiency, and ease of assembly encouraged the use of",Paragraph
prefabricated aluminum components.,Paragraph
These applications to commercial buildings were paralleled by experiments in housing,Paragraph
and space frame architecture. In 1931 the Aluminaire House was erected by Lawrence,Paragraph
Kocher and Albert Frey as a demonstration building within the Allied Arts and Building,Paragraph
Products Exhibition in New York City. The house was built using aluminum-pipe,Paragraph
columns and panels fixed on the,Paragraph

"the aluminum parts, probably with the intention of developing another area of aluminum",Paragraph
"application. In the late 1920s, Buckminster Fuller intended his 4D house to be fabricated",Paragraph
"from aluminum alloys, which at that time were yet to be developed. By the early 1930s,",Paragraph
"new heat-treated alloys were available, yet Fuller’s experimental ideas were not accepted",Paragraph
"by the American Institute of Architects (AIA), where prefabrication in domestic building",Paragraph
was disfavored. These early attempts at prefabrication did nonetheless set a precedent for,Paragraph
later postwar architects who produced a range of prefabricated buildings that employed,Paragraph
aluminum in many different applications.,Paragraph
This potential for prefabrication and portability was developed after World War II. For,Paragraph
"example, the British aircraft industry produced 86,000 prefabricated bungalows using",Paragraph
"aluminum as the main material immediately after 1945, and in America after 1940 the",Paragraph
National Homes Corporation designed and manufactured prefabricated houses using,Paragraph
aluminum cladding and roofing. The prefabrication ideal was also used in England for,Paragraph
"schools and portable buildings. During the 1950s, a British firm developed the supply of",Paragraph
"prefabricated, pressed, aluminumframed huts for use in rural areas of Africa.",Caption
After World War II the aluminum companies began promoting their material for use in,Paragraph
"construction and architecture. In 1947 the R.S. Reynolds Company, a specialist",Paragraph
"aluminum supplier, set up a Memorial Award, which was offered by the AIA for",Paragraph
architects who “made the most significant contribution to the use of aluminum,Paragraph
"aesthetically or structurally, in the building field.” Notable examples of award winners",Paragraph
"include I.M.Pei’s 88 Pine St., New York (1974), Philip Johnson’s Pennzoil Place (1978),",Caption
"Foster and Partner Hong Kong Shanghai Bank Headquarters (1986), and Helmut Jahn’s",Paragraph
"United Airlines Terminal, Chicago (1988). In France, the work of Jean Prouvé (who had",Paragraph
"already developed an interest in aluminum prior to 1940) was greatly enhanced when, in",Paragraph

"The demand for “space frames” grew with a demand for exhibition halls, aircraft",Paragraph
"hangars, warehouses, and storage facilities. One of the most elegant solutions for space",Paragraph
frames was the dome. The Festival of Britain’s Dome of Discovery (1951) was fabricated,Paragraph
"mainly from extruded triangular lattice aluminum framework and, at a span of 110",Paragraph
"meters, was the largest aluminum structure at the time. By the later 1950s, the American",Paragraph
Kaiser Aluminum Corporation was developing a prefabricated dome system that use,Paragraph

"able to hold up to 2,000 people, could be erected in a matter of hours. A gold-anodized",Paragraph
Kaiser dome was erected in Moscow in 1959 for a U.S. cultural and industrial exhibition.,Paragraph
"Although these structural uses of aluminum were impressive, the most successful",Paragraph
postwar application was undoubtedly the further development of the curtain wall. The,Paragraph
aluminum-clad 30-story Alcoa Building (1950) in Pittsburgh by Harrison and,Caption
Abramovitz was the lightest permanent office building of its size in the world at one time,Paragraph

Murphy’s Prudential Building (1955) was significant not only for its temporary status as,Paragraph

Modern Japanese architects have also embraced the material. Arata Isozaki’s,Paragraph

Mario Roberto Alvarez is considered one of the most prominent and prolific,Paragraph
representatives of the rationalist approach to architecture in Argentina. Born in Buenos,Paragraph
"Aires on 14 November, 1913, he graduated with a degree in architecture from the",Paragraph
University of Buenos Aires in 1937. He worked first at the Ministry of Public Works and,Paragraph
later become a municipal architect for Avellaneda City. Alvarez opened his architectural,Paragraph
"office in 1947, when the modernist ideas were firmly established in Latin America. Ever",Paragraph
"since, his practice has been characterized by the variety, quantity, and solid",Paragraph
professionalism of his work.,Paragraph
His most refined and important contribution is The Municipal Theater General San,Paragraph
"Martin, designed in association with Macedonio Oscar Ruiz (1960) and located on",Paragraph
"Corrientes Avenue, the area of spectacles and theaters. The facade has a curtain wall that",Paragraph
"announces adherence to a functional and rational approach, articulated with a marquee",Paragraph
that makes a subtle reference to the history of the area. The lobby is one of the best,Paragraph
"examples of high modernism in Latin America. This space, which echoes some of the",Paragraph
"developments in Brazilian modernism at that time, combines tilted columns supporting",Paragraph
the suspended volume of one of the auditoriums. It also incorporates a flying staircase,Caption
"and a large mural, as well as modernist furniture and rich materials.",Paragraph
"The entire complex, with four auditoriums dedicated to experimental theater,",Paragraph
"contemporary dance, and chamber music, incorporated the best stage equipment and",Paragraph
technology available at the time. The interior spaces of the auditoriums are characterized,Paragraph
by a calm artistic sensibility that relies on the combination of very few materials while,Paragraph
"using elongated, sweeping lines and lighting. The complex was later extended and",Paragraph
"connected to the San Martin Cultural Center (1970), also designed by Alvarez. The",Paragraph
"cultural center is located in a very dense urban area, and the entrance incorporates a dry",Paragraph
plaza that opens up the space of the old Spanish colonial grid.,Paragraph
"The studio also expanded some of the finest cultural institutions of the country, among",Paragraph
"them the prestigious Col6n Theater (1968) and the Cervantes National Theater (1969),",Paragraph
both in Buenos Aires.,Paragraph
"By the 1970s, the firm Alvarez and Associates, had acquired a reputation for",Paragraph
incorporating modern technology in its rational approach to design problems. This,Paragraph
"approach was further explored with the SOMISA building (1975), a technological",Paragraph
"challenge, as it was the first building in the world completely welded together.",Paragraph
Alvarez was always very conscious of the effect of a building in the environment. This,Paragraph
"is exemplified by the Galeria Jardin (1983), a commercial center located on Florida Street",Paragraph
"at the core of the city center. The complex has an underground garage, with three levels",Paragraph
"of shops and offices, and also includes two towers with offices and apartments. The basic",Paragraph
"parti revolves around the idea of opening an internal street, which was unified by two",Paragraph
submerged patios opened up to the sky and to natural light. The complex is linked,Paragraph
"visually and functionally by stairs and balconies, thus enriching the urban fabric with this",Paragraph
refuge in the core of the block.,Paragraph
"Among several towers designed by Alvarez, one of the most remarkable is the IBM",Paragraph
"building (1983). The IBM headquarters is located in the Catalinas Norte area, the",Paragraph
gateway to the metropolis from the estuary of the river. The tower is in the middle of a,Paragraph
"hub of relevant buildings from the turn of the century, including corporate headquarters,",Paragraph
"monuments, and parks.",Paragraph
The solution is a highly sculptural yet simple type that follows the tripartite model of a,Paragraph
"base, a middle, and a top, which exemplifies Alvarez classical affinities. However,",Paragraph
Alvarez incorporates subtle reflections on the theme. The building aesthetic is,Paragraph
characterized by the distinction between the circulation of the areas served. The tower is,Paragraph
"related to the site by an elongated, pure platform forming a base. The prism of the tower",Caption
"is linked to the platform by the elevator shafts’ smaller volume, generating the impression",Paragraph
that the tower is floating. The fenestration recedes and the horizontal bands of concrete,Paragraph
slabs composing each floor give the building its dynamic simplicity. A clean and,Paragraph
powerful entablature ends the composition.,Paragraph
"The conscious expression of the structure, care for the programmatic requirements,",Paragraph
"and the ascetic elegance of the interiors characterize most of the multistory flats, health",Paragraph
"centers, and office buildings designed by Alvarez’s studio. One of the most significant",Paragraph
"landmarks in the Buenos Aires skyline is Le Pare tower. Forty-six stories high, it is one",Paragraph
of the tallest towers in South America (1995). Instead of the typical Miesian rectangular,Paragraph
"prism used in many of his other projects, Alvarez approaches this structure differently.",Paragraph
The floor plan is expressed in volume through balconies and circulation. The highly,Paragraph
articulated yet restrained facade is the result of interior variations needed to provide sun,Paragraph
and views. The expressive richness of this tower comes from the joints in the exposed,Paragraph
concrete and from the marks left by the shuttering bolts securing the formwork.,Paragraph
"Instead of radical transformation, Alvarez’s philosophy has been to explore a limited",Paragraph
set of forms as variations of a theme: to do more with less. His work was immune to the,Paragraph
"sweeping changes and explorations of the 1970s and to the notions of fragmentation,",Paragraph
"historical allusion, or the search for complexity and richness of meaning. Alvarez’s",Paragraph
production remained involved in solutions that advanced an uncompromising classicist,Paragraph
attitude. His work belongs to a generation that absorbed most of Ludwig Mies van der,Paragraph
Rohe’s contributions and adopted them to a country with a developing economy.,Paragraph
"After more than 50 years of professional work, innumerable awards, and many",Paragraph
"competitions won, Alvarez’s studio remains committed to a stable, gradual evolution",Paragraph

AMSTERDAM SCHOOL,Title
The Amsterdam School was comprised of Dutch architects active between 1910 and 1930,Paragraph
whose work was associated with Expressionism and promulgated by the publication,Paragraph
"During World War I and for a decade thereafter, the striking and controversial work of",Paragraph
the Amsterdam School transformed entire portions of its eponymous city and influenced,Paragraph
architecture throughout the Netherlands. Although almost every building type was,Paragraph
"addressed, the major monuments are governmentfunded ensembles of workers’ dwellings",Paragraph
"arranged in perimeter blocks that brought a new scale to Dutch cities. Paradoxically,",Paragraph
"although its members sought unique solutions for each commission, a readily identifiable",Paragraph
"group style emerged, and collaborations were frequent. Characterized by a luxurious",Paragraph
"fantasy and individualistic details, the work came under fire in the later 1920s from",Paragraph
"proponents of the functionalist subsequently, the Amsterdam School was written out of",Paragraph
"the literature. But in the 1970s, reevaluation commenced; many of the buildings have",Paragraph
been restored and once again are a magnet for architects and urbanists.,Paragraph
The cradle of the Amsterdam School was the atelier of Eduard Cuypers (1859-1927).,Paragraph
"Working there at various times during the first decade were its future leader, Michel de",Paragraph
Klerk (1884-1923) and such important representatives as Johann Melchior van der Mey,Paragraph
(1878-1949) and Pieter Lodewjik Kramer (1881-1961). Other future acolytes in that,Paragraph
office who absorbed Cuypers’s credo that architecture was first and foremost an art that,Paragraph
"must transcend, while serving the pragmatic realities of program and resources, included",Paragraph
"G.F.LaCroix (1877-1923), Nicolaas Landsdorp (1885-1968), B.T.Boeyinga (1886—",Paragraph
"1969), Jan Boterenbrood (1886-1932), J.M.Luthmann (1890-1973), and Dick Greiner",Paragraph
(1891-1964).,Paragraph
"Cuyper’s peculiar synthesis of Austrian and German Jugendstil (Art Nouveau), British",Paragraph
"Arts and Crafts, Belgian Art Nouveau, 17th-century Dutch architecture, and Indonesian",Title
art appears in more abstract guise in all of their work. Better known architects of,Paragraph
Cuypers’s generation such as Willem Kromhout (1864-1940) and K.P.C.de Bazel (1869-,Paragraph
"1923) also were admired exemplars but with the doyen of Dutch architecture,",Paragraph
"H.P.Berlage (1856-1934), they had a more complicated relationship. In his one published",Paragraph
"statement of 1916, de Klerk criticized Berlage’s work for its excessive sobriety and lack",Paragraph
of representational character in both materials and function. Yet they followed his use of,Paragraph
"geometric systems to proportion plans and elevations, and in the late teens and early",Paragraph
"1920s, Berlage worked with members of the Amsterdam School and responded to their",Paragraph
delight in piquant invention; his housing around the Mercatorplein (1925-27) indicates a,Paragraph
mutual regard.,Paragraph
"Although the Amsterdam School, unlike its rival, De Stijl, embraced no specific",Paragraph
"theoretical program, its members were united not only by stylistic practice and the",Paragraph
conviction that architecture was first and foremost an inclusive art that should be,Paragraph
"aesthetically accessible to people of all classes, but also by training (many were",Paragraph
autodidacts or studied in courses outside the main professional school at Delft). To,Paragraph
"understand the movement’s rapid and widespread—if short-lived—influence, it is",Paragraph
necessary to review several peculiarly Dutch institutions through which its “members”,Paragraph
"exercised power. The club Architectura et Amicitia (A et A), founded in 1855, during the",Paragraph
teens and twenties was led by those sympathetic to the artistic ideals of the Amsterdam,Paragraph
"School, whose work was privileged in its publications, especially (literally, “Turnings,”",Paragraph
"but in the sense of departures or deviations), which under the partisan edi-torship of",Paragraph
Hendricus Theodorus Wijdeveld (1885—1987) appeared monthly from 1918 to 1928. The,Paragraph
club also held competitions and exhibitions that disseminated designs conforming to the,Paragraph
group’s aesthetic position; it was in a review of the display mounted by A et A in 1916,Paragraph
that the name __ first appeared in print.,Paragraph
Amsterdam’s municipal organizations also played a role. The Department of Public,Paragraph
"Works was staffed by its adherents, as testified by the street furniture, bridges, public",Paragraph
"baths, schools, and offices for city agencies that were designed and executed between",Paragraph
1917 and 1930. The Social Democrats responsible for housing policy in Amsterdam were,Paragraph
"admirers, for they believed that the work of the Amsterdam School dignified the",Paragraph
neighborhoods of the working- and lower-middle-class families for whom they were,Paragraph
responsible. The Commission of Aesthetic Advice which passed judgment on exterior,Paragraph
"design, also was dominated by its advocates, much to the chagrin of architects of other",Paragraph
"stylistic persuasions, who often had to change their designs to conform to Amsterdam",Paragraph
School conceptions.,Paragraph
"Multicolored brick and tile, quintessentially Dutch materials, were employed for",Paragraph
"structure and cladding but used in unprecedented ways, in combination with concrete,",Paragraph
"stone, and powerful new mortars, to create unique configurations that pulsate with",Paragraph
vitality. The dynamism of the modern metropolis inspired many of the formal strategies,Paragraph
"employed by the Amsterdam School, yet vernacular, historical, and even naturalistic",Paragraph
"references, as well as motifs from German and Scandinavian architecture and Frank",Paragraph
"Lloyd Wright, leavened the imagery. This was a narrative architecture that used massing",Paragraph
"and ormament iconographically, to contextualize each commission. Accusations of",Paragraph
"irrationalism and facadism were exaggerated; when commissions allowed, interior spaces",Paragraph
were as ingenious as exterior envelopes and in each case expressed the realities of the,Paragraph
program. After 1925 socioeconomic events curtailed the extravagant conceits of the,Paragraph
"Amsterdam School and led to a more repetitious and less imaginative vocabulary, but",Paragraph
during its reign in the Netherlands it was responsible for such remarkable buildings as the,Paragraph

AMUSEMENT PARK,Title
Amusement parks are controlled environments that entertain visitors through the,Paragraph
"simulation of space, place, and experience. It is the element of control that is initially",Paragraph
most important in defining the building type because the amusement park presents itself,Paragraph
"as a safe, and indeed sanitized, environment wherein conventionally dangerous or",Paragraph
arduous activities can be undertaken without fear of their consequences. The desire for,Paragraph
control leads to the necessity of simulating or fictionalizing each and every space and,Paragraph
"event that the visitor to the park will experience. For this reason, amusement park",Paragraph
"designers often treat their buildings and settings simply as film sets, facades that are",Paragraph
divorced from the function of their interiors and that are dismantled and changed at will.,Paragraph
"In the early years of the 20th century, this transience was exacerbated by the fact that a",Paragraph
single designer was rarely responsible for more than one part of any park. In,Paragraph
"combination, these factors render the task of determining who has designed the park, and",Paragraph
"even its date of completion, difficult. This situation has changed in recent years, with",Paragraph
"many respected architects, including Michael Graves, Robert Stern, Antoine Predock,",Paragraph
"Frank Gehry, Robert Venturi, and Denise Scott Brown, accepting commissions for the",Paragraph
design of amusement parks and associated facilities (hotels and training centers). Major,Paragraph
"20th-century amusement parks include Disneyland (1955) in Anaheim, Florida; Six Flags",Paragraph
"over Texas (1961) near Fort Worth, Texas; Walt Disney World (1965) in Orlando,",Paragraph
"Florida; Universal Studios (1970-80) in Los Angeles, California; Tokyo Disneyland",Paragraph
(1983) in Tokyo; and Fox Studios (1996-99) in Sydney.,Paragraph
"One particular type of amusement park, the theme park, also rose to prominence in the",Paragraph
last half of the 20th century. The theme park is characterized by a limited set of well-,Paragraph
defined thematic boundaries. Typical theme parks include the Old Westflavored Knotts,Paragraph
"Berry Farm (1940, 1970) in Anaheim, California; the theologically focused Bible World",Paragraph
"(1975) in Orlando, Florida; the evolutionary-themed Darwin Centre (1995) in Edinburgh;",Paragraph
and the piratical Mundomar (1996) by Estudio Nombela on Spain’s Costa Blanca.,Paragraph
"Despite these differences, the terms “theme park” and “amusement park” are often used",Paragraph
interchangeably to refer to any space that promotes enjoyment through simulation.,Paragraph
The origins of the amusement park are frequently traced to the 17th-century pleasure,Paragraph
gardens of England and France. One of the most famous of these parks was Vauxhall,Paragraph
"Gardens in London, which first opened in 1661 and by 1728 contained mechanical rides,",Paragraph
"parachute jumps, and balloon ascensions. Perhaps the most popular of these early",Paragraph
"amusement parks was the Prater in Vienna, which became the site of the 1873 Vienna",Paragraph
World’s Fair and which featured both a primitive wooden Ferris wheel and one of the,Paragraph
"first large carousels. However, although amusement parks first came to prominence in",Paragraph
"Europe, it was in North America that they enjoyed their greatest success. One of the first",Paragraph
"large American amusement parks was Jones’s Wood, which opened in New York in the",Paragraph
"early years of the 19th century. Jones’s Wood comprised a loose collection of beer halls,",Paragraph
music,Title
"houses, viewing platforms, dioramas, and shooting galleries. Rapid development of the",Paragraph
surrounding areas forced Jones’s Wood to close in the late 1860s just as a new era in,Paragraph
amusement park design was beginning on nearby Coney Island.,Paragraph
In 1897 George Tilyou erected a walled enclosure around his Steeplechase ride on,Paragraph
Coney Island. This act of enclosing the site and controlling entry to his rides is regarded,Paragraph
as a defining moment in 20th-century amusement park design. Of similar significance is,Paragraph
"Tilyou’s claim that if “Paris is France, Coney Island, between June and September, is the",Paragraph
"World” (McCullough, 1957, 291). With this statement, Tilyou set in motion the 20th-",Paragraph
century amusement park obsession with spatial and cultural simulation. Tilyou believed,Paragraph
"that by constructing replicas of famous building types from different parts of the world,",Paragraph
"he could simulate the entire planet in such a way that it could be quickly, efficiently, and",Paragraph
safely experienced by large numbers of paying customers. Such was the success of,Paragraph
"Steeplechase Park (1897) that two new Coney Island amusement parks, Luna Park (1903)",Paragraph
"and Dreamland (1904), soon followed. Luna Park simulated a trip to the moon, and",Paragraph
"Dreamland featured a number of attractions, including a partial reconstruction of Pompeii",Paragraph
(complete with simulated eruptions on the hour) and a six-story building where customers,Paragraph
could experience an office fire firsthand. Such was the success of this building type that,Paragraph
"by 1919 there were more than 1,500 amusement parks in North America, although the",Paragraph
Depression saw this figure drop to barely 200 financially viable parks in the 1940s. It was,Paragraph
not until the 1950s that Walt Disney revitalized the industry with his themed zones,Paragraph
"(Fantasyland, Adventureland, Frontierland, and Tomorrowland) and his focus on the",Paragraph
traditional values of middle America. The success of Disneyland at Anaheim saw a string,Paragraph
"of similar Disney parks opened around the world, including EPCOT (1982) in Florida",Paragraph
and the more controversial EuroDisney (1992) near Paris. This friction between the,Paragraph
“real” and the “simulated” or “virtual” is evident in many recent amusement park,Paragraph
"designs. At one extreme, amusement parks are increasingly producing more complex and",Paragraph
"realistic electronic simulations. Virtual World (1981-92) in San Diego, California;",Caption
Acurinto (1996) in Nagasaki; and SegaWorld (1996-98) in Sydney each feature,Paragraph
"extensive electronic, or video game, environments. In sharp contrast to this trend is the",Paragraph
rise in amusement parks that promote ecotourism as a “real” experience. Mitsuru Man,Paragraph
Senda’s Asahikawa Shunkodai Park (1994) and his Urawa Living Museum (1995) in,Paragraph
Urawa are examples of parks that advocate a “genuine” appreciation of the environment,Paragraph
"or history of the “real world.” Ironically, in many respects each of these extremes is as",Paragraph
artificial as the other. The only difference is that in one environment the simulation is,Paragraph
"glorified, whereas in the other it is repressed or hidden.",Paragraph

"ANDO, TADAO 1941-",Title
"Architect, Japan",Title
"Tadao Ando, one of the most important contemporary Japanese architects, has pursued",Paragraph
what he calls an architecture that moves people with its poetic and creative power. His,Paragraph
"numerous buildings yield intensely meaningful and didactic experiences. In so doing,",Paragraph
Ando has engaged the discipline in the core philosophical questions on humanistic,Paragraph
"values, such as the end and purpose of creativity, or what architecture can contribute to",Paragraph
improve the quality of human existence. To study his architecture is to examine how,Paragraph
architecture can conceivably enhance the world as a humanistic discipline.,Paragraph
"On the tangible level, Ando’s works may be characterized by their primary walls,",Paragraph
"constructed out of limited materials and composed of purely geometric forms. Raw,",Paragraph
unfinished reinforced concrete has been Ando’s material of choice since his earliest,Paragraph
"years; later he added a shorter list of wooden buildings. These rather reductive methods,",Paragraph
"however, should never be taken to demonstrate a lack of intention, nor do they result in",Paragraph
"poor spatial qualities; instead, they are the consequence of Ando’s willful determination",Paragraph
"to stage, though intangible they may be, rich architectural experiences. Ando’s simple",Paragraph
"materials and forms engage a viewer in an appreciation of architecture, making the piece",Paragraph
significant to that person. Ando is therefore in no respect a formalist—his interest in the,Paragraph
tangible stems solely from his much deeper concern for their ontological relation to the,Paragraph
intangible aspects of architecture.,Paragraph
Ando’s decision to limit his materials and forms comes from the belief that their,Paragraph
"intrinsic natures heighten the viewer’s experience of buildings, especially when they",Paragraph
"reveal their utmost state of existence. Therefore, Ando compares himself to the poet who",Paragraph
chooses words carefully and gives them the most appropriate forms of expression. Ando,Paragraph
"is keenly interested in and highly knowledgeable about building materials. Once, in the",Paragraph
"early 1980s, Ando joined other sculptors, industrial designers, and architects in an",Paragraph
"exhibition, held in Tokyo, of objects made out of glass. Ando’s entry, nothing but",Paragraph
"numerous sheets of glass laid horizontally on top of one another, brought to the viewer’s",Paragraph
"attention the intrinsic nature of float glass. Produced by pouring liquid glass on a flat bed,",Paragraph
ordinary float glass inevitably has minute irregularities on the upper-side surface.,Paragraph
"Compiling such sheets magnifies the irregularities, eventually causing them to shatter.",Paragraph
Ando’s project celebrated almost perfect sheets that withstood the challenge and quietly,Paragraph
acknowledged the great care the manufacturer took in producing them.,Paragraph
It is also in building projects that Ando reveals the material’s properties to the physical,Paragraph
extreme with a high degree of care. The intention is to present the materials in their,Paragraph
"utmost essence. In fact, Ando believes that the more austere his wall, the more it speaks",Paragraph
to mankind. Ando’s specification of hard concrete mixture stirred up the Japanese,Paragraph
"building industry in 1970s, when both contractors and architects were used to the norm of",Paragraph
much softer mixes for the sake of its easy distribution into the forms. The specification,Paragraph
"demanded Ando’s attentive supervision, apt instruction, and even some on-site",Paragraph
demonstration—he is said to have tapped the wooden panels incessantly while concrete,Paragraph
"was being poured. Once constructed, however, the walls were worthy of a critical gaze",Paragraph
and required no finishing materials that would ordinarily hide the faults of construction.,Paragraph
Ando’s efforts to provide an intense architectural experience rest not only with,Paragraph
materials but also with building form and open space. As one becomes familiar with,Paragraph
"Ando’s floor plans, one recognizes in them the persistent recurrence of pure geometry.",Paragraph
"However, once inside his building, a visitor is confronted with an enriched sequence of",Paragraph
spatial experiences rather than a mere confirmation of simple forms. The ultimate goal is,Paragraph
to draw attention to the space’s architectural qualities. Ando once commented that an,Paragraph
unexpected experience generates a stronger impression and elevates man’s spirit. In such,Paragraph
"an experience, geometry is no longer an abstract factor but instead serves to generate the",Paragraph
real human existence.,Paragraph
Ando’s interests in the spatial sequence led him to explore the potential significance of,Paragraph
"vertical circulation. A staircase is, in the utilitarian sense, nothing but the means to",Paragraph
"traverse between different floor levels. With Ando, ascending and descending become",Paragraph
"almost a spiritual opportunity of preparation before entering a place of religion, as in the",Paragraph
"Water Temple (1991) on Awaji Island. Or, as in the Oyamazaki Villa Museum (1996) in",Paragraph
"Kyoto, ascension is an awakening experience of one’s body while discovering the",Paragraph
"daylight reflected delicately on each step’s rounded nose, which in turn draws attention to",Paragraph
"the cascading waterfall just outside, which shines similarly under the sun.",Paragraph
The simplicity and purity of form and materials also support what Ando has called the,Paragraph
"nature—in particular, light, air, and water—of his architecture. Ando once commented",Paragraph
"that architecture should not be loud but rather that it should let nature, in the guise of",Paragraph
"sunlight and wind, speak. His concrete wall captures on its surface an ever-changing",Paragraph
"pattern of light and shadow. In return, the austere surface of the wall is enlivened, made",Paragraph
"rich with character. When his concrete walls, taller than eye level, bound a space, as in",Paragraph
"the Vitra Seminar House (1993) in Weilam-Rhein, Germany, the observer’s attention is",Paragraph
"naturally drawn to the sky, both visually and spatially. When an opening is made in a",Paragraph
"wall at floor level, as in a number of residential buildings, the sight is directed",Paragraph
"specifically to the pebbled or grassed ground outside. A vertical sheet of water, as in the",Paragraph
"Forest of Tombs Museum (1992) in Kumamoto, or a serene horizontal surface of water,",Paragraph
"as in the Church on the Water (1998) in Hokkaido, could be waiting to fill the viewer’s",Paragraph
"hearing or vision. In these settings, man is in an immediate confrontation with nature,",Paragraph
with only Ando’s architecture serving as a mediator.,Paragraph
Ando has acknowledged that the way he brings nature into architecture could require,Paragraph
"some severe living conditions. For example, in Row House Sumiyoshi (1976) in Osaka,",Paragraph
the residents are faced with every element of weather each time they pass the courtyard,Paragraph
on the way from one room to another. Ando’s rather forceful mediation between man and,Paragraph
nature is not always without criticism. Some critics have commented that it leads to a,Paragraph
"spatial impoverishment. On the contrary, however, Ando believes that a close",Paragraph
"confrontation with nature is crucial for the enrichment of man’s life, which makes man",Paragraph
keenly aware of the season and which nurtures within man a finer sensitivity. This,Paragraph
insistence on austerity and severity reflects his critical stance against modern society’s,Paragraph
"materialistic way of life. In this regard, Ando has taken a critical stance against the",Paragraph
modern ways of living that may be materialistically rich and yet spiritually impoverished.,Paragraph
He has made incessant inquiries as to what enriches an individual’s life in the,Paragraph
contemporary age. He considers it critical to discover through his architectural works,Paragraph
what is essential to human life. Ando believes that abundance does not necessarily enrich,Paragraph
one’s life and instead thinks that an architectural space stripped of all excess and,Paragraph
composed simply from bare necessities is true and convincing because it is appropriate,Paragraph
"and satisfying. In this understanding of the human conditions, Ando’s architecture",Paragraph
constitutes a challenge to contemporary civilization.,Paragraph
"Just as Ando is suspicious of the materialistic view of life, he is equally doubtful about",Paragraph
what many modern and contemporary architects have taken to be an unquestionable goal:,Paragraph
"timeliness of design. Rather, Ando’s is a quest for the essence that allows architecture to",Paragraph
"endure the test of time. In the same regard, Ando is in a constant search for the kind of",Paragraph
architectural heritages that have withstood various conditions of both time and place.,Paragraph
"Ando’s attitude toward architectural heritage should, however, be distinguished from the",Paragraph
"Postmodern regionalism in which traditional forms are replicated by modern, universally",Paragraph
"available industrial materials and technology, to which Ando is not at all sympathetic. A",Paragraph
pseudo-authentic application is for him not a pursuit of the material’s intrinsic potential,Paragraph
and therefore not essentially architectural.,Paragraph
Ando’s desire to scrutinize the time-earned architectural heritage and to appropriate it,Paragraph
"in his projects makes his practice critically cross-cultural. On the one hand, Ando is not",Paragraph
"hesitant to draw both from his native Japanese and from other, especially Western,",Paragraph
"traditions. On the other hand, his reference to the heritage is always based on the critical",Paragraph
and creative appropriation that often brings the heritage one step beyond its traditional,Paragraph
"boundaries. For example, it is not at all difficult to discern a Vitruvian ideal with four",Paragraph
"equilateral triangles in his temporary theater, Kara-za in Tokyo (1988). Ando chose the",Paragraph
dodecagon because of a certain order and perfection that the human mind tends to find in,Paragraph
the number 12. This also referred to the 12-year cycle of the Eastern calendar and the 12,Paragraph
"months of the Western year. Then Vitruvius’s recommendation is, for Ando, not",Paragraph
"restricted to the West but rather is cross-culturally human. For Ando, the dodecagon is",Paragraph
the most appropriate form to give to the project in which theatrical events represent a,Paragraph
construction of a temporary microcosm.,Paragraph
"With Ando’s Church of the Light (1989), a cross becomes more than a Christian",Paragraph
"symbol. Instead, a vertical and horizontal linear opening in the otherwise solid concrete",Paragraph
wall is a void at the end of the space. It embodies the sense of time and space beyond,Paragraph
"reach, so appropriate for religious contemplation. It encourages a respect for the past, a",Paragraph
"commitment to the future, and a trust in the universal applicability and effectiveness of",Paragraph
one’s,Title
"Modern Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas, designed by Tadao Ando",Caption
(2002),Title
© Mary Ann Sullivan,Title
"particular religious activity, which in turn is limited by its place and time.",Paragraph
Ando has an extraordinary background as an architect. He did not receive any formal,Paragraph
"architectural education, nor did he apprentice in an office. As for career preparation,",Paragraph
"Ando often refers to the study tours he made on his own and the books he read, including",Paragraph
"Le Corbusier’s oeuvre, during the period between 1962 and 1969, before he opened his",Paragraph
"architectural office in Osaka. This specific location was also somewhat out of ordinary,",Paragraph
"for many well-known, well-established architects are in Tokyo, by far Japan’s largest",Paragraph
center of economic activity. Because of this and because of the strong regional accent in,Paragraph
"his Japanese, Ando had often compared himself to a stray warrier, half mockingly and",Paragraph
"half proudly. His is the proof that still, in the economically driven contemporary",Paragraph
"societies, architecture can provide a spiritual and even sacred dimension of the human",Paragraph
existence.,Paragraph
Although his early practice was limited primarily to residences and smal! commercial,Paragraph
"building in the nearby regions of his office, Ando gradually gained domestic and",Paragraph
international acclaim and extended his practice to cultural and religious institutions. Ando,Paragraph
"has received virtually every award there is for an architect, including the Annual Prize",Paragraph

APARTMENT BUILDING,Title
Population growth and the increasing density of cities created a housing crisis in the 20th,Paragraph
century. The apartment building emerged as a solution for housing large numbers of,Paragraph
"people in small areas. Although a preexisting type, during the 20th century the",Paragraph
development of the apartment building dramatically reshaped the built environment of,Paragraph
cities and their surrounding suburbs. Apartment buildings developed in locations,Paragraph
convenient to transportation networks and services that encouraged dense residential land,Paragraph
use. The increase in apartment living subsequently inspired continued international,Paragraph
dissemination of the modern apartment building type.,Paragraph
An apartment building contains multiple dwelling units of one or more rooms. Other,Paragraph
basic aspects of the 20th-century apartment building’s program are a bathroom and,Paragraph
"kitchen for each unit and the provision of heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and other",Paragraph
"systems. As with other commercial building types, efficient use of space is integral to",Paragraph
good apartment building design. Public areas of the apartment building are normally,Paragraph
"minimal, with a small lobby and laundry room or, in more luxurious examples, a roof",Paragraph
"deck, recreation room, or swimming pool. All apartment buildings share the basic",Paragraph
"function of providing shelter for numerous household groups, but the features and",Paragraph
"appointments of a building can vary greatly, depending on the socioeconomic level of the",Paragraph
intended residents. Apartment buildings need to balance efficiency with comfort; this,Paragraph
"requirement is challenging, especially when building for low-income tenants.",Paragraph
"In the early 20th century, most architecturally notable apartment buildings were",Paragraph
intended for upper-class tenants. Living in a full-service apartment building could,Paragraph
provide a luxurious home at much smaller cost than maintaining a single-family house.,Paragraph
Rising land values in many cities made sole ownership prohibitively expensive even for,Paragraph
the relatively well off. Use of Classical Revival and Italian Renaissance Revival,Paragraph
"decorative modes was prevalent, as evidenced by the lavish examples built in cities such",Paragraph

historical styles in apartment building design indicated the fashionable design mode for,Paragraph
most commercial and domestic structures during the early part of the century.,Paragraph
"For low- and middle-income tenants, apartment building design was characterized by",Paragraph
tension between aesthetics and economic viability. Tenement house design frequently,Paragraph
"sacrificed aesthetic and sanitary concerns to create a profitable investment. By the 1920s,",Paragraph
apartment buildings were integral to the international debate over housing and social,Paragraph
reform. European avantgarde architects used the apartment building type to explore the,Paragraph
potential of modernism and prefabricated structural systems for providing affordable,Paragraph
worker housing. Government sponsorship of housing projects provided important,Paragraph
opportunities for architectural experimentation not available in the commercial real estate,Paragraph
market of the United States despite housing reform efforts. The housing policy of the,Paragraph
"Weimar Republic generated pioneering modern apartment buildings for German cities,",Paragraph
"such as Breslau, Hamburg, Celle, Berlin, and Frankfurt. Another example is J.J.P.Oud’s",Paragraph
"Kiefhoek housing (1925), an International Style garden apartment complex built in",Paragraph
Rotterdam. Both the garden apartment and the high-rise form of the apartment building,Paragraph
were explored by architects throughout the mid-20th century. A key high-rise example in,Paragraph
"London is Highpoint I (1933-35), designed by Berthold Lubetkin and Tecton.",Paragraph
These two primary apartment building forms—the mainly urban high-rise and the,Paragraph
suburban garden apartment—became internationally prevalent by the 1930s. High-rise,Paragraph

"Archigram is both a group of British architects and their architectural periodical,",Paragraph
"which gave the group its name. Between 1960 and 1972, Archigram published nine",Paragraph
"issues of the periodical, staged exhibitions and conferences, and devised a number of",Paragraph
"influential architectural projects. Founded by Peter Cook (1936-), the group consisted of",Paragraph
"Cook, David Greene (1937-), Mike Webb (1937-), Warren Chalk (1927-88), Dennis",Title
"Crompton (1935-), and Ron Herron (1930-94). Their avantgarde architecture rejected",Paragraph
"heroic modernism in favor of expendable, variable, and often mobile combinations of",Paragraph
component units plugged into superstructures. Although Archigram gained worldwide,Paragraph
"recognition, their Utopian project owed much to the intense architectural debate",Paragraph
fermented by the massive rebuilding projects of postwar Britain. The group drew on,Paragraph
"eclectic sources, including R.Buckminster Fuller, the Independent Group, Reyner",Paragraph
"Banham, comic books, science fiction, consumer imagery, and contemporary technology,",Paragraph
"such as the satellite, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s mobile",Paragraph
"launch towers, and the more modest Airstream trailer.",Paragraph
"In late 1960, Cook, Greene, and Webb began meeting in an effort to perpetuate the",Paragraph

around the notion of individual capsules that clipped onto or plugged into a structural,Paragraph
"framework. These capsules were mobile, expendable, and responsive to human desires,",Paragraph
"thereby embodying Archigram’s central concerns. Cook’s Entertainments Tower (1963),",Paragraph

ARCHITECTURAL DRAWING,Title
"In the 20th century and throughout the history of the discipline, drawing has been the",Paragraph
dominant means of architectural communication and is considered to be the “language”,Paragraph
"of architecture. Through drawings, an architect can record new ideas, concepts, and even",Paragraph
visionary projects in addition to projects intended for construction. To facilitate this,Paragraph
"communication, a number of drawing conventions have evolved.",Paragraph
Orthographic Projections,Title
The most commonly used projective drawing in 20th-century architectural practice is the,Paragraph
"orthographic projection. The primary orthographic projections are plan, section, and",Paragraph
elevation views in which the observer’s line of sight is perpendicular to both the drawing,Paragraph
plane and the surfaces of the building viewed and in which the drawing surface is parallel,Paragraph
to the principal surfaces of the building. The floor plan and building section are both,Paragraph
"sections, or cuts. The floor plan, a sectional view looking down after a horizontal plane,",Paragraph
"cut through the building with the top section removed, typically shows the location of",Paragraph
major vertical elements and all door and window openings. Building sections are,Paragraph
transverse or cross sections or longitudinal. A transverse section is created by cutting at,Paragraph
"right angles to the long axis, and conversely, a longitudinal section is an orthographic",Paragraph
projection made by cutting at right angles to the shorter axis. Elevations are drawings of,Paragraph
"the exterior of a building and are labeled north, south, east, or west for the direction from",Paragraph
which you see it (which is also the direction it faces). As no single orthographic,Paragraph
"projection can communicate all aspects of a threedimensional object, the drawings must",Paragraph
be considered as a series of related views. The advantage of an orthographic projection is,Paragraph
that the faces of an object parallel to the drawing surface are represented without,Paragraph
"distortion or foreshortening, retaining their true size to scale, their shape, and their",Paragraph
proportion.,Paragraph
Pictorial Projections,Title
This type of drawing shows the three dimensions of a building simultaneously. They are,Paragraph
generally divided into parallel and perspective drawings. The most common parallel,Paragraph
drawings are oblique and isometric. Oblique projections can be further subdivided into,Paragraph
"plan and elevation oblique projections. The plan oblique, or axonometric, is the most",Paragraph
popular of the parallel (or paraline) drawings. A scale drawing of the plan is tilted at,Paragraph
either a 45-degree angle giving equal views of two perpendicular planes or a 30/60-,Paragraph
degree angle giving emphasis to one plane over the other. All lines parallel to the three,Paragraph
main axes are drawn to scale.,Paragraph
Perspective drawings employ various techniques for representing three-dimensional,Paragraph
objects on a two-dimensional surface in a more realistic manner than paraline drawings.,Paragraph
All points of the object are projected to a picture plane by straight lines converging at an,Paragraph
"arbitrary fixed point. In a one-point perspective, a principal face of the object is parallel",Paragraph
"to the picture plane. Vertical lines remain vertical, horizontal lines remain horizontal, and",Paragraph
lines perpendicular to the picture plane converge on a vanishing point. In two-point,Paragraph
"perspective, vertical lines remain vertical and both sets of horizontal lines converge on",Paragraph
their own vanishing points.,Paragraph
"At different points in the 20th century, preferences for various drawing types and",Paragraph
rendering techniques have been inextricably linked with artistic movements. The birth of,Paragraph
the Modern Movement early in the century and the influence of Cubism resulted in the,Paragraph
rejection of architectural perspective drawing in favor of the more analytical and,Paragraph
"objective axonometric plan projections, which were considered more appropriate for an",Paragraph
"architecture cubic in nature and devoid of ornamentation. In fact, several movements in",Paragraph
the first half of the century were known primarily through the production and circulation,Paragraph
of architectural drawings and not as a result of built works. The break with tradition that,Paragraph
characterized Modernism was also evident in the graphic representation of the movement.,Paragraph
One of the early 20th-century movements that was expressed primarily through,Paragraph
"drawings was Futurism. The theoretical focus of Futurism, the Italian architectural",Paragraph
"movement founded in 1909 by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti (1876-1944), was made",Paragraph
"manifest through graphic representations of industrial buildings, skyscrapers, and",Paragraph
"Utopian visions of the city of the future. These images glorified technology, machines,",Paragraph
"speed, dynamism, and movement. The fact that drawings of futuristic cities by architects",Paragraph
such as Antonio Sant’Elia (1888-1916) do not include plans underscores the notion that,Paragraph
they were never intended for construction.,Paragraph
Architects of the De Stijl movement (1917-28) relied heavily on the use of,Paragraph
axonometric projections to illustrate the development of spaces. The antihistorical,Paragraph
"movement advocated a clarity of expression through the use of straight lines,",Paragraph
"decomposed cubes, pure planes, right angles, and primary colors. These qualities were",Paragraph
"effectively represented in the orthographic projections, which were repeatedly published",Paragraph
and exhibited.,Paragraph
"Similarly, Russian avant-garde architecture of the revolutionary era (1917-34) is",Paragraph
"known principally through drawings of work that, in many cases, was neither structurally",Paragraph
viable nor ever intended for construction. The new relationship between architecture and,Paragraph
the plastic arts that was central to De Stijl was also prevalent in the Russian architectural,Paragraph
drawings. The formal language of the architecture followed explorations in the fine arts.,Paragraph
Visionary drawings by Iakov Chernikov (1889-1951) celebrated technology and,Paragraph
demonstrated the possibilities of constructivist design to contemporary and subsequent,Paragraph
generations of architects.,Paragraph
"The Expressionist movement, affected by unstable conditions in Germany after the",Paragraph
"First World War, is characterized by drawings that emphasize force and massiveness.",Paragraph
"Buildings were conceived in terms of volume, and drawings by Erich Mendelsohn",Paragraph
(1887-1953) and others were devoid of the detail found in earlier architectural,Paragraph
representation.,Paragraph
In 1975 an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York of drawings from,Paragraph
the archives of the Ecole des BeauxArts exposed a new generation of architects and,Paragraph
designers to the meticulous watercolor renderings that had been supplanted earlier in the,Paragraph
century by axonometric projections. The contemporary Postmodern once again used,Paragraph
historical forms as a source of design inspiration and the movement was characterized by,Paragraph
"a resurgence in the Beaux- Arts style of rendering and the architectural drawing, as",Paragraph
became important in its own right removed from the context of built work.,Paragraph
"With the advent of Deconstruction late in the 20th century, the language of technology",Paragraph
"was concerned with breaking, splintering, diagonal overlapping, and superimposition of",Paragraph
"elements, and again, as in previous periods, these formal aspects of the architecture were",Paragraph
reflected in the drawings of architects such as Bernard Tschumi (1944-).,Paragraph
"Undoubtedly, the method of graphic representation that will have the greatest",Paragraph
influence on the future generation of architects is that involving the use of the computer.,Paragraph
"Computer-aided design, three-dimensional modeling, and programs allowing a client to",Paragraph
“walk through” a space that does not yet exist in reality are revolutionizing the way in,Paragraph
which architects conceive of and represent space. Computers have transformed the design,Paragraph
process into one of continuous and nearly limitless experimentation.,Paragraph

ARCHITECTURAL PHOTOGRAPHY,Title
"At the turn of the 20th century, architectural photography was just emerging as a subfield",Paragraph
of photography and ever since has affected the practice of architecture and its,Paragraph
representation. Governments and organizations made accurate photographic records of,Paragraph
"historic buildings, whereas architects found the photograph to be the perfect medium for",Paragraph
sharing their exotic travels with colleagues. Today architectural photography is its own,Paragraph
"industry, an inseparable part of the architectural profession and the primary vehicle",Paragraph
through which the public receives information about the built world.,Paragraph
The century began with a type of architectural photography very different from the,Paragraph
precision-obsessed documentary style of the 1870s and 1880s. These new photographs,Paragraph
"gave viewers much less detail about the architecture, instead preferring to elicit an",Paragraph
"emotive response about the atmosphere of a place. The work of the “Photo-Secession,” a",Paragraph
"group led by Alfred Stieglitz (1864-1946), characterizes this approach.",Paragraph
"As a result of this expanding definition of photography, new equipment, such as",Paragraph
"lighter, faster lenses and smaller, handheld cameras, started to appear. Travel",Paragraph
photographs by Le Corbusier illustrate the spontaneous aesthetic of easier-to-use,Paragraph
"equipment. Similarly, the snapshots by architect Erich Mendelsohn and others, compiled",Paragraph
"in a publication titled (1925, rev. 1928), were taken from nontraditional angles, featured",Paragraph
"people, and considered a wide range of vernacular subjects in an attempt to describe the",Paragraph
architect’s physical and conceptual impressions of the United States.,Paragraph
It was in the late 1930s that the history of architectural photography made a dramatic,Paragraph
"shift. Until this time, although many photographers excelled at making images of",Paragraph
"architecture, no one had yet dedicated their entire career to this task. Like Margaret",Paragraph
"Bourke-White (1904-71), whose powerful 1936 photograph titled “Fort Peck Dam,",Paragraph
"Montana” appeared on the first cover of magazine, some photographers worked as",Paragraph
"journalists for a variety of publications. Others, such as Berenice Abbott (1898-1991),",Paragraph
"who spent years photographing New York for the Federal Art Project, eventually moved",Paragraph
"on to other subjects. Toward the end of the decade, however, there appeared professional",Paragraph
"architectural photographers whose only business was to make photographs of buildings,",Paragraph
primarily for use in publications and by architects as marketing tools.,Paragraph
Magazines and journals produced internationally in major cities were quick to include,Paragraph
architectural photographs with their articles. These mass-produced images circulated,Paragraph
"widely in magazines such as and to name only two, and kept clients and the",Paragraph
"profession informed of new trends, emerging architects, award-winning designs, and",Paragraph
"buildings that were important at local, regional, national, and international levels. With",Paragraph
the emergence of architectural history as an academic discipline in the 19th and 20th,Paragraph
"centuries, the important history texts illustrated the canonic works of architecture with",Paragraph
photographs that in some cases would become iconic representations of famous,Paragraph
buildings.,Paragraph
It is not coincidental that the International Style gained popularity and influence at the,Paragraph
same time that a few talented photographers started to specialize in architectural images.,Paragraph
"Among the many factors that contributed to this, two are particularly noteworthy. The",Paragraph
"first is that, generally speaking, the representation of modern architecture was inherently",Paragraph
well suited to the formal language of modernism. Photography seemed well suited to,Paragraph
showing either layered planes or the subtle lights and darks of curved surfaces. Because,Paragraph
"color had not yet become the standard, black-and-white photography’s emphasis on tone",Paragraph
and depth worked well with modern architecture’s use of translucent materials and,Paragraph
"interest in space. Moreover, photography’s ability to isolate a single viewpoint provided",Paragraph
endless possibilities for abstract compositions. Some historians argue that the widespread,Paragraph
acceptance of black-and-white photography in the early days of the International Style,Paragraph
encouraged and perpetuated the movement’s monochromatic aesthetic. Photography,Paragraph
surely served to distribute the movement’s imagery and ideals to an international,Paragraph
audience.,Paragraph
A second factor appearing simultaneously with modernism and_ professional,Paragraph
architectural photography was the rising status of commercialism in society. Editors and,Paragraph
"advertisers hungered for images of modern life, giving rise, particularly after World War",Paragraph
"IL, to an immense market for architectural photographs that could be serviced only by a",Paragraph
"new group of specialized photographers. In the United States, this was particularly true of",Paragraph
"photographs of the “American dream home,” which were in high demand and resembled",Paragraph
fashion photographs in style and attitude. The potential for images to become marketing,Paragraph
"tools for architecture as a whole was recognized by Walter Gropius, Frank Lloyd Wright,",Paragraph
"and others, who immediately used architectural photography to promote their ideas.",Paragraph
Several figures of the architectural photography community emerged in the late 1930s,Paragraph
"and early 1940s, including Ezra Stoller (1915-) and Julius Shulman (1910). The first",Paragraph
"well-known architectural photography firm, Hedrich-Blessing, also came about during",Paragraph
"this period. Begun in Chicago by Ken Hedrich (1908-72), Hedrich-Blessing has been",Paragraph
"known for dramatic composition, a high level of craftsmanship, and an understanding of",Paragraph
architects’ need for marketable images.,Paragraph
The introduction of color photography in the 1960s and 1970s presented challenges,Paragraph
and opportunities that earlier photographers had not encountered. In addition to an,Paragraph
"image’s formal composition and the craftsmanship of the final product, photographers",Paragraph
now had to consider the color of every element that fell within the photograph’s,Paragraph
"boundaries. This was made more complicated by the nature of color film, which is slower",Paragraph
"than black-and-white film and sensitive to differences between daylight, incandescent,",Paragraph
"and other types of light. Despite the technical difficulties, color photography became very",Paragraph
"popular among architects and publications because it provided a new, important layer of",Paragraph
information. Two photographs by Richard Bryant (1947-) illustrate how color,Paragraph
photography has been used effectively. In his 1983 photograph of the Camden Town TV-,Paragraph
"am Building, the slower film speed records an object emitting light passing across the",Paragraph
bottom-left corner of the frame as a zigzag line of light that becomes the photograph’s,Paragraph
"only suggestion of life or movement. More recent photographers, such as Norman",Paragraph
"McGrath (1931-), Tim Street-Porter (1939-), Timothy Hursley (1955-), Cervin Robinson",Paragraph
"(1928-), and Yukio Futagawa (1932-), have spent much of their careers in the age of",Paragraph
color photography.,Paragraph
"Today, architectural photography, particularly in color, has also become the dominant",Paragraph
mode of architectural representation in publications. This is because it is perceived as,Paragraph
"more accurate and immediate than sketches or renderings. However, with the increasing",Paragraph

"Arcosanti, found in the desert of Arizona, is a prototype urban development by the",Paragraph
visionary architect and planner Paolo Soleri. The site is an experimental “urban,Paragraph
"laboratory” where Soleri applies his ideas concerning architecture, ecology, and urban",Paragraph
"planning. Born on 21 June 1919 in Turin, Italy, Soleri, shortly after completing Ph.D.",Paragraph
"studies in architecture at the Turin Politecnico in 1946, joined Frank Lloyd Wright at",Paragraph
"Taliesin in Spring Green, Wisconsin, and at Taliesin West in Scottsdale, Arizona, with a",Paragraph
fellowship for 16 months. He immigrated to the United States in 1955 and by 1970 had,Paragraph
completed designs for some 30 “arcologies.”,Paragraph
Soleri uses the term “arcology’ for alternative urban habitats (architecture and,Paragraph
ecology). Arcologies are high-density structures that will be capable of containing close,Paragraph
"to six million inhabitants. Arcosanti is the 13th of these arcologies, and it was the most",Paragraph
"feasible to build. It is a laboratory for a community that conserves energy, land, and raw",Paragraph
"materials and is composed of studios, apartments, a swimming pool, a restaurant, cultural",Paragraph
"facilities, a casting workshop, a community farm, a sewage pond, and greenhouses.",Paragraph
"Soleri, beginning construction at Arcosanti in 1970, has increased the initial projection",Paragraph
"of 1,500 inhabitants to 5,000. It is built on the south slope of a canyon on an 860-acre site",Paragraph
"at Cordes Junction. Arcosanti lies approximately 65 miles north of Scottsdale, where in",Paragraph
"1956 Soleri had begun constructing Cosanti, a nonprofit educational foundation.",Paragraph
"Cosanti was built on five acres of land, and it is where Soleri began his experiments in",Paragraph
concrete-casting techniques that were later to be applied at a larger scale at Arcosanti.,Paragraph
Experiments have also been carried out on surface decorations and moldings at Arcosanti,Paragraph
as well as the construction of large vaults and solar apses. Silt from streambeds on the,Paragraph
"site was used to create forms for sections of vaults, cast-in-place vaulting, and the precast",Paragraph
wall panels. Silt is used as a parting agent and can be easily carved to produce ribs where,Paragraph
needed. Coloring matter then is applied over the silt and adheres to the concrete along,Paragraph
with some of the silt to create various shades of color and texture. Linoleum sheets are,Paragraph
used for large areas when silt carving is inefficient. They are cut to predetermined shapes,Paragraph
and used to create indentations and transfer color to the concrete. The use of ordinary,Paragraph
"wood formwork is used for the pouring of foundations, columns, beams, and slabs. There",Paragraph
"are a few floor slabs where silt is used on top of the formwork to create curved, ribbed",Paragraph
undersides.,Paragraph
Soleri has designed advanced solar systems in building structures with assistance from,Paragraph
"the University of Arizona. At Cosanti, Soleri also began creating his ceramic wind-bells.",Paragraph
This effort eventually led to the creation of a foundry and workshop on its site for casting,Paragraph
"metal bells. The Soleri bells soon became the main income source for Cosanti and, later,",Paragraph
Arcosanti.,Paragraph
"There are more than 50,000 annual visitors to Arcosanti who may participate in",Paragraph
workshops and conferences or tour the grounds. The main builders of Arcosanti have,Paragraph
"been mainly volunteers, summer student apprentices, and a few employed workers.",Paragraph
"The urban planning at Arcosanti takes its stand against suburban sprawl, which Soleri",Paragraph
sees as an extremely destructive force. As an alternative to spread-out cities and suburban,Paragraph
"sprawl, Arcosanti is based on a miniaturization of elements into large urban structures.",Paragraph
"To Soleri, energy problems are largely the result of suburban sprawl and the use of the",Paragraph
"automobile. It is avoiding the use of automobiles and creating a series of ministructures,",Paragraph
"not megastructures, that Soleri believes will help create a better prototype for urban",Paragraph
dwelling.,Paragraph
It is Soleri’s notion that cities are vital but that contemporary cities tend to isolate,Paragraph
people from one another and to have transportation systems that are cumbersome and,Paragraph
"polluting. Cities also tend to segregate people on the basis of age, race, ethnicity,",Paragraph
"occupation, and wealth as well as to create problems such as natural resource depletion,",Paragraph
"food scarcity, and a depletion of the quality of life. Arcosanti is designed to include the",Paragraph
"positive attributes of an urban environment, such as human interaction, and availability of",Paragraph
consumer goods and services along with integrating these urban qualities in an interaction,Paragraph
"with the surrounding desert. When completed, Arcosanti will be 25 stories high. With a",Paragraph
"footprint that covers 15 acres of the 860-acre site, it will represent one of the highest",Paragraph
population densities ever known.,Paragraph
The architectural historian Hanno-Walter Kruft claims in (1994) that Arcosanti,Paragraph
explores an alternative to the functionalist and technologist concerns within architecture,Paragraph
"occurring in the United States at the time of its inception. According to Kruft, Arcosanti",Paragraph
is a “transtechnological” Utopian city in which Soleri believes that by improving social,Paragraph
"conditions, humankind’s genetic structure would also be improved (p. 439). Like many",Paragraph
"modernists, Soleri believes in the morality of architecture: better living conditions",Paragraph
"produce better humans. However, following the philosopher Teilhard de Chardin, Soleri",Paragraph
extends this to include humankind’s genetic composition as being effected by better,Paragraph
"living conditions. The architectural historian Charles Jencks, in (1982), stated that in",Paragraph
"the early 1970s, Soleri’s Arcosanti presented a “highly saturated superurbanism” that",Paragraph
differed from many counter-cultural movements of the time that emphasized a movement,Paragraph
away from the urban environment (p. 284). Jencks also described Soleri as a late,Paragraph
modernist having similarity with Luis Barragan and John Hejduk in his emphasis on pure,Paragraph
sculptural form (p. 178).,Paragraph

"In Argentina, modernization was implemented by conservative political powers. The",Paragraph

renaissance. The search for authentic cultural roots and a national style was the first,Paragraph
attempt to examine architectural patrimony and to systematically preserve local culture.,Paragraph
The first part of the 20th century was also characterized by other reactions against,Paragraph
Beaux-Arts and academic canons. Art Nouveau appeared through varied manifestations,Paragraph
including Catalan modernism in Rosario by Francisco Roca Simo and in Buenos Aires by,Paragraph
Julian Garcia Nufiez with the notable Spanish Hospital (1906). Other architects who,Paragraph
"embraced Italian influences include Mario Palanti, Francisco Gianotti, and Virgilio",Paragraph
Colombo.,Paragraph
The 1925 International Exhibition of Decorative Arts in Paris signaled a shift in taste,Paragraph

Argentina also manifests some of the earliest critiques of modernist stylization. The,Paragraph
"Austral Group, in its manifesto (1939), declared that “present architecture is in a",Paragraph
critical moment and lacking the spirit of the initiators.” The group denounced the use of,Paragraph
academicism and so-called narrow-minded functionalism. The Austral Group was,Paragraph
"composed of Bonet, Ferrari Hardoy, Kurchan, Le Pera, Ungar, and Zalba. Representative",Paragraph
of the manifesto’s position are the ateliers and housing for artists (1939) in Buenos Aires,Paragraph

"vaults, rich materials, and tectonic variations.",Paragraph
"In the 1940s, Peron initiated a plan of industrial production for Argentina. World War",Paragraph
"II promoted the industrial development of the country, and architecture became oriented",Paragraph
"toward social welfare. Public work was directed to the areas of education, housing, and",Paragraph
health. It was only after World War II that International Style modernism gained,Paragraph

"Although historians may question the extent, chronologically and geographically, as",Paragraph

"historicism so dominant during the 19th century, using as inspiration Nature in all its",Paragraph

"color and an aspiration to refine and elevate the material world; third, a determination to",Paragraph
"erase the distinction between the fine and the applied arts, between the designer and the",Paragraph

"materials, transforming the character of traditional ones, like stone, stained glass, and",Paragraph
"mosaic, and inventing new uses and shapes for recently developed ones, above all cast",Paragraph
"and wrought iron. In architecture and the decorative arts, there is a heightened",Paragraph
"appreciation of the role of ornament, but ornament that was novel in its formal character",Paragraph
"and was not merely applied to, but integrated with, structure.",Paragraph
"If there were influences from the distant past in time and space, they did not lead to",Paragraph
"the imitative revivals so typical of the 19th century. Although Japanese, Islamic, and",Paragraph
"Javanese art, medieval architecture, and rococo interiors were studied, the lessons learned",Paragraph

ARTS AND CRAFTS MOVEMENT,Title
Although the Arts and Crafts movement dominated England between the years 1860 and,Paragraph
"1915, its effects were felt around the world, especially in Western Europe and the United",Paragraph
"States, well into the 1920s. Artwork associated with the Arts and Crafts movement is",Paragraph
characterized by a handcrafted aesthetic that embodied the principles of its English,Paragraph
"founders: C.R.Ashbee, W.R. Lethaby, and William Morris, among others. The",Paragraph
philosophy these men advocated centered on their belief that the Industrial Revolution,Paragraph
"had produced substandard goods with little artistic merit. In response to this situation,",Paragraph
they sought to reintroduce handmade products to the arts and to elevate the craftsman to a,Paragraph
more prominent position in the design professions. In refocusing the production of art,Paragraph
"away from machines and toward individual designers, Arts and Crafts leaders hoped to",Paragraph
"reform society by changing the way art was created, patronized, and appreciated in",Paragraph
English society.,Paragraph
"The Arts and Crafts movement promoted the idea of truth in architecture, meaning that",Paragraph
"a building should clearly express its structure, function, and material. An uncluttered",Paragraph
"exterior and interior, without applied decoration to obscure the structure, was considered",Paragraph
"the ideal, partly because the aesthetic was easily achieved without machines. This idea of",Paragraph
truth and clarity in architecture contrasted sharply with the Victorian aesthetic currently,Paragraph
"in vogue in England in which elaborate and ornate decora-tions, usually multicolored and",Paragraph
"machine-made, dominated architectural design. Ashbee, Lethaby, and Morris believed",Paragraph
that Victorian interiors hid truth and clarity from the viewer by obscuring the forms and,Paragraph
"shapes of a building. To this end, the simpler aesthetic of the Arts and Crafts returned",Paragraph
truth to architecture and contrasted with the “false” art created by the machine.,Paragraph
"The idea of a simple aesthetic had regional, national, and historic overtones. Leaders",Paragraph
of the Arts and Crafts movement argued that the corrupted state of artistic production,Paragraph
"resulted from the negative influence of industrialization on Western, particularly English,",Paragraph
"society. Therefore, artistic production could be reformed by reviving methods of art and",Paragraph
"craft that predated the industrial era. As viewed by the Arts and Crafts founders, the",Paragraph
period that best exemplified the preferred mode of artistic production was the age of,Paragraph
English medieval architecture. Not only did English medieval architecture fully embody,Paragraph
"the Arts and Crafts ideal of a simple and truthful aesthetic, but buildings of the style were",Paragraph
"local and easily available for study. Most important, the forms of English medieva.",Paragraph
"structures were already synonymous with the English architectural identity, and therefore",Paragraph
reviving English medieval art and craft promoted the English national identity through,Paragraph
"architectural form. In using English medieval models, Ashbee, Lethaby, and Morris made",Paragraph
direct connections between the past and the present and between the historic and the,Paragraph
modern to make the Arts and Crafts aesthetic pertain directly to England.,Paragraph
The use of English medieval models also embodied the vision of craftsmen working,Paragraph
"for a truthful aesthetic, which Arts and Crafts leaders strenuously advocated. In general,",Paragraph
English medieval structures had been constructed by laborers who worked with hand,Paragraph
"tools to build a collective monument from honest artistic labor. Ashbee, Lethaby, and",Paragraph
"Morris argued that because the work of these craftsmen was not mass-produced, it had",Paragraph
"not been corrupted by the machine. Therefore, English medieval models served as",Paragraph
examples of how the individual craftsman could enhance the design of an aesthetic,Paragraph
masterpiece by ensuring that every part of the design received individual attention and,Paragraph
"that every form was designed and created by hand. Ashbee, Lethaby, and Morris",Paragraph
"envisioned groups of craftsmen, metalworkers, stonecutters, and carpenters working",Paragraph
together toward a finished product that combined a variety of different media. Inspired by,Paragraph
"these medieval models, Arts and Crafts leaders believed that artistic production could",Paragraph
separate itself from the mechanized methods of the Victorian age to create a detailed and,Paragraph
truthful expression of its time and place.,Paragraph
Attention to detail resulted in an idea that was fundamental to the Arts and Crafts,Paragraph
movement: that of a total work of art. The Arts and Crafts aesthetic was not limited to,Paragraph
"any one particular medium; in fact, Ashbee, Lethaby, and Morris argued that all arts",Paragraph
should be used to create a complete effect such that the whole became more than the sum,Paragraph
"of its parts. Every aspect of an Arts and Crafts interior or structure, whether it was art or",Paragraph
"architecture, was considered relevant to the design, and in this way the entire",Paragraph
"environment was subject to consideration by a designer or a design team. To this end,",Paragraph
many Arts and Crafts workers began to experiment with processes that machines had,Paragraph
"performed for decades, and crafts such as fabric dyeing and printing experienced a",Paragraph
renaissance as new methods were investigated and new objects produced.,Paragraph
"Because the Arts and Crafts movement is a movement largely of ideas, it is difficult to",Paragraph
"single out particular designers or works, or to identify particular forms as characteristic of",Paragraph
"the Arts and Crafts style. In terms of architecture, Philip Webb’s Red House, in Upton,",Paragraph
"Kent, commissioned by Morris in 1859, serves as one outstanding example of Arts and",Paragraph
"Crafts architecture in England. Taking its name from its red brick construction, the design",Paragraph
of the Red House avoided all decoration that recalled a direct model and instead followed,Paragraph
"the functional needs of Morris and his family. Murals, wall hangings, tapestries, and",Paragraph
wallpapers together created a homey and medieval ambience through natural motifs that,Paragraph
"included animals, birds, flowers, and trees, all of which were native to the area or to",Paragraph
"England. Designed and crafted by Morris, his wife Jane, Philip Webb, and Morris’s",Paragraph
"friend Dante Gabriel Rosetti, the Red House expressed a relaxed and informal medieval",Paragraph
atmosphere where different artistic media conveyed a total aesthetic.,Paragraph
Arts and Crafts architecture relied on historic local and regional influences,Paragraph
to ensure that each house would wholly be a product of its place. Looking,Paragraph
"back to earlier examples of Scottish domestic architecture, Charles Rennie",Paragraph
"Mackintosh intended his 1903 Hill House, in Helensburgh,",Paragraph
"Dunbartonshire, Scotland, to connect with the Scottish medieval past",Paragraph
"through a re-use of medieval and local forms. Like that at the Red House,",Paragraph
"Hill House’s facade is plain, with limited applied ornament. The exterior",Paragraph
"consisted of smooth stucco with low, protective eaves; deep windows and",Paragraph
porches; and buttresses that were borrowed,Paragraph
"Interior designs of Hill House, Helensburgh, Scotland, designed by",Caption

"from nearby examples of the medieval country church. Inside, Hill House embodied the",Paragraph
same idea of a total work of art in its consideration of all aspects of the space. Dark wood,Paragraph
"shaped in simple and linear forms decorated the walls, while the beams supporting the",Paragraph
"upper stories were left open to view. Handcrafted furniture and plain, white walls created",Paragraph
"a cozy effect, while the lighting filtered through wooden screens and lampshades to warm",Paragraph
the room. Mackintosh’s appreciation for the materials and his honest expression of the,Paragraph
structure through planar forms made Hill House fully represent the goals of the Arts and,Paragraph
Crafts movement.,Paragraph
"The Arts and Crafts movement had greater impact on craft than on architecture, as",Paragraph
craftsmen were encouraged to incorporate many different artistic media into a single,Paragraph
"product. Many Arts and Crafts designers worked in groups or partnerships, with each",Paragraph
"partner specializing in a different process, such as printing or metalwork. Morris’s firm,",Paragraph
"Morris, Marshall, Faulkner and Company, founded by Morris in 1861, serves as an",Paragraph
"excellent example of this diversity, as the firm could produce wallpaper, furniture,",Paragraph
"murals, stained glass, carvings, metalwork, and tapestries. The inclusion of different",Paragraph
artistic media not only added to the overall effect of the Arts and Crafts interior but also,Paragraph
"recalled the idea of a medieval system in which different artists worked together, each",Paragraph
providing an essential and necessary component that enhanced the overall product.,Paragraph
The Arts and Crafts ideology and aesthetic was not limited to English and Scottish,Paragraph
"designers. The reform efforts of Ashbee, Lethaby, Morris, and Mackintosh resonated",Paragraph
"with designers of other nations, many of whom struggled with the issue of artistic",Paragraph
"national identity, the impact of the machine on society, and the economic effect of",Paragraph
"mechanized art. Each nation, however, tended to isolate and incorporate different aspects",Paragraph
of the ideology of the Arts and Crafts movement as they related to each nation’s context.,Paragraph
"In the United States, for example, Morris’s ideas were complemented by the efforts of",Paragraph
"Gustav Stickley, who promoted an agenda similar to Morris’s through his magazine,",Paragraph
"For Stickley, a return to a handcrafted aesthetic not only promoted art and social reform",Paragraph
but also educated the public and provided many with the means to earn their own living.,Paragraph
"Unlike the English Arts and Crafts leaders, Stickley was less concerned with evoking a",Paragraph
"medieval atmosphere in his designs, especially because the medieval did not have a",Paragraph
"connection to the American past. Instead, Stickley argued that the simple Arts and Crafts",Paragraph
aesthetic could enhance the social conditions of the worker. As a result Stickley chose to,Paragraph
harness the power of the machine in favor of the worker rather than at the worker’s,Paragraph
"expense. Ultimately, Stickley’s more famous designs, such as the 1903 Morris chair,",Paragraph
were produced by his own workers using machine technology.,Paragraph

questioning approach to design.,Paragraph
"Having qualified as a civil engineer and with a special interest in reinforced concrete,",Paragraph
"Arup joined the Danish company Christiani and Nielsen in 1922, a company that",Paragraph
designed and built civil engineering structures. He worked in Hamburg before moving to,Paragraph
"their London office, where he became chief designer in 1925.",Paragraph
"With this experience not only in the design but also in the construction of structures,",Paragraph
Arup became increasingly interested in developing a holistic approach to design. His,Paragraph
"particular skill in the use of a new material, reinforced concrete, created opportunities for",Paragraph
him to work with other designers who were committed to the ideals of the Modern,Paragraph
movement. Collaborating with Tecton (a group of young architects in London) and with,Paragraph
"Berthold Lubetkin in particular, Arup was to play an influential role in the design of a",Paragraph
several iconic buildings of the period. The first was the Gorilla House (1933) at the,Paragraph
"London Zoo, followed by the Penguin Pool (1934). Both explored the fluid forms made",Paragraph
possible by using reinforced concrete. He went on to work with Lubetkin on the design of,Paragraph
Highpoint One. This residential building in London was also built in reinforced concrete,Paragraph
but explored the potential of the material to create an eight-story tower.,Paragraph
The construction of Highpoint coincided with Arup’s move in 1934 to join J.L.Kier,Paragraph
"and Company, the contractors who built the scheme. This project was especially",Paragraph
significant because it allowed Arup and Lubetkin to work on a design that required the,Paragraph

C.R.Ashbee was one of the best-known figures of the British Arts and Crafts,Paragraph
"movement. He was born on 17 May 1863 in Spring Grove, Isleworth, on the western",Paragraph
fringe of London. Ashbee attended Wellington College from 1877 to 1882 and graduated,Paragraph
"from King’s College, Cambridge, in 1886. At King’s College, Ashbee became exposed to",Paragraph
"the thoughts of Ruskin, which were to influence his lifelong commitment to the Arts and",Paragraph
Crafts. Among Ashbee’s noteworthy accomplishments were the founding of the Guild of,Paragraph
"Handicraft; a series of houses on Cheyne Walk, London; the development of the Survey",Paragraph
of London; and his role as civic adviser to the city of Jerusalem during renovations to the,Paragraph
old city.,Paragraph
"Following King’s College, Ashbee joined the architectural firm of Bodley and Garner,",Paragraph
"the leading English church architects of their day. For the next two years, Ashbee lived at",Paragraph
"Toynbee Hall, meeting William Morris for the first time on 4 January 1886. Ashbee drew",Paragraph
"on his experiences at Toynbee Hall in founding his own School and Guild of Handicraft,",Paragraph
inaugurated on 23 January 1888. The School and Guild grew in part from Ashbee’s,Paragraph
reading class on Ruskin in the winter of 1896-97 and a later class on drawing and,Paragraph
decoration (both at Toynbee Hall). Ashbee rented for two years the top floor of a,Caption
"warehouse on Commercial Street, which served as a combined workshop and",Paragraph
"schoolroom. The primary goal of the School and Guild, observed Ashbee, was “the",Paragraph
"application of Art to Industry” (Burrough, 1969, p. 85). The School lasted only until",Paragraph
"895, but the Guild (which produced furniture, silver and metalwork, jewelry, and later,",Paragraph
books) was Ashbee’s constant focus until it began to decline in 1905. Shortly after its,Paragraph
"inauguration, the Guild’s work was favorably received at the first exhibition of the Fine",Paragraph
Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in September 1888. After William Morris’s death in,Paragraph
"896, the Guild purchased and operated his Kelmscott Press. For most of his career,",Paragraph
Ashbee maintained an architectural office as well as the Guild of Handicraft. His first,Paragraph
"architectural office opened in September 1890 at 15 Lincoln’s End Fields, London. Soon",Paragraph
"the volume of work required a larger space, and the firm moved to Essex House on Mile",Paragraph
End Road in 1891.,Paragraph
A major undertaking of Ashbee’s career was the large-scale movement of the Guild of,Paragraph
"Handicraft, its workers, and their families to Chipping Campden in the Gloucestershire",Paragraph
"countryside in 1902. Inspired by Ruskin’s 1882 explanation of his St. George’s Guild,",Paragraph
"focusing on the value of rural life, work, and community, Ashbee and his Guild",Paragraph
renovated buildings in the small rural town for their purposes. Chief among the renovated,Paragraph
"buildings was the old Silk Mill (1902, woodshed and engine house; 1909, pottery kilns),",Paragraph
"which became the center of the Chipping Campden site. By 1905, however, the Guild",Paragraph
"was in decline. Its distance from London made marketing its wares more difficult, and",Paragraph
"competitors, such as Liberty, began to produce comparatively inexpensive copies of its",Paragraph
silver work. The dismal economic times and remote location of the Guild made letting,Paragraph
"workers go an impractical solution to these problems. Instead, the Guild began to",Paragraph
"liquidate its assets in 1907. Despite the Guild’s eventual demise, it served as a model for",Paragraph
"other socially conscious projects, such as Jane Addams’s Hull House in Chicago.",Paragraph
"In addition to his work with the Guild, Ashbee designed, built, and",Paragraph
"renovated many houses, including several on Cheyne Walk, London,",Paragraph
where his work is perhaps best known. He combined the ambiance of old,Paragraph
"London, brickwork, and an asymmetrical arrangement of elements to",Paragraph
produce simple and functional houses appropriate for their riverside,Paragraph
setting. In 1893 Ashbee began work on the first house—The Ancient,Paragraph
Magpie and Stump at 37 Cheyne Walk—which became his mother’s,Paragraph
house and was Ashbee’s first executed design. He then bought land that he,Paragraph

"(1897-98), 38-39 (1898-99), and 75 (1901-02). Of these houses, only 38-39 survives.",Paragraph
Ashbee also made significant contributions to architecture and the study of its history,Paragraph
"through two additional projects. In 1894 he began work on the Survey of London, one of",Paragraph
his most enduring legacies to English architectural history. The aim of this ambitious,Paragraph
"project was to record all historic buildings in London. Today, the Survey of London is a",Paragraph
"continuing and scholarly record. Following the Guild’s demise, Ashbee was appointed",Paragraph
civic adviser to the city of Jerusalem to survey the old city and to begin the restoration,Paragraph
"process. Ashbee worked on the restoration of Jerusalem between 1919 and 1922, when he",Paragraph
"resigned and retired to Godden Green, Kent.",Caption
"In addition to his architectural and crafts pursuits, Ashbee traveled and lectured",Paragraph
extensively in the United States in 1896 and 1900-01 (the East and Midwest) and in,Paragraph
"1908-09 (California), visiting some 14 states on his coast-to-coast tour. Some time in late",Paragraph

"Architect, Sweden",Title
Erik Gunnar Asplund was among the most important Scandinavian architects of the,Paragraph
first half of the 20th century. His early work evolved from National Romanticism through,Paragraph
the sparse Nordic classicism of the World War I period and by 1930 embraced canonic,Paragraph
"modernism. At the time of his death in 1940, his work assumed a personal direction,",Paragraph
influenced more by traditional architecture and a desire for symbolic content than by,Paragraph
contemporaneous design tenets. Asplund had a unique ability to create a sense of place in,Paragraph
"his architecture, to manifest directly the context in which his works were situated through",Paragraph
manipulating landscape elements as forcefully as architectural ones. His untimely death,Paragraph
at age 55 occurred at the height of his creative powers and productivity.,Paragraph
"Born in Stockholm, Asplund studied architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology.",Paragraph
"After traveling to Germany on an Institute Scholarship, he returned to Stockholm and",Paragraph
"helped establish, with some fellow students, the Klara School, an independent academy",Paragraph
"of design. Supplanting the more normative neoclassical training of the period, the Klara",Paragraph
"School, under the tutelage of Carl Bergsten, Ragnar Osberg, Ivar Tengbom, and Carl",Paragraph
"Westman, proposed a Romantic sensibility incorporating the influence of Scandinavian",Paragraph
vernacular design and handicrafts. The inclusion of vernacular and traditional sources of,Paragraph
"expression had influenced Nordic architecture since the turn of the century, creating a",Paragraph
style known as National Romanticism. The National Romantic influences of Westman,Paragraph
"and Osberg, and especially Osberg’s ability to combine symmetrical facade composition",Paragraph
"with informal plan organization, informed Asplund’s early work: examples include the",Paragraph
"villa project for Ivar Asplund (1911), the Karlshamn School competition entry (1912),",Paragraph
and the Villa Ruth (1914). These works are characterized by a vernacular imagery created,Paragraph
"through using traditional board and batten siding, tilecovered gable-roof forms, and",Paragraph
carefully placed and proportioned window openings.,Paragraph
"Asplund, while continuing to use vernacular imagery, began to use",Paragraph
"classical motifs in his work, as witnessed in the first-place competition",Paragraph
"entry for the Woodland Cemetery (1915, Stockholm; in collaboration with",Caption
"Sigurd Lewerentz) and his Woodland Chapel (1919, Stockholm), which",Paragraph
"blends Romanticism and Classicism. The simple, steeply pitched chapel",Paragraph

Asplund’s sensitivity in designing buildings within the historical context of the city is,Paragraph
equal to that within the natural landscape.,Paragraph
"Paralleling the development of classicism in Scandinavia during the 1920s, the",Paragraph
classical-Romantic duality of Asplund’s earlier work gave way to a more explicit,Paragraph
expression of classical principles. The work of this period represents a serious attempt at,Paragraph
innovation within the context of classicism rather than a nascent eclecticism. Two,Paragraph
"buildings in Stockholm, the Skandia Cinema (1923) and the Public Library (1928),",Paragraph
demonstrated his leadership position in this pan-Nordic movement. Whereas the Skandia,Paragraph
"Cinema projects a certain playful and idiosyncratic use of classical elements, motifs, and",Paragraph
"images, the Public Library has a simplicity and austerity reminiscent of the neoclassical",Paragraph
architecture of the French Enlightenment. Although the initial design for the library was,Paragraph
"explicitly classical, with coffered dome, columnar entry porticos, and -like facade",Paragraph
"treatment, the built work, while maintaining the organizational was abstracted into two",Paragraph

Sweden and represented a fundamental change in sensibility for the architect. The design,Paragraph
"for the Exhibition complex underwent three phases, the last occurring after Asplund",Paragraph
traveled to the Continent to visit extant examples of the new “modern” architecture. The,Paragraph
Stockholm Exhibition not only epitomized the mechanistic aesthetics of modernism but,Paragraph

ATHENS CHARTER (1943),Caption
The “Athens Charter” was the name given by Le Corbusier to his version of the results of,Paragraph
the fourth congress (1933) of the Congrés Internationaux d’Architecture Moderne,Paragraph
"(CIAM). This congress was organized on the theme of the “Functional City,” a concept",Paragraph
"developed in part by the Dutch town planner Cornelis van Eesteren, who became",Paragraph
president of CLAM in 1930. In contrast to what he called the “cardboard architecture” of,Paragraph
"classical urbanism, van Eesteren and other CLAM members advocated an approach to city",Paragraph
"planning based on the most rational siting of functional elements, such as workplaces and",Paragraph
transportation centers. This idea was linked to the belief that city planning should be,Paragraph
"based on the creation of separate zones for each of the “four functions” of dwelling,",Paragraph
"work, recreation, and transportation. At the fourth congress, held on a cruise ship",Paragraph
"traveling from Marseilles to Athens and back in July-August 1933, CIAM members from",Paragraph
Eastern and Western Europe analyzed the samescale plans of 33 existing cities prepared,Paragraph
by CIAM members according to guidelines developed by the Dutch CIAM group. At the,Paragraph
"end of the congress, the CLAM members present had planned to draw conclusions from",Paragraph
these analyses and to issue resolutions about how cities should be reorganized according,Paragraph
to CIAM principles. Disagreements over whether CLAM should call for the expropriation,Paragraph
of existing property for such a reorganization and over Le Corbusier and others’,Paragraph
promotion of high-rise housing delayed the issuing of these resolutions. In the fall of,Paragraph
"1933, the congress instead published what it termed preliminary (Observations) in",Paragraph
French and (Findings) in German.,Paragraph
"In both the French and the German versions, which were not completely consistent",Paragraph
"with each other, the text emphasized that cities are part of an economic, social, and",Paragraph
"political system. Under “Dwelling,” CLAM found that population densities were typically",Paragraph
too high in historic centers and that open spaces were lacking. It demanded that housing,Paragraph
districts should occupy the best sites and that a minimum amount of solar exposure,Paragraph
"should be required in all dwellings. For hygienic reasons, CIAM asserted that buildings",Paragraph
should not be built along transportation routes and that modern techniques should be used,Paragraph
to construct high apartment buildings widely spaced apart to free the soil for large green,Paragraph
"parks. Under “Leisure,” CIAM found that existing open areas were generally insufficient",Paragraph
for recreation or not well situated to benefit the inhabitants of dense central areas. It,Paragraph
called for the demolition of these central areas so that they could be turned into green,Paragraph
"spaces, with schools and other collective facilities sited in them. Under “Work,” CLAM",Paragraph
"found that the relationship between dwelling and places of work was not rational, as it",Paragraph
usually required long commutes. It determined that travel distances should be reduced to,Paragraph
"a minimum and called for the separation of industrial quarters from housing, buffered by",Paragraph
a neutral zone of green areas and sports fields.,Paragraph
"Under “Transportation,” CIAM found that most cities had street patterns that had",Paragraph
"become unsuitable for modern means of transportation, such as streetcars and",Paragraph
automobiles. It proposed that rigorous statistical methods be used to establish rational,Paragraph
"street widths, classified according to the speed of different modes of transport. Under",Paragraph
"“Historic Districts of the City,’ CIAM stated that historic monuments should be",Paragraph
respected when they “are a pure expression of previous cultures and are of general,Paragraph
interest” and when their conservation did not mean that their inhabitants had to live in,Paragraph
unhealthy conditions.,Paragraph
In the CIAM concluded that the chaotic conditions of present cities do not,Paragraph
correspond to the “primordial bio-logical and psychological necessities of the,Paragraph
population.” It declared that the city should be organized according to the four functions,Paragraph
and that city plans should conform with these biological and psychological needs. CLAM,Paragraph
also emphasized that urbanism was “a three-dimensional science” and that the “element,Paragraph
of height” could be used to solve traffic problems and efficiently create green spaces for,Paragraph
leisure.,Paragraph
"Le Corbusier’s published in Paris in 1943, is an expanded version of the that was",Paragraph

"French CIAM group, ASCORAL (Assemblée de Constructeurs pour une Renovation",Paragraph

"of postwar reconstruction. One of these publications, authored by “CIAM-France” (later",Paragraph

"in Vichy, where it was intended to provide a basis for legislation governing postwar",Paragraph
"reconstruction. By publishing it with its 1941 introduction by Jean Giraudoux, the book",Paragraph
linked Le Corbusier and ASCORAL to the pre-Vichy era and paved the way for its,Paragraph
acceptance by the government after liberation. Although the text maintains the same,Paragraph
sectional headings (the four functions and the “Historic Districts of the City”) as the,Paragraph

"eight-point section called “The City and Its Region” in the Athens Charter, and what had",Paragraph
been simply termed “Summing Up” is retitled the more directive “Points of Doctrine.”,Paragraph
"Without Le Corbusier and his associates’ urban plans, which are the text’s absent",Paragraph
"illustrations, the Athens Charter is less clear than the terse 1933 CIAM and it often",Paragraph
"reads as a series of platitudes. Nevertheless, it was widely referred to in postwar Europe",Paragraph

architects in the world. She has made her reputation in a versatile career that has,Paragraph
"combined architecture with designs for theater, furniture, museums, exhibitions,",Paragraph
"showrooms, gardens, and city-planning projects. In this way, she is very much a product",Paragraph
"of Milan in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, when many architects, such as Vittorio Gregotti,",Paragraph
combined architecture with design.,Paragraph
Aulenti graduated from the Faculty of Architecture at the Milan Polytechnic,Paragraph
"University in 1954. From 1955 to 1965, she was an editor in charge of layout at",Paragraph
"magazine in Milan, directed by Ernesto Rogers, her mentor. She was a member of a",Paragraph

showrooms: Olivetti (1967) in Paris; Olivetti (1968) in Buenos Aires; Knoll International,Paragraph
"(1970) in New York; and Fiat (1970) in Brussels, Zurich, and Turin. She also designed",Paragraph
"offices, such as Max Mara (1965) in Milan. She designed a traveling exhibition (1970)",Paragraph
"for Olivetti and participated in the exhibition, “Italy: The New Domestic Landscape,” at",Paragraph
"the Museum of Modern Art in New York (1972). In the 1960s, her interior designs are",Paragraph
"kaleidoscopic explosions of forms into space, though later they become calm and",Paragraph
"restrained, with curvilinear, surreal, and suggestive forms. The early showrooms are",Paragraph
experiments in the breaking up of space without interfering with its functional use.,Paragraph
"During the 1980s, Aulenti’s attention turned toward the design of museums and",Paragraph
exhibition spaces. Her best-known project is the design of the Musée d’Orsay (1980-86),Paragraph
"in Paris, made in collaboration with a team of French architects and the lighting designer",Paragraph
Piero Castiglioni. This beautiful museum combines the iron structure and stucco,Paragraph
decoration of a railway station into a modern architectural composition. Aulenti also,Paragraph

"Pompidou Center in Paris (1982-85), the National Museum of Catalan Art in Barcelona",Paragraph
"(1987-95), and the Palazzo Grassi in Venice (1985-93). She designed “The Italian",Paragraph
Metamorphosis 1943-68” exhibit at the Guggenheim Museum in New York (1994). The,Paragraph
"museum and exhibition designs always take into account, according to Aulenti, how the",Paragraph
art is viewed by the visitor from different perspectives and combinations. Her exhibitions,Paragraph
develop contrasts between open and closed spaces as well as between the autonomy and,Paragraph
integration of spaces.,Paragraph
"Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Aulenti designed a series of stage sets for theatrical",Paragraph
"productions. These include sets for Rossini’s (1981-89), Rimski-Korsakov’s at the",Paragraph
"Teatro alla Scala in Milan (1988), Strauss’s in Milan (1994), and Shakespeare’s at the",Paragraph
Teatro Argentina in Rome (1995). Aulenti’s stage sets contain beautiful dreamlike,Paragraph

rapidly changing dictates of the modern age. Those efforts have been marked less by,Paragraph
technical innovation than in many other countries—until recently Austria’s building,Paragraph
industries lagged behind those of most other European nations—but rather by a,Paragraph
"remarkable openness to new forms and ideas. On the one hand, modern Austrian",Paragraph
"architecture has been characterized by a strong inclination to embrace novelty, to",Paragraph
originate and develop innovative expressions. But Austrian architects have also exhibited,Paragraph
"exceptional skill in manipulating and re-using elements from the past, engaging, in the",Paragraph
"process, in a sophisticated dialogue with history. In the works of many of the best",Paragraph
"Austrian architects, these two tendencies have been combined to yield designs of unusual",Paragraph
power and expressiveness. Often the results have been quite distinctive: the works of,Paragraph
"figures like Adolf Loos or Gustav Peich! remain uniquely individual and parochial, even",Paragraph
while they have drawn worldwide attention. And when Austrian architects have followed,Paragraph
"wider tendencies, their works nonetheless frequently show original adaptations to culture",Paragraph
and place.,Paragraph
The origins of 20th-century Austrian architecture stem in great part from Otto Wagner.,Paragraph
"In his roles as practitioner, revolutionary, and teacher, Wagner inaugurated the headlong",Paragraph
search for the new. His call for an architecture suited to “modern life” and “new materials,Paragraph
and the demands of the present” proved decisive in shaping the distinctive look of the,Paragraph

"after him, never fully abandoned the past; even his most spare works are redolent of",Paragraph
"Austria’s rich building history, especially its legacy from the Renaissance and the",Paragraph
"Baroque. Early on, Wagner developed a new form language that mixed freely the",Paragraph
"curvilinear lines of the Art Nouveau (Jugendstil) with classical features, compositional",Paragraph
"strategies, and planning. By 1904, however, he had begun to pursue a more rectilinear,",Paragraph
abstract style that brought together elements of the old and new. The resulting fusion of,Paragraph
"the classical and the modern characterized his most famous works, including the Postal",Paragraph
Savings Bank (1904-05) and the Church am Steinhof (1902-07).,Paragraph
"Wagner’s many protégés and followers, although often tracing their own special paths,",Paragraph
continued to investigate the possibilities of innovation and historical revivalism. Joseph,Paragraph
"Maria Olbrich, who worked in Wagner’s atelier around the turn of the century, sought a",Paragraph
new architectonic ideal in the florid lines and patterning of the Jugendstil. But Olbrich,Paragraph
"was simultaneously drawn to archaic, Asian, and Near Eastern motifs, resulting in a",Paragraph
"discernible note of exoticism in his designs, a tendency that has reappeared in the works",Paragraph
"of many later Austrian architects. Josef Hoffmann, another of the architects who was",Paragraph
"influenced by Wagner, sought to foster a new idiom from the language of rectilinear",Paragraph
geometry: the —the square style—that Hoffmann pioneered along with the graphic artist,Title
"and designer Koloman Moser, became the most widely admired—and imitated—images",Paragraph
"of early Austrian modernism. Yet Hoffmann, after his brief flirtation with a geometric",Paragraph
"purism, returned to employing elements from former times, experimenting at various",Paragraph
"times with the Biedermeier, Baroque, Rococo, folk art, and Anglo-American traditions.",Paragraph
"Many of Wagner’s former students from the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, among",Paragraph
"them Hubert Gessner, Franz Gesser, Karl Ehn, and Rudolf Perco, adopted this same",Paragraph
"approach in the 1920s and 1930s, combining features of Wagner’s modernized classicism",Paragraph
and other historical imagery.,Paragraph
"A parallel, but equally important strain of Viennese modernism is descended from",Paragraph
"Adolf Loos. During the early years of the 20th century, Loos formulated an alternative",Paragraph
vision of modern architecture based on his own idiosyncratic ideas of culture and form.,Paragraph
"He rejected the Jugendstil as contrived and inappropriate, calling instead for an",Paragraph
architecture that would reflect honestly the inherent modernity he found in contemporary,Paragraph
urban life. This approach led Loos toward a new architecture of complexity and pluralism,Paragraph
most brilliantly expressed in his Goldman and Salatsch store on the Michaelerplatz in,Paragraph
Vienna (1910-11). Loos’s renunciation of the notion of a universal modern style was also,Paragraph
"embraced by a number of Vienna’s younger generation of modernists, most notably",Paragraph
"Oskar Strnad and Josef Frank, who in the years prior to 1914 developed their own",Paragraph
progressive critique of the Viennese,Title
The implications of Loos’s ideas extended beyond traditional concepts of style.,Paragraph
"Inspired by the linguistic and ethical writings of his friend Karl Kraus, Loos sought to",Paragraph
establish a modern architectonic language that would articulate his notions of propriety,Paragraph
and civility without sacrificing older conventions of material comfort. In his Goldman,Paragraph
"and Salatsch Building, Loos also began to investigate a new spatial idea, the or",Paragraph
"spaceplan, a system of interlocking rooms on multiple levels. In a series of later designs,",Paragraph
"most notably the Moeller (1927-28) and Miiller (1929-30) houses, he raised the",Paragraph
"concept to a high art, creating some of the most extraordinary spatial assemblages of the",Paragraph
modern era. Both of these notions—the concept of linguistic “appropriateness” and the,Paragraph
idea of intricate spatial play—exerted a strong influence on Loos’s followers and later,Paragraph
"Austrian architects, including the philosopher-builder Ludwig Wittgenstein, Josef Frank,",Paragraph
and Hermann Czech.,Paragraph
World War I marked a caesura in the development of Austrian architecture. After,Paragraph
1918 the prosperity and stability of the prewar years gave way to a long period of,Paragraph
"economic hardship and political uncertainty that ended only after 1945. Vienna, which",Paragraph
"before the war had been the capital of an empire of 60 million inhabitants, was reduced to",Paragraph
a provincial city in a country of barely 6 million. The centerpiece of Austrian building,Paragraph
activity in the interwar years was a massive program launched by the Social Democratic,Paragraph
municipal government in Vienna to combat the city’s severe postwar housing shortage. In,Paragraph
"contrast to similar housing programs in Germany and the Netherlands, however, the",Paragraph
"Viennese experimented little with new construction technologies, relying instead on",Paragraph
"conventional, labor-intensive building practices as a means of ensuring employment for",Paragraph
as many workers as possible.,Paragraph
"With few exceptions, the Austrians of the interwar years also showed a decided",Paragraph
aversion to the modernist purism of Le Corbusier and the Bauhaus. The vast majority of,Paragraph
"the Vienna communal housing projects were the work of the former Wagner students,",Paragraph
"and their buildings, like Karl Ehn’s massive Karl-Marx-Hof (1926-30), reflected older,",Paragraph
traditional ideas of massing and composition. Even those architects like Ernst Lichtblau,Paragraph
and Walter Sobotka who subscribed to the general ideas of the Modern movement,Paragraph
exhibited a notable tendency in the 1920s and early 1930s to introduce historical forms,Paragraph
and complex patterning into their designs.,Paragraph
Among the few Austrians of the interwar period who conformed to tenets of the so-,Paragraph
"called International Style were Ernst Plischke, Lois Welzenbacher, and Richard Neutra.",Paragraph
Plischke’s Liesing Labor Office in Vienna (1930-32) and Welzenbacher’s Turmhotel,Paragraph
Seeber in Solbad Hall (1930-31) both brilliantly encapsulated the best features of the,Paragraph
"functionalist idiom, but neither architect was able to realize more than a handful of",Paragraph
"works. Far more successful was the young Neutra, who immigrated to the United States",Paragraph
in the early 1920s and settled in California where he practiced for a time with Rudolph,Paragraph
"M. Schindler, another Viennese-trained modernist. Together with Frederick Kiesler, who",Paragraph
"moved to New York in the mid-1920s, the three architects would have a decisive impact",Paragraph
"on American modern design, but their work exerted little, if any, influence in their",Paragraph
homeland.,Paragraph
The period between 1933 and 1938 formed the second major break in the history of,Paragraph
20th-century Austrian architecture. With the rise of the conservative Austrian clerica.,Paragraph
"party and the later German annexation of Austria, many of the country’s leading",Paragraph
architects were forced to flee. Josef Frank moved to Sweden and Clemens Holzmeister to,Paragraph
"Turkey, but the majority of Austrian exiles—among them Felix Augenfeld, Victor Gruen,",Paragraph
"Ernst Lichtblau, and Bernard Rudofsky—sought refuge in the United States. Very few of",Paragraph
"these exiles returned to Austria after 1945, depriving the country of some of its best",Paragraph
architectural talent.,Paragraph
The arduous task of rebuilding Austria after World War II fell to a small group of,Paragraph
mostly middle-aged architects who had been trained in the 1920s and 1930s. The most,Paragraph
"significant of these figures were Holzmeister, who promoted an older, traditional, and",Paragraph
"popular approach; Oswald Haerdtl, Hoffmann’s former assistant, whose buildings and",Paragraph
"interiors carried on the tradition of a distinctive Austrian modernism; and Roland Rainer,",Paragraph
"who developed a rational, decidedly antihistoricist architectural idiom. But it was a new",Paragraph
"generation, most of whom had been students of Holzmeister at the Vienna Academy of",Paragraph
"Fine Arts, including Friedrich Achleitner, Johann Gsteu, Hans Hollein, Wilhelm",Paragraph
"Holzbauer, Friedrich Kurrent, Josef Lackner, Gustav Peichl, Anton Schweighofer, and",Paragraph
"Johannes Spalt, who took the lead in shaping the direction of Austrian architecture after",Paragraph
"the late 1950s. Gsteu, Holzbauer, Peichl, and the others sought to reestablish the links",Paragraph
with Austria’s prewar modernist tradition while at the same time responding to,Paragraph
contemporary trends abroad. The result was a more resolutely modernist and,Paragraph
"constructivist architecture, one that for the first time began to explore fully the",Paragraph
possibilities of the newest construction methods. Also important in this development was,Paragraph
"Karl Schwanzer, whose Museum des 20. Jahrhunderts (1959-62) and Philips Building",Paragraph
(1962-64) were widely admired.,Paragraph
"In the midst of this fascination with technology and tectonics, Hollein, in his Retti",Paragraph
"Candle Shop (1964-65) and subsequent works, demonstrated a renewed interest in",Paragraph
"aestheticism, one that pointed firmly in the direction of Postmodernism. Like Holzmeister",Paragraph
"before him, Hollein probed the potential of symbolism and representation, articulated not",Paragraph
"only in formal terms, but also through materials and space. Other Austrian architects of",Paragraph
"the 1960s, among them Haus-Rucker-Co (Laurids Ortner, Manfred Ortner, and Giinther",Paragraph

"garde of the previous decade, seeking to substitute a new architecture—visionary,",Paragraph
"dynamic, and socially responsive—in the place of the dominant modernist",Paragraph
monumentalism of the time.,Paragraph
"By the 1970s, the works of both the old and the new avantgarde began to attract",Paragraph
"worldwide attention. Many of the old avant-garde—including Gsteu, Hollein, Kurrent,",Paragraph
"Lackner, Peichl, and Spalt—received academic appointments, and both groups found",Paragraph
increasing numbers of commissions in Austria and abroad. Their position was challenged,Paragraph
"in the mid-1970s by two new movements that arose outside Vienna, the Vorarlberger",Paragraph
Bauktinstler (Vorarlberg architect-builders) and the Grazer Schule (Graz School). The,Paragraph
"former, concentrated in Bregenz near the border with Switzerland and represented by",Paragraph
"Carlo Baumschlager, Dietmar Eberle, Roland Gnaiger, and Hermann Kaufmann, stressed",Paragraph
"structural refinement and clear tectonic expression; the Graz School, led by Giinther",Paragraph

"approach, emphasizing the organic and expressive aspects of building.",Paragraph
"The designs of the Vorarlberger Baukiinstler, in spite of their use of regional, Alpine",Paragraph

Austria in the 1990s presented an unusually rich and diverse architectural scene. At,Paragraph

AUTOMOBILE,Title
"At the close of the millennium, many local and national politicians admitted what many",Paragraph
architectural critics and planners had noted for years: the landscape of post-World War II,Paragraph
America had been planned around automobiles more than around people. Reflecting the,Paragraph
"nation’s great enthusiasm for automobility, the 20th-century landscape integrated this",Paragraph

dominance snuck up on many Americans; yet such change is more attributable to blinded,Paragraph
free choice than to naiveté: the 20th-century American lived under the spell of the open,Title
road.,Paragraph
"Although the United States seized the invention, the automobile was first developed in",Paragraph
Europe in the 1890s. French manufacturers marketed the first successful automobile in,Paragraph
1894. Inconvenience from a lack of roads and infrastructure as well as a dependence on,Paragraph
transportation technologies such as trolleys precluded Americans from rapidly accepting,Paragraph
the new “horseless carriage.” The manufacturing and marketing efforts of Henry Ford,Paragraph
"and others changed this attitude by 1913, when there was one motor vehicle to every",Paragraph
"eight Americans. Mass production made sure that by the 1920s, the car had become no",Paragraph
"longer a luxury but a necessity of American middle-class life. The landscape, however,",Paragraph
"had been designed around other modes of transport, including an urban scene dependent",Paragraph
"on foot travel. Cars enabled an independence never before possible, if they were",Paragraph
supported with the necessary service structure. Massive architectural shifts were,Paragraph
"necessary to make way for the automobile, as architects and planners reconfigured urban",Paragraph
street forms or designed new building types to accommodate the automobile. Congested,Paragraph
"streets forced motorists to park and store their automobiles in a new building, the parking",Paragraph
garage. Early garages included mechanical systems and elevators to carry cars into tall,Paragraph
skyscraperlike garages. Smaller garages affiliated with hotels or commercial districts,Paragraph
"proliferated. After World War II, motorists could select garages with attendants or, more",Paragraph
"commonly by the 1970s and after, they could use selftpark garages. By the 1990s,",Paragraph
architects were designing tall garages for hundreds of cars. With retail storefronts at the,Paragraph
"pedestrian level, many urban garages were designed to blend in with neighboring",Paragraph
buildings and styles.,Paragraph
"Although the motorcar was the quintessential private instrument, its owners had to",Paragraph
operate it over public spaces. Who would pay for these public thoroughfares? After a,Paragraph
"period of acclimation, Americans viewed highway building as a form of social and",Paragraph
economic therapy. They justified public financing for such projects on the theory that,Paragraph
roadway improvements would pay for themselves by increasing property-tax revenues,Paragraph
"along the route. At this time, asphalt, macadam, and concrete were each used on different",Paragraph
roadways.,Paragraph
"By the 1920s, the congested streets of urban areas pressed road building into other",Paragraph
areas. Most urban regions soon proposed express streets without stoplights or,Paragraph
"intersections. These aesthetically conceived roadways, normally following the natural",Paragraph
"topography of the land, soon took the name “parkways.” Long Island and Westchester",Paragraph
"County, New York, used parkways with bridges and tunnels to separate these express",Paragraph
"routes from local cross traffic. The Bronx River Parkway (1906), for instance, follows a",Paragraph
river park and forest; it also is the first roadway to be declared a national historic site. In,Paragraph
"addition to pleasure driving, such roads stimulated automobile commuting.",Paragraph
The Federal Road Act of 1916 offered funds to states that organized highway,Paragraph
"departments, designating 200,000 miles of road as primary and thus eligible for federal",Paragraph
"funds. More important, ensuing legislation also created a Bureau of Public Roads to plan",Paragraph
"a highway network to connect all cities of 50,000 or more inhabitants. Some states",Paragraph
adopted gasoline taxes to help finance the new roads. By 1925 the value of highway,Paragraph
construction projects exceeded $1 billion. Expansion continued through the Great,Paragraph
"Depression, with road building becoming integral to city and town development.",Paragraph
Robert Moses of New York defined this new role as road builder and social planner.,Paragraph
"Through his work in the greater New York City area (1928-60), Moses created a model",Paragraph
for a metropolis that included and even emphasized the automobile as opposed to mass,Paragraph
transportation. This was a dramatic change in the motivation of design. Historian Clay,Paragraph
"McShane (1994) writes, “In their headlong search for modernity through mobility,",Paragraph
American urbanites made a decision to destroy the living environments of nineteenth-,Paragraph
"century neighborhoods by converting their gathering places into traffic jams, their",Paragraph
"playgrounds into motorways, and their shopping places into elongated parking lots.”",Paragraph
"Outside of cities in the United States, major efforts were underway to knit",Paragraph
"the nation together on a larger scale. In the 1910s, motorists and",Paragraph
commercial forces joined in the good-roads movement to establish early,Paragraph
"national highways, such as the Lincoln Highway and the Dixie Highway.",Paragraph
"Route 66, stretching southwest from Chicago through Illinois, Missouri,",Paragraph
"Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California, ending",Paragraph
"at Los Angeles, was to become the most celebrated interstate roadway.",Paragraph
While the road supplied an exodus for many Dust Bowl sufferers in the,Paragraph
"1930s, Route 66 became even more important as a symbol. “Get your",Paragraph
kicks on Route 66” echoed through many musical moments as well as in,Paragraph
"minutes of personal longing. For Americans, “America’s Main Street”",Caption
opened up westward and ushered in a period of comfortable cruising in,Paragraph
"American automobiles. Probably more than any other roadway, Route 66",Paragraph
allowed the automobile to become a means for expressing the American,Paragraph
"tradition of independence and freedom. Planners, designers, and",Paragraph
entrepreneurs sought methods to stimulate and take advantage of this new,Paragraph
American passion.,Paragraph

"Drivers through the 1930s often slept in roadside yards, so developers soon took",Paragraph
advantage of this opportunity by devising the roadside camp or motel. Independently,Paragraph
"owned tourist camps graduated from tents to cabins, which were often called “motor",Paragraph
"courts.” After World War II, the form became a motel, in which all the rooms were tied",Paragraph
"together in one structure. Still independently owned, by 1956 there were 70,000 motels",Paragraph
nationwide. Best Western and Holiday Inn soon used ideas of prefabrication to create,Paragraph
chains of motels throughout the United States. Holiday Inn defined this new part of the,Paragraph
automobile landscape by emphasizing uniformity so that travelers felt as if they were in a,Paragraph
familiar environment no matter where they traveled.,Paragraph
"The automobile landscape, of course, needed to effectively incorporate its essential",Paragraph
"raw material: petroleum. The gas station, which originally existed as little more than a",Paragraph
"roadside shack, mirrors the evolution of the automobile-related architecture in general.",Paragraph
"By the 1920s, filling stations had integrated garages and service facilities. These facilities",Paragraph
"were privately owned and uniquely constructed. By the mid-1930s, oil giants, such as",Paragraph
"Shell and Texaco, developed a range of prototype gas stations that would re-create the",Paragraph
"site as a showroom for tires, motor oil, or other services. The architectural style clearly",Paragraph
"derived from the International Style, with a sleek, white appearance. While carefully",Paragraph
"dressed attendants were a vital part of the experience at many service stations, George",Paragraph
Urich introduced the United States’ first self-service gas station in California in 1947. By,Paragraph
"the 1990s, this form had been further streamlined to include convenience stores and the",Paragraph
opportunity to pay at the pump. The gas station experience would steadily become less,Paragraph
personalized.,Paragraph
"As automobiles became more familiar in everyday Americans’ lives, planners and",Paragraph
developers formalized refueling stations for the human drivers as well. Food stands,Paragraph
"informally provided refreshment during these early days, but soon restaurants were",Paragraph
developed that utilized marketing strategies from the motel and petroleum industries.,Paragraph
Diners and family restaurants sought prime locations along frequently traveled roads;,Paragraph
"however, these forms did not alter dining patterns significantly. White Castle (1921)",Paragraph
combined the food stand with the restaurant to create a restaurant that could be put almost,Paragraph
"anywhere. Drive-in restaurants would evolve around the idea of quick service, often",Paragraph
"allowing drivers to remain in their automobile. Fast food as a concept, of course, derives",Paragraph
specifically from Ray Kroc and the McDonald’s concept that he marketed out of,Paragraph
California (1952). Clearly the idea of providing service to automobile drivers had created,Paragraph
an entire offshoot of the restaurant industry.,Paragraph
"Whereas most roadside building types evolved gradually, the drive-in theater was",Paragraph
"deliberately invented. Richard M.Hollingshead Jr., of New Jersey, believed that",Paragraph
entertainment needed to incorporate the automobile. Hollingshead patented the first,Paragraph
"drive-in in 1933, but the invention would not proliferate until the 1950s. Viewing outdoor",Paragraph
films in one’s car has become a symbol of the culture of consumption that overtook the,Paragraph
"American middle class during the postwar era. Of course, it also established the",Paragraph
"automobile as a portable, private oasis where youth could express their sexuality as well",Paragraph
as experiment with drugs and alcohol.,Paragraph
Most of these developments redefined the local landscape while creating few national,Paragraph
thoroughfares. President Dwight D. Eisenhower changed this in the 1950s. In 1920 he,Paragraph
had led troops across the American road system in a military call for new roads. Then he,Paragraph
"had witnessed the spectacle of Hitler’s Autobahn firsthand. When he became president,",Paragraph
he worked with automobile manufacturers and others to devise a 1956 plan to connect,Paragraph
America’s future to the automobile. The interstate highway system was the most,Paragraph
expensive public works project in human history. The public rationale for this hefty,Paragraph
project revolved around fear of nuclear war: such roadways would assist in exiting urban,Paragraph
"centers in the event of such a calamity. The emphasis, however, was clearly economic",Paragraph
expansion. At the cost of many older urban neighborhoods—often occupied by minority,Paragraph
groups—the huge wave of concrete was unrolled that linked all the major cities of the,Paragraph
nation.,Paragraph
"With the national future clearly tied to cars, planners began perfecting ways of further",Paragraph
"integrating the automobile into American domestic life. Initially, these tactics were quite",Paragraph
"literal. In the early 20th century, many homes of wealthy Americans soon required the",Paragraph
"ability to store vehicles. Most often, these homes had carriage houses or stables that could",Paragraph
"be converted. Soon, of course, architects devised an appendage to the home and gave it",Paragraph
"the French name “garage.” From this early point, housing in the United States closely",Paragraph
followed the integration of the automobile and roads into American life.,Paragraph
Upper- and middle-class Americans had begun moving to suburban areas in the late,Paragraph
"1800s. The first suburban developments, such as Llewellyn Park, New Jersey (1856),",Paragraph
followed train lines or the corridors of other early mass transit. The automobile allowed,Paragraph
"access to vast areas between and beyond these corridors. Suddenly, the suburban",Paragraph
"hinterland around every city compounded. As early as 1940, about 13 million people",Paragraph
lived in communities beyond the reach of public transportation. Because of these,Paragraph
"changes, suburbs could be planned for less wealthy Americans.",Paragraph
Modeled after the original Gustav Stickley homes or similar designs from —_ and other,Paragraph
"popular magazines, middle-class suburbs appealed to working- and middle-class",Paragraph
Americans. The bungalow became one of the most popular designs in the nation. The,Paragraph
"construction halt of the Great Depression set the stage for more recent ideas and designs,",Paragraph
"including the ranch house. The basic features of the ranch house—its simple, informal,",Paragraph
one-story structure; its low-pitched eaves; and its large expanse of glass that included,Paragraph
“picture” windows—were fused in the public mind with the easygoing lifestyle identified,Paragraph
with the Southwest and West Coast.,Paragraph
Planners used home styles such as these to develop one site after another with the,Paragraph
automobile linking each one to the outside world. The world of Levittown (the first of,Paragraph
which was constructed in 1947) involved a complete dependence on automobile travel.,Paragraph
"This shift to suburban living became a hallmark of the late 20th century, with over half",Paragraph
the nation residing in suburbs by the 1990s. The planning system that supported this,Paragraph
"residential world, however, involved much more than roads. The services necessary to",Paragraph
"support outlying, suburban communities also needed to be integrated by planners.",Paragraph
"Instead of the Main Street prototype, the automobile suburbs demanded a new form.",Paragraph
"Initially, planners such as Jesse Clyde Nichols devised shopping areas, such as Kansas",Paragraph
"City’s Country Club District (1922), that appeared a hybrid of previous forms. In Lake",Paragraph
"Forest, Illinois, Howard Van Doren Shaw designed Market Square (1916), perhaps the",Paragraph
"first shopping center planned to address the automobile. Soon, however, the “strip” had",Paragraph
evolved as the commercial corridor of the future. These sites quickly became part of,Paragraph
suburban development in order to provide basic services close to home. A shopper rarely,Paragraph
"arrived without an automobile; therefore, the car needed to be part of the design program.",Paragraph
The most obvious architectural development for speed was signage: integrated into the,Paragraph
"overall site plan would be towering neon aberrations that identified services. In addition,",Paragraph
parking lots and drive-through windows suggest the integral role of transportation in this,Paragraph
new commerce.,Paragraph
"These developments culminated in the shopping mall, which quickly became a",Paragraph
"necessary portion of strip planning. By the 1970s, developers’ initiatives clearly included",Paragraph
regional economic development for a newly evolving service and retail world.,Paragraph
"Incorporating suburbs into such development plans, designs for these pseudocommunities",Paragraph
were held together by the automobile. The marketplace for this culture quickly became,Paragraph
"the shopping mall. Strip malls, which open onto roadways and parking lots, were",Paragraph
installed near residential areas as suburbs extended further from the city center.,Paragraph
"Developers then perfected the self-sustained, enclosed shopping mall, which became the",Paragraph
symbol of a culture of conspicuous consumption that many Americans have criticized,Paragraph
"since its first appearance. Try as they might, developers could never re-create the culture",Paragraph
of local communities in these new artificial environments.,Paragraph
Critics such as Jane Jacobs and James Kunstler identified an intrinsic bias on the,Paragraph
"American landscape in the 1970s. Kunstler writes, “Americans have been living car-",Paragraph
centered lives for so long that the collective memory of what used to make a landscape or,Paragraph
a townscape or even a suburb humanly rewarding has nearly been erased.” The 1990s,Paragraph
closed with the unfolding of the new politics of urban sprawl. “I’ve come to the,Paragraph
"conclusion,” explained Vice President Al Gore on the campaign trail in 1999, “that what",Paragraph
we really are faced with here is a systematic change from a pattern of uncontrolled sprawl,Paragraph
"toward a brand new path that makes quality of life the goal of all our urban, suburban,",Paragraph
"and farmland policies.” During the 20th century, planners and designers gave Americans",Paragraph
what they wanted: a life and landscape married to the automobile. A divorce will require,Paragraph
an entirely revised architectural program.,Paragraph

AVANT-GARDE,Title
"Taken literally, the avant-garde refers to the front part of a marching army, the scouts that",Paragraph
"first head into unknown territory. As a metaphor, the word has been used from the 19th",Paragraph
century onward to refer to progressive political and artistic movements that considered,Paragraph
"themselves to be ahead of their time. The avant-garde is struggling against the old,",Paragraph
"heading toward the new. It is radical and controversial, fighting against consensus and",Paragraph
looking for disruption. The avant-garde radicalizes the basic principle of modernity: the,Paragraph
"urge toward continual change and development. According to Matei Calinescu (1987), its",Paragraph
very radicality drives it to a conscious quest for crisis: Because the avantgarde attitude,Paragraph
"implies the bluntest rejection of such traditional ideas as those of order, intelligibility, or",Paragraph
"even success, its protagonists seek for an art that is to become an experience, deliberately",Paragraph
"conducted, of failure and crisis. The most characteristic feature of the avant-garde,",Paragraph
"therefore, might be the continuous cycling of short-lived movements that emerge and",Paragraph
whither away in rapid succession.,Paragraph
"As early as 1962, Renato Poggioli described the avant-garde as characterized by four",Paragraph
"moments: activism, antagonism, nihilism, and agonism. The activist moment meant",Paragraph
"adventure and dynamism, an urge to action that is not necessarily linked to any positive",Paragraph
goal. The antagonistic character of the avant-garde refers to its combativeness; the avant-,Paragraph
"garde is always struggling against something—against tradition, against the public, or",Paragraph
against the establishment. Activism and antagonism are often pursued in such a way that,Paragraph
"an avant-garde movement finally overtakes itself in a nihilistic quest, in an uninterrupted",Paragraph
"search for purity, ending up by dissolving into nothing. The avant garde is indeed",Paragraph
inclined to sacrifice itself on the altar of progress—a characteristic that Poggioli labels,Paragraph
agonistic.,Paragraph
"During the last decades, the term avant-garde has acquired a more precise theoretical",Paragraph
meaning because of the work of Peter Burger (1974). The avant-garde is clearly,Paragraph
distinguished from modernism in that it is confined to a more limited range of ideas and,Paragraph
"movements. According to Burger, the avant-garde in the visual arts and literature was",Paragraph
concerned to abolish the autonomy of art as an institution. Its aim was to put an end to the,Paragraph
"existence of art as something separate from everyday life—of art, that is, as an",Paragraph
"autonomous domain that has no real impact on the social system. The avant-garde, says",Paragraph
"Burger, aims for a new life praxis, a praxis that is based on art and that constitutes an",Paragraph
alternative for the existing order. This alternative would no longer organize social life on,Paragraph
the basis of economic rationality and bourgeois conventions. It would rather found itself,Paragraph
on aesthetic sensibilities and on the creative potentialities of each individual.,Paragraph
"Avant-gardism has been most prominent in literature and the arts, whereas its use in",Paragraph
"the context of architecture was less common. Nevertheless, there has been a tendency to",Paragraph
identify the Modern movement as the avant-garde in architecture. The theoretical fine-,Paragraph
"tuning urged by Burger, however, necessitates a modification of this too-simple",Paragraph
identification. Biirger's work also brought about a growing consensus to distinguish,Paragraph
"between the historical avant-garde, chronologically situated before World War II, and the",Paragraph
"neo-avant-garde, which is a more recent phenomenon.",Paragraph
The issues and themes around which the Modern movement in architecture,Paragraph
crystallized were surely related to the avant-garde logic of destruction of the old and,Paragraph
construction of the new. The Modern movement was based on a rejection of the,Paragraph
bourgeois culture of philistinism that used pretentious ornament and kitsch and that took,Paragraph
"the form of eclecticism (Gusevich, 1987). In its stead, the movement gave precedence to",Paragraph
"purity and authenticity. In the 1920s, these themes acquired a distinct political dimension:",Paragraph
The new architecture became associated with the desire for a more socially balanced and,Paragraph
egalitarian form of society in which the ideals of equal rights and emancipation would be,Paragraph
"realized. The architectural vanguard, nevertheless, did not become as uncompromising",Paragraph
"and as radical as its counterpart in art and literature. Most architects, for example, never",Paragraph
"renounced the principle of rationality, even if it stood for a bourgeois value.",Paragraph
"Therefore, it might be more productive not to speak of the Modern movement as",Paragraph
"avant-garde but, rather, to distinguish certain avant-garde moments within its discourse,",Paragraph
"for the movement was hardly a unified whole; rather, it consisted of widely differing",Paragraph
trends and tendencies. Manfredo Tafuri and Francesco Dal Co cite tendencies such as De,Paragraph
"Stil in Holland, Productivism and Constructivism in Russia, and the late Expressionist",Paragraph
currents of the Arbeitsrat fiir Kunst and the Novembergruppe in Germany among the,Paragraph
"architectural avant-garde. These movements, they argue, were inspired by an intensive",Paragraph
exchange between visual arts and architecture and a new social reality that was based on,Paragraph
"a new, artistic outlook on the world.",Paragraph
The early writings of Swiss historian and critic Sigfried Giedion testify to an,Paragraph
aspiration to abolish architecture as a typology or segregated discipline. In (1928;,Paragraph
"), Giedion questions the very idea of an architecture with definitive boundaries, and",Paragraph
his implicit suggestion is that architecture no longer has anything to do with objects. If it,Paragraph
"is to survive at all, it must become part of a broader domain in which spatial relations and",Paragraph
"concerns are of central importance. Herewith, Giedion formulates as a goal for",Paragraph
architecture that it would break out of the limits imposed on it by tradition and by its,Paragraph
functioning as an institution.,Paragraph
Although Giedion did not develop these potentially subversive considerations in any,Paragraph
"radical way in his consecutive work, they were not completely idiosyncratic, either. The",Paragraph
thought that architecture should no longer limit itself to the design of representative,Paragraph
buildings but rather should develop into a more comprehensive discipline that is focusing,Paragraph
on the whole of the environment and that merges with social reality and with life itself,Paragraph
was shared by many prominent modern architects from the 1920s. Avant-garde architects,Paragraph
"such as Walter Gropius, Hannes Meyer, and Ernst May believed that their mission had to",Paragraph
"do with the design of all aspects of life, and they aimed at a reconceptualization of the",Paragraph
"whole process of building, including construction techniques, housing typologies, and",Paragraph
urbanism. One of the most radical interpretations of such beliefs was to be found in the,Paragraph
work of Walter Benjamin.,Paragraph
"Benjamin thought that the destructive gestures of the avantgarde, which aimed at",Paragraph
"purification, were necessary to free the way for a revolutionary future. The transparency",Paragraph
"and openness of the new architecture pointed for Benjamin to a revolutionary, classless",Paragraph
society based on emancipation and flexibility. He interpreted this architecture as part of,Paragraph
the avant-garde’s attack on bourgeois culture. The new architecture schooled inhabitants,Paragraph
and users to adapt to new social conditions that prefigured the future transparent society.,Paragraph
Benjamin saw architecture as a discipline that was capable of stimulating people to align,Paragraph
"their attitudes with those required by the new society to come (Heynen, 1999).",Paragraph
The alignment between modern architecture and politically progressive tendencies was,Paragraph
"thus clearly present in the 1920s and the early 1930s, in the self-reflection of its",Paragraph
representatives as well as in the discourse of major critics. This avant-garde position,Paragraph
"claimed a new, more open and more socially relevant mission for architecture. It was",Paragraph
"Utopian and critical, believing that the new future could be reached only by starting from",Paragraph
"scratch. This position, however, did not dominate very long. When HenryRussell",Paragraph
"Hitchcock and Philip Johnson introduced modern architecture to the United States, they",Paragraph
"presented it as the latest and most topical style, leaving aside any social or political issues",Paragraph
( 1932). Giedion himself gravitated toward a similar position with his later (1941).,Paragraph
In presenting the space-time concept as a “secret synthesis” that was capable of building,Paragraph
"a unity across very different disciplines, Giedion no longer referred to social experiments",Paragraph
"or to the revolutionizing aims of the new architecture. Instead, he strove toward the",Paragraph
formulation of a common denominator that could unite rather diverse trends under the,Paragraph
"banner of one “modern architecture,” thus formulating a certain orthodoxy that was at",Paragraph
odds with the continuous longing for change characteristic of the avant-garde.,Paragraph
This tendency toward consensus and orthodoxy in modern architecture was only,Paragraph
"reinforced in the postwar years, when modern architecture was accepted by many",Paragraph
administrations as the most appropriate answer to the building needs of the,Paragraph
Reconstruction era. Modern architecture thus became institutionalized as part of the,Paragraph
"establishment, and consequently, it took its leave from the avant-garde aspirations of the",Paragraph
1920s. It was therefore no coincidence that after World War II a gap opened up between,Paragraph
modern architecture and the avant-garde in the arts. They soon drifted quite apart. The,Paragraph
most vehement criticism that was leveled against modern architecture in the early,Paragraph
postwar years came from movements such as Lettrism and International Situationism,Paragraph
rather than from right-wing conservatives. International Situationism was based on the,Paragraph
"program for a “unitary urbanism,” which consisted of a vigorous critique of current",Paragraph
modernist urbanism. Unitary urbanism rejected the utilitarian logic of the consumer,Paragraph
"society, aiming instead for the realization of a dynamic city, a city in which freedom and",Paragraph
"play would have a central role. By operating collectively, the Situationists aimed to",Paragraph
"achieve a creative interpretation of their everyday surroundings, and they created",Paragraph
situations that subverted the normal state of affairs. The Situationists belonged to the neo-,Paragraph
avant-garde movements that formed an “avant-garde beyond modernism.” This neo-,Paragraph
avantgarde considered itself to be ahead of the masses in its search for the future but took,Paragraph
"its distance from the more conciliatory, consensus-oriented mainstream modernism",Paragraph
because it was much more radical and Utopian.,Paragraph
"Within the field of architecture, there were also groups, such as Archizoom,",Paragraph
"Archigram, and Superstudio that moved beyond modernist ideas and could be called neo-",Paragraph
"avant-garde. It is less clear, however, what the meanings of the terms “avant-garde” and",Paragraph
"“neo-avant-garde” have become in the most recent decades. On the one hand, there is a",Paragraph
clear rejection of the avant-garde logic of destruction of the old and Utopian construction,Paragraph
"of the new. It is stated that this logic is based on an ideology of progress, which has since",Paragraph
been proven to be false; that it gave rise to an elitist hermeticism that rendered its ideals,Paragraph
completely inaccessible to a general public; and that its supposedly radical innovations,Paragraph
and inventions nevertheless lend themselves all too well to appropriation by the culture,Paragraph
industry. This widely spread criticism would lead one to think that the avant-garde is,Paragraph
"dead—a claim that has been made repeatedly. On the other hand, in the 1980s and the",Paragraph
"90s, the notion of a contemporary neo-avantgarde has resurged in the work of Peter",Paragraph
"Eisenman, Bernard Tschumi, and others. It seems clear, however, that this use of the term",Paragraph
is based on a perception of their position within a discursive field and that its,Paragraph
"application has nothing to do with how they, contentwise, think about architecture. The",Paragraph
"avant-garde and its significance for 20th-century architecture rests, then, with the",Paragraph
"constant obliteration of boundaries between the arts and architecture, image and text, and",Paragraph
the meanings of old and new.,Paragraph

The theoretization of what the avant-garde was all about took place mostly in fields,Paragraph

BATYOKE TOWER,Title
"Designed by Plan Architects; completed 1987 Bangkok, Thailand",Caption
"Distinctive for its horizontal strips of rainbow color and a gableshaped roof, the first",Paragraph
"Batyoke tower in Bangkok, Thailand, was famously known as the one-time tallest",Paragraph
reinforced-concrete building in Asia. This skyscraper signified the start of Thai high-rise,Paragraph
"architectural development. Land Development, a real estate company dominated by the",Paragraph
"Baiyoke family, the project developer and landowner, proposed this 42-story building to",Paragraph
serve as both a commercial and a residential complex. The company turned the site on,Paragraph
"Rachaprarob Road, which once had been occupied by a large-scale theater, into a",Paragraph
garment and cloth market and a residential tower for the Pratunam district. Not only did,Paragraph
the garment and cloth business inside the building fit in well with the neighborhood’s,Paragraph
"business in general, but it also eventually became one of the most significant wholesale",Paragraph
cloth markets in Bangkok for years to come.,Paragraph
Although the Baiyoke tower established the Baiyoke family among Bangkok’s,Paragraph
"business society, the tower itself promoted its design firm, Plan Architect, for their use of",Paragraph
bright color and the composition of geometric forms. The design team represented a,Paragraph
"collaboration between Plan Architect and Inter Arkitek. Sinn Phonghanyudh, Plan",Caption
"Architect’s executive architect, was in charge of the design team, which included",Paragraph
"Theeraphon Niyom (firm owner), Krongsak Chulamorkodt (partner), Boonrit",Caption
"Kordilokrat, Chenkit Napawan, Sapark Aksharanugraha, and Songsak Visudharom. Their",Paragraph
design won the 1984 competition sponsored by the Baiyoke family. The winning design,Paragraph
proposed the most functional exploitation of the limited site as well as the remarkable,Paragraph
concept of building the tallest building in the region.,Paragraph
"On its completion in 1987, the building contained 55,000 square meters, including two",Paragraph
main parts: podium and tower. The large-scale column-and-beam reinforced-concrete,Caption
"podium covered almost the entire site. Each floor was marked by different color, forming",Paragraph
"a vertical rainbow in downtown Bangkok. The ground, first, and second floors were",Paragraph
devoted to the garment and cloth market. The third floor was originally designed as,Paragraph
"offices for rent but later was turned, in part, into cloth shops to serve the growing market.",Paragraph
The fourth floor held a gigantic food center and several minitheaters. The next five floors,Paragraph
"served as a parking garage for over 500 cars, an estimation approximated to",Paragraph
accommodate the high density of car drivers in Bangkok during the 1980s. Architects,Paragraph
"designed the roof at the top of the podium as a recreation center, including a swimming",Paragraph
"pool and health center, serving residents of the tower above. The residential floors were",Paragraph
"eventually converted to a hotel complex. Its structure, supported by the shared structure",Paragraph
"of the podium, was erected with flat-slab layers of a cross shape. Each residential floor",Paragraph
"combined eight units, each with a single shared wall. Four elevators at the tower core ran",Paragraph
"from the ground floor to the top, separating the tower’s access from that of the podium.",Paragraph
Other facilities were likewise designed separately for serving the tower’s residents and,Paragraph
the users inside the podium area. Despite the shared structure of the podium and tower,Paragraph
"parts, Baiyoke tower was designed as two very different buildings. In fact, this design",Paragraph
reflected a common trend of multifunction complex favored among Bangkok’s real estate,Paragraph
development during the late 20th century.,Paragraph
"Shortly following the success of the project, the Batyoke real estate developer decided",Paragraph
"in 1988 to initiate a second project, Baiyoke II, with a similar publicized theme of",Paragraph
establishing another record for the world’s tallest reinforced-concrete building. This,Paragraph
"follow-up project, however, was interrupted a few times during Thai financial turbulence",Paragraph
"in the 1990s. The building was finally opened to the public in 1999, taking more than ten",Paragraph
years to complete. This long wait contrasted to the three-year construction period of its,Paragraph
"fellow building, the first Baiyoke.",Paragraph
"The Baiyoke II consisted of 172,000 square meters, more than three times the first",Paragraph
"Baiyoke’s space. The project comprised 88 floors, 309 meters in total height above",Paragraph
ground (including the tower’s antenna but excluding the two underground floors). The,Paragraph
building functioned mainly as a hotel and included a shopping plaza and a parking,Paragraph
garage—an intrinsic element of contemporary Bangkok’s architecture. The ground floor,Paragraph
"through the fourth floor served as retail shops, and the next ten floors consisted of",Paragraph
"parking space. The hotel business occupied space from the 15th floor up, with the top ten",Paragraph
"floors designed to serve as space for sky lounges, restaurants, and kitchen areas. The",Paragraph
"main observation lounge for tourists and visitors was located on the 76th floor, whereas",Paragraph
access to the very top floors remained exclusive to hotel guests and the restaurants’,Paragraph
clients.,Paragraph
"Unlike the first Baiyoke’s colorful theme, the Plan Architect design team",Paragraph
conceptualized the second Baiyoke building as a massive red block rising from the,Paragraph
"ground, with a glittering gold roof that signified the golden roof of a Thai temple, an",Paragraph
omnipresent metaphoric symbol of Thai culture. In the design proposal of Plan,Paragraph
"Architects, the design team once mentioned that the mass of colorful red sandstone",Paragraph
"represented “the image of natural sandstone rising from the earth, punched out to provide",Paragraph
"space for human’s various activities. The higher it goes, the more modernized and",Paragraph
sophisticated these various voids become.”,Paragraph
To be modernized or not remains an unfinished argument for which there is hardly an,Paragraph
"answer, not only for both Baiyoke towers but also for contemporary Bangkok",Paragraph
architecture in general. The issues of “modern” and “modernity” have led many Thai,Paragraph
architects to confront problems in interpreting and defining designs to suit the terms.,Paragraph
Along with layers of interpretation and influences from foreign architectural,Paragraph
"development, definitions vary and thus have brought up various designs. The Baiyoke",Paragraph
"towers’ significant contribution to the city, with extension to the Southeast Asian region,",Paragraph
was essential in that they challenged the general geographic condition and virtually,Paragraph
turned Bangkok’s architectural development into a new phase of high-rise architectural,Paragraph

Herbert Baker’s prolific practice produced a wide variety of work in England and,Paragraph
abroad. His work ranged from country houses to ecclesiastical work and public buildings,Paragraph
and most notably includes the government Houses in both South Africa and India.,Paragraph
"Indeed, Baker is credited with the creation of a South African architecture by giving",Paragraph
"expression to the dreams of his great patron, Cecil Rhodes, who wished to create a",Paragraph
distinguished and permanent culture.,Paragraph
"As a contemporary of Edwin Lutyens, Baker’s particular distinction lay in his ability",Paragraph
"to range from Arts and Crafts in his domestic work, to a dignified monumental style,",Paragraph
"sensitively modified to accommodate technology, and different national and climatic",Paragraph
conditions.,Paragraph
"Baker was born in Kent, and attended the Royal Academy School, London, from 1879",Paragraph
"until 1881, when he was apprenticed to his cousin, Arthur Baker. Between 1882 and",Paragraph
"1887, he served as lead assistant in the office of celebrated domestic architects, George",Paragraph
"and Peto, where he claimed to have gained invaluable experience. Emphasis was placed",Paragraph
"on the importance of working drawings, sketching tours, and above all, respect for high",Paragraph
"levels of craftsmanship. It was there that he met Lutyens, who was an apprentice with the",Paragraph
firm from 1887.,Paragraph
"In 1892 Baker began his own practice in Cape Town, South Africa, where he met",Paragraph
"Rhodes, who commissioned the restoration of his home, Groote Schuur. It was originally",Paragraph
completed in 1895 but destroyed by fire and rebuilt by Baker. The final design was an,Paragraph
adaptation of the old Cape Dutch style and alerted South Africans to the supremacy of,Paragraph
their 17th- and 18th-century buildings over recent 19th-century work. The interiors are,Paragraph
"indebted to George and Peto, in Baker’s elaborate amalgamation of English Tudor and",Paragraph
Cape Dutch and in his employment of a consistent group of craftsmen.,Paragraph
"Baker was appointed diocesan architect for Cape Town, and was responsible for",Paragraph
"building many churches, including St. George’s Cathedral (1898, Cape Town), all of",Paragraph
which were characterized by a round-arched style that combined rough-hewn stone and,Paragraph
white plaster. A flow of both domestic and commercial buildings followed.,Paragraph
Baker designed many houses in Johannesburg built in response to the short-lived,Paragraph
"mining boom. His style provided a synthesis of indigenous sources, including",Paragraph
"Mediterranean vernacular, and English Arts and Crafts, which were emulated in",Paragraph
numerous suburbs.,Paragraph
"In 1900 Baker retraced Rhodes’s steps while on a tour of Egypt, Greece, and Italy.",Paragraph
Rhodes’s tour had inspired him to a series of classical architectural dreams that sadly,Paragraph
"were to materialize only in his memorial, which was built by Baker at Mowbray, Cape",Paragraph
Town. Baker also designed memorials to the Shangani tribe for the Matabele War of,Paragraph
"1897 and a monument, the (1905), at Kimberley, Cape Province, that was inspired by",Paragraph
"Rome and Agrigentum. Following Rhodes’s death in 1902, Lord Milner assumed",Paragraph
responsibility for reconstruction in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony after the Boer,Title
War.,Paragraph
"Baker and his partner, Francis E.Masey, produced government buildings, churches,",Paragraph
"houses, and agricultural and mining settlements. Pretoria Cathedral was begun in 1905,",Paragraph
"but was only partially completed. Government House (1907, Pretoria) and Pretoria",Paragraph
Railway Station (1909) heralded the Union Buildings style. The work was commissioned,Paragraph
"by General Botha, South Africa’s first prime minister, and came as a result of the",Paragraph
legislature remaining in Cape Town; the Pretoria Union Buildings (1912) represent,Paragraph
"Baker’s most important work in South Africa, and lend expression to his belief that a",Paragraph
"nation should demonstrate pride by the creation of noble monuments. In this work,",Paragraph
traditional European Neoclassical forms were combined with a serious concern to adapt,Paragraph
"to local materials and technology. Twin cupola towers, evoking Wren’s Greenwich",Caption
"Hospital, were linked by a concave hemicycle to prevent them from dominating the low",Paragraph
ground that they crowned.,Paragraph
Lutyens recommended that Baker share with him in the building of the,Paragraph
new government buildings in New Delhi. Unfortunately a disagreement,Paragraph
over the leveling of the central King’s Way leading to Lutyen’s Viceregal,Paragraph
Lodge led to a long estrangement. Whereas Baker’s designs were,Paragraph
"sympathetic to the Mogul tradition, those by Lutyens were rather more",Paragraph
"dispassionate and individual. In 1913 Baker returned to England and, with",Paragraph
"his subsequent partner, Francis Fleming, designed the twin-domed",Paragraph
Secretariat Building and the circular Legislature Building.,Caption
In 1917 the War Graves Commission invited Baker to make recommendations about,Paragraph
cemeteries and monuments that were designed to give expression to inarticulated grief.,Paragraph
"Compared with Lutyens, who strove for abstract monumentality, Baker favored a more",Paragraph
"literal symbolism, reveling in the intricacies of heraldry and literary quotation. His",Paragraph
designs included the Indian Memorial at Neuve Chapelle and the South African,Paragraph

With the abrupt change that accompanied the arrival of European art and architectural,Paragraph
"styles during the late 19th century, Bangkok of the 20th century emerged as an",Paragraph
"international city, emulating Western urban formation and leaving behind its former",Paragraph
structure of canals and teak buildings along the riverside. “Venice of the East” was,Paragraph
"effaced; replacing it are layers of different modern architectural styles, in which",Paragraph
“modern” is defined variously according to different contemporaneous Euro-American,Paragraph
"architectural currents, imported into Thailand through different means. Over the century,",Paragraph
"however, the fabrication of “the East-meets-West” architecture occasionally occurred.",Paragraph
"But by the end of the century, the mass of concrete high-rise buildings has become an",Paragraph
unprecedented image of Bangkok’s skyline.,Paragraph
The proliferation of Western influence on Bangkok architecture during the first half of,Paragraph
the century was largely due to the sociopolitical reformation during the late 19th and,Paragraph
early 20th centuries. It began in the last decades of the 19th century when King Rama V,Paragraph
"(Chulalongkorn, 1853-1910) officially introduced Western practices of both",Paragraph
sociopolitical structure and city formation. Given the government’s incentive to,Paragraph
"modernize Thailand, the imported culture was no longer perceived as foreign practice,",Paragraph
"but as fundamental composition of national modernization process, to which Western-",Paragraph
"style practices were not only imposed on, but also adapted to, the existing condition of",Paragraph
Thai society.,Paragraph
"By 1920 neoclassical architecture outshone other types of buildings, particularly in the",Paragraph
heart of the present-day Bangkok’s old town due to the large number of royally imported,Paragraph
"Italian artists and architects. The Grand Palace’s new complex, including the",Paragraph
"Barommabhiman Palace and the Royal Innercourt division, the Dusit Palace complex,",Paragraph
"and a group of Ministries’ buildings along Rajdamnern Road, were among the foremost",Paragraph
evidences. Some of the outstanding Thai and foreign architects of the period included,Paragraph
"Prince Narissaranuwattiwongs (Vimanmek Palace and Benjamabopitr temple), Carl",Caption
"Dohring (Bangkhunprom Palace), and M.Tamanyo (Anantasamakom Palace).",Paragraph
"As favor for European-derived architecture grew, foreign artists, architects, and",Paragraph
"engineers flooded into the country to design new buildings, while many young Thai",Paragraph
scholars went aboard to study and also to experience the culture of the other hemisphere.,Paragraph
"When they returned to Thailand, many of them reset the standard of the Thai lifestyle,",Paragraph
"which in turn radically altered Thai mentality and daily life practices, and their influence",Paragraph
could be observed even more clearly in architecture of the later period; Western influence,Paragraph
"was manifested not merely by the exterior, but more importantly through the use of space",Paragraph
"and the emulation of Western daily life practices inside the building. Consequently, the",Paragraph
development of Thai architectural design from the 191 Os through the 1930s could be,Paragraph
"called an experimental period, the moment in which Thai architects attempted to create",Paragraph
"space that not only accompanied more “modern/civilized” practices, but also suited",Paragraph
tropical weather. Different combinations of materials and technology gave rise to various,Paragraph
"architectural styles and building forms, as can be seen in the architectural evidences of",Paragraph
the Marukkatayawan and the Klaikangvol Palaces.,Paragraph
"Meanwhile, in 1934, seven professional Thai architects, Pra-",Paragraph

"place where many of them were trained. In fact, the omnipresent trend of",Paragraph

period of time.,Paragraph

Such political incentive in architectural design became even more solidified through the,Paragraph
"rise of different political leaders after the political situations of the 1932 revolution,",Paragraph
"which changed the national political structure from absolute monarchy to democracy, and",Paragraph
after the rise of nationalism during World War II. The political fragments unwittingly,Paragraph
"geared Thai society toward a search for a unifying discourse, a way to express the",Paragraph
nation’s identity. The idea in designing public buildings shifted from the sole expression,Paragraph
"of the government, as had occurred in the dynastic dynamic, to the representation of",Paragraph
collective identity—a “modern” identity of democratic Thailand. The elaborate,Paragraph
decorative styles became outdated as they were seen to symbolize feudalism; modern,Paragraph
architectural style of different trends in Europe were adopted as a solution for an identity,Paragraph
"search, a situation resembling that of many other countries at the same period. The use of",Paragraph
simple geometric forms and a playful arrangement of both horizontal and vertical planes,Paragraph
became dominant. Although many of the contemporaneous buildings were destroyed,Paragraph
"during the bombing of World War II, one could still find images of buildings built during",Paragraph
"this period, such as the shophouse along Rajdamnern Road and that of the adjacent",Paragraph
neighborhoods including the former Chalerm-Thai theater.,Paragraph
"Within the decades following, Bangkok grew from a small Asian capital into a",Paragraph
medium-size international metropolitan city. International economic growth during the,Paragraph
1960s and 1970s resulted in a surge of the importation of newer architectural influences,Paragraph
"from abroad. The design goal in general was no longer to emulate Western modernity,",Paragraph
"but to drive Bangkok to reach “the international standard,” as represented by other",Paragraph
"metropolises. Modernism, particularly that of the International Style, became popular",Paragraph
"among Thai designers and architects, outdistancing other styles. High-rise buildings with",Paragraph
sun-shading elements and cement blocks took on a major part in changing the cityscape.,Paragraph
"New business districts emerged along Sukhumvit, Silom, Rama V, and Sathorn roads,",Paragraph
and the preceding ones around the old town began to fade away. All these changes,Paragraph
"affected the general layout of Bangkok, as the city began to grow toward the East and the",Paragraph
"North, while its old town, and the western part, including the Thonburi district across the",Paragraph
"Chao Phraya River, were left remaining more or less with its former skyline.",Paragraph
Another interesting architectural movement during 1960s was the revival of traditional,Paragraph
Thai-style architecture. Several designs of M.J.Samaichalerm and M.R.Mitrarun for royal,Caption
buildings and temporary ceremonial stands reflected the preference of following,Paragraph
"traditional architectural grammar, but with an adaptation of material and construction",Paragraph
technology. A similar attempt of Luang Visalsilpakarm could be seen in his designs of,Paragraph
"several Buddhist temples, including the elegant Wat Amarintraram. A younger generation",Paragraph
such as Pinyo Suwankiri evoked and grounded concerns for traditional Thai architecture,Paragraph
in many schools of architecture in Bangkok. The design of traditional Thai architecture in,Paragraph
"general, however, was utilized quite exclusively for royal and religious ceremonies and",Paragraph
related practices.,Paragraph
"Despite the challenges of unstable politics and military interference, the period from",Paragraph
"the 1970s to the 1980s was the beginning of the Bangkok real estate boom, which",Paragraph
continued into the next decade before it gradually slowed down by the mid-1990s. Given,Paragraph
the rapid growth of the population and the increasing number of immigrants from the,Paragraph
"countryside, housing and land development predominated over other forms of real estate",Paragraph
"investment. Agricultural land around Bangkok was developed into residential areas,",Paragraph
particularly that extending from the new business districts on the north and east sides.,Paragraph
no,Title
Newly developed and/ or rehabilitated villages sprang up and were eventually integrated,Paragraph
"to become the city’s new districts. Consequently, Bangkok kept growing with no fully",Paragraph
"restricting zoning control and proper transportation systems. In addition, the design for",Paragraph
Thai suburban real estate development suggested another challenging point in modern,Paragraph
"Thai architectural development in that, to begin with, it generally reflected that Thai",Paragraph
"architectural realm encompassed the most influential trend of the era, modernism, merely",Paragraph
through the use of materials and through the Western-replicating forms.,Paragraph
A slightly economic decline occurred during the end of 1970s and the beginning of,Paragraph
1980s when fears of Communism throughout Southeast Asia were compounded by,Paragraph
"political disturbance, along with the energy crisis. Yet the city kept growing, and the",Paragraph
"number of high-rise buildings in business districts eventually increased, following the",Paragraph
"strengthening of Thai politics and international connections. By the end of the 1980s,",Paragraph
more than half of today’s high-rise buildings in Bangkok’s downtown were constructed.,Paragraph
"The headquarters of banks and financial companies lined Silom, Sathorn, and Sukhumvit",Paragraph
"Roads. The offices of Bangkok Bank on Silom Road, designed by Krisda Arunwongs,",Caption
"and Thai Farmer Bank on Paholyuthin Road, designed by Rangsan Torsuwan, created a",Paragraph
"stir in the Thai architectural design movement, as their designs were the very first",Paragraph
recognizable construction of the grand-scale high-rise office buildings. The completion of,Paragraph
"an international award-wining robot-shape Asia Bank building, designed by Sumet",Paragraph
"Jumsai, enhanced the world’s recognition of modern Thai architecture. The peak moment",Paragraph
of Thai high-rise building culminated with the completion of the one-time tallest,Paragraph
"reinforced concrete building in Asia, Baiyoke Building, in 1987, designed in chief by an",Paragraph
"architectural team from Plan Architect, underscoring a virtual transformation of",Paragraph
Bangkok’s skyline.,Paragraph
"During the late 1980s, flat slab and glass wall construction came into favor in",Paragraph
designing Bangkok’s high-rise architecture. The growth of the Thai concrete and glass-,Paragraph
wall industries supported the movement. The general design of the trend’s new high-rise,Paragraph
"buildings, such as Thai Airways Building, Sin Asia Building, and Orkarn Building, thus",Paragraph
differentiated itself from its predecessors with the surface design’s material and a more,Paragraph
"elaborate interior decoration. To architects, designing with flat slab and glass wall",Paragraph
"became, for some time, fashionably intrinsic to high-rise architecture. Yet, to the general",Paragraph
"public’s perception, buildings with linear strips such as the two Headquarters of Bangkok",Paragraph
Bank and Shell Gas Company exemplified the majority of Bangkok’s architecture in the,Paragraph
"1980s, but the cloud reflection on the mirror wall of the new Thai Airways office",Caption
building on Vipavadee Road induced their imagination of the future Bangkok.,Paragraph
"Meanwhile, another architectural trend was introduced to Bangkok through the",Paragraph
Postmodernism influence. The neoclassical style Amarintr shopping plaza twisted the,Paragraph
"atmosphere of Erawan Square, from a postwar-World War II] modern architectural",Paragraph
"environment to a reconstructed 19th-century European atmosphere. Yet, as time passed,",Paragraph
"the Postmodernist trend lost its popularity among architects, but its influence was rooted",Paragraph
"in the design of individual houses, luxurious housing development in particular.",Paragraph
The continuing escalation of the Thai economy during the early 1990s was a key to the,Paragraph
construction of many grand-scale buildings. The National Queen Sirikit Convention,Caption
"Center, designed by Design 103 Architects firm, purposely built to serve as an",Paragraph
"international convention center, shed light on the use of high-span structure and the",Paragraph
concern for energy conservation. The form itself exemplified other buildings in which the,Paragraph
"architects attempted to combine the form of traditional Thai architecture, the pointed roof",Paragraph
"in particular, with modern architectural elements. Yet, even though the “East-meets-",Paragraph
"West” situation has been a longtime concern of modern Thai architects, thus far it has not",Paragraph
"yet been fully developed, either in terms of form or concept. The closest was that of Dan",Paragraph
Wongsprasat’s design of Regent Hotel on Sathorn Road; the architect integrated the,Paragraph
design for tropical weather with the simplified form of Thai Panya-roof house into the,Paragraph

included Sumet Jumsai’s design of the Dome Building at the new campus of Thammasat,Caption
University and the Moblex Firm’s design of the Rajmongkol Conference Center inside,Paragraph
the Suang Luang Public Garden.,Paragraph
In contrast to the architects’ struggle in conceptualizing and refining modern Thai,Paragraph
"architecture, traditional Thai architecture during the last half of the century is well",Paragraph
regarded and more developed. The complex of Ruen Thai architecture at Chulalongkorn,Paragraph
"University, designed by Pinyu Suwankiri, has become a significant prototype for late-",Paragraph

"BANHAM, REYNER 1922-88",Title
"Architectural historian and critic, England",Title
Reyner Banham was an iconoclastic British architectural historian and design critic,Paragraph
whose irreverent writings spanned an enormous range of topics and audiences—,Paragraph
"everything from traditional architectural history to discipline-bending academic studies,",Paragraph
from advocacy criticism for his avant-gardist contemporaries to journalistic popular,Paragraph
culture reviews. Trained first as an aeronautical engineer and only later as an architectural,Paragraph
"historian under Nikolaus Pevsner at the Courtauld Institute in London, Banham was",Paragraph
fascinated by questions of technology and technological expression. Acting something,Paragraph
"like modernism’s guilty conscience, he challenged mid-20th-century architecture to",Paragraph
realize its earlier unfulfilled promises of functionalism and machine aesthetics.,Paragraph
"Simultaneously, he celebrated the actual technological achievements realized by the",Paragraph
popular cultures of the industrialized world. He turned a sharp eye toward the potato,Paragraph
"crisp, cult films, surfboards, California air shows, and London Raves and found in them",Paragraph
the promises and achievements of a culture living at the speed of the machine.,Paragraph
After leaving behind his wartime career as an aeronautical engineer and a short-lived,Paragraph
"career as a newspaper art critic, Banham enrolled in the prestigious Courtauld Institute.",Paragraph
"There, he quickly won the admiration of Pevsner and within a few short years found",Paragraph
himself in dialogue with London’s most interesting architects and artists and on the staff,Paragraph
"ofthe . Like many around him during the difficult postwar years, Banham developed a",Paragraph
strange joint infatuation—on the one hand obsessed with the inaccessible splendor of,Paragraph
U.S. consumerism and on the other admiring the late Surrealist and Abstract,Paragraph
Expressionist strategies of formlessness and material ineloquence. The fusion of these,Paragraph
two gave rise to the so-called Independent Group in London—a group of Pop-affiliated,Paragraph
"artists and architects that included Banham, Peter and Alison Smithson, Eduardo",Paragraph
"Paolozzi, Lawrence Alloway, Richard Hamilton, John McHale, and Nigel Henderson,",Paragraph
among others—out of which commenced Banham’s struggle to craft an During this,Paragraph
"period, he was the studio critic for the movement known as New Brutalism and",Paragraph
passionately endorsed its material and technological facticity and its proto-Pop interests,Paragraph
in American advertising.,Paragraph
"With the publication of his doctoral dissertation in 1960, Banham",Paragraph
gave academic rigor to his earlier enthusiasms. In a rich and convincing,Paragraph
"study, he outlined two competing tendencies within the history of the",Paragraph
"Modern movement, one compositional and traditional, the other dynamic",Paragraph
"and technological. Upending the familiar arguments, Banham claimed that",Paragraph
"the International Style, often considered to be a functionalist architecture,",Paragraph
was in fact essentially a symbolic and aesthetic movement. In,Paragraph
"contradistinction, Banham championed the work of the early-20th-century",Paragraph
"Italian Futurists and Buckminster Fuller, whom he claimed had more fully",Paragraph
"internalized the dynamism of machine-age culture. Quoting Fuller,",Paragraph
Banham characterized technology as “the unhaltable trend to constantly,Paragraph
accelerating change.” He concluded with a polemical challenge to the,Paragraph
profession:,Title
The architect who proposes to run with technology knows now that he,Paragraph
"will be in fast company, and that, in order to keep up, he may have to",Paragraph
"emulate the futurists and discard the whole cultural load, including the",Paragraph
"professional garments by which he is recognized as an architect. (Banham,",Paragraph
1960),Title
Extrapolating from the conclusions of | Banham wrote a number of essays in the 1960s,Paragraph
that examined the impact of “second” machine-age technologies on architecture. With an,Paragraph
"eye toward things such as television, inflatable buildings, demountable geodesic domes,",Paragraph
"mobile homes, and “architecture-less” drive-in movie theaters, Banham argued that the",Paragraph
traditional architectural virtues of permanence and monumentality were becoming,Paragraph
"increasingly irrelevant. As he put it,",Paragraph
"When your house contains such a complex of piping, flues, ducts, wires,",Paragraph
"lights, inlets, outlets, ovens, sinks, refuse disposers, hi-fi reverberators,",Paragraph
"antennae, conduits, freezers, heaters—when it contains so many services",Paragraph
that the hardware could stand up by itself without any assistance from the,Paragraph
"house, why have a house to hold it up?... what is the house doing except",Paragraph
concealing your mechanical pudenda from the stares of folks on the,Paragraph
"sidewalk? (Banham, 1960)",Caption
"This line of argument reached its zenith, at least in an academic sense, with the",Paragraph
publication in 1969 of Banham’s discipline-stretching study . Discreetly posing as a,Paragraph
"history of environmental technologies (for example, lighting, ventilation, heating, and air",Paragraph
"conditioning) and loosely extrapolated from Sigfried Giedion’s canonical (1950), in",Paragraph
actuality Banham’s argument was a revisionist end run around the genealogy of,Paragraph
"modernism, an attempt to imagine (and instigate) an architectural future.",Paragraph
"However, any description of Banham would be only half complete if it ended with his",Paragraph
vision of the good life lived mechanically in a “polythene bag.” Just as surely as Banham,Paragraph
"was a careful reader of science, he was also an enthusiastic reader of science fiction. His",Paragraph
was a pop sensibility as comfortable with robots and Martians and bikini-clad warriors as,Paragraph
"with ventilator flows. From his earliest days with the Independent Group, Banham had",Paragraph
celebrated the excessive technological imagery of the American post-war consumer,Paragraph
"boom. He wrote lovingly of Detroit’s baroque chrome ornament, the physiognomy of the",Paragraph
"American hamburger, drag racing and custom-car culture, ice cream wagons, and even",Paragraph
"Disneyland, Coca-Cola, and the Santa Monica Pier. Given these infatuations, it was",Paragraph
"probably inevitable that Banham would find himself drawn to the United States, and after",Paragraph
"several extended study and research tours in the mid-1960s, he eventually relocated for",Paragraph
"good in 1976, first to Buffalo and then to California.",Paragraph
It was with the California dream of a tanned noble savage—that New World polyglot,Paragraph
"of surfboards, rock and roll, balloon frames, freeways, “gizmos,” and mad scientists—",Paragraph
that Banham discovered his long-sought synthesis between the cultures of consumerist,Paragraph
affluence and technological potlatch. His brilliant 1971 book paints a celebratory,Paragraph
picture of a city infused with the rhythms of bodies and cultures in motion. With its,Paragraph
"bronzed warriors, endless sunshine, and endless freeways (which necessitated that he",Paragraph
"learn to drive in order to “read Los Angeles in the original”), Banham had found at last an",Paragraph
urbanism in which “mobility outweighs monumentality” and that sparkled with the,Paragraph
"fantasies of endless selftinvention and renewal. For Banham, Los Angeles was “a",Paragraph
"reasonable facsimile of Eden” (Banham, 1971).",Caption
The impact of Banham’s writings echoed into the second half of the 20th century. If at,Paragraph
times his critique of the profession of architecture seemed totalizing and radically,Paragraph
"pessimistic, when he did discover architects whom he liked—figures as diverse as",Paragraph
"Archigram, Bruce Goff, the Japanese megastructuralists, or James Stirling—Banham’s",Paragraph
"wide-eyed enthusiasms proved disarmingly contagious. His obsessions with hygiene,",Paragraph
"waste, and the nonvisual body undoubtedly will only continue to grow in theoretical",Paragraph
"importance. His eloquence on behalf of the American techno-vernacular had, with the",Paragraph
"exception perhaps of J.B.Jackson, no equal; and, if regrettably some of Banham’s",Paragraph
"writings now seem compromised by an irreverent sensibility—long on the furry, the",Paragraph

BANK OF CHINA TOWER,Title
Designed by I.M.Pei and Partners; completed 1989 Hong Kong,Caption
"Notable for its place in the late-20th-century skyline of Hong Kong, the Bank of China",Paragraph
"Tower, the headquarters of the Bank in Hong Kong designed by I.M.Pei and Partners and",Paragraph
"completed in 1989, is located two blocks away from the old bank building in central",Paragraph
"Hong Kong island. Surrounded by major roads on three sides, the tower rises from a",Paragraph
square footprint placed at the center of the small two-acre trapezoidal site. Measuring,Caption
"1,209 feet to the tip of the twin masts in 70 stories, the tower was the tallest structure",Paragraph
outside the United States at completion.,Paragraph
The building is acclaimed for its elegant form and structural ingenuity. The tower can,Paragraph
be divided into two parts: the curtain-walled shaft resting on a three-story granite-clad,Paragraph
"base. The base, with a castellated top, is designed to give the building visual protection",Paragraph
from the chaotic surrounding of major roadways. The allusion to an ancient Chinese city,Paragraph
"wall in the design of the base is unmistakable. As the site slopes up from north to south,",Paragraph
the base absorbs the slope and provides the building with two entrances at different,Paragraph
levels. The northern entrance has an arched opening that leads into a barrel-vaulted lobby,Caption
where elevator banks are placed for access to the office tower. The southern entrance at,Paragraph
"the upper level leads into the banking hall. Located right above the base, the hall is",Paragraph
surrounded on three sides by a floor-to-ceiling curtain wall screened with heavy vertical,Paragraph
"mullions. This screen wall, decorated with a diagonally placed squares motif used in",Paragraph
"Pei’s Fragrance Hill Hotel in Beijing, helps to make the transition from the heavy base to",Paragraph
the light curtain-walled tower. Above the information counter in the hall is a 14-story,Caption
"square atrium that brings daylight into the center of the hall. However, because of the",Paragraph
"narrowness of the atrium, very little light manages to filter into the hall. Around the",Paragraph
"atrium are the offices for the bank, and above these floors are speculative offices. The",Paragraph
boardroom for the bank is located at the apex of the tower under sloped glass roofs,Caption
supported by massive steel trusses.,Caption
"Although the building is set back from Victoria harbor by a block, its shimmering",Paragraph
"facade never fails to attract attention from across the water, the principal vantage point of",Paragraph
the famed Hong Kong skyline. This is due entirely to the elegant form of the building.,Paragraph
The tower is made up of a square shaft cut by the two diagonals into four triangular,Paragraph
segments. Each segment terminates at a different height with a large sloping roof. The,Paragraph
"effect is said by Pei to be like bundling four sticks of different heights together,",Paragraph
symbolizing rising bamboo stalks with its auspicious connotation in Chinese culture. The,Paragraph
form of the building is said to be the result of a long search by Pei for an appropriate,Paragraph
form for a late-20th-century skyscraper. Dissatisfied with the conventional rectangular,Paragraph
"tower of the International Style and the neo-classical pastiche of Postmodernism, Pei",Caption
attempts to seek a new form in the Bank of China Tower that is structurally honest and,Paragraph
"innovative while aesthetically genuine to its region. Because of the diagonal cut, the",Paragraph
"building contains six facades tapering toward the tip, each face covered with silver-",Paragraph
coated reflective glass that catches light from different directions at different times of the,Paragraph
"day, resulting in a glittering appearance.",Paragraph
Pei’s tower is similarly important for its structural inventiveness. Designed in,Paragraph
"collaboration with Leslie E.Robertson, the main structure consists of four corner",Paragraph
composite columns of reinforced concrete that carry the building load to the ground. In,Paragraph
"addition, a central column to support the four segments of the tower is placed between the",Paragraph
"top of the building to the 25th floor, at which point the load is transferred to the corners.",Paragraph
The five-column tower is reminiscent of ancient Chinese pagoda forms with a heavy,Paragraph
central column and four supporting corner columns. It is at these corners that both,Paragraph
"vertical and lateral loads meet and where vertical, horizontal, and diagonal steel members",Paragraph
meet in the encasing reinforced-concrete columns. Designed to withstand the severe,Paragraph
"typhoon winds of Hong Kong, the structural frame was conceived by Robertson as a huge",Paragraph
"three-dimensional space frame, a structural solution that is extremely efficient and less",Paragraph
costly than a conventional structural steel frame. In order to express the structure on the,Paragraph
"facade, Pei first proposed a curtain-wall system that accentuated the structural frame,",Paragraph
resulting in a series of crosses on the elevations. This proposal was not accepted by the,Paragraph
"client, who feared that the crosses might carry negative associations. Pei then modified",Paragraph
the design to recess the horizontal elements of the bracing system and turn them into,Paragraph
"steel. This design, explained by Pei as a series of diamonds, seamlessly integrates the",Paragraph
structure with aesthetics.,Paragraph
The meaning of the building’s form has been a subject of intense,Paragraph
speculation in Hong Kong society. The four triangular,Paragraph
"Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong,",Caption
designed by I.M.Pei,Caption
© GreatBuildings.com,Title
shafts of the building resulted in sharp corners. According to the principles and beliefs of,Paragraph
"the ancient Chinese art of reading the house form for auspicious or bad influences, these",Paragraph
edges are regarded as exerting malignant forces on the occupants of facing buildings.,Paragraph
"Thus, the building is said to have a negative impact on neighboring buildings. For",Paragraph
"masters, the corners are like sharp knife blades, and devices must be placed in",Paragraph
"surrounding buildings, including the Government House (the residence and office of the",Paragraph
"colonial Governor of Hong Kong), to ward off negative influences coming from the",Paragraph
tower.,Paragraph
The taller and more elegant Bank of China Tower has always been compared to the,Paragraph
"Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Headquarters by Norman Foster. However, what Pei has",Paragraph
"ultimately achieved in the tower, his last skyscraper, is a modernist statement of",Paragraph
structural integrity and honesty of expression in a multifaceted sculptural form. The,Paragraph

landmark achievement in concrete construction. Designed by Clorindo Testa in,Caption
"association with SEPRA architects, the introverted building presents a robust concrete",Paragraph
facade that belies a seductive and subdued labyrinthine interior. Set within a context of,Paragraph
"formal neoclassical architecture from the 19th century, the cleverly orchestrated design",Paragraph
mediates between the busy and crowded Argentinian streets and the methodical operation,Paragraph
of the bank headquarters. It compliments the urban fabric in a manner that is both,Paragraph
charismatic and controlled.,Paragraph
The building was constructed at a time of tremendous economic turbulence in,Paragraph
"Argentina, resulting from political changes internally and the rampant tension across",Paragraph
Latin America that had culminated in the Cuban revolution of 1959. The election of,Paragraph
Arturo Frondizi as president of Argentina in 1958 had introduced sweeping reforms to,Paragraph
"the economic, political, and cultural policy of the country, designed to dispel discontent",Paragraph
and to reform the inward-looking Argentine economy. Frondizi instigated an urgent,Paragraph
"program of westernization, targeting rapid development through increased levels of",Paragraph
foreign investment and the growth of local industry. The new headquarters for the Bank,Paragraph
of London and South America was the first by-product of this new economic policy. The,Paragraph
building was to represent a rekindling of ties between Britain and Argentina that had,Paragraph
gradually been eroded since the beginning of World War II. As a mark of sincerity,Paragraph
"toward this objective, the foundation stone for the building was laid by Prince Philip, the",Paragraph
"Duke of Edinburgh, in March 1962.",Paragraph
"The building already on the site, the former headquarters of the bank (designed in",Paragraph
"1867 by the architects Hunt and Schroeder), was demolished in May 1961. The first stage",Paragraph
"of construction was begun in December 1962, and the inauguration of the building took",Paragraph
place in August 1966. The design of the building was the outcome of an invited,Paragraph
competition undertaken by four Argentinian practices between January and May 1960.,Paragraph
The commission was awarded to the well-established local firm SEPRA (Santiago,Paragraph
"Sanchez Elia, Fredrico Peralta Ramos, and Alfredo Agostini), who had collaborated with",Paragraph
"the local artist and architect Clorindo Testa in their design proposal. Testa, who was more",Paragraph
"than a decade younger than the other three members of the design team, had previously",Paragraph
worked with SEPRA on numerous urban projects for the city and became instrumental in,Paragraph
the design and realization of the finished building.,Paragraph
Occupying the corner of a busy intersection in the historical business district of,Paragraph
"Buenos Aires, the building responds to the demanding neoclassical context by filling the",Paragraph
"rectangular site with a chiseled, extruded block measuring 45 by 75 meters in plan. The",Paragraph
"massive structure is hewn from concrete, which, unlike steel, could be produced locally",Paragraph
and required a less-skilled workforce. The two public facades of the building are,Caption
"protected by monolithic, layered concrete screens that curve outward at the top, providing",Paragraph
a more generous pedestrian area at the base. The fluid concrete walls are punctuated by,Paragraph
seductive rounded openings to allow light to enter. This acts as a curtain providing a,Paragraph
mediation between the narrow street and the cavernous interior of the bank. Behind the,Paragraph
"dramatic concrete curtains, which carry the structural load of the massive roof, is another",Paragraph
"layer of glazing, which provides a climatic and acoustic barrier from the street. The two",Paragraph
imposing skirts fold back at the corner to reveal the glazed curtain wall that marks the,Paragraph
"entrance to the building. A large, unadorned concrete blade wall folds over at the roof",Paragraph
"level in the manner of a giant eyelid, enclosing the outdoor foyer space and revealing the",Paragraph
"underside of the vaulted canopy, providing a shaded undercarriage as a refuge from the",Paragraph
busy and confined street space beyond. The gesture at the corner addresses not only the,Paragraph
"entry but also the opposing buildings of the intersection, disappearing seamlessly into the",Paragraph
urban context.,Paragraph
"The building houses 1,500 employees of the bank and provides office space in excess",Paragraph
"of 10,000 meters squared. The complex yet sculptural interior layout, dominated by",Paragraph
"floating mezzanines and the powerful mass of the circulation cores, distributes the office",Paragraph
space over six levels. Services and car parking are contained in three subterranean floors.,Paragraph
"The palette of materials consists of richly formatted reinforced concrete throughout, light",Paragraph
"timber trimmings, and a deep red painted finish.",Caption
The interior of the building is open and uncluttered by structural supports. The floating,Paragraph
"floor slabs are supported by the concrete core of the lift shafts, the separate banks of",Paragraph
"stairs, and the sculpted columns that support the exterior walls, tapering at both the base",Paragraph
and apex. This adds a legibility to the structural system and also frees the plan of,Paragraph
"intermediate supports, allowing for a fluid and unobstructed spatiality inside the building.",Paragraph
The fluid concrete beams on the underside of the floating intermediate levels taper back,Paragraph
to elegantly house lighting and airconditioning ducts.,Paragraph
The monumental simplicity of the building has played an important role in the context,Paragraph
of architectural history not only in Argentina but across the world. The sculptural,Paragraph
"building can be seen as influential to avant-garde movements such as Archigram,",Paragraph
"Metabolism, and the Brutalism of Paul Rudolph and, more recently in the curvilinear",Paragraph

concurrence with the arrival of Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer into this country in,Paragraph
"1937. He closed his office in 1994, just as a reinvention of modernism appeared to be",Paragraph
"launched. During the intervening years, Barnes crafted an array of private houses notable",Paragraph
"for their clarity in plan, volume, and landscaping. The houses exist as a series of",Paragraph
"education! and cultural buildings, instructive for the sensitivity of their siting and",Paragraph
responsiveness to a larger context. Barnes’s body of work also includes several office,Paragraph
"buildings, note- worthy for their dedication to Louis Sullivan’s theme of the tall building,",Paragraph
artistically considered.,Paragraph
"Barnes was born in Chicago in 1915, to parents who were successful in their chosen",Paragraph
"careers of law and writing. He attended preparatory school in the East, and received his",Paragraph
"undergraduate education at Harvard College. Following a brief teaching stint, Barnes",Paragraph
"returned to Harvard to study under Gropius and Breuer, graduating in 1942 with a",Paragraph
master’s degree in architecture.,Paragraph
"Barnes’s wartime career included a year in Washington, D.C., at the Division of",Paragraph
Defense Housing and service as an architect with the Naval Reserve at Hunter’s Point in,Paragraph
"San Francisco. At the close of the war, Barnes joined the offices of architect William",Paragraph
"W.Wurster in San Francisco, and industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss in Los Angeles.",Paragraph
"With Dreyfuss, Barnes designed a prefabricated house for Consolidated Vultee Aircraft,",Paragraph
"scheduled for mass production. In 1949 Barnes returned East with his wife, Mary, and",Paragraph
opened an office in New York City.,Paragraph
"Like a number of his Harvard contemporaries including Henry Cobb, Ulrich Frazen,",Paragraph
"John Johansen, Philip Johnson, and I.M.Pei, Barnes entered the profession during a time",Paragraph
"of rapid economic expansion, and increased demand for new construction at all levels,",Paragraph
"including residential, institutional, and commercial. For Barnes and the others, the",Paragraph
"national growth combined with talent, personal connections, and luck led to rapid",Paragraph
recognition and robust practices by the mid-1950s.,Paragraph
"Barnes’s body of work, while infused with a modernist acknowledgment of the",Paragraph
"specificities of each project, exudes no dogmatic or easily definable style. His legacy is a",Paragraph
dedication to an overall organizing idea derived from the complexities of each,Paragraph
"commission, distilled in a rationally ordered plan.",Paragraph
"The Osborn House (1949-51) in Salisbury, Connecticut, typifies a group of early",Paragraph
"Barnes houses, with a site plan that creates a distinct precinct within an open meadow,",Paragraph
augmented by carefully considered connections between individual rooms and the,Paragraph
adjacent landscape. In time Barnes extended this strategy to increasingly individualized,Paragraph

"Camp Anita, 1953-55, Fishkill, New York). At the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts",Caption
"(1958-63) in Deer Isle, Maine, Barnes combined a bold master plan—running down the",Paragraph

elements. Although the individual buildings at Haystack are one-story volumes,Paragraph
"constructed of unfinished wood boards, their geometry and the system that orders their",Paragraph

making the experience of place an emotional and practical one. While Barnes described,Paragraph
his overriding concept as the construction of “a typical Maine fishing village” (minutes of,Paragraph
"the Board of Trustees, Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, 26 July 1959), the simplicity",Paragraph
and inevitability of such a conceit is the product of the architect’s thoughtful design,Paragraph
decisions. In 1994 Haystack Mountain School of Crafts received the American Institute,Paragraph
of Architects (AIA) award for an exemplary American building of 25 years of age or,Paragraph
"more. It remains the masterwork of his career. Following Haystack, Barnes designed a",Paragraph

"With the Walker Art Center (1966-71, addition in 1984) in Minneapolis, Minnesota,",Paragraph
Barnes first tackled the program of an art museum; he arranged seven galleries and three,Paragraph
"roof terraces around a central service core. The galleries, individualized by their",Paragraph
"proportions and apertures, defer in authority to the artwork. Here, the architect",Paragraph
emphasized movement through space over discrete destinations. At the Dallas Museum,Caption

"scale of the overall enterprise and, as with the early houses, allows the development of",Paragraph
independent relationships between interior galleries and exterior gardens.,Paragraph
"Although Barnes was lauded in his commercial work, it was more for his articulation",Paragraph
of surface than for his design plan or volume; two towers stand out for the clarity of their,Paragraph
"overall design. The New England Merchants National Bank (1963-71) in Boston,",Caption
"Massachusetts, addresses a sloping site and a complex of disparate civic buildings at its",Paragraph
"base, including the Old State House and the new city hall (1962-67, Kallmann",Caption
McKinnell and Knowles). The articulation of the crown expresses the presence of a,Paragraph
"restaurant and an executive office suite. In between, a tight surface patterned by ribbons",Paragraph
of window and wall convey repetitive office floors. At the IBM tower (1973-83) in New,Caption
"York City, a similar scheme provides for an entrance base, a clear tower shaft (here",Paragraph

Geoffrey Bawa is a rare architect whose work combines an environmentally,Paragraph
appropriate beauty with a cultural sensitivity. Bawa was educated within the modernist,Paragraph
"tradition in the West, where he was trained both as a lawyer and as an architect. An",Paragraph
"urbane, widely read, and well-traveled person, he remains rooted in the soil of his native",Paragraph
land. His buildings are predicated on the landscape and climate—he is as much an,Paragraph
architect of landscape as he is of buildings.,Paragraph
"To Bawa, the pitched roof is the archetype of southern Asian architecture. It is the",Paragraph
"dominant element that governs his aesthetic, in which shape, texture, and proportion are",Paragraph
"the strongest visual factors in his buildings. The great roof, with the building’s sides open",Paragraph
"to the flow of air and the view, give “presence to both function and form, to admit beauty",Paragraph
"and pleasure as well as purpose” (as told to the author, 1984). Another important feature",Paragraph
"of his work deals with movement through the building, modulated by the rooms,",Paragraph
"passages, and courtyards that frame vistas or parts of the landscape. Of equal importance",Paragraph
"is the play of light, in both the built areas and the “rooms” of the landscaping, which",Paragraph
"gives pleasure in addition to giving comfortable, functional use of the spaces. Bawa pays",Paragraph
"careful attention to detail, ranging from the expression of structure to the furnishing of",Paragraph
"rooms, regardless of the scale of the project.",Paragraph
Bawa has been fortunate to be in the position to choose his projects and select clients,Paragraph
"who are sympathetic to his approach. They include artists and intellectuals, private",Paragraph
"institutions, and government. The perception and organizational skills of his longtime",Paragraph
"partner, Dr. Poologasundram, an engineer, has enabled the Bawa to realize the buildings",Paragraph
"as conceived. He has worked with several others in his office for many years, and they",Paragraph
"also assist him in the development of his ideas. However, Bawa remains the principal and",Paragraph
controls every aspect of the design.,Paragraph
"Bawa designs using numerous freehand sketches, while simultaneously working on",Paragraph
"the site layout plan, section, elevation, and details. His partners and colleagues begin to",Paragraph
formalize the work with schematic and working drawings. Often construction drawings,Paragraph
and details are discussed with the craftsman and are changed. In the mode of the master,Paragraph
"architect, Bawa will alter his design on-site while the building is under construction. This",Paragraph
technique was even used on his large Parliament Complex Colombo which was built by a,Paragraph
"Japanese company on a turnkey basis, but Bawa’s on-site decisions and solutions proved",Paragraph
better and more cost-effective than the original plan.,Paragraph
"His personal residences best illustrate his approach to design. His country house,",Paragraph
"Lunuganga, has been a continuing project since 1950. Set in a garden of 25 acres, the",Paragraph
"house and its free-standing pavilions overlook terraces and a lake, and illustrate his",Paragraph
concerns with site and the expression of a contemporary vernacular. He has periodically,Paragraph
"added new buildings and elements, such as a large concrete chess set and a grove of trees",Paragraph
and benches. Each of the pavilions has its own character and fits into its natural setting. It,Paragraph
"is perhaps his masterpiece, and was once described by one of the workmen as “a sacred",Paragraph
"place.” His principal residence in Colombo dates from 1969, and consists of four",Paragraph
townhouses joined together with multiple small courtyards and a maze of rooms. It,Paragraph

Peter Behrens was one of the most prolific architects of his generation. He created,Paragraph
"buildings ranging from embassies, monuments, bridges, churches, and giant factories to",Paragraph
"domestic houses, workers’ estates, and apartment blocks. He also became the first",Paragraph
"industrial designer in the modern sense; he was responsible for mass-produced furniture,",Paragraph
"textiles, cutlery, ceramics, and glass in addition to his well-known range of electrical",Paragraph
"appliances for the AEG, or General Electric Company. His graphic work was enormously",Paragraph
"successful, and he was active in theater design, calligraphy, and typography. He was a",Paragraph
"teacher and a writer, and he had a strong influence on the development of his assistants,",Paragraph
who were to become the most celebrated architects of the next generation. Behrens was,Paragraph
"born in St. Georg, Hamburg, and he was the son of a landowner who did not marry his",Paragraph
"mother. Both his parents died when he was young, and he was reared by a guardian from",Paragraph
"the age of 14. On leaving school in Altona in 1886, he chose to study art and attended the",Paragraph
"Gewerbeschule, Hamburg, and the Kunstschule, Karlsruhe, until 1889, before becoming",Paragraph
first a pupil of Ferdinand Briitt in Dusseldorf and then of Hugo Kotschenreiter in Munich.,Paragraph
Behrens went through various phases in his painting style; at first he was influenced by,Paragraph
"the realist and impressionist work of Dutch-German and Dutch artists, such as Wilhelm",Paragraph
"Leib] and Max Liebermann, before turning to studio compositions of a more symbolist",Paragraph
approach. Behrens never sought or acquired formal qualifications as an architect. In the,Paragraph
"later 1890s, while still living in Munich, he executed a number of woodcuts in a flat,",Paragraph
linear style and became drawn into the group that formed the Vereinigten Werkstatten fiir,Paragraph
"Kunst im Handwerk, designing and exhibiting ceramics, glass, jewelry, furniture, and",Paragraph
"women’s clothing. His large woodcut, (1898), became one of the best-known images of",Paragraph
"Jugendstil, or German Art Nouveau.",Paragraph
"In July 1899, as a result of his reputation as an artist and designer, he was invited to",Paragraph
"join the artists’ colony at Darmstadt, which was being established under the patronage of",Paragraph
"Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig of Hessen. This colony was planned and launched with ducal,",Paragraph
"government, and industrial support to stimulate the role of applied art in the local",Paragraph
economy and to bring prestige to the city. The seven artists brought together at Darmstadt,Paragraph
"were to be a free creative community, and to exhibit their work regularly; they were to",Paragraph
"live in houses designed by the Austrian architect Joseph Maria Olbrich, with the",Paragraph
"exception of Behrens, who designed his own.",Paragraph
"This house, his first, was to accommodate himself, his wife, and their two young",Paragraph
"children. It was intended, like the other houses of the _(artists’ colony), to be at once a",Paragraph
"dwelling and a permanent exhibit of the new architecture, a statement of a way of living",Paragraph
and a model of style.,Paragraph
"Behrens’s house is basically cubic in form, with a red-tiled pyramidal roof. A gable",Paragraph
"dominates the main facade, and the plain white walls are relieved with decorative pilaster",Paragraph
"strips, quoins, and architraves in molded green-glazed bricks. Internally, the ground floor",Caption
is comprised of an entrance hall with wide sliding screens that open into a music room,Paragraph
"that in turn connect to a dining room, so that virtually the whole space can be unified",Paragraph
when desired. The studio is a principal room upstairs. Behrens designed all the interior,Caption
"decorations—the furniture, carpets, curtains, light fittings, cutlery, glass, china, and",Paragraph
linen—in harmony. He and his house played a major role in the 1901 exhibition of the,Paragraph

Of importance to his growing reputation was his contribution to the First International,Paragraph
Exhibition of Modern Decorative Arts in Turin in 1902. He was responsible for the,Paragraph
"Hamburger Vorhalle, a powerfully modeled, cryptlike, top-lit hall. It may be considered",Paragraph
"the most Art Nouveau of Behrens’s architectural works, and the strongest expression of",Paragraph
"his admiration for Frederich Nietzsche’s philosophy. Following this, his architecture",Paragraph
"became more rectilmear and geometric, and indeed it remained so for the rest of his",Paragraph
career.,Paragraph
"In 1903 Behrens moved to Diisseldorf, where he had been appointed director of the",Paragraph
"School of Arts and Crafts. In that year, he traveled in England and Scotland, visiting",Paragraph
houses by Edwin Lutyens and Charles Rennie Mackintosh. A striking demonstration of,Paragraph
"Behrens’s new, coolly geometrical style was seen in the garden layout and pavilion that",Paragraph
he designed for the Diisseldorf Gartenbau und Kunstausstellung (Garden Design and,Paragraph
Pavilion) of 1904. In harmony with the restaurant pavilion (which Behrens furnished with,Paragraph
"Mackintosh-like ladder-backed chairs) were rectangular white latticework pergolas,",Paragraph
"creating what was described as “habitable nature, a living room in the open air” (Osborn).",Paragraph

The modern face of Beirut hides the city’s long architectural and urban history. Recent,Paragraph
"archaeological excavations, generated by the post-civil war reconstruction, have provided",Paragraph
further evidence that different civilizations have continuously inhabited the city since at,Paragraph
least the Iron Age. Hardly any architectural landmarks remain from before the 19th,Paragraph
"century, with the exception of some religious buildings. Beirut remained a secondary",Paragraph
"settlement to other cities along the eastern Mediterranean coast, such as Tripoli and",Paragraph
"Damascus until 1831, when Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt, in his failed insurrection against the",Paragraph
"Ottomans, took it as a base, and attracted merchants and consuls. Since then, the city has",Paragraph
"grown from a town of 10,000 to a metropolitan district of about 1.5 million today.",Paragraph
"The early years of growth were supported by many Ottoman modernization projects,",Paragraph
conducted mostly through concessions to European companies. These included harbor,Paragraph
"expansion, public utilities, military facilities, and transportation networks, and most",Paragraph
"notably, the toll road to Damascus (1863). Buildings such as the Orozdi Bek Department",Paragraph
"Store (1900), the Arts and Crafts School (1914), including some of its extramural",Paragraph
"residential quarters and missionary educational facilities, display a Mediterranean",Paragraph
architectural character that attests to the open cultural exchange at the time.,Paragraph
"During World War I, Beirut suffered a famine, losing much of its population of",Paragraph
"100,000. A major urban-planning endeavor was mounted by the Ottomans, that would be",Paragraph
completed during the French mandate (1918-43) in the form of Place de l’Etoile. The,Paragraph
mandate created a new nation-state—Greater Lebanon—with Beirut as its capital. With,Paragraph
"the exception of urban improvements in the city center, the mandate continued the",Paragraph
"modernization-by-concession process started by the Ottomans. It was not until 1932, in",Paragraph
"the face of social tensions caused in part by the Great Depression, that an attempt at",Paragraph
large-scale urban planning began. Two master plans were advanced: one by the Danger,Paragraph
Brothers in 1932 and one by Michel Ecochard in 1942. The first created commercial,Paragraph
"centers for new residential areas, while the second introduced a major road network",Paragraph
linking the port and airport with the hinterland. Neither plan was implemented.,Paragraph
The building of the city’s new quarters and institutions was carried out by some of its,Paragraph
"established architects, including Yousif Aftimos and Mardiros Altounian. Aftimos helped",Paragraph
"develop the ornate facade architecture of the new avenues in the city center, such as the",Paragraph
Municipality Building (1933) and Maarad Street (1930s). Altounian elevated Oriental Art,Paragraph
"Deco motifs, extending it to civic architecture for the Lebanese Parliament and the",Paragraph
National Museum buildings. The pre-World War II period also saw the rise of a new,Paragraph
"generation of architects, such as Antoun Tabet, Farid Trad, Ilyas Murr, and Bahjat",Paragraph
Abdulnour. Tabet’s link with the studio of Auguste Perret heralded the expressive,Paragraph
"application of concrete-and-steel technology by many engineer-architects of the period,",Paragraph
whereas the work of Murr and Trad extended the forms of late Ottoman architecture into,Paragraph
the French mandate (1918-43) and early independence (1943-58). This extension of,Paragraph
styles and building types attests to the continuity within the urban developmental culture,Paragraph
"across the different political epochs. Interestingly, a new vernacular architecture was",Paragraph
"developed during this period, featuring multistory residential buildings built to absorb the",Paragraph
growing population.,Paragraph
Beirut’s economic primacy in the region was boosted by the sudden loss of,Paragraph
competition from the city of Haifa and the beginning of the Arab-Israeli conflict in 1948.,Paragraph
"This was supported by Lebanon’s strong banking and services sectors, and by the",Paragraph
presence of foreign business interests; it was paralleled by the strong intellectual and,Paragraph
political life that gave Beirut the reputation of being a breeding ground for regional,Paragraph
"political and cultural movements. Architecture, however, remained cast in the",Paragraph
"professional, technical arena. Following a brief civil war in 1958, urban development was",Paragraph
guided by a new welfare state and a new ministry of planning. Two major master plans,Paragraph
were proposed for Beirut; one by Constantinos Doxiadis in 1957-59 and one by Michel,Paragraph
Ecochard in 1963-64. Both master plans acknowledged the growth of the city and the,Paragraph
"need to develop physical planning at a regional, and even a national, scale. The country’s",Paragraph
"new institutions and infrastructure were given a strong modern image, as exemplified by",Paragraph
"the Central Bank as designed by Swiss architects Addor et Julliard, among others.",Paragraph
"However, the buildings were distributed mostly in the suburbs including such important",Paragraph
projects such as the Ministry of Defense (1965) and the Lebanese University (late 1960s),Paragraph
"by Maurice Hindieh and André Wogenscky. Hence, they did nothing to improve the",Paragraph
"urban layout. Other architects of the period, such as Pierre el-Khoury, Bahije Khoury-",Paragraph
"Makdisi, Wassek Adib, Pierre Neema, George Rayes, and Assem Salam, helped to",Paragraph
generate a professional culture that guided Lebanon’s architecture more effectively than,Paragraph
"the intellectual networks and academic institutions. For example, Khoury’s Ecole",Paragraph
"Technique provided a model for institutional buildings, whereas Adib’s collaborations",Paragraph
with Polish architect Karl Schayer provided the city with a facade along the seafront. The,Paragraph
"Corniche combined a rational, structural frame with expressive ground planes and roofs.",Paragraph
With such buildings as the Shell Building (1962) by Schayer and Adib and the more,Paragraph
"mannered work of Joseph Philippe Karam, the city acquired a new building type: a",Paragraph
"mixed-use apartment building, that would come to dominate urban as well as suburban",Paragraph
development.,Paragraph
What emerged in the early 1960s as a vigorous expression of flexibility turned into a,Paragraph
"formal anonymity in the 1970s under the pressure of speculative construction. Architects,",Paragraph
"such as Pierre Neema and Michel Ecochard, sought a more institutional expressiveness,",Paragraph
as demonstrated by Neema’s Electricité du Liban (1962). Samir Khairallah and Assem,Paragraph
"Salam would consciously incorporate regional styles, with Salam actively debating with",Paragraph
"other Arab architects, such as Rifaat Chadirji (Iraq) and Jaafar Toukan (Jordan), about",Paragraph
national and Arab identity expressed through architecture. Despite the rise of many,Paragraph
"schools of architecture, practice maintained its primacy in generating architectural",Paragraph
attitudes. This was caused by the continuation of a technical approach to architecture and,Paragraph
by the effectiveness of competition and open exchange that dominated the development,Paragraph
culture.,Paragraph
"Beirut would witness exponential growth in population, from 10,000 within the",Paragraph
"municipal district in 1920, to about 1.5 million in the metropolitan area by 1975. With",Paragraph
"about half of Lebanon’s population occupying 5 percent of the land, Beirut had become a",Paragraph
virtual city-state. This imbalance in growth and development attracted the rural,Paragraph
"population to the city, causing over-crowding in its immediate suburbs, and dire",Paragraph
"socioeconomic problems. During the same period, the city also absorbed Palestinian",Paragraph
"refugees increasing social tensions in the city. It led, along with religious and regional",Paragraph
"conflicts, to a succession of wars between 1975 and 1990, and included the invasion of",Paragraph
"the city by Israel in 1982. From 1975 to 1990, Beirut would suffer extensive damage,",Paragraph
leaving much of the commercial center’s architecture destroyed.,Paragraph
"Since the 1990 Taef Accord, which reconciled Lebanon’s warring",Paragraph
"factions, Beirut has been the focus of Lebanon’s reconstruction efforts.",Paragraph
The emphasis has been on rebuilding road networks and infrastructure,Paragraph
services and enlarging the city’s port and airport. Much of the urban,Paragraph
"planning was guided by the (1986), a study developed by the Mission",Paragraph
"Franco-Libanaise d’Etude et d’Aménagement, which called for",Paragraph
"decentralization of the commercial activity toward regional centers, and",Paragraph

"At the turn of the century, Belgian architecture played a vital role in the promotion of",Paragraph
"modern architecture with its Art Nouveau style, developed by the pioneers Victor Horta",Paragraph

"academies, and neo-Gothic styles, taught at the St. Lucas Institutes.",Paragraph
"Horta’s design for the Tassel House (1893, Brussels) already revealed all the",Paragraph
"characteristics of this new style: a new language of elegant curvilinear forms, a dynamic",Paragraph
"manipulation of interior spaces, and a decorative use of steel and wrought iron as",Paragraph

"By 1895 Henri van de Velde, a prolific theorist and the first industrial designer, had",Paragraph

Belgian architecture of the 20th century. The student revolts of May 1968 aimed to,Paragraph

"Manfredo Tafuri or Kenneth Frampton, his books serve as important texts in the study of",Paragraph
"20th-century architecture, both in Italy and around the world.",Paragraph
Since the early 1960s with Benevolo has concerned himself with the history,Paragraph
"and transformations of the city. This book addresses the industrial city, the Utopian city,",Paragraph

"concern with the city was the main focus of (The Architecture of the Renaissance),",Paragraph
with chapters on the ideal city and urban transformations in the 16th century. Here,Paragraph
"Benevolo also focused on the evolution of architectural styles, the invention of new",Paragraph
"architectures, and the architectural principles of varying periods.",Paragraph
"In the early 1970s, Benevolo published (The Adventures of the City), addressing",Paragraph
"the problems of the relation between the historical center of the city and the (outskirts),",Paragraph
and the decline and degradation of the Italian city following World War II. Many of the,Paragraph
"problems of the city are attributed to territorial organizations, which result from the",Paragraph
"interests of public administrators and private landowners, and are perpetuated by obsolete",Paragraph
institutions and customs in Italian society. In 1960 Benevolo published his,Paragraph
"(Introduction to Architecture), in which he explained the constructive principles of",Paragraph

"surveying architectural types including Greek, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine,",Paragraph
"Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Mannerism, baroque, neo-classical, and modern.",Paragraph

"antique, medieval, modern, and contemporary periods. The work is an attempt to explain",Paragraph
the origin of the city and to tell the basic story of the development of the built,Paragraph
environment in the history of civilization. It is intended for the average reader as well as,Paragraph
scholars and professionals in the fields of architecture and urban planning. Written in,Paragraph
"1960, his two-volume (History of Modern Architecture) has significantly impacted",Paragraph
the architectural history of the 20th century for the last four decades. The first volume,Paragraph
"(1760-1914) examines town planning, engineering, and the emergence of the skyscraper",Paragraph

canon of architects and buildings that characterize the Modern movement. Other books,Paragraph
that have been translated into English are and . These analyze the built,Paragraph
"environment at every level, from the room to the city, and consider the relation between",Paragraph

"undergone by Italian cities during the 16th century, with a detailed examination and",Paragraph
"comparison of city plans from that period. In (The City in the History of Europe),",Paragraph
"Benevolo addresses, in more technical terms, issues such as the detachment of the",Paragraph
"modern world from the ancient world, the idea of the city in classical culture, and the",Paragraph
transformations of the city during the Roman Empire. He analyzes the use of perspectival,Paragraph

Designed by Alfra and Tobia Scarpa; 1967—,Caption
The Benetton Corporation was a groundbreaking manufacturer both in terms of their,Paragraph
interest in design and the transition from manufacturer of goods to the making of a,Title
service industry toward the idea of service-oriented production industries of the late 20th,Paragraph
"century, which created a culture around a product. Their advanced, just-in-time",Paragraph
production and continual flow of goods from manufacturing to distribution influenced the,Paragraph
"layout, design, and siting of their facilities. Spanning three decades of development, these",Paragraph
"complexes in Treviso, Northern Italy, were designed by Alfra and Tobia Scarpa,",Paragraph
"architects and industrial designers, who designed not only the factory and administration",Paragraph
"buildings, but also developed with Benetton a new approach to retail design, which was",Paragraph
initiated with their international franchises in the 1960s.,Paragraph
Tobia Scarpa designed the first factory building for Benetton in 1967 in Paderno di,Paragraph
"Ponzano, Treviso, with Christiano Gasparetto and Carlo Maschietto. The complex,",Caption
"adjacent to an historic villa, comprises an administration building and manufacturing",Paragraph
"facility identified by the different roofscapes for the two building typologies, setting up a",Paragraph
"dialogue between the two functions, while creating a sense of the whole site.",Paragraph
The manufacturing facility’s primary structure is a girder and parallel series of X-,Paragraph
"shaped prefabricated concrete beams. The X-shaped beams, 1.3 meters high by 1.3",Caption
"meters wide with the profile exposed, have skylight glazing in the interstices, bringing",Paragraph
light to the manufacturing floor. The beams are supported on the 84-meter-long hollow,Paragraph
"girder for the entire length of the building, forming the main axis, and by perimeter 9.2-",Caption
"meter-high precast panels walls with a C-shaped section. The X-shaped beams, with their",Paragraph
"sloped angles, reflect light in the interior and have the double duty of integrating the",Paragraph
building systems of pipes and electric wiring through the hollow channel.,Paragraph
The long beam identifies a streetlike spine for local circulation and a wider delivery,Paragraph
area bracketed by the production areas. The success of this layout led to its continued use,Paragraph
"for three additional facilities. Variation in the manufacturing space, through paving and",Paragraph
"spatial divisions, makes a comfortable rather than overbearing work space.",Paragraph
"A courtyard links the manufacturing hall to the administrative offices, a custodian",Paragraph
"house, and the heating plant. Capping the offices, the architects designed pyramidal roofs",Paragraph
with cupola skylights by assembling three triangular 3-inch-thick prefabricated concrete,Caption
"panels, each with a base of 3.9 or 4.5 meters, recalling the surrounding domestic",Paragraph
landscape. Reference to the local context is also made evident in the rustic waddle and,Paragraph
"dab walls, with the sticks still visible.",Paragraph
"In 1986 this complex was renovated and expanded to house prototype production,",Paragraph
"offices for the computer systems, a conference center, a meeting room, and the runways",Paragraph
for fashion shows. A 600-car underground garage reduces the use of automobiles at the,Paragraph
site and creates unobstructed views to the site. Pedestrian pathways over ramps and,Paragraph
arched bridges above water channels create “streets” to lead to displays of Benetton,Paragraph
prototype stores.,Paragraph
In 1993-95 Benetton hired the Scarpas to build a two-part manufacturing facility in,Paragraph
"Castrette di Villorba, Treviso, based on the same layouts as the earlier factories.",Paragraph
Castrette’s singularity lies in the structural system and unobstructed production space,Paragraph
employing a high-tech industrial aesthetic and materiality. The single-story complex was,Paragraph
"built as two identical 18,000-meter-squared manufacturing buildings in seven, 25-meter",Paragraph
modules based on the dimensions of the cotton machines. The factory layout has three,Paragraph
"distinct areas—centralized assembly, a central roadway spine, and two production areas.",Paragraph
"The just-in-time production method made the access key to the site, so the architects",Paragraph
"made the central spine a 40-meter-wide roadway, larger than the earlier factory.",Paragraph
"To achieve the essential flexible and unobstructed manufacturing space, the architects",Paragraph
"employed a structural system developed by Bridon Ropes of Doncaster, England,",Paragraph
normally used for bridges and here used for the first time for a factory building. A,Paragraph
reinforced concrete pier in the center of each of the seven modules anchors pairs of 25-,Paragraph
meter-high steel pylons from which thin steel cables extend to brace the trussed roof. The,Paragraph
"roof trusses are, in turn, supported on the exterior reinforced concrete walls. The walls",Paragraph
"are clad with insulated ribbed galvanized steel, creating a horizontal emphasis to the",Paragraph
complex. The steel manufacturers dipped the panels in zinc coating to create a,Paragraph
"herringbone pattern resembling woven fabrics, symbolic of the activity inside. The",Paragraph
architects recessed the building under overhanging metal eaves with a wide cantilever,Caption
over the loading street. On the east and west facades the shed module profile is exposed,Caption
in the framework of the seven bays. They were also concerned with maintaining the,Paragraph
"vistas and the landscape, so they lowered the building into the earth for a lower profile. In",Paragraph
"the below-ground spaces, large skylights illuminate the workers’ cafeteria.",Paragraph
The exposed high-tech structure also conceals in its wall panel system a high-tech,Paragraph

"BERLAGE, HENDRIK PETRUS 1856-1934",Title
"Architect, Netherlands",Title
Hendrik Petrus Berlage was one of the most significant European architects before,Paragraph
"World War I. Often considered the father of modern architecture in the Netherlands,",Paragraph
"Berlage greatly influenced a generation of architects that included J.J.P.Oud, Gerrit",Paragraph
"Rietveld, and Mies van der Rohe. His work is known for its transition from 19th-century",Paragraph
historicism to new styles and theories of modern architecture. While his early designs,Paragraph
"were revivalist Dutch Renaissance, in the 1890s Berlage rejected historicism to",Paragraph
"experiment instead with stylistically innovative forms. Often considered a rationalist,",Paragraph
Berlage was similarly noted for his restrained use of ornament and his insistence that the,Paragraph
"exterior of a building express its interior, functional design. Berlage was a pioneer in the",Paragraph
"development of 20th-century architecture, and many of his buildings are Dutch cultural",Paragraph
landmarks.,Paragraph
"Berlage’s career falls into three periods: 1878 to 1903, his early work through the",Paragraph
"completion of the Amsterdam Exchange; 1903 to 1919, his mature period through the",Paragraph
termination of his work for the Kréller-Miiller family; and his late work from 1920 to,Paragraph
"1934, when he turns to Cubist forms. Berlage received his formal architectural training at",Paragraph
"the Ziirich Polytechnic. After extensive travels, he began working in the Amsterdam",Paragraph
"office of Theo Sanders. When Sanders retired in 1889, Berlage opened an independent",Paragraph
office. His first major commission was the purely historicist De Algemeene office,Paragraph
"building in Amsterdam. His experiments with restrained, stylized historical forms",Paragraph
culminated in the Amsterdam Exchange. The five successive Exchange designs (1884—,Paragraph
98) show Berlage’s transformation from historicism to modernism. Beginning as a Dutch,Paragraph
"Renaissance palace, the Exchange became an original design, reinterpreting, abstracting,",Paragraph
and subjecting historical forms to new ideas about proportion and materials. The,Paragraph
Exchange uses a proportional grid of triangular prisms that harmonizes and unifies the,Paragraph
"exterior. In conception, it drew on history as well, as Berlage sought to adapt a native",Paragraph
form for 20th-century use. The first exchanges in the Low Countries had been open,Paragraph
courtyards. Berlage kept that basic idea with glass-roofed trading halls surrounded by,Paragraph
brick arcades.,Caption
After 1913 Berlage became “house architect” for the wealthy Kréller-Miiller family,Paragraph
"and designed several innovative buildings, including the Holland House in London and",Paragraph
St. Hubertus near Otterlo. The London building code required that Berlage cover Holland,Paragraph
House’s steel frame. He chose terra-cotta plates to fill the space and frame the windows.,Paragraph
"Inside, movable walls divided the office space. Both were innovations. St. Hubertus was",Paragraph
an extravagant hunting lodge; its plan takes the form of stylized antlers in reference to the,Paragraph
story of St. Hubertus and the stag. The monumental conception has been linked to,Paragraph
Wright’s designs.,Paragraph
After 1920 Berlage’s work began to favor geometry even more vigorously. The best,Paragraph
"examples of this are the First Church of Christ, Scientist, and the Municipal Museum,",Paragraph
both in The Hague. Both buildings are assemblages of cubic prisms in which geometry,Paragraph
"replaces historical quotations. Another late work is the Amstel Bridge, designed as part of",Paragraph
his plan for Amsterdam South. The bridge was a joint effort between Berlage and the city,Paragraph
engineer’s office and was praised by contemporaries as a socially productive,Paragraph
collaboration between state and artist promising cooperation for the future. It combines a,Paragraph
decorated bridge with park space for water recreation.,Caption
Both 19th-century theorists and 20th-century innovators influenced Berlage. He drew,Paragraph
"inspiration from Gottfried Semper and Viollet-le-Duc, who admired the organic harmony",Paragraph
and holistic creativity of great architecture of the past but who also criticized the cut-and-,Paragraph
paste pattern-book copying that had come to dominate 19th-century architecture.,Paragraph
"Similarly, Berlage argued that the architect should shape useful spaces rather than",Paragraph
"decorate facades. In his view, a building should express its function from the interior",Paragraph
outward rather than allow surface details to dictate room arrangement. Through lectures,Paragraph
"and essays describing his American travels, Berlage was the first major European",Paragraph
architect to publicly declare his interest in the American innovations of Louis Sullivan,Paragraph
"and Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright’s work particularly affected Berlage, confirming the",Paragraph
path toward geometric architecture that he had already begun.,Paragraph
Berlage is thus an excellent example of an architect negotiating between the ancients,Paragraph
and the moderns. He was interested in developing a newer architectural vocabulary in,Paragraph
step with the 20th century while also retaining links to the historical past. His best-known,Paragraph
works are modern but based in traditional forms. After 1890 he began to decorate his,Paragraph
"buildings with geometric, stylized historical motifs. Preferring simple materials to",Paragraph
"imitations and noting that “genuine plaster is better than false marble” ( 1904), he",Paragraph
"liked to use materials in accordance with their natural features. Conversely, he disliked",Paragraph
"bentwood and the plaster concealment of structural elements, as the exposed iron",Paragraph
supports in the trading rooms of the Amsterdam Exchange demonstrate. Berlage was,Paragraph
"especially fond of brick, a material traditionally associated with Dutch architecture. He",Paragraph
"retained this link to the past, but he used brick in unorthodox ways, particularly by",Paragraph
"exposing it as an interior wall element in residences, for example, the Villa Henny (1898)",Paragraph
"in The Hague. Brick gave mass, strength, and an organic pattern to architectural designs",Paragraph
"that were intrinsic to the material, not an applied ornament.",Paragraph
Berlage believed that the architect had a social responsibility to improve,Paragraph
"living conditions. Consequently, beginning around 1900, his interests",Paragraph
"expanded to include city planning as a means of social amelioration,",Paragraph
"resulting in expansion plans for several Dutch cities, of which only the",Paragraph
plan for South Amsterdam (1915-17) was implemented. Social concerns,Paragraph
"affected Berlage’s interior design as well, which is known for its",Paragraph
geometric focus. He explicitly avoided the vegetative forms popular with,Paragraph

Berlin’s “tradition of no traditions” spawned the 20th century’s preeminent,Paragraph
architectural avant-garde. There was so much to build and so few precedents. While the,Paragraph

Berlin’s 20th-century architectural pageant was not just prescient but stylistically,Paragraph

(organicism/keneticism). Only 20th-century Helsinki—through Alvar Aalto—could,Paragraph

BERLIN PHILHARMONIC CONCERT,Title
HALL,Title
"Designed by Hans Scharoun; completed 1963 Berlin, Germany",Caption
In 1956 Hans Scharoun (1893-1972) won an invited competition of 12 architects to,Paragraph
design a home for Germany’s premier orchestra. Now considered to be one of Scharoun’s,Paragraph
"crowning achievements, the Berlin Philharmonic Concert Hall (1963) is outstanding both",Paragraph
for its auditorium design and for its dynamic spatial experiences. The site in Berlin,Paragraph
originally chosen for the competition was on the Bundesallee adjacent to a 19th-century,Paragraph
"school, the Joachimsthaler. Scharoun’s design used the Philharmonic building to create a",Paragraph
"public square on axis with Stiiler’s Matthai Church. In 1959, however, the Berlin Senate",Paragraph
changed the site to the Tiergarten in anticipation of the development of a new cultural,Paragraph
"center for the city of Berlin, an attempt to revitalize an area that had been devastated in",Paragraph
"the war. The basic form and concept of Scharoun’s design remained the same, but he",Paragraph
adjusted the configuration of the foyer and ancillary spaces to accommodate the new site.,Paragraph
Scharoun completed the adaptations and overseeing of the construction in conjunction,Paragraph
"with the architect Werner Weber. Work proceeded rapidly, and within three years of the",Paragraph
"laying of the foundation stone in 1960, the auditorium opened on 15 October 1963 with a",Paragraph
"concert directed by Herbert von Karajan, a supporter of Scharoun in the early phases of",Paragraph
the competition.,Paragraph
"At the time of its completion, both the critics and the public lauded the auditorium",Paragraph
"design for its innovation, but they derided the exterior form, likening its sweeping roofs",Paragraph
to a circus tent. Originally left as rough-finished concrete and painted a yellow ochre,Paragraph
"color reminiscent of many of the historic buildings in Berlin, the exterior of the",Paragraph
"auditorium was faced in the 1980s with golden anodized aluminum panels, further",Paragraph
accentuating the central form. In a striking contrast to the dominance of the central,Paragraph
"auditorium is the three-story administrative wing, which angles away from the auditorium",Paragraph
as a painted white rectangular mass.,Paragraph
"Particularly significant, however, is the fact that Scharoun, who considered the",Paragraph
"creation of interior and exterior spaces of equal importance, used the foyer as a mediating",Paragraph
space so that both site and auditorium requirements could be accommodated. The foyer,Paragraph
"reaches out into the site, drawing the visitor into the entry, where, once inside, he or she",Paragraph
"confronts a dynamic, fluid space. Angled walls break up the edges of the foyer, blurring",Paragraph
"the boundaries between one area and another. Located near the entry are amenities, such",Paragraph
"as ticket booths and coat rooms, which are split between the multiple levels. Within the",Paragraph
"foyer, dramatic stairs rise seemingly at random but are actually artfully controlled and",Paragraph
successfully accommodate the large number of people attending the performances. Using,Paragraph
"the placement of the stairs to guide circulation, Scharoun creates a dynamic",Paragraph
nonhierarchical yet elegant spatial experience that removes the visitor psychologically,Paragraph
from the world outside.,Paragraph
Scharoun’s concern for the relationship of the individual to the community carried,Paragraph
over into his design of the Philharmonic. He assembled a group of artists and engineers,Paragraph
whose work underscores his theories. Erich Fritz Reuter’s slate mosaic floor patterns,Paragraph
"guide the visitor through the foyer toward the two main stairs, which are further",Paragraph
highlighted by Alexander Camaro’s colored-glass windows and a sloping glass skylight.,Paragraph
"Light, shadow, and subtle color activate the daytime experience of the foyer. In contrast,",Paragraph
"the evening lighting is more subdued, with pendant “dandelion” lights designed by",Paragraph
Giinther Symmank and lit handrails along the stairs.,Paragraph
"Exceedingly aware of the cultural and political importance of the building,",Paragraph
Scharoun designed an architectural experience that creates a community,Paragraph
through the dissolution of traditional barriers between the listeners and the,Paragraph
performers. Scharoun explained the generative idea for his design as,Paragraph
"“music in the centre—this, from the very beginning, has been the guiding",Paragraph
principle which has shaped the new Philharmonic auditorium.” In addition,Paragraph
"to his generative concept of the centralized performance space, Scharoun",Paragraph
described the auditorium metaphorically as a landscape where banks of,Paragraph
angled seating become “vineyards” sloping into the “valley” of the stage,Paragraph
and the ceiling a “skyscape” floating above. The angled groups of seating,Paragraph
"prevent the creation of a single focal point, forcing the viewers to visually",Paragraph
"address the other listeners, thus subduing the overall symmetry of the plan.",Paragraph
The auditorium is equipped with a 72-register organ built by Schuke with,Paragraph
"Professor Michael Schneider, facilities for television production and",Title
"recording, locations throughout for small additional groups of musicians,",Paragraph
and the ability to lower the orchestra floor in sections to accommodate a,Paragraph
"variety of performance types. None of the 2,218 seats, however, is more",Paragraph
"than 100 feet away from the stage, and only 270 seats are located",Paragraph
"Berlin Philharmonic Concert Hall,",Title

behind the orchestra. The overall impression in the auditorium remains one of intimacy.,Paragraph

"Through his work with the engineer Lothar Cremer, they achieved reverberation times in",Paragraph
the auditorium ranging between 2 and 2.4 seconds. A triple-shell roof system and double-,Paragraph
"wall design buffer the auditorium from outside noise, and the limestone walls",Paragraph
surrounding the orchestra act as reflectors.,Paragraph
"Currently, adjacent to the Philharmonic Concert Hall is the Chamber Music Hall",Paragraph
"(1978). Although the initial sketch was by Scharoun, Edgar Wisniewski completed the",Paragraph
"hall after Scharoun’s death. Unfortunately, Scharoun’s original ideas regarding the siting",Paragraph
"of the Philharmonic were never completed. Later, in conjunction with his design of the",Paragraph
"State Library (1967-78), Scharoun produced another site design that included the",Paragraph
"Philharmonic site. However, this was never completed either, and there remains a",Paragraph
disjointed quality to the site.,Paragraph
The recent resurgence of interest in Scharoun’s work in general and the Philharmonic,Paragraph
Concert Hall in particular indicates the influence of his work beyond the labels of,Paragraph
"German Expressionist or organic architecture, an interest gained from his friend Hugo",Paragraph
Haring. Scharoun’s prioritization of spatial experiences and expressive designs has,Paragraph
influenced many later 20th-century architects. The Berlin Philharmonic Concert Hall,Paragraph
"remains one of the most unique architectural spatial experiences, as well as one of the",Paragraph
"most successful concert halls built to date, and is a flourishing cultural addition to the city",Paragraph
of Berlin.,Paragraph

"The Berlin Wall stood in Berlin, Germany, for 28 years, 2 months, and 26 days.",Paragraph
"However, it was not just any wall—it was Wall: politically, a symbol of the post-World",Paragraph
"War II Cold War world order; architecturally, an example of the power of the most basic",Paragraph
"building block of architecture; and artistically, a giant 166-kilometer-long blank canvas.",Paragraph
"After the defeat of the Third Reich in 1945, both Germany and its capital, Berlin, were",Paragraph
"partitioned into four zones, each under the administration of one of the Allies: Great",Paragraph
"Britain, France, the United States, and the USSR. The partition of Germany was done so",Paragraph
"along existing provincial boundaries. The partition of Berlin, which was located in the",Paragraph
"middle of the Soviet sector, was done so in terms of postal codes.",Paragraph
"In 1949 the French-, British-, and American-controlled sectors were merged to form",Paragraph
"the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), with Bonn as its capital. In that same year, the",Paragraph
Soviet-controlled eastern quarter of Germany became the German Democratic Republic,Title
"(GDR), with (East) Berlin as its capital. Although the USSR proclaimed the sovereignty",Paragraph
"of the GDR in 1954, East Germany effectively was an internally run satellite of the",Paragraph
USSR.,Paragraph
"Between the years 1949 and 1961, it is estimated that approximately three million",Paragraph
"people, or roughly one-sixth of the population, fled from the GDR to the West. This",Paragraph
"exodus occurred both along the 1,400-kilometer border with the FRG and from East to",Paragraph
West Berlin. Because the refugees were from all professions and mostly under the age of,Paragraph
"25, the GDR soon faced a social and economic crisis, especially in terms of the loss of",Paragraph
trained and specialist personnel.,Paragraph
"To stop this flow of refugees, armed units of the GDR began to seal off the open",Paragraph
border between East and West Berlin in the early morning of 13 August 1961. The border,Paragraph
"between the GDR and the FRG was also sealed, and West Berlin became, in effect, an",Paragraph
island in the middle of the GDR. The justification for these fortifications was clear in the,Paragraph
GDR’s name for them—‘the antifascist protective barrier”—suggesting the prevention of,Paragraph
"the West from coming in, not the prevention of the East from going out.",Paragraph
At first the Berlin Wall was merely a hastily constructed barbed-wire fence with,Paragraph
"armed guards. During the remainder of 1961, these initial fortifications rapidly grew",Paragraph
"more sophisticated. In front of the Brandenburg Gate, soldiers constructed a seven-foot-",Paragraph
"high (2.1 meters), six-foot-deep (1.8 meters) tankproof bar rier with steel posts and",Paragraph
"prefabricated concrete slabs laid flat and held with mortar. Elsewhere in Berlin, concrete",Paragraph
slabs were laid vertically and then topped off with square concrete blocks and barbed,Paragraph
wire.,Paragraph
"On the eastern side of the Wall, the GDR then slowly began to construct a no-man’s",Paragraph
"land. First, a second wall was built approximately one city block (100 meters) into East",Paragraph
"Berlin. This system was perfected with lookout towers, searchlights, tank traps, dog runs,",Paragraph
"trip wires, alarmed fences, and ditches in between the two walls. Then the above-ground",Paragraph
division was doubled underground as Berlin’s subway lines were severed and terminated,Paragraph
"at the border. Eventually, all roads, train lines, canals, and other transportation routes in",Paragraph
and out of West Berlin were either severed or controlled by GDR border police.,Paragraph
"In some areas of Berlin, the East-West border ran right down the middle of a street,",Paragraph
thanks to the previously mentioned decision to use postal codes as the division line. In,Paragraph
"these locations, the buildings on the East were evacuated and their openings bricked up,",Paragraph
"effectively making the buildings themselves the Berlin Wall. Eventually, these buildings",Paragraph
and also the early versions of the Wall were demolished and replaced with the,Paragraph
"superefficient “fourth generation,” or 1979 version, which proved to be the most famous.",Paragraph
It consisted of four-foot-wide (1.2 meters) prefabricated concrete L-shaped panels nearly,Paragraph
"12 feet (3.6 meters) high, laid side-by-side in mortar and topped with a round concrete",Paragraph
tube. Each panel weighed 2.6 tons and had to be installed with a crane.,Paragraph
This last version of the Berlin Wall is the one that became famous for its graffiti. Soon,Paragraph
"after the 1979 version was built, all sorts of comments, slogans, stories, constructions,",Paragraph
"figures, and grotesque fantasies began to be written, stenciled, and painted onto it. Every",Paragraph
"year, the GDR border guards would dutifully paint over these scribbles in a futile attempt",Paragraph
"to draw attention away from them, and every year the Wall would fill right back up with",Paragraph
its multicolored messages.,Paragraph
"The Wall soon became no longer a thorn in the side of West Berlin but rather an asset,",Paragraph
almost a tourist attraction. Tourists from around the world no longer came to West Berlin,Paragraph
to take in an opera or to visit a museum but rather to marvel at this three-dimensional,Paragraph
expression of an arbitrary line on the map. The American artist Keith Haring painted a,Paragraph
vast stretch near “Checkpoint Charlie” in 1986 and held a press conference afterward.,Paragraph
"After that point, the Wall was considered art.",Paragraph
The beginnings of the fall of the Berlin Wall can be traced to the 1985 election of,Paragraph
Mikhail Gorbachev as general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.,Paragraph
"Gorbachev’s policies, which allowed the satellite nations of Eastern Europe to determine",Paragraph
"their own affairs, brought about demands in those countries for more freedom. In May",Paragraph
"1989 the Hungarian government opened its border with Austria, thereby lifting",Paragraph
Churchill’s famous “iron curtain” and allowing GDR citizens to travel to the West via,Paragraph
Hungary. On 9 November 1989 the GDR announced on the radio that all citizens were,Paragraph
free to travel wherever they wanted. This decree effectively rendered the Berlin Wall,Paragraph
useless.,Paragraph
"Within one year, the Berlin Wall was practically destroyed by both angry East",Paragraph
Germans and hungry souvenir hunters. Other parts were dismantled and recycled for road,Paragraph
construction. On 3 October 1990 East and West Germany were officially unified into a,Paragraph
single Federal Republic of Germany. In 1995 one watchtower and four stretches of the,Paragraph
remaining Berlin Wall totaling 1.71 kilometers were placed under protection and,Paragraph
designated as historical monuments. The Wall thus officially became history.,Paragraph

BEST PRODUCTS SHOWROOM,Title
"Designed by SITE; completed 1975 Houston, Texas",Caption
"The Best Products building located in Houston, Texas, also known as the",Paragraph
"“indeterminate facade,” was built in 1975 as a showroom by the architectural firm SITE",Paragraph
for the Best Products retail chain. The building is known mainly for its idiosyncratic,Paragraph
"facade, which wraps a 65,000-square-foot, commercial-formula building with a high",Paragraph
brick wall that appears to be in the act of collapsing. The extended cornice is given an,Paragraph
"irregular profile as though it were coming apart, and atop the entrance a massive pile of",Paragraph
"bricks tumbles through a gap, resting precariously on a thin metal canopy. The building",Paragraph
"presents a startling image when viewed within its suburban context, a strip center located",Paragraph
between Almeda Mall Shopping Center and a residential neighborhood along the Gulf,Paragraph
Freeway. Visitors’ reactions to the building have ranged from amusement to concerns for,Paragraph
the safety of the occupants; a common conjecture soon after the building opened was that,Paragraph
"it was damaged by a Gulf coast hurricane or an earthquake. The apocalyptic vision was,",Paragraph
"of course, apocryphal; inside the building it was business as usual.",Paragraph
The Houston showroom is one of several unusual designs that SITE produced for the,Paragraph
"Richmond, Virginia-based company, each of them involving an eye-catching",Paragraph
embellishment of the facade. The commissions were in no small measure owing to the,Paragraph
"patronage of the late Sidney Lewis, then president of Best, who was an avid collector of",Paragraph
contemporary art. Lewis was seeking ways to incorporate art into his showrooms to,Paragraph
distinguish them from the conformity of standard shopping-strip architecture. In an,Paragraph
"earlier commission in 1972, shortly after the formation of the SITE group, the designers",Paragraph
"enlivened a Best Products showroom in Richmond, Virginia, with the Peeling Front, a",Paragraph
facade that was molded in epoxy to create the appearance that the facing brick was,Paragraph
"peeling away from the building’s backing materials. However, of all the SITE designs,",Paragraph
the Houston showroom was the one that was most photographed and that received the,Paragraph
most popular and critical attention.,Paragraph
"SITE was organized in 1970 as a collaboration between Alison Skye, who was trained",Paragraph
"as an art historian; Michelle Stone, a photographer and sociologist; and James Wines, a",Paragraph
sculptor. The confluence of their various disciplinary points of view resulted in designs,Paragraph
that rejected conventional architectural formulas for new inspirations found in,Paragraph
"contemporary art (particularly the work of American Pop artists of the 1960s, such as",Paragraph
"Claes Oldenburg), social commentary, and popular culture.",Paragraph
"Wines, who became the chief spokesman for the group, described SITE’s work as",Paragraph
"being about “de-architecture,” which he defined as a condition of reversing or removing",Paragraph
some quality or ingredient from architecture in order to destabilize it. It was a means of,Paragraph
"defining an attitude or of changing standard reactions to the urban context, including the",Paragraph
ubiquitous strip centers that were burgeoning along America’s highways. In the Best,Paragraph
"showrooms, they attacked the most banal, contemporary building type, the commercial",Paragraph
"box, by subverting the traditional relationships between form, function, and economy. In",Paragraph
its place they foregrounded the often ambiguous relationship between the building’s,Paragraph
contents and the external influences of a more inclusive social and cultural context. The,Paragraph
SITE designs made the showroom buildings into memorable landmarks—no small feat,Paragraph
among the visual complexities and commercial excesses of the suburban strip. As,Paragraph
"marketing strategies, their success could be measured in increased sales revenues for the",Paragraph
Best Company.,Paragraph
"Curiously, the buildings also became the focus of intense architectural commentary,",Paragraph
"perhaps because they distilled many of the interests of the Postmodernists—for example,",Paragraph
the idea of the decorated shed advanced by architect Robert Venturi—and pushed them,Paragraph
almost to the point of parody. Extensive critical review and coverage of the Houston,Paragraph
showroom in both the professional and the popular press included sympathetic reviews,Paragraph
"by Gerald Allen (1977) and Bruno Zevi (1980), the latter of whose commentary was",Paragraph
titled “The Poetics of the Unfinished.” Opposite opinions were registered by architects,Paragraph
"Lebbeus Woods, who considered the building to be little more than a “one-liner” without",Paragraph
"sustaining power, and Léon Krier, who called it tragic and a setback for architecture.",Paragraph
The extraordinary amount of attention that was paid to the building owed partly to,Paragraph
Wines’s own polemical writings and interviews in which he described SITE’s mission as,Paragraph
"a confrontation with the tenets of modern architecture, particularly the orthodoxies of",Paragraph
"formal functionalism (that is, International Style). In the Houston design, with its",Paragraph
"wholeness shattered by the appearance of chaos, the commentary went further,",Paragraph
constructing a deliberate subversion of the glossy conformity that expressed the,Paragraph
economic and building boom in the state of Texas. By liberating the facade and making it,Paragraph
"a plaything of the imagination, the Best Showroom signaled the arrival of wit, parody,",Paragraph
and surreal figuration in architecture. These inversions on the standard architectural,Paragraph
formulas were similar to the fascinations of the avant-garde artists beginning with Marcel,Paragraph
"Duchamp in the early 20th century, who worked to blur conventional categories and",Paragraph
definitions of art.,Paragraph
The Best Showroom has been described as both a mock ruin and a vision of,Paragraph
"incompleteness or indeterminacy, Wines himself staunchly defending the latter",Paragraph
"interpretation. As a constructed ruin, it was never romantic or reflective, as was the case",Paragraph
"with many of the mock ruins or follies from history. Instead, it was intended to call",Paragraph
attention to itself by creating an architectural puzzle in which the viewer is invited to fill,Paragraph
"in the missing pieces. As a cultural icon, it introduced to the strip the ambiguous sign",Paragraph
whose meaning had little relationship either to the contents or to the usual patterns of,Paragraph
signification that were characteristic of strip architecture. Wines used the freedom of this,Paragraph
"new formulation to pursue a fusion of art and architecture, although in this case whatever",Paragraph
architecture there was in the design was largely devoured by the effusiveness of imagery,Paragraph
"that is, after all, decoration. Because SITE never interfered with the formula for the",Paragraph
"interior layouts of the showrooms, the projects portrayed a fundamental schism between",Paragraph
form and content—inside and out—that was a characteristic feature of much of the work,Paragraph
of the Postmodern architects.,Paragraph

"geographic features. Moreover, Birkerts playfully utilizes the metaphorical qualities of",Paragraph

unusual clients and remarkable problems. He designed the new Federal Reserve Bank in,Paragraph
Minneapolis under the leadership of bank president Hugh Galusha in 1973; at first glance,Paragraph

structures that appear to shoot across the flat site as if on railroad tracks. Birkerts,Paragraph
borrowed elements of Frank Lloyd Wright’s designs (primarily the manner in which,Paragraph
buildings relate to the natural setting) in a continuation of the organic tradition of,Paragraph

"BOFILL, RICARDO 1939-",Title
"Architect, Spain",Title
Ricardo Bofill is one of Europe’s most prolific and provocative exponents of,Paragraph
Postmodernism in architecture.,Paragraph
In 1975 French President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing described Bofill as the “world’s,Paragraph
greatest architect” for his award-winning design for Les Halles in Paris. In the following,Paragraph
"decade, a series of international exhibitions and monographs confirmed his position at the",Paragraph
"forefront of the modern classical revival. However, despite being celebrated for the",Paragraph
"manner in which he has rejuvenated the classical and baroque traditions in architecture, it",Paragraph
"is also an appreciation of geometry and the interrelation among social, spatial, and",Paragraph
technical systems that define his work.,Paragraph
"Bofill was born in Barcelona in 1939, and between 1955 and 1960 he studied at the",Paragraph
Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura in Barcelona and the Université de Genéve in,Paragraph
"Switzerland. In 1960 he founded the multidisciplinary team (Architecture Workshop),",Paragraph
and since that time he has worked with them in close collaboration on all his designs.,Paragraph
Bofill and the Taller have been based in Barcelona and Sant Just Desvern in Spain since,Paragraph
"that period, but they have also opened offices in Paris, Algeria, and New York.",Paragraph
Bofill describes both his childhood in Catalonia and his travels with his family as,Paragraph
being strong influences on his architectural career. It was while growing up in Barcelona,Paragraph
that he developed a great fascination for the architecture of Antoni Gaudi (1852-1926),Paragraph
and for traditional Catalan craftsmanship. During his later travels throughout Western,Paragraph
"Europe and North Africa, he also cultivated an interest in the manner in which spaces",Paragraph
"shape social interaction. All of these themes suffuse his early architectural works,",Paragraph
including the Plaza San Gregorio Apartment Building (1965) and the Nicaragua,Paragraph
"Apartment Building (1965) in Barcelona, as well as the Barrio Gaudi (1968) in Reus. All",Paragraph
three of the buildings are constructed of simple industrial materials that are applied in,Paragraph
"traditional ways, and all feature elaborate, variegated roofscapes and richly textured and",Paragraph
decorated facades.,Paragraph
"Bofill’s work first came to international prominence in the early 1970s, when the",Paragraph
"produced a series of brightly colored, and enigmatically titled buildings throughout",Paragraph
"Spain. All these projects, including Xanadu (1967) on the bay of Sitges, Walden-7 (1975)",Caption
"in Sant Just Desvern, and Kafka’s Castle (1968) and Red Wall (1972), both in Alicante,",Paragraph
display a similar theme; they share a preoccupation with the manner in which geometric,Paragraph
systems can generate forms that are complex yet conducive to social interaction. Kafka’s,Paragraph
"Castle is a resort, and is generated from a series of equations that govern the siting and",Paragraph
distribution of cubic rooms and castellated balconies. One equation generates the number,Paragraph
"of room capsules that plug into the stair towers, and another determines the height of each",Paragraph
"spiral progression around the stair. Rather than resulting in a bland or repetitive building,",Paragraph
the overlaying of these simple geometric rules produces a rich and evocative,Paragraph
"environment. In Walden-7, a monumental 17-story apartment complex, this same method",Paragraph
is used to accommodate different-sized groups of people in cellular spaces. Both of these,Paragraph
"flexible-use living areas are connected by vast atriums, upper-level bridges, and roof",Paragraph
gardens. Bofill describes these early works as being an intuitive response to issues of,Paragraph
design and local culture that have since been termed critical regionalism. For Bofill such,Paragraph
"projects attempt to solve modern problems (mass housing) using modern materials, while",Paragraph
"retaining some essence of the region’s natural complexity. However, in the years that",Paragraph
"followed, Bofill began to gradually revise this approach to design, arguing that it was",Paragraph
becoming increasingly important to express historical and regional characteristics as well,Paragraph
as geometric ones.,Paragraph
In 1975 Bofill’s design for a large public park ringed by baroque,Paragraph
colonnades won the international design competition for Les Halles in,Paragraph
"Paris. The design was already under construction when the mayor of Paris,",Paragraph
"Jacques Chirac, ordered that it be abandoned. Despite this setback, Bofill",Paragraph
successfully developed a number of similarly monumental and historically,Paragraph
"themed projects in France, including Les Arcades du Lac (1981) and Le",Paragraph
"Viaduc (1981), both near Versailles, Les Espaces d’ Abraxas (1983) at",Paragraph
"Marne-la-Vallée, Les Echelles du Baroque (1985) in Paris, and Antigone",Paragraph
(1985) in Montpellier. Bofill describes Les Arcades du Lac and Le Viaduc,Paragraph
as “Versailles for the people.” These buildings (the latter over an artificial,Paragraph
"lake) incorporate a giant rhythmic system of precast-concrete pilasters,",Paragraph
"arched windows, and classical pediments. Below the symmetrical piazza",Caption
"with its classical fountains and balustrades, are cavernous parking lots. Les",Paragraph
"Espaces d’ Abraxas, a development for more than 600 apartments on the",Paragraph
"outskirts of Paris, is similarly boldly derivative of French architectural",Paragraph
history and geometry. Les Espaces d’ Abraxas comprises three historic,Paragraph
"building types: a semicircular theater, an arc (a habitable arch), and the",Paragraph
palace (a U-shaped block that frames the arc). Each of these buildings is,Paragraph
"between 10 and 15 stories high and is clad in an elegant, precast-concrete",Paragraph
panel system. The exterior of the theater features a series of,Paragraph

In the 1990s Bofill and the Taller continued to design buildings for clients in the,Paragraph

"By the time that Bofill’s designs for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics were completed,",Paragraph

BOOTS FACTORY,Title
"Designed by Sir Owen Williams; completed 1938 Nottingham, England",Caption
The factories designed by the architect and engineer Sir Owen Williams for Boots,Paragraph
Pure Drugs Company in Nottingham are regarded as buildings of seminal importance in,Paragraph
the history of modern architecture in Britain.,Paragraph
"Built between 1930 and 1938, the development consists of two large buildings",Paragraph
designed for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products and a collection of smaller,Paragraph
"buildings including a fire station. All the buildings still exist, and the factories were",Paragraph
refurbished in 1994.,Paragraph
Owen Williams was born in 1890. He qualified as an engineer in 1911 and a year later,Paragraph
"joined the Trussed Concrete and Steel Company, for which he worked as an assistant",Paragraph
"engineer prior to establishing his own practice in 1918. Three years later, he was",Paragraph
"appointed consulting engineer to the British Empire Exhibition, a commission that",Paragraph
included the design of several large exhibition buildings together with a swimming pool,Paragraph
"and a sports stadium for 125,000 spectators at Wembley. It was a turning point in his",Paragraph
"career. The buildings, which made extensive use of reinforced concrete, were completed",Paragraph
"in record time, and, after the exhibition opened in 1924, Williams was knighted in",Paragraph
recognition of his achievements. He subsequently became a registered architect and in,Paragraph
1930 was appointed to design a large new manufacturing complex for a wide range of,Paragraph
pharmaceutical products for Boots of Nottingham.,Paragraph
"Although Boots had originally been founded by Jesse Boots, a local chemist, it was",Paragraph
under American ownership at the time of Williams’s appointment. The United Drugs,Paragraph
"Company purchased a 300-acre site at Beeston on the outskirts of Nottingham in 1926,",Paragraph
and their initial design brief required that the complex be contained within one huge,Paragraph
"envelope. Williams worked with the client to develop their requirements, and his first",Paragraph
plans were for a single building planned for phased development and designed to,Paragraph
accommodate wet and dry processes of manufacture located to either side of a central,Paragraph
shipping dock.,Paragraph
"The first building to be constructed, the Packed Wet Goods Factory, was completed in",Paragraph
"1932. Planned as half of the original scheme, the vast concrete, steel, and glass complex",Caption
"has a footprint of 240,000 square feet. It is organized in five interrelated zones with an",Paragraph
"unloading dock to the south, a ground floor manufacturing area with upper floors for",Paragraph
"storage of raw materials, a main packaging hall connected to a four-story packed goods",Paragraph
"store, and a shipping dock to the north. Administrative offices were integrated into the",Paragraph
"scheme in a four-story block along the western edge of the complex, which was also",Paragraph
"planned to accommodate the main entrance, laboratories, and a staff canteen.",Paragraph
The organization of the building is dominated by an uncompromising functionalist,Paragraph
approach and an interest in developing an overall systematic method of construction. The,Paragraph
structure consists of reinforced-concrete flat slabs spanning in two directions and,Paragraph
supported on square reinforced-concrete columns with flared capitals. The slabs are,Paragraph
"cantilevered at the perimeter and around light wells, and the building is clad with a",Caption
glazed-curtain wall.,Caption
"Like the early buildings designed by Albert Kahn for Henry Ford, the scheme for this",Paragraph
first building was planned to feed raw materials down from the upper levels. Also like,Paragraph
"Kahn, Williams was keen to design a building that provided good working conditions,",Paragraph
and this is perhaps most obvious in the use of natural daylight. In addition to an extensive,Paragraph
"glazed perimeter, the light wells bring daylight into the heart of the building. In the five-",Paragraph
"story packing hall, perhaps the most dramatic space in the scheme, Williams created a",Paragraph
roofing system with 8 1/2-inch-diameter circular glass disks within a 1 3/4-inch-deep,Paragraph
"reinforced-concrete slab supported on steel trusses at 30-foot, 8-inch centers. He also",Paragraph
used a similar system over the unloading docks and the manufacturing areas.,Paragraph
"In 1935, after Boots Company had been bought back into British ownership, Williams",Paragraph
"was commissioned to design additional manufacturing space at Beeston. The “Drys,”",Paragraph
"originally conceived as a mirror-image extension to his first building, was eventually",Paragraph
redesigned to be independent and freestanding.,Caption
"Planned for the manufacture, storage, and dispatch of powders, tablets, and other dry",Paragraph
"products, the design of this building is simpler than the earlier factory. It consists of three",Paragraph
"zones planned for incoming raw materials, manufacture, and packaging and shipping. A",Paragraph
five-story central spine houses manufacturing processes that are top fed as in the “Wets”,Paragraph
"Building. However, the atria were omitted. Single-story spaces at either side provide for",Paragraph
incoming raw materials to the south and for outgoing finished materials to the north.,Paragraph
"Although built in reinforced concrete, the structural system is also different. Flat-slab",Paragraph
"construction, limited to the central spine building, is carefully integrated with the",Paragraph
structure of the roofs over the single-story bays at either side. Nine-foot-deep Z section,Caption
beams of reinforced concrete span 92 feet to the north and 215 feet to the south with,Paragraph
"extraordinary cantilevers of 30 feet and 48 feet, respectively, providing column-free",Paragraph
"unloading and loading docks. At the point where these beams meet the multistory spine,",Paragraph
they are suspended from concrete hangers that are exposed on the elevation and that in,Paragraph
"turn are suspended from deep beams at roof level. Williams, who also sought to integrate",Paragraph
"structural and servicing systems, designed these hangers to be hollow, and they house air-",Paragraph
extract ducts.,Paragraph
Perhaps it is not surprising that these buildings appear to be inspired by American,Paragraph
"practice, for the first was commissioned by an American client; designed to optimize",Paragraph
"materials and structural systems developed by engineers such as Ernest Ransome, Turner,",Paragraph
and the Trussed Steel Concrete Company; and constructed after a series of large,Paragraph
reinforced-concrete industrial buildings designed by Albert Kahn that had been widely,Paragraph
"publicized. However, they should also be considered in a lineage that includes the",Paragraph
"significant work of Maillart, Freysinnet, and Perret in Europe. Williams’s buildings for",Caption

The Boston City Hall is a modern architectural icon that has served and identified the,Paragraph
"citizens of Boston since 1969. It is the product of the Boston architectural firm Kallmann,",Paragraph
"McKinnell and Knowles, now Kallmann, McKinnell and Wood, and a national design",Paragraph
competition held in 1962. The site is in the center of the historic Boston urban fabric in a,Paragraph
"plaza created by architect I.M.Pei. The trapezoidal site, comparable in scale to St. Mark’s",Paragraph
"Square in Venice, provides one of the earliest modern exterior public spaces in a large",Paragraph
American city.,Paragraph
"Gerhard Kallmann and Michael McKinnell, along with Edward Knowles, formed their",Paragraph
"office with this project. Kallmann, the eldest member of the team, German born and",Paragraph
"English educated, provided the philosophical expressions of the theory and the design",Paragraph
"ideas. McKinnell, English born and educated, has shared Kallmann’s inclusive and",Paragraph
sensitive approach to architecture for all the years of the office’s existence. Both have,Paragraph
"served as practicing architects, as educators at the Harvard Graduate School of Design,",Paragraph
and as researchers and historians. Henry Wood joined the firm in 1965.,Paragraph
The Boston City Hall expresses the design quality and philosophy of the firm. It is the,Paragraph
historical foundation of its design credits and the initial expression of its goals achieved,Paragraph
in the built environment. It is not easy to understand the building without a context or,Paragraph
"background in architecture. At the same time, it is a building much appreciated and",Paragraph
generally valued and approved by architects and architecture critics.,Paragraph
"Writing in in 1959, Gerhard Kallmann, as an educator, not yet practicing or having",Paragraph
"designed the City Hall, sought to generate a new spirit of creativity in architectural",Paragraph
"designers. Modernism as a style dominated the architectural scene, and its success was",Paragraph
multiplied by the large amounts of construction in the postwar period that conveyed that,Paragraph
"visual image. It was a time of rigid stylistic dogma, well-established rules, and culturally",Paragraph
defined and accepted physical forms. In the face of systems processes and deterministic,Paragraph
"products, Kallmann argued for and encouraged young architects to maintain confidence",Paragraph
in the traditional architectural problem-solving processes and insights. As Kallmann,Paragraph
"demonstrates in the Boston City Hall, it is critical that human emotions and expressions",Paragraph
overcome system processes that produce homogeneous and stylistically dead,Paragraph
metropolitan environments.,Paragraph
"In place of static modernism design approaches, Kallmann and McKinnell",Paragraph
championed the “New Brutalism” style. The work of Le Corbusier and the refining,Paragraph
qualities of Louis Kahn’s work served as springboards for the office to create a new,Paragraph
physical expression with a new direction affording new opportunities within the modern,Paragraph
"movement. In a lecture in 1959, Kallmann stated that this new direction “in its physical",Paragraph
"concreteness and firmness of build, strives for a confirmation of identity and existence to",Paragraph
counter the modern fear of nothingness.”,Paragraph
As a development of Kahn’s ideas of rigor and order within the context of New,Paragraph
"Brutalism, form, symbolism, function, and technology are balanced and integrated in the",Paragraph
"Boston City Hall. Form is the classical tripartite massing of base, body, and cap. Contrast",Paragraph
"and tension in this scheme is achieved by inverting the masses. The large, ordered, and",Paragraph
"repetitive office spaces are at the top. The body, or central portion of the tower,",Paragraph
symbolically expresses the central government process of council and mayor with clear,Paragraph
"and bold forms. The base is open and accessible, inviting and encouraging the public to",Paragraph
"enter and traverse the dramatic, interpenetrating interior arrival and circulation spaces.",Paragraph
The entire project is set on a brick plaza base that serves as a public,Paragraph
"gathering space and a Boston focal point. As an exterior circulation area, it",Paragraph
encourages movement through the plaza into the building and around to,Paragraph

The symbolism of the government is expressed as both authoritarian and,Paragraph
"human, inviting participation by the citizenry of Boston. There is a clear",Paragraph
expression of the government functions within a complexity that invites,Paragraph
interest and a desire to be included.,Paragraph
One element that fails in this openness and opportunity for public involvement is the,Paragraph
"long, high wall along Congress Street. It reflects the quality of monumental, institutional",Paragraph
scale typical of the modern artifacts at the time of its design. The wall serves as a brick,Paragraph
"barrier, unsympathetic to the pedestrian path at its side.",Paragraph
Analysis of the architecture of the Boston City Hall reveals an uncommon balance,Paragraph
"between the need to provide form, function, and technology. The integration of",Paragraph
environmental systems with the building structure and form is well studied and,Paragraph
developed. In what has become for the firm an opportunity to explore and express the,Paragraph
"central concepts of their design philosophy, the structural elements serve not only to",Paragraph
"support the building loads but also to formally become elements of style that define entry,",Paragraph
"wall, space, and program.",Paragraph
Daylighting and electric lighting are integrated so as to reveal the total architecture,Paragraph
and provide a cohesive fabric that underlies the total experience. The integration of the,Paragraph
air-handling ducts within the columns and beams successfully provides the services of the,Paragraph
system without focusing attention on the technology.,Paragraph
The use of exposed concrete as the building material is an issue for some of those who,Paragraph
are accustomed to the softer textures and feel of wood and the more human scale of,Paragraph
"masonry. Concrete is a cold, hard material, lacking the scale of detail in classical",Paragraph
masonry and stone construction. One must realize that this type of construction was new,Paragraph
and provided the opportunity for the “Brutal” style of modern architecture to come into,Paragraph
"being. This building, through detail and complexity of form and scale, overcomes the",Paragraph
"lack of historic context and precedence. However, the grayish values remain cold and",Paragraph
"provide a counterresistance to the open, inviting appearance.",Paragraph
"Today, although the building is recognized as an architectural icon, societal changes",Paragraph
and the growth of the Boston City government have generated calls for renovation and,Paragraph
even replacement. The biggest disappointment is the failure of the surrounding urban,Paragraph
community to successfully develop the plaza boundaries and walls. The exterior space,Paragraph
"fails to provide the human qualities of scale, texture, and meaning that are so",Paragraph
characteristic of the historic Boston urban scene. The surrounding structures have not,Paragraph
"provided the sense of place and balance of enclosure, entry, passage, and definition that is",Paragraph
characteristic of European piazzas. The reference to the comparable size of St. Mark’s,Paragraph
Square is limited to that parameter.,Paragraph
"Despite these qualifications, the Boston City Hall is a building of quality and historic",Paragraph
"significance. The style, program, holistic expression, and historic significance in the",Paragraph
annals of modern architecture make it one of the truly great buildings in the United,Paragraph
States.,Paragraph

"BOTTA, MARIO 1943—",Title
"Architect, Switzerland",Title
Mario Botta gained architectural fame during the early 1970s when he began,Paragraph
designing small houses in the Ticino region of Switzerland.,Paragraph
Botta completed an apprenticeship with Tita Carloni and architectural studies in Milan,Paragraph
"and Venice, prior to opening his own office in 1969. The houses he designed during the",Paragraph
early 1970s established the Ticino school and changed Swiss architec-ture dramatically.,Paragraph
It is largely because of Botta’s innovative work that the present generation of Swiss,Paragraph
architects is internationally acclaimed.,Paragraph
"During the 1970s and early 1980s, the Ticino region changed from a primarily",Paragraph
"agricultural economy, to an industrial one that emphasizes tourism. The primary cause of",Paragraph
this change was the integration of this region into the European highway system at the,Paragraph
beginning of the 1960s. Most of the Ticino architects built for the wealthy bourgeoisie,Paragraph
"who profited from the economic change, and Botta’s first commissions came either from",Paragraph
"clients to whom he was recommended by his mentor Carloni, or from his relatives. In",Paragraph
"addition, he participated in competitions, either alone or with older colleagues, such as",Paragraph
"Luigi Snozzi, Carloni, and Aurelio Galfetti.",Paragraph
The Ticino school generates its designs from architectural and contextual,Paragraph
"requirements. Architecturally, the buildings exhibit their materials and construction",Paragraph
"openly. Simple forms characterize typical examples, with a focus on mass and contour",Paragraph
"line, and ornamentation derived from structure and construction technology.",Paragraph
"Contextually, these designs attempt to relate the old to the new. The old comes from",Paragraph
"architectural typology and the vernacular traditions, and the new stems from building",Paragraph
"technology. In addition, these architects intend to express a mythical topography of the",Paragraph
"Ticino region, or what is termed the natural calling of the site. This architecture attempts",Paragraph
"to continue the trends already apparent in the organization of the land, and to realize",Paragraph
"them in an architecture conceived as an act of culture, which incorporates geometry and",Paragraph
history.,Paragraph
"For Botta, the dignity of architecture results not from intuition, but from architecture’s",Paragraph
own rules and from history. He proposes that history is the place where architecture finds,Paragraph
and defines its meaning. Form and meaning are determined through the relationship to,Paragraph
"historical buildings, especially the local Romanesque and baroque churches. New",Paragraph
"meanings can be derived only from these familiar themes, and it is only secondarily that",Paragraph
"meaning is created through sociocultural usage. Botta’s designs aim to contrast physical,",Paragraph
"social, and cultural traditions to the transient phenomena of modern life.",Paragraph
"Botta began in the 1960s, with designs that were inspired by the postwar",Paragraph
"work of his idols: Le Corbusier and Louis Kahn. During the 1970s, he",Paragraph
transformed his theories into buildings that had a strong formal quality.,Paragraph
"The Bianchi House (1973) in Riva San Vitale is a mysterious, isolated",Paragraph
tower that stands up to the surrounding mountains. It is defined by corner,Paragraph
"supports and a roof slab, and allows outside views by increasing the",Paragraph
opening of the construction shell as it rises. The confrontational position,Paragraph
"of the house to its site emerges in the entrance bridge, which",Paragraph
"San Francisco Museum of Modern Art,",Caption
"California, designed by Mario Botta",Caption
(1994),Title
© Mary Ann Sullivan,Title
"articulates the detachment between natural and man-made, resulting in stark, bizarre",Paragraph
forms.,Paragraph
"Botta’s buildings impress through their strong image quality, which might be",Paragraph
interpreted as cultural resistance intent on a new order and meaning. The houses are,Paragraph
devoid of clustered compositions or extensions. The massive exterior walls establish a,Paragraph
"sharp datum. Through such devices, the Casa Rotonda (1981) in Stabio establishes an",Paragraph
unexpected presence within an anonymous context. The building is derived from,Paragraph
"geometric form. The seemingly impenetrable, cylindrical shape contrasts with the large",Paragraph
cuts in its surface and suggests an opposition between fortification and openness. The,Paragraph
Casa Rotonda questions our assumptions concerning the nature of dwellings;,Paragraph
"conventional or traditional elements are eliminated. Moreover, everything is subordinated",Paragraph
to form. The interior is laid out symmetrically around the central slot of the stairwell and,Paragraph
"skylight, and rooms are irregular, leftover spaces resulting from inserting a rectangular",Paragraph
grid into the house’s cylinder.,Paragraph
"In larger designs, the geometrical forms became megastructures. The Middle School",Paragraph
"(1977) in Morbio Inferiore, uses a bridge typology for the arrangement of its eight",Paragraph
"classroom clusters. The complex is an orderly architectural composition with openings,",Paragraph
"covered areas, porticoes, and passages. Modular units are repeated to generate the overall",Paragraph
"shape, and to make the organizational structure of the building easily apparent. A",Paragraph
"spatially diverse, skylit central passage creates a rich variety of spaces inside this simple",Paragraph
form.,Paragraph
"In the State Bank (1982) in Fribourg, Botta managed to fit his building into an existing",Paragraph
"urban situation. A protruding cylindrical volume dominates a public square, and turns the",Paragraph
corner while the two receding wings relate to the rhythm and scale of the buildings on the,Paragraph
flanking streets. Botta used this approach of dividing a large building into different,Paragraph
shapes and facade articulations frequently during the 1980s.,Paragraph
"In the late 1980s, the images of the facades became dominant in Botta’s buildings;",Paragraph
they became figures in which typical details from his earlier designs were re-used. In his,Paragraph
"Union Bank (1995) in Basel, the facade, curved toward the square, impresses as a heavy",Paragraph
bastion. It opens into a cavity that is partly filled by a massive pier on a broad base.,Paragraph
"Although such shapes are appropriate for a bank building, they become disturbing when",Paragraph
used for other building types. The large cubical forms used for the Housing Complex,Paragraph
"(1982) in Novazzano appear to be without scale and meaningless, because they are not",Paragraph
finished in Botta’s traditional brick veneer. The absence of this craft surface reveals the,Paragraph
emptiness of these forms.,Paragraph
A disappointing aspect of Botta’s architecture is that most of his buildings seem to,Paragraph
"embody the same vision. Now, his repetitive cylinders have appeared in all parts of the",Paragraph
"world for the most diverse functions, such as museums, churches, single-family homes,",Paragraph
"shopping centers, and office buildings, as well as in his furniture designs and household",Paragraph
appliances.,Paragraph

"BRASILIA, BRAZIL 1955-60",Title
"The construction of Brasilia, the much-maligned capital city of Brazil, represents an",Paragraph
important and cathartic moment in the history of modern architecture and the,Paragraph
International Style. As well as becoming a national emblem for the geographically,Paragraph
"disparate country, Brasilia has also become, in more recent times, a symbol for some of",Paragraph
the perceived shortcomings of the modernist movement. Bringing together many of the,Paragraph
"European ideals that had accompanied the Utopian urban plans of the postwar years,",Paragraph
Brasilia necessitated the deployment of monumental architecture on a scale almost,Paragraph
unprecedented in the 20th century. The emphasis on establishing a new cultural identity,Paragraph
for the South American power was interwoven with the global architectural language of,Paragraph
Oscar Niemeyer and the Le Corbusian-inspired planning of his mentor Lucio Costa. The,Paragraph
optimistic proposal was to be realized within an incredibly short construction period and,Paragraph
in the wake of enormous political pressure.,Paragraph
The decision to relocate the Brazilian capital from Rio de Janeiro to Brasilia in the,Paragraph
isolated interior of the country was set against a backdrop of domestic instability and,Paragraph
individual ambition. In 1955 Juscelino Kubitschek had been elected president of Brazil,Paragraph
by a slender margin and without a party majority. The decision to build a new capital was,Paragraph
motivated by the need to consolidate the support of a marginal electorate as well as the,Paragraph
need to project Brazil into the technological age. The geography of the country had,Paragraph
"dictated much of the political and economic structure of Brazil, concentrating most of the",Paragraph
population and industry along the scenic Atlantic coast that housed most of Brazil’s,Paragraph
major cities. An inland capital was intended to not only symbolically relocate the seat of,Paragraph
national power but also shift the demographic and economic focus away from the,Paragraph
European colonial powers and toward the vast domestic hinterland. This was part of,Paragraph
Kubitschek’s nationwide industrialization process that sought to rapidly develop rural and,Paragraph
remote regions of Brazil and bring egalitarian prosperity to the emerging country. The,Paragraph
"new capital was to be a symbol for this modernization, establishing a new national",Paragraph
identity and offering the opportunity to reform the convoluted bureaucracy of the old,Paragraph
capital in Rio.,Paragraph
The fact that Kubitschek was limited to a single five-year term in office necessitated,Paragraph
that the epic project be realized within this period. The vast scale and enormous technical,Paragraph
impediments to the project meant that the preliminary design of the city had to be,Paragraph
"undertaken with speed and efficiency. Brazil’s most internationally renowned architect,",Paragraph
"Oscar Niemeyer, who had previously worked with Kubitschek, was appointed to direct",Paragraph
the works and given complete control over the design and construction process. On 16,Paragraph
"March 1957, Niemeyer announced a national competition for the master plan of the new",Paragraph
"capital and, as an important member of the jury, was instrumental in awarding the",Paragraph
winning scheme to Lucio Costa (his teacher and former employer). Niemeyer was to be,Paragraph
the architect for the buildings extending a long period of successful collaboration,Paragraph
between the two men. Construction was begun in 1957 and the new capital city was,Paragraph
inaugurated on schedule on 21 April 1960.,Paragraph
"Costa’s plan for the city was hinged around the intersection of two monumental axes,",Paragraph
marking Brasilia as the symbolic and geographic center of Brazil. The characteristic,Paragraph
"arrangement houses the three branches of government—legislative, executive, and",Paragraph
judicial—along a lineal central axis that Costa calls the Plaza of the Three Powers. From,Paragraph
"here, two wings radiate in either direction, housing the ministry buildings and embassies,",Paragraph
giving the plan a diagrammatic relationship to a modern aircraft. This cruciform plan was,Paragraph
an important symbol aligning the new capital not only with more traditional Catholic,Paragraph
"typology but also with the pervasive imagery of modernism, progress, and flight. Unlike",Paragraph
"the congested streets of Brazil’s coastal metropolises, the new capital was serviced by",Paragraph
"broad, expansive highways that celebrated automation and the technological convenience",Paragraph
of the modern age.,Paragraph
"Costa had followed Le Corbusier’s Ville Radieuse (Radial City) (partially,",Paragraph
implemented at Chandigarh) by isolating the political and administrative centers of the,Paragraph
"new capital from the housing and recreational facilities, which radiated out from the",Paragraph
"circumference of this new monolithic center. However, it was the imposing architectural",Paragraph
composition of Niemeyer that most clearly reiterated the formal principles of Le,Paragraph
Corbusian modernism. The language of Niemeyer’s grandiose structures betrayed a,Paragraph
"profound allegiance to Le Corbusier and, in particular, his work at Chandigarh.",Paragraph
"Niemeyer, in reverence to the Punjab capital, implemented a simple but elegant",Paragraph
geometric language to articulate the colossal monuments of Costa’s plan. The austerity of,Paragraph
"this new architectural entourage, like many modernist projects, attempted a synthesis",Paragraph
between an idealistic social vision and pure geometric form. The attenuated scale of the,Paragraph
buildings deployed in the capital worked with the master plan to facilitate a,Paragraph
"characteristically modernist reunification between architecture, nature, and the individual.",Paragraph
The Plaza of the Three Powers represents the political and architectural epicenter for,Paragraph
the new capital. The elegant Palacio de Planalto (Highland Palace) became the new seat,Paragraph
"for Brazil’s government, housed within a single structure running parallel to the plaza.",Paragraph
"Giant, curved concrete pilasters articulate the exterior of the building, allowing the roof",Paragraph
and floors to float gracefully above the ground. Opposite the palace and separated by a,Paragraph
"broad public space is the Supreme Court, which employs a similar language of forms to",Paragraph
the palace with the strong rhythm of sculptural pilasters that dominates the elevation. In,Paragraph
"the vast space between these two buildings, along the center of the axis, is the Museum of",Paragraph
"the City of Brasilia, characterized by a dramatic horizontal cantilever that memorializes",Paragraph
"the construction of the city. A large bust of Kubitschek faces back toward the palace,",Paragraph
unmistakably commemorating the president responsible.,Paragraph
The central axis is also the site of several important cultural buildings including the,Paragraph
"National Theatre and the sculptural Metropolitan Chapel. The chapel, in particular, is an",Paragraph
important structure subtly demarcating the roles of politics and religion within Costa’s,Paragraph
plan for a Utopian urbanism. The poetic conical structure is formed by 16 bent concrete,Paragraph
pilasters opening out at the top to form a crown. Between the concrete supports is a,Caption
mosaic of colored glass (redesigned in 1970 by Marianne Peretti) transmitting a powerful,Paragraph
"spirituality to the internal space. This is heightened by the entry procedure, which takes",Paragraph
visitors underground before depositing them dramatically in the center of the internalized,Paragraph
crystal chamber. The National Theatre also makes use of a pyramidal form elegantly,Paragraph
housing two theaters within a terraced subterranean crater.,Paragraph
The end of the Plaza of the Three Powers is punctuated by the third major,Paragraph
administrative building—the authoritative residence of the Congress. This colossal,Paragraph
structure dominates the surrounding landscape with two slender concrete towers on a,Paragraph
broad horizontal plinth. The two bodies of congress (the House of Deputies and the,Caption
"Senate) are expressed by two enormous parabolic dishes, one inverted, that are located on",Paragraph
either side of the two towers above the podium. The circular form of the dishes allows a,Paragraph
"seductive interior layout for the two legislative bodies, distributing, rather than focusing,",Paragraph
power.,Paragraph
"The playful composition of the Congress, set against the expansive public spaces of",Paragraph
"the plaza, marks the hierarchical apex of the axis forming a hinging point in the whole",Paragraph
design. Costa’s plan is reminiscent of the principles of the colonial baroque architecture,Paragraph
(evident in many coastal cities of Brazil) that established primary and secondary,Paragraph
"functional corridors. Architecturally, Neimeyer established this hierarchy through the use",Paragraph
of form and finish to distinguish between the sacred Plaza of the Three Powers and the,Paragraph
secondary administrative axis that bisects it. The various ministries that make up the two,Paragraph
curved wings of the plan are accommodated within undistinguished Cartesian office,Paragraph
"blocks, less elaborate than the parliamentary buildings in both form and execution.",Paragraph
Recent writers have applied a more critical eye to Brasilia and observed that,Paragraph
Niemeyer’s structures unwillingly enforced a cultural hierarchy by allocating expensive,Paragraph
finishes and detailing to the institutional structures and neglecting the sites of work and,Paragraph
"eisure. Unlike the rough Brutalism of Chandigarh, which was uncompromising in its",Paragraph
"rough-cast concrete finish, many of the significant buildings of Brasilia are finished with",Paragraph
"luxurious yet cosmetic surfaces like marble, metal, and mirrored panels. The most",Paragraph
"pronounced contrast with this, and the subject of many contemporary critiques of the city,",Paragraph
is embodied in the sprawling housing sectors that surround the capital and quickly,Paragraph
"became the scene of crime, poverty, and disease. As a result, Brasilia became a city of",Paragraph
transit for politicians who generally resided in Rio de Janeiro and visited the capital only,Paragraph
"intermittently. The residents of the city, many of whom had been instrumental in its",Paragraph
"construction, were relegated to ramshackle favelas enveloping the periphery of the city.",Paragraph
This divisive relationship between the center and the periphery seemingly enforces a rigid,Paragraph
social stratification between the monumental majesty of the governing elite and the,Paragraph
"working-class squatters, betraying the egalitarian rhetoric that initially inspired the",Paragraph
construction of the new capital.,Paragraph
Nowhere is the decadent luxury of Brasilia more evident than in the lavish presidential,Paragraph
"palace, which exists on an isolated site apart from the other institutional buildings.",Paragraph
"Known as the Alvarado Palace, the expansive residence was the first building completed",Paragraph
at Brasilia and remains one of the most recognizable and influential of Niemeyer’s,Paragraph
buildings. It quickly became the architectural symbol of the new capital. The palace,Paragraph
"employs a similar language to the Federal Government and Supreme Court monuments,",Paragraph
dominated by an inverted arched colonnade that sinks gracefully into a pristine reflecting,Paragraph
"pond. The palace incorporates a private chapel, signaling the seamless influence of the",Paragraph
"Catholic Church on the affairs of state. Located at the side of the imposing palace, the",Paragraph
"plan of the chapel is based on a sweeping spiral that, like the plastic forms of Le",Paragraph
"Corbusier’s Ronchamp, leads the visitor from the sculptural whitewashed exterior toward",Paragraph
"a discreet and contemplative altar. The geographic and spiritual isolation of the residence,",Paragraph
"as well as its imposing scale, further elaborates the social stratification intrinsic to the",Paragraph
program of the new Capital.,Paragraph
"Only four years after the city’s completion, Brazil was the victim of a military coup",Paragraph
that instantaneously reversed the democratic and egalitarian principles that had initially,Paragraph
inspired the construction of the new capital. The next 20 years within the country were,Paragraph
characterized by a turbulent political landscape that ultimately led Niemeyer to live in,Paragraph
"exile in Europe for several years. Despite this, Niemeyer, although occasionally",Paragraph
"distancing himself from the design of the city, continued his association with the capital",Paragraph
"under the new regime, finishing the construction of several important buildings, including",Paragraph
"the Ministry of Justice. Significantly, in 1980 Niemeyer proposed a monument to",Paragraph
"commemorate the death of Juscelino Kubitschek, who had been the political and spiritual",Paragraph
"force behind the new city. The monument, whose form is reminiscent of the hammer and",Paragraph
"sickle, houses the tomb of the former president in a serene underground chamber.",Paragraph
"However, possibly the most elegant and graceful of all of the buildings at Brasilia is",Paragraph
"the Pantheon of Liberty and Democracy, completed in 1987 in memory of Tancredo",Paragraph
Neves. The poetic reinforced concrete sails of the pyre now enclose the southern end of,Paragraph
"the Plaza of the Three Powers, juxtaposed against the robust silhouette of the congress",Paragraph
building at the northern end. The expressive structure subtly completes the urban,Paragraph
"composition, complementing the formal austerity of the earlier monumental structures",Paragraph
with contemporary images of peace and harmony.,Paragraph
Despite failing in its intention to create a more egalitarian society through pure,Paragraph
"architectural expression, the city of Brasilia remains a powerful urban gesture, layered",Paragraph
with symbolism of form and meaning deployed across a rich architectural tapestry. The,Paragraph
"dominant scenography, rigid geometric planning, and uniform aesthetic language",Paragraph
"effectively unite the diverse political, social, and artistic forces of the turbulent South",Paragraph
"American nation, forming a capital that is as inspirational as it is imperfect. The elegant",Paragraph
"poetry, epic scale, and often-naife socialism embodied in the monumental forms provide",Paragraph
an important commentary on both the best and worst aspects of the Modern movement.,Paragraph

The 20th-century architecture of Brazil became widely famous for its originality and,Paragraph
formal freedom in contrast to more codified paradigms of modernism. Celebrated abroad,Paragraph
"as a step ahead of functionalism and rationalism, Brazilian modernism acquired",Paragraph
"international significance in the 1950s, and the effects of it can still be found in",Paragraph
"contemporary architecture. However, to grasp the full scope of Brazilian 20th-century",Paragraph
"architecture, it is necessary to understand the radical transformations in its economy and",Paragraph
society that led to an accelerated process of urbanization. From 17 million inhabitants in,Paragraph
"1900, 70 percent of whom were living in rural areas, Brazil closed the century with",Paragraph
"almost 170 million, with more than 60 percent living in urban areas.",Paragraph
Brazilians entered the 20th century under the influence of positivism and sanitary,Paragraph
engineering as two events of 1897 indicate: the planned city of Belo Horizonte was,Paragraph
inaugurated to replace the 18th-century Ouro Preto as the capital of the state of Minas,Paragraph
"Gerais, and Canudos, a fast-growing spontaneous settlement guided by messianic leader",Paragraph
"Antonio Conselheiro in Bahia, was destroyed by the Brazilian army. Both the plan of",Paragraph
Belo Horizonte by engineer Aardo Reis and the Canudos war campaign reveal positivist,Paragraph
views of sanitation and circulation in vogue at that time.,Paragraph
"Following that direction, the 1900s would be marked in Rio by the urban reformations",Paragraph
"of Pereira Passos, with avenues being opened and slums being displaced while civic",Paragraph
"buildings in French neoclassical style took its place (for example, in Teatro Nacional,",Paragraph
1906). In 1927 another plan by the French urbanist Alfred Agache would be the structure,Paragraph
"for Rio’s main transformations of the first half of the century. Meanwhile, Sao Paulo",Paragraph
experimented an exhilarating growth brought about by the coffee-based economy that,Paragraph
provided new developments based on garden city ideas for the emergent middle class.,Paragraph
"Around 1905 Victor Dubugras was designing railroad stations in the Art Nouveau style,",Paragraph
initiating what would be Sao Paulo’s cosmopolitan modernity.,Paragraph
"Later, in the second decade of the century, a debate would arise regarding issues of",Paragraph
local identity versus international images with the arrival of Art Deco on the one hand,Paragraph
and the development of neo-Colonial styles on the other. The Deco tradition was manifest,Paragraph
"in many of Brazil’s landmarks, such as the Cristo Redentor statue over Rio, the City Hall",Paragraph
"in Belo Horizonte, and multiple buildings and viaducts in Sdo Paulo. On the other hand,",Paragraph
"the neo-Colonial movement, led by José Mariano Filho, would battle against the",Paragraph
modernist avant-garde ideas during the whole of the 1920s and 1930s but would also be,Paragraph
fundamental to give Brazilian modernism its character by valuing the forms of 18th-,Paragraph
century baroque.,Paragraph
"Until the 1920s, modernism had an impact only on some isolated painters and writers",Paragraph
who were influential within architectural developments. The event that marks the starting,Paragraph
"point of Brazilian avant-garde is the Semana de Arte Moderna, a week of exhibitions,",Paragraph
"lectures, and poetry declamation organized in Sado Paulo in 1922. From this period, we",Paragraph
can highlight the works of Oswald de Andrade on texts such as —_ and the young female,Paragraph
painters Anita Malfatti and Tarsila do Amaral. They attempted to resolve the apparently,Paragraph
opposing forces of abstract internationalism and the representation of local identities.,Paragraph
"After the polemical introduction at the Semana, Brazilian avant-garde artists gradually",Paragraph
turned to the issue of adapting the avant-garde to Brazilian reality and “Brazilianess.” As,Paragraph
"early as 1925, articles appeared in Sdo Paulo’s newspapers by Rino Levi and Gregory",Paragraph
"Warchavchik, who were the first exponents of what contemporary historiography calls",Paragraph
“modern architecture in Brazil” (primarily derived from European traditions) to,Paragraph
differentiate it from “Brazilian modern architecture” (exemplified by Brazilian-derived,Paragraph
"ideas and formal vocabularies). Rino Levi (Art Palacio Movie Theater, 1936) became an",Paragraph
"exemplar of Brazilian modernism, whereas Warchavchik (House at Rua Itapolis, 1928)",Caption
would play an important role as Costa’s partner for a while and also as the first Latin,Paragraph
American delegate to the CIAM (Congrés Internationaux d’Architecture Moderne).,Paragraph
"In 1930, in what would be one of the key moments of Brazilian architecture, Lacio",Paragraph
Costa was named director of ENBA (National School of Beaux-Arts). As soon as he was,Paragraph
"named, Costa began a radical reformation of the art and architecture curriculum based on",Paragraph
the Bauhaus pedagogy and Le Corbusier’s ideas in architecture. The strong reaction,Paragraph
"against the changes led to Costa’s replacement 11 months later, but the ideas that he",Paragraph
"installed flourished with a generation of students at that time: Oscar Niemeyer, Roberto",Paragraph
"Burle Marx, Affonso Raidy, Carlos Moreira, Milton Roberto, Luis Nunes, and Henrique",Paragraph
"Mindlin, among others. Until 1930 the ENBA still adopted the 19th-century academic",Paragraph
"approach to architectural teaching, with a strong emphasis on classical figurative",Paragraph
"drawing. This was changed in the 1930 curricular reformation, and this early generation",Paragraph
of Brazilian modern architects took advantage of both the strong domain of classical,Paragraph
drawing and the new architectural freedom of avant-garde techniques. After leaving the,Paragraph
"ENBA, Costa went to work for the Ministry of Education and Culture on the organization",Paragraph
"of SPHAN, the Brazilian Office for Conservation of Historic Monuments.",Paragraph
"With the task of cataloging, protecting, and publicizing Brazilian historic and artistic",Paragraph
"heritage, the Servigo do Patrim6nio Histérico e Artistico (SPHAN) was created in 1937.",Paragraph
"Costa’s acumen played a major role in the articulation of Brazilian modern architecture,",Paragraph
stitching together the past and the future into a very effective concept of architecture.,Paragraph
"Standing in defense of the | 8th-century baroque, not yet valued by modern critique and",Paragraph
"diminished by the Beaux-Arts academia, Costa sought transitions and continuations",Paragraph
rather than ruptures and breaks; he thus conceived of modern architecture as a natural,Paragraph
continuation of the baroque style.,Paragraph
In 1936 Le Corbusier was invited as a supportive consultant for the team of architects,Paragraph
commissioned to design the new building for the Brazilian Ministry of Education and,Caption
Health (MES). The invitation of Le Corbusier served as a support for canceling the,Paragraph
"previous competition, as the winning design was considered by the government to be",Paragraph
"incompatible with the modern image that it was trying to establish. The MES building,",Paragraph
"one of the first high-rises of the world following Le Corbusier’s five points, would",Paragraph

BRICK,Title
"“A common, ordinary brick,” says Woody Harrelson, playing an architect in the movie",Paragraph
"(1993), “wants to be something more than it is.” Harrelson proceeds to turn this",Paragraph
"proposition into a metaphor for the human condition, something never envisioned by the",Paragraph
real architect who served as an inspiration for the movie’s monologue. It was Louis,Paragraph
I.Kahn (1903-74) who first posed a question in the early 1970s that has since attained,Paragraph
"legendary status within architectural circles: “What do you want, brick?” The answer,",Paragraph
"according to Kahn, is that brick wants to be an arch and not merely an in-fill or cladding",Paragraph
material with no structural role.,Paragraph
"In fact, a key to understanding brick as a modern architectural material lies precisely",Paragraph
in its dual potential to be both structure and cladding. For the greater part of the history of,Paragraph
"architecture, brick walls assumed both roles, simultaneously supporting floors and roof",Paragraph
while at the same time providing enclosure. It is only since the late 19th century that it,Paragraph
has become possible to separate those roles by creating an independent framework of,Paragraph
steel or reinforced concrete (structure) to which exterior brick may be attached,Paragraph
"(cladding). In this case, the brick no longer supports the floors and roof, although its",Paragraph
appearance as cladding might well obscure this fundamental distinction.,Paragraph
"From the Kahnian viewpoint, brick as mere cladding was inherently suspect.",Paragraph
"However, other modernists were equally distrustful of brick as load-bearing structure, as",Paragraph
"this seemed to negate the idea of the “free plan,” the independence of structural",Paragraph
"framework from means of enclosure, and the opportunities for large glass areas. In fact,",Paragraph
an influential faction of early 20th-century modern architects and theorists eschewed the,Paragraph
"use of brick in any form, associating it with the 19th-century cultural forces that they",Paragraph
were attempting to overcome. They lobbied instead for the 20th century’s revolutionary,Paragraph
"new materials of construction: glass, steel, and reinforced concrete. Where construction",Paragraph
"with brick walls was still found expedient within this context, a coat of plaster could",Paragraph
transform the deviant surface into something acceptably plain and neutral. As a of,Paragraph
"traditional culture and pre-industrial technology, brick was an easy target. However,",Paragraph
brick’s traditional role as load-bearing structure was also legitimately challenged by the,Paragraph
need for greater heights and larger spans in the new commercial and industrial structures,Paragraph
"of the 19th and 20th centuries and by the ascendancy of heterogeneous, layered exterior",Paragraph
"wall systems that could accommodate air and vapor barriers, thermal insulation, and an",Paragraph
air space (cavity) to block the migration of water through exterior walls.,Paragraph
"Nevertheless, brick was never rejected absolutely and was, on the contrary, often",Paragraph
found capable of embodying precisely the abstract formal values that helped define the,Paragraph
new modernist aesthetic. Even load-bearing brick buildings remained influential well into,Paragraph
"the 20th century, acting as a kind of conservative moral datum of “honest” construction",Paragraph
"(what the brick really “wanted to be”) opposed to some, but not all, modern tendencies.",Paragraph
"Architects continued to use brick with enthusiasm and, like Frank Lloyd Wright (1867—",Paragraph
"1959), boasted that in their hands the ordinary brick became “worth its weight in gold.”",Paragraph
"Other practitioners, however, were less confident about the appropriateness of brick in",Paragraph
"modern construction; for them, brick represented a kind of compromise—accepted with",Paragraph
"various degrees of ambivalence—between the new culture, technology, and aesthetics of",Paragraph
"the 20th century and those that preceded it. At the same time, brick itself was subject to",Paragraph
"technological change, evidenced not only in the increased systemization of its",Paragraph
"manufacture, begun in the late 12th century and culminating in the 19th century’s",Paragraph
"relentless mechanization of all aspects of the brick-making process, but in the application",Paragraph
of Frederick Taylor’s theory of scientific management to bricklaying in the first decades,Paragraph
of the 20th century.,Paragraph
"Brick was widely used throughout the 20th century, accommodated within virtually all",Paragraph
styles. The chronological survey that follows is therefore necessarily incomplete and,Paragraph
"somewhat arbitrary. That being said, several key developments can be high-lighted,",Paragraph
"starting with the period before World War I. Already, a number of trends can be",Paragraph
discerned in the late 19th century that continued to be played out well into the 20th. The,Paragraph
first can be illustrated by Daniel Burnham’s design for the Monadnock Building in,Paragraph
"Chicago (1889) and H.P.Berlage’s Amsterdam Stock Exchange (1903), both of which",Paragraph
pointed the way toward a reinterpretation of brick informed by the modernist bias toward,Paragraph
"simple, relatively unornamented surfaces, even when used in load-bearing wall",Paragraph
"construction. A second, more complex tendency can be seen in the brick facade of Louis",Paragraph
"Sullivan’s Wain-wright Building in St. Louis (1890), which, while functioning as",Paragraph
"nonstructural cladding, was meant to express symbolically the “idea” of the steel",Paragraph
"framework behind it. What resulted, though, was a certain ambiguity—some would call it",Paragraph
deceit—in which the actual construction of the building was severed from its outward,Paragraph
form.,Paragraph
A third trend derives from 19th-century brick-walled factory buildings characterized,Paragraph
"by flat brick surfaces, functional massing, and the use—at least internally—of heavy",Paragraph
"timber or cast-iron structural elements. In Hans Poelzig’s chemical plant at Luban (1911),",Paragraph
"the asymmetric massing and unornamented surfaces were distinctly modern; in contrast,",Paragraph
"the small, rectangular and arched window openings that punctuated the brick walls",Paragraph
"evoked a premodern sensibility. On the other hand, the Fagus Werk factory in Alfeld-an-",Paragraph
"der-Leine (1911) and the model factory, Werkbund exhibition, Cologne (1914), by",Caption
Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer—both brick-clad buildings—contained elements of,Paragraph
"classical axiality in their massing while their innovative glass curtain walls, when",Paragraph
"photographed from the proper perspective, gave the buildings a dynamic modern",Paragraph
appearance. An additional variation on this theme can be seen in Poelzig’s Upper Silesia,Paragraph
"Tower in Posen (1911), where brick cladding is clearly expressed as nonstructural “in-",Paragraph
"fill” within an actual structural frame exposed on the building’s surface. However, this",Paragraph
"remained a minority position, in part because the exposure of an actual skeletal",Paragraph
"framework, especially of steel, invites problems with corrosion, differential thermal",Paragraph

opportunity for this remarkable plan was provided initially by an invitation to present the,Paragraph
1930 Kahn Lectures at Princeton University. After a decade of personal trials and,Paragraph
"professional inactivity and with the economic depression increasingly pressing, Wright",Paragraph
knew that these lectures could provide an opportunity for regeneration. In those sections,Paragraph
"devoted to the city, he presented no specific layout or architectural parts. Instead, he",Paragraph
"negatively exposed the physical and social state of present cities; they were ugly,",Paragraph
"congested, dirty, badly administered, and an economic disaster. Wright’s solutions were,",Paragraph
"however, mired in emotion mixed by awkwardly unclear language. Yet the vision of",Paragraph
Broadacre City was described in all but name. His comments match those in his,Paragraph
"autobiography, written at the same time and for the same reason.",Paragraph
"For the autobiography, Wright wrote a concluding section about Broadacre, but the",Paragraph
publisher rejected it. Wright then had it produced as a pamphlet titled . The first half,Paragraph
"contained philosophical reasons for change and an accounting of present ills, organized",Paragraph
under five headings: economic (drawn from the analytical and curative ideas of Henry,Paragraph
George); suppression of human individuality; urban concentrations and the inhuman,Paragraph
"vertical city; the failure to embrace modern resources (for example, telecommunications,",Paragraph
"mechanical systems, and new building materials); and chaotic automobile traffic.",Paragraph
"The last half of | offered some rather inexact proposals for rectification, all to be",Paragraph
activated by adhering to George’s social and economic observations and promotion of the,Paragraph
individual as the dominant factor in opposition to collectivism and the dominating,Paragraph
authorities of government and church. If causes and effects were properly understood and,Paragraph

such. Lyman Sargent’s reasonable specification (in 1988) is that a utopia must,Paragraph

at the turn of the century. Since 1890 a group of young architects such as Victor Horta,Paragraph

This aesthetic quest in search for perfect harmony would dominate the avant-garde,Paragraph
architecture until the eve of World War I.,Paragraph
During the movements with more vigor and amplitude promoted a rationalization of,Paragraph
the building process. In order to solve the problems of Brussels’s overcrowded inner-city,Paragraph

The designs for public buildings during that period were mainly experimentation,Paragraph
grounds with the new material rein-forced concrete and complex building programs.,Paragraph
Horta’s Palais des Beaux-Arts (1928) has both classical and Art Deco stylistic features,Paragraph
and is built in reinforced concrete. The complicated plan reveals the architect’s primary,Paragraph
"concern, namely, to accommodate a complex building program on an irregular sloping",Paragraph

tendencies would leave their undeniable mark on the urban landscape. The North-South,Paragraph
"connection, a master plan developed back in the 19th century, took until 1945 to be",Paragraph
completed. This urban intervention longitudinally dissected the city and left a whole area,Paragraph
that needed to be redeveloped. A variety of public buildings in a number of styles were,Paragraph

"Housing programs, both individual and collective ones, remained the most important",Paragraph
"architectural tasks during this post-war period. Villas, with facades in noble materials,",Paragraph
"such as natural French stone, adorned Brussels’s most prominent boulevards leading to",Paragraph
suburbs such as Tervueren and Uccle/Ukkel. Few of these buildings have a modern,Paragraph
"character. Exceptions are the residences in Uccle/Ukkel (1954) by L.J.Boucher (1929-),",Paragraph
"J.P.Blondel (1924—-), and O.Filippone (1927—). Row houses, the most common type of",Paragraph

"1954, E.Delatte’s (1910—) design for his own house sets the standard: a garage and entry",Paragraph
"hall on the ground level, daytime spaces on the first floor, nighttime spaces on the second",Paragraph
"floor, and a brick facade. Apartment buildings were an attempt to change the monotony",Paragraph
of this typology. Noteworthy examples are the apartment buildings (1949) by Josse,Paragraph
"Franssen in Schaarbeek, the duplex apartments in the high-rise tower (1954) by W.Van",Caption

"Whereas before World War II, modernism would be generated in Europe and",Paragraph
"emulated in the United States; after World War II, Europe borrowed ideas from America",Paragraph
to further develop its cities. Public buildings such as the offices of the Prévoyance,Paragraph
"Sociale (PS), designed in 1957 by H.Van Kuyck (1902-), introduced the American",Paragraph
technique of the curtain wall. The Corporate Headquarters Offices of the Bank Lambert,Caption
"(1965) were designed by Gordon Bunshaft (1909-90), a partner of Skidmore, Owings",Paragraph
and Merrill. Although for the latter this project was merely an intermediate step in an,Paragraph
"evolving typology, for Brussels it represented a primer with its freestanding pillars that",Paragraph
support the cross-shaped prefabricated concrete elements of the elevation. This,Paragraph
"procedure, which alleviated multiple shortcomings of the curtain wall, has been emulated",Paragraph
"in many projects. An example is the Glaverbel office building (1967, Watermael-",Paragraph

American model.,Paragraph
"During the 1970s and 1980s, Belgian architecture freed itself from the doctrines of the",Paragraph

"heritage. At first various retro styles, such as neoecclecticism, neo-Art Nouveau and neo-",Paragraph
"Art Deco, were rekindled; yet they did not, besides some ersatz products, make any",Paragraph
valuable contributions. The Belgian capital in search for its own identity did not find a,Paragraph
new architectural style. Noteworthy for the period are some remarkable architectural and,Paragraph
urban rehabilitation projects. The beautiful Salon du Concert Noble designed by,Caption
H.Beyaert in the 19thh century became an integral part of a new office building. And in,Paragraph
"1983, it was decided that the new Museum of Modern Art (R.Bastin, L.Beeck) at the",Paragraph
Place Royale/Koningsplein had to be built completely below ground around a central,Paragraph
courtyard to minimally impact this historically significant urban context.,Paragraph
The last decade of the century is marked by a rekindled interest in qualitative,Paragraph
architecture. Typical for the 1990s is the work of H.Daem and P.Robberecht (1950—),Paragraph
whose minimalist architecture are virtually invisible interventions in existing situations in,Paragraph
order to celebrate a work of art or a significant restored building element. In the Hufkens,Paragraph
"gallery (1992), for example, the classical facade was carefully restored while the body of",Paragraph

"composition contrasting open versus closed parts, is incontestably modern. It is",Paragraph
"furthermore continued in the roof where it provides idiosyncratic light wells that, in",Paragraph
"reference to V.Horta’s nearby townhouses, help to illuminate the otherwise dark interior",Paragraph
spaces.,Paragraph
Exemplary public buildings of the early 1990s are the projects by Ph. Samyn (1948-),Paragraph
and Partners. Their architecture may be characterized as contemporary high-tech,Paragraph
"executions of classical spatial compositions. His Brussimmo Office Building (1993),",Paragraph
erected in the Leopold district where most of the European institutes have their,Paragraph

"Brutalism (also called New Brutalism), narrowly defined, was the term used to describe",Paragraph

humane goals.,Paragraph
Given the exigencies of building in Europe in the years immediately following World,Paragraph
"War II, namely, limited resources and unlimited demand, it was no surprise that the new",Paragraph
generation of postwar architects saw before them not merely opportunity but the,Paragraph
challenge to respond to circumstances that seemed unprecedented in European history.,Paragraph
"After World War I, architects seemed to approach the task of rebuilding in Europe with",Paragraph
revolutionary idealism and an optimistic trust in mechanical technology. International,Paragraph
Modernism seemed to represent not only all that was modern but also all that was,Paragraph
valuable in a devalued and degraded world. The generation following World War II had,Paragraph
"less use for idealism, revolutionary or otherwise, and diminished trust in technology. It",Paragraph
"was in that context that the Brutalist apothegm “An ethic, not an aesthetic” acquired",Paragraph
"significance. The new generation embraced several precepts: first, that architecture",Paragraph
"absorbed existential weight; second, that building was the result not of reasoning but of",Paragraph
"ethical action; and finally, that International Style modernism was no more than shallow",Paragraph
aestheticism. It was the radicalism of its approach rather than the persuasiveness of its,Paragraph
early monuments that enabled Brutalism to force a transformation of the accepted,Paragraph
"conventions of modernism. Despite its short life as an identifiable movement, Brutalism",Paragraph
came to occupy a central position in the redefinition of the history of 20th-century,Paragraph
architecture.,Paragraph
"The first built Brutalist work was the Secondary School at Hunstanton in Norfolk,",Paragraph
"England (Peter and Alison Smithson, 1954), which employed what seemed at first glance",Paragraph
to be a Miesian aesthetic of pure structural clarity. For a building at that time in Britain to,Paragraph
"follow the example of Mies van der Rohe would have been provocative enough, but the",Paragraph
"Hunstanton School added another dimension to Miesian clarity: that of the mundane, the",Paragraph
"diurnal, the literal. Thereafter, the Smithsons turned their attention to larger questions,",Paragraph
especially the need for a new approach to public housing in post-World War II Europe.,Paragraph
"Their new concerns resulted in no built works of their own, but their original ideas",Paragraph
became profoundly influential. The next range of Brutalist buildings were to be the works,Paragraph
"of other young British architects; for example, the Terrace Housing (Howell, Howell, and",Paragraph

"Common, 1958), Architecture School Extension (Wilson and Hardy, Cambridge, 1959),",Caption
"Park Hill Development (Sheffield City Architect, Sheffield, 1961), and Engineering",Paragraph
"School Laboratories (Stirling and Gowan, Leicester, 1963), among others. All of those",Paragraph
"examples shared an unyielding emphasis on structural clarity, spatial simplicity, and",Paragraph
"material presence, and all contributed to the solidifying of the character of Brutalism in",Paragraph
the general imagination.,Paragraph
"The origin of the term Brutalism is not reliably attested, but the most plausible",Paragraph
explanation comes from adaptation of the French phrase (rough concrete) to describe,Paragraph
"the material qualities of many buildings in Europe after World War II, qualities",Paragraph
necessitated by a general lack of the time and resources necessary to obtain finer finishes.,Paragraph
"In particular, two works by the Swiss-French architect, Le Corbusier—the Unite",Paragraph
"d’Habitation (Marseilles, 1946-52) and the Maisons Jaoul (Neuilly, 1954)—played major",Paragraph
"parts in establishing the Brutalist model. In the first case, the Unite d’Habitation",Paragraph
"displayed unfinished, boldly concrete surfaces laid out in patterns directly descriptive of",Paragraph
"the processes of its fabrication. In Maisons Jaoul, Le Corbusier employed rough",Paragraph
"brickwork, tile-surfaced concrete vaults, and raw plywood, mimicking traditional",Paragraph
"vernacular building with industrial materials. To be sure, at least one Brutalist building",Paragraph
"had appeared in Britain by 1954, but that fact cannot obscure the role of Le Corbusier’s",Paragraph
works as precursors of the new wave. To the smooth white planes and elegantly balanced,Paragraph
compositions of International Style (to whose definition Le Corbusier himself had made,Paragraph
"major contributions before 1939), Brutalism contrasted unfinished, natural-colored",Paragraph
"surfaces and seemingly awkward arrangements of parts, only too often revealing messy",Paragraph
"and formerly hidden mechanical functions. Indeed, even when smoothly finished,",Paragraph
"Brutalist buildings appeared crude and ordinary, with what some critics saw as willful",Paragraph
perversity.,Paragraph
"Again, although it was at first essentially a British phenomenon, Brutalism’s reach",Paragraph

"As the capital of Romania, Bucharest can be also considered the primary source of the",Paragraph
"country’s modern architecture, beginning in the second half of the 19th century and",Paragraph
"continuing throughout the 20th century. Like other major European capitals, the search to",Paragraph
define an emblematic national character for Bucharest’s architecture developed in,Paragraph
relationship to historical precedents as well as the contemporary milieu.,Paragraph
The 19th century represented a period of major change for Bucharest in both political,Paragraph
and cultural realms. The first half of the century encouraged Western European values of,Paragraph
"culture and civilization, thus announcing a massive import of several architectural",Paragraph
currents—mainly neoclassicism and Romanticism—that progressively changed the,Paragraph
"Oriental aspect of the city. In 1859, as the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia",Paragraph
"unified, Bucharest became the capital of the new state of Romania and, in 1878, after the",Paragraph
"country won its independence from the Ottoman Empire, the capital of the kingdom of",Paragraph
Romania. This gain in political prestige was reflected in the architectural field by an,Paragraph
"important campaign of building monumental official institutions and luxury residencies,",Paragraph
"all inspired by the French eclecticism of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. French influence,",Paragraph
"dispersed through the work of French architects or Romanians trained at the Ecole,",Paragraph

"followed the same way of modernization by assimilating the French model, as it",Paragraph
happened for the creation of a series of boulevards inspired by Baron von Haussmann’s,Paragraph
"Parisian model. Parallel to the spread of foreign currents, the first Romanian architects",Paragraph
"attempted to create a style based on a national expression in Bucharest, interpreting the",Paragraph
rich heritage of historic and folk tradition.,Paragraph
"As the majority of Romanian architects studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris,",Paragraph
"even after the foundation of the School of Architecture in Bucharest in 1892, their",Paragraph
production mirrored the French aesthetic (primarily the historical revivalism and,Paragraph
academicism of Beaux-Arts or the neobaroque). Among the most important public,Paragraph
buildings designed according to the French method were the Palace of the Chamber of,Paragraph
"Deputies (1907) and the Military Circle (1912), both by Dimitrie Maimarolu, and the",Paragraph
"Palace of the Bourse (1911) by Stefan Burcus. However, the magnificence of the French",Paragraph
"influence was reflected mostly in the sumptuous compositions of private dwellings, such",Paragraph
as those designed by Ion D. Berindey (1871-1928) and Petre Antonescu (1873-1965).,Paragraph
"In contrast, the development of a “national” style emerged as a reaction against the",Paragraph
"omnipresent foreign stylistic models. Its aesthetics exalted the local tradition, interpreting",Paragraph
major examples from the Wallachian architecture of the 18th century (considered as the,Paragraph
most representative) and assimilating the craftsmanship and ornamentation of the folk,Paragraph

Economic prosperity and a governmental legislation that encouraged construction,Title
transformed Bucharest into a huge building site. The penetration of new architectural,Paragraph
ideas and modernist architecture was favored by several institutions and particularly,Paragraph
among intellectual circles with shared progressive or avant-garde views. Modernist,Paragraph
"architecture never achieved an official status, but nevertheless it became the emblem of",Paragraph
"post-World War II dynamism. In fact, the first important modernist building, the ARO",Paragraph

company Asigurarea Romaneasca (ARO). Other important public buildings developed,Paragraph
"the potential of modernism, including those designed by Duliu Marcu, Rudolf Fraenkel,",Paragraph

"Budapest is the capital of Hungary, and is the industrial, commercial, and cultural center",Paragraph
"of the country. The city is situated on the Danube River, in the geographic center of the",Paragraph
"region. With the compromise between Hungary and Austria in 1867, a period of",Paragraph

"280, 349 inhabitants. At the turn of the century, Budapest already had a population of",Paragraph
"733,350. In 1871 the first international competition in urban development was announced",Paragraph
to restructure the capital. Its program underlined the importance of the Chain Bridge as,Paragraph
the central connection between Buda and Pest. A system of boulevards and avenues was,Paragraph
"realized as the result of the competition and subsequent revisions, and the urban structure",Paragraph
of Budapest today is determined by the largescale realization of what was probably the,Paragraph
most consistent attempt to create a bourgeois city in Europe.,Paragraph
"The Danube is the determining element of the monumental cityscape, its sweep",Paragraph
underlined by the closed building facades on the embankments. The architectural,Paragraph
"treatment of the river-front and St. Marguerite Island, which became an urban park, was",Paragraph
seen by many urban planners of the time as a major achievement. The problem of,Paragraph
creating well-functioning connections between Pest and Buda was solved by a number of,Paragraph

The basis of Budapest’s prosperity was the grain-milling industry and the processing,Paragraph
and sale of other agricultural goods in the Carpathian basin. Urban development was,Paragraph
"conducted by the Council of Public Works (1870-1949), a body related to the",Paragraph
municipality as well as to the government. The downtown business and residential,Paragraph
district was executed during the last three decades of the 19th century. The typical,Paragraph
residential unit of Budapest was a block of rental apartments with an interior courtyard.,Paragraph
Access to the individual flats was from open galleries in the courtyard. The quality of,Paragraph
apartments and the social status of their inhabitants could differ within a one-block area.,Paragraph
Upper-middle-class families built summer residences and villas on the green hills of,Paragraph

BUNGALOW,Title
"As the 19th century drew to a close and the 20th began, Victorian ideals and the domestic",Paragraph
architecture that embodied them were coming under increased scrutiny. Beginning in the,Paragraph
"1880s, the Arts and Crafts movement and its bungalows would transform the landscape",Paragraph
of American domestic architecture and serve as a transitional housing form in the years,Paragraph
"prior to World War II. Between 1900 and 1930, the bungalow was the most widespread",Paragraph
"housing type in the country, from city to suburb.",Paragraph
Bungalows responded to a constellation of sociocultural forces and economic,Paragraph
"necessities, particularly to the Progressive Era philosophy of the Arts and Crafts",Paragraph
movement. As the cost of previously unavailable household technologies such as indoor,Paragraph
"plumbing and electricity increased, the size of American homes was reduced to",Paragraph
compensate for these expenses (which could add between 25 and 40 percent to a home’s,Paragraph
"cost). At the same time, “simplicity” became a watchword of the Arts and Crafts",Paragraph
"movement, which was taking shape in the United States with the help of publications",Paragraph
"such as Gustav Stickley’s magazine. For Arts and Crafts proponents, the craftsman-",Paragraph
"inspired bungalow provided an economically advantageous, socially responsible, and",Paragraph
artistic dwelling for members of the middle and working classes.,Paragraph
Bungalow scholar Clay Lancaster explains that “the word ‘bungalow’ originated in,Paragraph
"India, derived from the Bengali noun meaning a low house with galleries or porches all",Paragraph
"around” (see Lancaster, 1985). The first American bungalows appeared along the eastern",Paragraph
seaboard as a type of resort architecture. Much grander in scale than the more modest,Paragraph
"bungalows that followed, these early bungalows nevertheless included the ample porches",Paragraph
and exposed-framing construction that are typical of the form. Although not all scholars,Paragraph
"agree on this point, the architects who are usually credited with perfecting the bungalow",Paragraph
style in the United States are Charles Sumner Greene and Henry Mather Greene. In,Paragraph
"addition to the Greenes, architect Frank Lloyd Wright’s Prairie style of domestic",Paragraph
"architecture influenced mid-western bungalows. In California, where the bungalow was",Paragraph
"most popular, Arthur and Alfred Heineman were well known for pioneering the concept",Paragraph
"of the “bungalow court,” featuring multiple bungalows around a central courtyard.",Paragraph
"Beginning in the early 1900s, the Greene brothers designed a number of relatively",Paragraph
"inexpensive California homes as well as the “Ultimate Bungalows,” for which they are",Paragraph
"best known (for example, the Blacker House [1907] and the Gamble House [1908]). The",Paragraph
distinguishing features of the Greenes’ style include (1) a heavy use of wood and natural,Paragraph
"materials, such as clinker brick and river stone; (2) exposed interior and exterior joinery;",Paragraph
(3) the use of sleeping and living porches to enhance the occupants’ contact with nature;,Paragraph
"(4) a concern for the “total design” of a home, including its textiles and furnishings; and",Paragraph
(5) the use of relatively open floor plans. Many of these features are evident in simpler,Paragraph
"and smaller bungalows that feature natural building materials, wide porches with heavy",Paragraph
"(typically masonry) columns, and low-pitched roofs with exposed rafters and joinery. In",Paragraph
"addition to these features, many bungalows incorporate outdoor gardens with pergolas,",Paragraph
"porches specifically designed for sleeping, and prominent chimneys constructed of rustic",Paragraph
materials.,Paragraph
Architectural historian Marcus Whiffen (1969) explains that “it was the bungalow as,Paragraph
much as any other kind of house that led to the adoption of the ‘living room’ and the,Paragraph
"‘outdoor-indoor’ living space—of craftsmanship, climatic adaptation, and harmony with",Paragraph
the landscape.”,Paragraph
The simple floor plans of most bungalows maximize the amount of interior space,Paragraph
available by discarding the Victorian parlor in favor of a combined living and dining,Paragraph
"area, often separated by a colonnade or book arch. The typical bungalow plan provides a",Paragraph
"kitchen at the rear, a living-dining area with the living area at the front of the home, and",Paragraph
two bedrooms with a bathroom between them. To maximize the bungalow’s limited,Paragraph
"interior space, built-in furniture pieces, such as buffets, bookcases, and seating",Paragraph
"inglenooks, were integral features. Built-ins enhanced the beauty of a room with their",Paragraph
natural woodwork while contributing to the reputation of the bungalow as an easily kept,Paragraph
home.,Paragraph
"Bungalows vary somewhat by region in terms of their exterior appearance, building",Paragraph
"materials, and interior plans. Bungalows in the eastern United States tend to exhibit an",Paragraph
"English influence, whereas west coast bungalows draw inspiration alternately from Japan",Paragraph
"and the Swiss chalet. Such observations are only guidelines, however, as the widespread",Paragraph
diffusion of the bungalow through plan books and mail-order catalogs has functioned to,Paragraph
minimize regional differences. The typically wooden exterior of the bungalow is also,Paragraph
"occasionally replaced or joined by stucco, brick, or stone. The most typical interior",Paragraph
variation of the bungalow is the provision of an extra bedroom or breakfast area. In,Paragraph
"addition, many two-story homes can be characterized as bungalows despite the fact that",Paragraph
the term usually denotes a one-story home. Two-story “bungaloid” homes (as Marcus,Paragraph
Whiffen calls them) often feature dormer windows to maintain a relatively low profile,Paragraph
appearance.,Paragraph
"Potential home owners could build a bungalow from an architect’s original plans,",Paragraph
purchase bungalow plans from widely available catalogs such as or buy a,Paragraph
prefabricated bungalow kit from companies such as Sears and Roebuck or Aladdin. Mail-,Caption
"order bungalows produced by Sears, Aladdin, and several smaller companies appeared in",Paragraph
1906 and reached their greatest popularity between 1910 and 1930. An estimated one-,Paragraph
half million mail-order homes were produced between 1900 and the start of World War II,Paragraph
in 1939. Today mail-order houses can be found throughout the country.,Paragraph
Beginning with the stock market crash of 1929 and continuing through the Great,Paragraph
"Depression, the popularity of the bungalow declined, as did interest in domestic building",Paragraph
generally. The construction industry was dealt a sharp blow by the enduring economic,Paragraph
"crisis, with housing starts falling a precipitous 90 percent between 1925 and 1933. By the",Paragraph

"Architect, United States",Title
Daniel Hudson Burnham’s directive to “make no small plans” remains a fitting,Paragraph
"summary for a man whose life and work was defined by the expansion, growth, and",Paragraph
prosperity of well-to-do Americans in the decades that surround the turn of the 20th,Paragraph
century. Not only did Burnham house businessmen and statesmen who drove the,Paragraph
"American commercial and political engine to its unmatched expansion, but he also",Paragraph
defined and gave architectural expression to the building types and urban forms they,Paragraph
brought to life.,Paragraph
Burnham was born into a family of modest means in rural New York. In 1855 his,Paragraph
"family moved to Chicago, drawn by the thriving new city’s opportunities. At first,",Paragraph
"seeking his fortune elsewhere, Burnham made unsuccessful attempts to get an Ivy League",Paragraph
"education, mine for silver in the West, and run for public office in the late 1860s. Upon",Paragraph
"returning to Chicago, Burnham fell into architecture, rather than having been led by a",Paragraph
"muse to express himself in built form. From the start, Burnham saw architecture as a",Paragraph
business opportunity. After working briefly for a series of architectural offices that,Paragraph
"included Loring and Jenney in 1872, Burnham settled in with Carter Drake and Wight,",Paragraph
"where he met John Wellborn Root. In the following year, the two men channeled their",Paragraph
complementary interests and talents into opening their own firm. Root was more,Paragraph
"aesthetically inclined and detail oriented, and became the firm’s primary designer,",Paragraph
whereas Burnham’s organizational and social skills were directed toward business,Paragraph
matters and planning efforts.,Paragraph
"Their first projects were residences for wealthy Chicagoans, and were characterized by",Paragraph
an affinity for period styles and historical eclecticism. They included a house in 1874 for,Paragraph
stockyard mogul John B.Sherman that was built on fashionable Prairie Avenue. This,Paragraph
"project was essential to Burnham’s later development and professional life, and offered",Paragraph
him access to the board-rooms of high-powered patrons; it became his social entrée to,Paragraph
"dinner parties following his marriage to Sherman’s daughter. From this point, Burnham",Paragraph
and Root were catapulted into the elite social and business circles in Chicago.,Paragraph
His patrons enhanced Burnham’s natural inclination toward the entrepreneurial.,Paragraph
"Declaring that he was “not going to stay satisfied with houses,” Burnham envisioned",Paragraph
"assembling a “big business to handle big things, deal with big businessman, and to build",Paragraph
"up a big organization, for you can’t handle big things unless you have an organization”",Paragraph
"(Hines, 1974). His growing firm focused on office-building projects, for which Burnham",Paragraph
"laid out the plans, and they soon became the standard for this new building type; Root",Paragraph
"was responsible for the detailed designs. Burnham’s functional, utilitarian designs were",Paragraph
"based largely on H, U, or square plans accommodating interior light wells, while",Paragraph
exposing a maximum amount of the exterior walls to light and air. Their 11-story,Paragraph
Rookery Building (1887) is a square plan with one double-loaded corridor wrapping a,Paragraph
central light court; all of its offices opened onto either this court or the exterior. The,Paragraph
"efficient plan was matched by an innovative, iron-curtain, wall structure not evident",Paragraph
"under the building’s brick and terracotta shell, articulated into five heavy layers, with a",Paragraph
"profusion of neo-Romanesque ornament. In contrast, the recently restored internal",Paragraph
court—a delicate web of cast- and wrought-iron skylights and cantilevered stairways—is,Paragraph
a dazzling display of late-19th-century building technology.,Paragraph
"Whereas the Rookery showed indebtedness to 19th-century historicism, another office",Paragraph
building constructed in the following decade pointed toward the future. The Reliance,Paragraph
"Building (1894) eschewed overt historical detail in favor of a more utilitarian, functional,",Paragraph
structure-expressing language for which the Chicago School is well known. The 14-story,Paragraph
steel frame was wrapped in fireproof terra-cotta and expressed clearly on the building,Paragraph
"facade through the slender, ribbonlike spandrels that wrap each story at floor level,",Paragraph
leaving the greatest proportion of the facade open to glazing. Delicate foliate patterns in,Paragraph
the terra-cotta and the building’s original projecting cornice hearken to past traditions.,Paragraph
"However, the startling quantity of glass, the sparkling whiteness of the glazed spandrels",Paragraph
"with their pronounced horizontality, and the removal of vertical structural members from",Paragraph
"the facade foretold a new spirit in office-building design: a functional, honest expression",Paragraph
of the structure that would reach fulfillment in the next century. Burnham’s office,Paragraph
"buildings contributed to the development of the new building type, improving function",Paragraph
"and comfort. Whatever the outward expression of these buildings, their decorous designs",Paragraph
"made them impressive members of the urban landscape, suggestive of the growing wealth",Paragraph
"and prestige of their patrons, and the importance of the activities within their walls.",Paragraph
"With Root’s unexpected death in 1891, Burnham was forced to form other",Paragraph
partnerships; the firm’s name changed to D.H. Burnham and Co. and later to Graham,Paragraph
"Burnham and Company. Each firm built on the original Burnham and Root model, with",Paragraph
Burnham overseeing every part of an increasingly hierarchical and specialized structure.,Paragraph
"Adopted from the world of business, this approach led architectural practice away from",Paragraph
"the atelierbased system, and toward the now common architectural practice. By 1910",Paragraph
"Burnham’s was the largest architectural firm in the world, with 180 employees, branch",Paragraph
"offices in New York and San Francisco, and buildings rising from Houston to London.",Paragraph
"Burnham was long an advocate for professionalism in architecture, and he lobbied for",Paragraph
professional rights and served the American Institute of Architects (AIA) as president in,Paragraph
the 1890s.,Paragraph
His growing fame and prominence in social and professional circles made Burnham an,Paragraph
appropriate choice to direct the architectural planning of the World’s Columbian,Paragraph
Exposition of 1893 held in Chicago. It was not only a fair; the exposition was a city in,Paragraph
"miniature and inaugurated Burnham’s practice as an urban planner. As director, Burnham",Paragraph
"took control of virtually every aspect including the hiring of workers, laborers, artists,",Paragraph
"and architects, and overseeing their work and the construction of all buildings. Burnham",Paragraph
led the team of prominent architects in arranging a series of buildings around a,Paragraph
centralized Court of Honor. To encourage harmony among the designs in response to the,Paragraph
"classical taste shared by many of the Ecole-trained architects, the committee agreed to a",Paragraph
"uniform cornice height and a classical vocabulary for their individual buildings, which",Paragraph
were to be grouped around the central Court of Honor. References to imperial and,Paragraph
"Renaissance Rome, Versailles, and post-Haussmann Paris were manifest in the fair’s long",Paragraph
"axial boulevards, water elements, and monumental classical architecture. Although a",Paragraph
"variety of building styles were employed in the peripheral buildings, it was the images of",Paragraph
"the Court of Honor that made the fair famous, and influenced city planning afterward.",Paragraph
Aesthetics were not all that concerned Burnham in the planning of the Columbian,Paragraph
"Exposition. Although it was to be temporary, the grounds were needed to operate like a",Paragraph
"small-scale city: electrical, steam, gas, water supply, sewage, and transportation all had to",Paragraph
"be accommodated, which further prepared Burnham for the practical considerations of",Paragraph
"city planning. However, in this case, other urban challenges were conspicuously absent.",Paragraph
"For example, there were no slums, and no housing at all was designed or was to be",Paragraph
"included. Many questioned the appropriateness of this model for real, working cities, and",Paragraph
"it was deemed irrelevant by later historians and critics. However, the fair was enormously",Paragraph
"successful with the thousands of visitors who flocked to it, as well as the city officials",Paragraph
across the country that were moved to inject some of the model into their own,Paragraph
municipalities.,Paragraph
"Following the success of the fair, Burnham’s well-known administrative",Paragraph
and planning skills were in great demand at the turn of the century. His,Paragraph
most prominent commission was the Washington Plan of 1902. It was,Paragraph
"prompted by the capital city’s centennial, renewed hope and prosperity",Paragraph
"following the depression of the mid-1890s, and the conclusion of the",Paragraph
Spanish-American war. The plan began as a revival of Pierre Charles,Paragraph
"L’Enfant’s 1793 scheme, ftom which departures had been made for time-",Paragraph
and cost-saving reasons. The design team (Burnham and other alumni of,Paragraph
the Columbian Exposition) studied such,Paragraph

"precedents as Paris, Rome, and Versailles, focusing their attention on the Mall area. The",Paragraph
main axes of the original plan had been abandoned with the placement of the Washington,Paragraph
Monument. Burnham’s reconfigured Mall disguised this imperfection by redrawing the,Paragraph
axes to meet at the Monument. Burnham cleansed the Mall of its previous functions as,Paragraph
"pasture, lumberyard, and railroad center, making it a wide swath of elm-lined green",Paragraph
"space, bordered by cultural institutions. Office blocks and parks were planned for prime",Paragraph
locations nearby. The next four administrations drew from Burnham’s plan the,Paragraph
"groundwork for future development in Washington, and architects followed his precepts",Paragraph
for layout and style. Significant additions to Washington that remained in keeping with,Paragraph
"the plan include Henry Bacon’s Lincoln Memorial (1912), John Russell Pope’s National",Paragraph
"Gallery of Art, and Burnham’s Union Station (1907). Burnham’s classicized plan for the",Paragraph
capital—successor to and embodiment of the fulfillment of the westward march—suited,Paragraph
the nation’s cultural and political vision.,Paragraph
"Burnham’s plans for Cleveland (1903) and San Francisco (1905) proved, on smaller",Paragraph
"scale, the national influence of his city-planning ideals. His vision affected foreign",Paragraph
countries as well; in 1904 Burnham designed the colonial Philippine cities of Manila and,Paragraph
"Baguio. These designs also paid homage to Beaux-Arts planning, with the city grid cut by",Paragraph
"diagonal boulevards and dotted with a citywide park system. However, within this",Paragraph
"imported framework, Burnham preserved local Spanish-Philippine building traditions. As",Paragraph
"such, his urban plans encourage comparison with other early-20th-century imperial",Paragraph
"capital planning, such as Sir Edwin Lutyens’s design for the Viceroy’s House (1913) in",Paragraph
"New Delhi, where Mogul and Buddhist features meld into an otherwise abstractly",Paragraph
classical design.,Paragraph
"No urban scheme of Burnham’s was as sweeping as his Chicago Plan of 1909. Here,",Paragraph
"he accepted the challenge that included not only a city center or fairgrounds, but a",Paragraph
complete city. Taking only the most general clues from the existing street grid and,Paragraph
"akeshore, Burnham reorganized the city into a 20-mile-long recreational, lakefront park,",Paragraph
"backed by virtually endless commercial districts, with consistent cornice heights",Paragraph
punctuated by interior parks. The existing grid of streets was improved functionally and,Paragraph
"aesthetically, railroad terminals were regrouped for better communication and reduced",Paragraph
"industrial sprawl, and the Chicago River was straightened for more effective water and",Paragraph
"riverside transportation. A great domed civic center dominated the skyline; from it, radia",Paragraph
boulevards reached into the suburbs miles away.,Paragraph
While the Chicago Plan’s aesthetics are often noted—particularly the seeming,Paragraph
"incongruence of Burnham’s Beaux-Arts imposition on the existing industrial, commercial",Paragraph
"nature of the jagged city, a consistency remains with his earlier vision, to ennoble the",Paragraph
businessman and his commercial empire. Burnham’s Chicago was a commercia.,Paragraph
"enterprise, aggrandized in a way that lent recognition to commercial activity as Chicago’s",Paragraph
"primary cultural export. As early as the mid-1890s, Burnham had revealed the genesis of",Paragraph
the plan as the city’s moneymaking potential: an improved physical structure would,Paragraph
"increase productivity and wealth, and a fine-looking city would encourage the spending",Paragraph
"of travel dollars at home rather than abroad. Burnham’s optimistic and, ultimately",Paragraph
"unrealistic vision, populated it with wealthy and successful business leaders with little",Paragraph
"room for anyone else. Even so, the grandeur of Burnham’s vision directed much of",Paragraph
Chicago’s development in coming years: his double-decker boulevard was built as,Paragraph
"Wacker Drive, Michigan Avenue, was broadened in the 1920s, and various lakefront",Paragraph
"amenities were constructed in a landfill along the shore, now known as Grant Park.",Paragraph
Burnham’s plans served the society that he knew best: the industrialists and politicians,Paragraph
who endeavored to improve society through cultural gifts. With honorary degrees from,Paragraph
"Harvard, Yale, and Northwestern; membership in exclusive social and business clubs;",Paragraph
"extensive foreign travel; and a supporter of the arts, Burnham was among the elite of the",Paragraph
"architectural profession, who could afford to live as their clients did. Just as businessmen",Paragraph
"presented the city with museums and libraries, Burnham gave the gift of his talents to the",Paragraph
people. Most of the city plans he completed were presented free of charge. Although,Paragraph
"some might judge this beneficence as misguided, Burnham was convinced of",Paragraph
architecture’s role in the improvement of society. In he described the plan of,Paragraph
Washington as complementary to the reformation called for among progressive,Paragraph
politicians. He believed that aesthetic unity among buildings encouraged social harmony.,Paragraph
He felt the ennobling forms of classical architecture were a language meant to uplift the,Paragraph
"populace, and express the strength and permanency of the political and social order. In",Paragraph
"his report for the Cleveland Plan, he wrote that the “jumble of buildings” present in most",Paragraph
"cities disturbed social peace. Architectural uniformity and harmony, as seen in ancient",Paragraph
"cities of the world, would encourage social harmony in modern America.",Paragraph
Attitudes about Burnham changed radically after his death in 1912. While once he was,Paragraph
"regarded as a powerful visionary, by the 1920s he was decried as a megalomaniac.",Paragraph
"During the 1930s, the threat of Fascism and its orderly, uniform architecture brought a",Paragraph
chill to reviews of his grand designs. The aesthetic of classicism fell out of favor as,Paragraph
"modernism swept through the architectural academies and journals, and the few who",Paragraph
"discussed Burnham did so with derision, grieving his renunciation of the honest",Paragraph
"architecture of the Chicago School to follow classical, elitist, historicist, and irrelevant",Paragraph
"flights of fancy. Recent years have been kinder to Burnham, bringing an increased",Paragraph
appreciation for the role of ornament in architecture after mid-century. It has lead to a,Paragraph
"reevaluation of Burnham’s career. During the 1970s, the first serious biography of",Paragraph
"Burnham was written, as were a flurry of dissertations on his work and planning. His",Paragraph

"inhabited Cities of the Dead (cemeteries), or its contemporary informal peripheries, Cairo",Paragraph
is also a city that has experienced almost all international trends of modernism (in a broad,Paragraph

"when an ambitious ruler, Khedive Isma’il (r. 1863-79), known for his passion for",Paragraph
"architecture and his will to prove that his country was European rather than African,",Paragraph
decided to transform the Egyptian capital according to the model of Paris.,Paragraph

"where they more or less reproduced the architecture of their native countries,",Paragraph
occasionally using Moorish and later Mamluk motifs to add some sort of “local” touch to,Paragraph
their constructions.,Paragraph
Both the eagerness of affluent patrons for innovations from abroad and the hegemony,Paragraph
of French and Italian aesthetics continued all through the British occupation (from 1882,Paragraph
to 1922). Building in reinforced concrete started in 1894 and developed quickly. An early,Paragraph

Although Calatrava’s work might be best characterized by the futuristic forms of his,Paragraph

this philosophy is reflected clearly in the manipulation of seemingly unnatural materials,Paragraph

projects tackle complicated technical issues and are resolved in surprisingly elegant ways.,Paragraph
"Often inspired by nature, the organic forms that are his solutions leap to new technical",Paragraph
"heights in a synthesis of light, material, and form.",Paragraph
His most recognizable bridge design might be the Alamillo Bridge (1987-92) in,Paragraph
"Seville, Spain, spanning 820 feet (250 meters) over the Guadalquivir River. Originally",Paragraph
"proposed as a twin bridge with a connecting viaduct, the design would cross the river in",Paragraph
"two locations, approximately | mile (1.5 kilometers) apart. The twin bridges were",Paragraph
"designed so that their tall, inclined masts would reach toward each other, forming an",Paragraph
implied triangle that had its apex far above the site. This scheme was ultimately,Paragraph
"abandoned and adjusted to a single bridge and viaduct, but the inclined mast was",Paragraph
retained. The extraordinary weight of the mast (steel filled with concrete) angling back at,Paragraph
58 degrees was enough to support the roadbed without the need for counter-stay cables.,Paragraph
"This was a first in bridge design, and is a stunning sight. The 1640-foot (500 meter)",Paragraph
"viaduct served as an entrance gateway for Expo ’92 in Seville, for which Calatrava also",Paragraph
"designed the Kuwait Pavilion. Typical of Calatrava’s other works, this bridge was",Paragraph
designed to seamlessly accommodate pedestrian traffic and connect with motor roads.,Paragraph
The Stadelhofen Station in Zurich presented Calatrava with a unique,Paragraph
chance to make a mark on a city. The site the station was to occupy was,Paragraph
challenging in that it varied greatly in elevation from end to end and was,Paragraph
curved along its length. Other proposals for the station involved roofing,Paragraph

grand monumentality of permanence and importance that appealed to a new wealthy class,Paragraph
of philanthropic benefactors who emerged in the early 20th century. Cloaking themselves,Paragraph
"in art and culture, these philanthropists set their sights on creating personal memorials.",Paragraph
The philanthropic benefactor desired a worthy monument. With large sums of money,Paragraph
"being contributed to educational institutions, it became necessary to provide tangible",Paragraph
evidence of the gifts beyond the expansion of research programs and academic pursuits.,Paragraph
"Gone was the notion of utilitarian educational structure, as evidenced in the new Parker,",Paragraph
Thomas and Rice Beaux-Arts campus for Johns Hopkins in 1904. The campus of,Paragraph
architectural grandeur had arrived.,Paragraph
John D.Rockefeller’s endowment to the University of Chicago was bestowed without,Paragraph
"direct involvement in campus planning. However, Leland Stanford had no such hesitancy",Paragraph
"when he endowed Stanford University at the end of the 19th century, transforming",Paragraph
Frederick Law Olmsted’s plan for informal structures set carefully in the coastal foothills,Paragraph
behind Palo Alto into a formal arrangement of buildings around a fully enclosed,Paragraph
"quadrangle. Anticipating Beaux-Arts formalism, the university was built on a flat site laid",Paragraph
out with a formal axis. Stanford’s ordered monumentality made a good fit with his desire,Paragraph
"for a proper personal monument. At the same time, it suited the emerging needs of the",Paragraph
new expanding university.,Paragraph
So influential was the Beaux-Arts campus that it essentially defined campus planning,Paragraph
in the first half of the 20th century. Even campuses that were developed in the 18th or,Paragraph
19th century rushed to modify their campus plans in the Beaux-Arts fashion in the early,Paragraph
1900s. The modifications to Olmsted’s plans at the University of California at Berkeley,Caption
and Stanford were emblematic of the changing tide. As Olmsted’s firm was taken over by,Paragraph
"his two sons, it could not ignore the trend, and so it specialized in campus planning in the",Paragraph
"Beaux-Arts style, developing a plan for Harvard that emphasized strict symmetry and",Paragraph
axiality.,Paragraph
"Princeton University sometimes seemed to be at the whim of these changes, going",Paragraph
from a symmetrical campus in the early 19th century to a more informal campus plan at,Paragraph
the end of the century to a revised plan at the beginning of the 20th century by Ralph,Paragraph
"Adams Cram that emphasized a new axial order, even though Cram’s plans,. Gothic in",Paragraph
"style, also included many smaller spaces that ignored Beaux-Arts conventions. At the",Paragraph
"University of Wisconsin at Madison, the Ecole-trained Paul Philippe Cret transformed the",Paragraph
"existing campus in 1908 with a new central axis, cross axes, and domed buildings laid out",Paragraph
"in a Beaux-Arts pattern. In 1910, Cass Gilbert redesigned the University of Texas at",Paragraph
Austin with a new integrated pattern of formal quadrangles and a centralized tower,Paragraph
monument.,Paragraph
With the expansion of higher education in the 20th century and the increasing,Paragraph
"presence of the large university, another trend developed that sought to reestablish the",Paragraph
intimacy of the college campus. Although running not quite counter to Beaux-Arts,Paragraph
"principles, often embodying many of its formal characteristics, it nonetheless sought to",Paragraph
bring about a more collegiate presence by looking back to the form of the English,Paragraph
medieval college.,Paragraph
"The principal physical expression of this nostalgia was the enclosed quadrangle, which",Paragraph
evoked a kind of cloistered and secluded education that most 20th-century campus,Paragraph
"planning had moved beyond. If its principal metaphor was the monastery, it was",Paragraph
nonetheless a very collegial monastery where intellectual life was hoped to thrive within,Paragraph
a closed setting of fellowship.,Paragraph
"The most popular advocate of this collegiate traditionalism was Cram, a political",Paragraph
conservative who was opposed to the “Germanic secularism” of contemporary campus,Paragraph
planning and sought to rectify it with romantic evocations of medieval architecture that,Paragraph
relied on Gothic structures and closed quadrangles. Cram’s Gothic campuses sprang up at,Paragraph
"West Point, Sweet Briar College, and Richmond College in Virginia as well as at",Paragraph
Princeton.,Paragraph
"As neo-Gothic enthusiasm spread, often in the form of a compromise between",Paragraph
"medievalism and classicism, new proponents took up the style. Around 1914, Charles",Paragraph
"Zeller Klauder designed Cram-influenced structures at Wellesley, Cornell, and Princeton.",Paragraph
"In 1925, he developed a campus plan for Concordia Seminary in St. Louis that relied on",Paragraph
Cram’s formula of a cathedral tower and monastic buildings set around quadrangles. In,Paragraph
"Pittsburgh, Klauder was responsible for the towering 42-story Gothic Cathedral of",Paragraph
"Learning at the University of Pittsburgh, which dramatically expressed the underlying",Paragraph
"religious preoccupation of the neo-Gothicists. Built in 1926, the building seemed almost a",Paragraph
"moral corrective to the symbolic significance of the skyscraper. The university, Klauder",Caption
"seemed to be saying with his heaven-reaching edifice, relied on God, not Mammon.",Paragraph
"Prior to World War II, campus planning stodgily resisted inroads by modern",Paragraph
"architecture. Although a few anomalies to the traditional campus were to be found, for",Paragraph
the most part higher education regarded modern architecture with a frozen look of,Paragraph
"displeasure. By the 1940s, International Style structures began to reface American cities",Paragraph
but exerted little influence on college campuses. Mies van der Rohe’s 1938 plan for the,Paragraph
Illinois Institute of Technology was a noted exception.,Paragraph
"Also in 1938, Frank Lloyd Wright tried his hand at campus planning at Florida",Paragraph
Southern College. The result was a geometrically fascinating arrangement of irregularly,Paragraph
"shaped buildings. However, like Wright’s highly schematic urban plan, Broadacre City, it",Paragraph
remained mostly a curiosity. Other notable experiments of the prewar era were Paul,Paragraph
Rudolph’s master plan for the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama and Walter Gropius and,Paragraph
"Marcel Breuer’s plan for Black Mountain College. In New York City, Hunter College",Caption
"came forth with a brazen new International Style structure in 1942 but had few followers,",Paragraph
even though the trend seemed serious in architectural magazines that debated the wisdom,Paragraph
of “going modern” on the campus.,Paragraph
"After World War IL society was recast socially, economically, and demographically.",Paragraph
Huge increases in college enrollments forced the need for new campus planning. At the,Paragraph
"same time, however, college designers began to abandon the idea of the master plan in",Paragraph
favor of growth contingencies that emphasized flexibility and adaptability.,Paragraph
"The result was an abandonment of the fully integrated campus, as new, large",Paragraph
unconventional structures began to be built to meet enrollment increases and fill in spaces,Paragraph
"on traditional campuses. Freed from the restraints of compatibility, university",Paragraph
"administrators concentrated on building programs that featured large, often out-of-scale",Paragraph
"improvements to dormitories, student unions, and laboratories.",Paragraph
An early example of the new attitude toward campus planning was Alvar Aalto’s,Paragraph
"sprawling modern dormitory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1949,",Paragraph
followed four years later by Eero Saarinen’s three-pointed auditorium. At Yale,Paragraph
"University, a hodgepodge of new structures took defiant residence on the campus,",Paragraph
"including Louis Kahn’s Art Gallery, Gordon Bunshaft’s Rare Book Library, Paul",Paragraph
"Rudolph’s Art and Architecture Building, and Philip Johnson’s Science Center. When",Paragraph
"campus additions were conceived of as a group, as they were at the Harvard Graduate",Paragraph
"Center in 1949, they were often sited irregularly in unpredictable arrangements that",Paragraph
defied the traditional norm of the college quadrangle.,Paragraph
"The new campus planning was an aggressive repudiation of Beaux-Arts planning, with",Paragraph
"each new building conceived of as an individual unit, as dramatic and unpredictable as",Paragraph
"the times. When campus planners reached into the past, it was often no further than Paris",Paragraph
"in 1932, where Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret established a vocabulary of forms at",Paragraph
"the Swiss Student Hostel that relied on masonry framing, minimal detailing, and the",Paragraph
calibrated curtain wall.,Caption
"When considerations were given to planning an entire campus, the presiding rationale",Paragraph
was often based on organizing by function and accessibility. The new plan for the,Paragraph
"University of Illinois at Chicago Circle in 1965, for example, focused on developing",Paragraph
"specialized areas, instead of having separate buildings for each department, with",Paragraph
circulation being the foremost priority.,Paragraph
The social upheavals of the 1960s challenged the traditions of formal education and,Paragraph
brought about significant changes to education if not always campus planning. The,Paragraph
University of California at Santa Cruz took a large step away from the traditional college,Paragraph
"campus with its 1963 master plan by John Carl Warnecke and Associates, which totally",Paragraph
dispensed with the idea of formal symmetry and took the site’s natural topography in the,Paragraph
California coastal foothills as a basis for locating the campus’ “cluster colleges.”,Paragraph
"The most innovative of the clusters was Moore and Turnbull’s Kresge College,",Paragraph
"University of California, Santa Cruz, created like a rural compact village in sight of the",Paragraph
"ocean. At the same time the plan reached into the future, it evoked campus planning",Paragraph
ideals from the past. Intact was the romantic notion of education isolated in nature.,Paragraph
Recalling Jefferson’s ideal of dialogue and proximity between students and faculty at the,Paragraph
"University of Virginia, the plan encouraged faculty to live on the campus in informal",Paragraph
settings near where they teach. It also recalled Olmsted’s original plan for the Berkeley,Paragraph
campus by minimizing the proportion of land to buildings and keeping them informal—a,Paragraph
university regulation prohibits any building taller than two-thirds the height of the coastal,Paragraph
redwood trees that populate the area.,Paragraph
Another radical departure in campus planning came about after William Pereira’s,Paragraph
"1960 plan for the University of California at Irvine, planned around a series of concentric",Paragraph
"rings. Although Pereira’s plan appeared to lack any overall design concept, it became a",Paragraph
"proving ground for the postmodern campus, especially after 1985, when Frank Gehry’s",Paragraph
"three-pavilion structure for classrooms, engineering laboratories, and administrative",Caption
facilities provided a new shock to the system for campus planning.,Paragraph
"Along with structures by Robert Venturi, Eric Moss, and Charles Moore, Gehry’s",Paragraph
"colorful collage of ramps, stairways, porches, and canopies created a furor at the time; it",Paragraph
"also might have served as an annunciation in campus planning, sweeping in an even freer,",Paragraph
more unpredictable collection of ideas of what the campus should be.,Paragraph

CANADA,Title
Canada’s architecture has been intricately bound up with the nation’s search for an,Paragraph
identity distinct from European and American influences. At the dawn of the 20th,Paragraph
"century, the lingering effects of England’s authority over Canadian political and",Paragraph
"economic affairs were still keenly felt, and Canadian architecture was held firmly in the",Paragraph
thrall of Victorian trends. Although the major external influences on Canada’s,Paragraph
"architecture originally came from France and Great Britain, movements popular in the",Paragraph
United States began to attract notice as Canada directed more interest toward the nation,Paragraph
with whom it shared a common geography and a history of recent settlement.,Paragraph
"Nonetheless, the new century also represented a coming of age for Canada’s architects, as",Paragraph
professional associations of architecture and engineering were established to ensure,Paragraph
clients of minimum standards of practice and to enable Canadian architects to offer,Paragraph
"serious competition to British and American architects, who had been awarded many",Paragraph
substantial contracts during the preceding years.,Paragraph
A significant factor affecting Canada’s architectural evolution was the,Paragraph
political autonomy that came with the costly sacrifices in World War I.,Paragraph
"This served as a national coming of age, and Canadians realized that they",Paragraph
were now entitled to make their own decisions with regard to their,Paragraph
country. The struggles during the Great Depression of the 1930s and the,Paragraph
contributions to the World War II effort were followed by a high-spirited,Paragraph
postwar era of booming population and extensive development. Canada’s,Paragraph
"economy relies heavily on abundant natural resources, but technological",Paragraph
innovation and development have diversified the country’s research and,Paragraph
manufacturing sectors. The perceived architectural colonialism of the,Paragraph
early decades has evolved into an architectural vocabulary that reflects a,Paragraph
maturing sense of independence and emerging national identity. There,Paragraph
were several factors propelling this architectural evolution.,Paragraph
Immigration and Early External Influences,Title
Canada had benefited greatly as a consequence of the global economic depression,Paragraph
"between 1873 and 1896. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, publicity schemes",Paragraph
and land grants attracted thousands of impoverished immigrants from the British Isles,Paragraph
"and Europe, in addition to young families who migrated from the eastern provinces to",Paragraph
"settle the western plains. In their new and harsh environment, the settlers experienced",Paragraph
"limited success at reproducing familiar architecture, and inevitably the use of locally",Paragraph
"available construction materials merged with cultural heritage, creating a distinctive",Paragraph
"Canadian “folk” architecture. Such original, vernacular design was particularly noticeable",Paragraph
"in regions settled by immigrants from Eastern Europe, the Ukraine, Russia, Scandinavia,",Paragraph
"Iceland, and China. The strict religious beliefs of some prairie settlers, such as the",Paragraph
"Doukhobors and the Hutterite Brethren, predetermined the form of their community-",Paragraph
focused architecture.,Paragraph
"With the massive immigration to the newly created prairie provinces of Manitoba,",Paragraph
"Saskatchewan, and Alberta, as well as British Columbia, governments embarked on an",Paragraph
ambitious program to supply new settlements with essential services—legislative,Paragraph
"buildings, post offices, immigration and customs houses, policing, courthouses, and",Paragraph
correctional facilities. The federal government architecture of the early 20th century,Paragraph
"closely adhered to precedents set by Thomas Fuller, chief architect of the Department of",Paragraph
Public Works from 1881 until 1896. His carefully situated and finely detailed buildings,Paragraph
with their rusticated masonry and textured surfaces contributed significantly to the High,Paragraph
"Victorian character still evident in many Canadian communities. However, Victorian",Paragraph
"eclecticism was gradually over-taken by more contemporary approaches to design, such",Paragraph
"as the Edwardian baroque, the Richardsonian Romanesque, the Chateau style derived",Paragraph
"from the Loire Valley of France, and the neo-classical Beaux-Arts tradition promoted at",Paragraph
the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The classical principles of rational,Paragraph
clarity and ordered planning that were the hallmarks of the teachings of the Ecole des,Paragraph
Beaux-Arts influenced Canadian architectural education of this era. Whether the,Paragraph
"practitioners acquired their skills in Paris or from American architecture schools, many of",Paragraph
Canada’s early 20th-century architects converted to this multinational design philosophy.,Paragraph
"As particular styles became associated with certain building types,",Paragraph
Canadian architecture assumed a more consistent and less decorative,Paragraph
character. Beaux-Arts classicism was expressed in the monumental,Paragraph
legislatures designed and built in the prairie provinces between 1888 and,Paragraph
World War I. These were highlighted by statuesque central domes and,Paragraph
"entrance porticoes with rhythmic arrays of double-height columns,",Paragraph
strikingly similar to the Minnesota and Rhode Island state capitols. The,Paragraph
sole exception was the Richardsonian Romanesque design of the Ontario,Paragraph
"Legislative Building (1892, Richard A.Waite) at Toronto’s Queen’s Park.",Caption
Neoclassical vocabulary was further adapted to situations such as,Paragraph
E.J.Lennox’s Toronto Power Generating Station (1903-13) at Niagara,Caption
"Falls, where his client wished to create a majestic temple to new",Paragraph
technology. This building is visually grounded by a large central block and,Paragraph
pedimented entrance portico. The extremities of the side wings are,Caption
"anchored by smaller cubic blocks, and the entire facade is unified by the",Paragraph
entablature and an imposing arrangement of Ionic columns—a grandiose,Paragraph
shell for a utilitarian function.,Paragraph
Climate and the Natural Environment: Technological Innovation,Title
"As the first immigrants had discovered, the Canadian climate and physical geography",Paragraph
"ensured that, over a period of time, it proved expedient to adapt foreign styles and",Paragraph
"building technologies. Early in the 20th century, the National Research Council, a",Paragraph
"multidisciplinary institute of the federal government, saw the necessity for developing",Paragraph
building materials and techniques to assist Canadians in their perpetual battle against the,Paragraph
elements. The Institute for Research in Construction was established to develop,Paragraph
"materials, insulation, and construction standards suita-ble to every part of the country.",Paragraph
"This research led to specialized construction appropriate to Arctic conditions, such as",Paragraph
"cold temperatures, permafrost, low snow cover, and high winds. During the 1970s",Paragraph
"escalating energy costs fostered interest in solar design and collector panels, heat pumps,",Paragraph
"superinsulated windows, and low-emission glazing, culminating in the development of",Paragraph
the R-2000 building system.,Paragraph
"In addition, prefabrication and standardized housing designs have often been used to",Paragraph
"offset construction costs. During the World War II era, available housing was at a",Paragraph
"premium, forcing the federal government to establish Wartime Housing Limited to design",Paragraph
and build thousands of small family homes. Many Canadian cities still retain,Paragraph
"neighborhoods of these “wartime” houses, originally considered to be an expedient yet",Paragraph
temporary measure to alleviate the housing shortage. The lessons learned from such,Paragraph
"projects were adapted to other circumstances, where the lumbering, mining, pulp and",Paragraph
"paper milling, and hydroelectric power generation industries established company towns",Paragraph
in remote parts of the country. On a site selected for an aluminum smelter because of its,Paragraph
"deep-water access to the Pacific, the hydroelectric power capacity of the Nechako River,",Paragraph
"and the broad alluvial plain on which a town could be built, the planned community of",Paragraph
"Kitimat, British Columbia, was created by Alcan Aluminum during the early 1950s.",Paragraph
"Referencing Ebenezer Howard’s garden city concept, the model town included a",Paragraph
greenbelt that encircled distinct residential and commercial districts.,Paragraph
Many of Canada’s rapidly constructed northern and aboriginal,Paragraph
communities are also distinguished by standardized and prefabricated,Paragraph
buildings. Although the earliest of these quickly proved unsuited to the,Paragraph
"climatic extremes of the northern territories, recent buildings were more",Paragraph
"appropriately designed. They are now raised off the ground, with an",Paragraph
insulating barrier under the main floor to prevent the building’s heat from,Paragraph
melting the permafrost; walls and roofs are totally insulated with no,Paragraph
vented roof crawl spaces; and the windows are few and small in area.,Paragraph
Even though these engineered structures are not necessarily architectural,Paragraph
"masterpieces, they are very characteristic of Canada’s north. With",Paragraph
"continued improvements to materials and technology, northern",Paragraph
communities now have many examples ofa creatively designed yet,Paragraph
"pragmatic architecture. The Nunavut Legislative Assembly (1999),",Caption
designed for the new northern territory by The Arcop Group and Full,Caption
"Circle Architecture, combines the latest in energy-conservation technology",Paragraph
with a series of interior spaces and symbolic forms important to Inuit,Paragraph
culture.,Paragraph
Geography and Transportation: Regionalism,Title
"For centuries, aboriginal communities existed along trade routes or wherever agriculture",Paragraph
"was viable, and with a growing European interest in Canada’s natural resources,",Paragraph
"particularly furs and lumber, permanent settlements sprang up near trading posts and",Paragraph
"transshipment centers. In the late 19th century, completion of the first Canadian",Paragraph
transcontinental railway (1886) expedited the shipment of goods and people and fostered,Paragraph
the establishment of towns along its route. The western railway towns of wooden false-,Paragraph
fronted buildings overlooking a broad Main Street greeted thousands of immigrants as,Paragraph
"they disembarked to begin their homesteading life. By contrast, government buildings,",Paragraph
"prosperous businesses, and financial institutions were usually constructed of brick or",Paragraph
assembled from prefabricated components that had been shipped from the east. The,Paragraph
thriving agricultural economy of the 20th century added another prominent feature to,Paragraph
"prairie towns: the grain storage elevator, or “prairie sentinel.” These mammoth wooden",Paragraph
"structures, with steeply pitched roofs and the town’s name boldly emblazoned on their",Paragraph
"sides, could be identified from a great distance. Industrial versions of these elevators can",Paragraph
"be found at the major Great Lakes and ocean ports, where a phalanx of massive concrete",Paragraph
"silos stretches along the waterfront, with the railway spur line on one side and the",Paragraph
freighters tied up on the other. It was a complex such as this that attracted Le Corbusier’s,Paragraph
admiration for their honest industrial form.,Paragraph
"The high costs of transporting goods, materials, and labor over immense",Paragraph
"distances and the climatic extremes in this, the world’s second-largest",Paragraph
"country, continue to foster regionalism in Canadian architecture.",Paragraph
Professional architects have incorporated local characteristics in their,Paragraph
"projects, as seen in Peter Rose’s post-modern Bradley House (1979) in",Paragraph
"North Hatley, Québec. This country home evokes the spirit of a 1 6th-",Paragraph
"century Palladian villa, adopts Queen Anne Revival features prevalent in",Paragraph
"the community, and incorporates local building materials. One of the most",Paragraph
outstanding examples of postmodern Canadian regionalism is the,Paragraph

Jones and Michael Kirkland to reflect both the maturity of this sprawling,Paragraph
Toronto suburb and its roots as a rural farming community. A lofty clock,Paragraph

fronted by an open agora that is enclosed by modest colonnades. The,Paragraph
"dramatic interior spaces continue these historical references, and the",Paragraph
intricate detailing and high-tech finishes imbue the building with a modern,Paragraph
persona.,Paragraph
International Architecture and Canadian Identity,Title
When Canada acquired dominion status with the 1867 confederation of four British,Paragraph
"provinces, Canadian sensibilities turned toward the picturesque neo-Gothic and its High",Paragraph
"Victorian interpretation. Used for religious buildings, educational institutions, and most",Paragraph
"outstanding, the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa (1865, Frederick Warburton Stent and",Caption
"Augustus Laver; 1866, Thomas Fuller and H.Chilion Jones), the neo-Gothic style defined",Paragraph
Canada’s affiliation with the British Empire. It was subsequently reproduced in the,Paragraph
"Centre Block (1927, John A.Pearson and J.Omar Marchand), which was redesigned and",Paragraph
rebuilt following a disastrous fire in 1916. Even though the heavy masonry and mansard,Paragraph
roofs of the Second Empire style had been popular for a brief period at the turn of the,Paragraph
"century, particularly in Québec, where it expressed the province’s historic ties with",Paragraph
"France, Victorian neo-Gothicism remained the prevalent form of architectural expression",Paragraph
in English-speaking Canada well into the 20th century. This style was evident not only in,Paragraph
"large public buildings but also in vernacular architecture, as manifested in the numerous",Paragraph
"white, clapboarded community churches and gable-fronted farmhouses of Ontario.",Caption
"Because it symbolized a valued affiliation with all things British, Victorian Gothic",Paragraph
remained in vogue in the Canadian architectural landscape long after it fell from favor,Paragraph
elsewhere.,Paragraph
"Nonetheless, Canadians were becoming ever more preoccupied with defining their",Paragraph
own distinctive and recognizable architectural style. The most successful of these efforts,Paragraph
"was achieved by a series of luxurious railway hotels, initiated at Québec City with the",Paragraph
"Canadian Pacific Railway’s Chateau Frontenac (1892-93, Bruce Price). The last and",Paragraph
"undoubtedly most impressive of these, the Banff Springs Hotel, was constructed in two",Paragraph
phases to enlarge the original wood-frame resort. Designed by the railway’s own,Caption
"personnel, Walter S.Painter in 1911-14 and John Wilson Orrock in 1925-28, this",Paragraph
"building was characterized by steeply pitched roofs, multiple dormer windows, corner",Paragraph
"turrets, and solid massing. This unabashedly picturesque style has been termed either",Paragraph
Northern French Gothic or Canadian Chateau. In acknowledging the effect of this,Paragraph
"Canadian architectural idiom, the federal government approved an urban plan for the",Paragraph
"national capital, Ottawa, which made particular reference to the appropriateness of the",Paragraph
"Chateau style. Consequently, several mansard-roofed government buildings were",Paragraph
constructed in the vicinity of Parliament Hill during the Depression era. Even after World,Paragraph
War II the federal government commissioned H.L.Allward and G.R.Gouinlock of,Paragraph
Toronto to design the East (1949-56) and West (1954-58) Memorial buildings in this,Paragraph
idiom. These interconnecting buildings successfully combined the Chateau style with the,Paragraph
restrained and subtle detailing of the “stripped” classicism that had emerged during the,Paragraph
1930s.,Paragraph
"Whereas the federal government was attempting to define a national style, John",Paragraph
"M.Lyle, a Toronto architect and teacher, encouraged his colleagues to study European",Paragraph
modermism. Canadian architects and their clients were generally reluctant to,Paragraph
"wholeheartedly embrace new trends, and even John Lyle’s own approach sought to",Paragraph
combine traditional forms with a new language of ornament reflecting Canadian history,Paragraph
and regional diversity. An example of his approach to modern classicism was the Bank of,Paragraph
"Nova Scotia (1930) in Calgary, which contained neoclassical elements compressed into",Paragraph
"the building’s facade and highlighted by decorative imagery of western Canada, such as",Paragraph
"Mounties, aboriginal figures, horses, bison, wheat sheaves, and oil wells. Lyle’s ideas",Paragraph
"were taken a step further by Ernest Cormier, who successfully combined attributes of the",Paragraph
"neoclassical, Art Deco, and moderne to create dramatic architectural statements. For his",Paragraph
"1920s design of the Université de Montreal (1943), situated on the slopes of Mont Royal,",Paragraph
Cormier arranged a brick and reinforced-concrete structural system in a symmetrical,Paragraph
"Beaux-Arts organizational plan, complemented by the precise, vertical piers that",Paragraph
"articulate the main elevation and delineate the tall, domed central tower.",Caption
"It was not until after World War II, however, that most Canadian architects discarded",Paragraph
historicism. With technological development instigated by wartime research and the,Paragraph
"booming population, architects largely ignored the International Style in its pure form",Paragraph
"and turned to the Modern movement. This trend first made inroads in Vancouver,",Paragraph
nurtured by a vibrant community of young artists and designers led by Charles B.K.Van,Paragraph
"Norman, B.C.Binning, Frederic Lasserre, Robert A.D.Berwick, and Charles Edward",Caption
"Pratt, who were followed by Ron Thom and Arthur Erickson. The first Massey Gold",Paragraph
"Medal, jointly established by the Right Honorable Vincent Massey, governor-general of",Paragraph
"Canada, and the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC), was awarded in 1952 to",Paragraph
"Semmens and Simpson for Vancouver’s Marwell Place, one of Canada’s earliest",Paragraph
renditions of international modernism.,Paragraph
The 1950s and 1960s heralded an era of profound change and development that saw,Paragraph
"the destruction of many buildings, structures, and societal institutions. Glass-enclosed",Paragraph
"skyscrapers began to dominate the major Canadian cities, and Toronto in particular saw",Paragraph
"the emergence of the large, multidisciplined corporate design firm. One of most prolific",Paragraph
"of these was John B. Parkin Associates, renowned for its collection of rectilinear",Paragraph
buildings designed in the international modern style. The characteristic traits of this,Paragraph
"design firm—formality, precision, and technology—are evident in the Ortho",Paragraph
"Pharmaceutical (1956) office’s bold, white concrete frame; the dark recessed glazing with",Paragraph
steel spandrel panels; and the adjacent manufacturing plant of white glazed brick and,Paragraph
"contrasting dark ribbon windows. The John B.Parkin firm, with Bregmann and Hamann,",Caption
"also worked with Mies van der Rohe on the Toronto-Dominion Centre (phase 1, 1969), a",Paragraph
high-rise development in Toronto’s financial district. The resulting pair of finely detailed,Paragraph
"black towers, with exposed I beams traveling the full height of the immense curtain walls,",Paragraph
immediately became a city landmark.,Paragraph
Montréal experienced an exuberant proliferation of new architecture with its hosting,Paragraph
"of the world’s fair, Expo 1967, during the centennial year of Canada’s confederation.",Paragraph
This celebration was an opportunity for the nation to showcase its achievements to the,Paragraph
"world, and the Expo pavilions were an eclectic sampling of architectural modernism.",Paragraph
Two of the Government of Canada theme pavilions (1967) occupied a massive assembly,Paragraph
of interconnected tetrahedrons constructed of exposed-steel space frames that were,Paragraph
"designed by the Montréal firm of Affleck, Desbarats, Dimakopulos, Lebensold, and Sise.",Caption
Another remarkable Expo 1967 project was the experimental housing complex of,Paragraph
"prefabricated concrete block units, Habitat (1967). The original but unsuccessful",Caption
"intention of the young architect, Moshe Safdie, was to create a prototype for low-cost",Paragraph
housing.,Paragraph
"Although large urban centers benefited from these major design projects, smaller-scale",Paragraph
"regional architecture continued to flourish. Still a source of creative inspiration, the",Paragraph
prairie provinces produced unique Expressionist projects by young architects. Their,Paragraph
"designs employed natural materials, sinuous lines, and organic forms to mold structures",Paragraph
that successfully achieved the contradictory objectives of blending with the landscape,Paragraph
"and drawing the attention of the viewer. Partially set into a hillside, Clifford Wiens’ St.",Paragraph
"Mark’s Shop (1960) was an artisan’s studio with a conical concrete roof, reminiscent of",Paragraph
"the tepees of the plains aboriginal cultures. In Manitoba, Etienne Gaboury’s church for",Paragraph
the Paroisse du Précieux Sang (1967) reflected recent changes to the Roman Catholic,Paragraph
"liturgy with a circular interior space, capped by a conical wooden roof that spiraled up to",Paragraph
"a strategically placed window at the apex. A third innovator was Douglas Cardinal,",Paragraph
"whose first major commission was St. Mary’s Church (1968), constructed in Red Deer,",Paragraph
Alberta. This structure of sinuously curving walls of red brick enclosing a semicircular,Paragraph
nave displays what has become the architect’s signature style. Above this looms a,Paragraph
prestressed-concrete roof whose form resembles the experimental tensile fabric structures,Paragraph
of the era.,Paragraph
"The 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of several architects, such as A.J.Diamond",Paragraph
"and Barton Myers, Raymond Moriyama (Moriyama and Teshima Architects), and",Paragraph
"Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects, who addressed the requirements of",Paragraph
"urban living. Given the sobriquet of late modernism, their design approach was typified",Paragraph
"by projects such as Edmonton’s Citadel Theatre (1976) by Diamond and Myers, with",Paragraph
"Richard L.Wilkin. Occupying a busy corner site in the city center, the glass walls,",Caption
"awnings, and skylights of the reception area initiate a visual conversation between the",Paragraph
people on the street and the theater’s activities inside.,Paragraph
A growing concern over the destruction of the country’s historic architectural fabric,Paragraph
evolved into the heritage conservation movement. In addition to numerous local heritage,Paragraph
"initiatives, this received federal government support through the conservation programs",Paragraph
of Parks Canada. Heritage conservation created a need for architects who were skilled at,Paragraph
combining new technologies and public sensibilities with an appreciation for older,Paragraph
structures and traditional building methods. One of the earliest projects was the,Paragraph

Canberra (Australian Capital Territory) provides a showcase of Australian planning and,Paragraph
architecture during the 20th century. The first parliament of the Commonwealth of,Paragraph
Australia met in,Paragraph
Melbourne in 1901. An international competition for the federal capital city of,Paragraph
Canberra was conducted in 1911 and was won by Walter Burley Griffin and Marion,Paragraph
Mahony Griffin of Chicago.,Caption
"The so-called Departmental Board Plan was under way by 1913, designed by",Paragraph
bureaucrats using features assembled from the competition entries. This procedure and its,Paragraph
"ugly product caused a public outrage, so Griffin visited Australia in late 1913, when he",Paragraph
was appointed director of Federal Capital Works. The Griffins thus settled in Australia in,Paragraph
"May 1914, but their Canberra Plan was frustrated by wartime conditions, by quickly",Paragraph
"changing governments, and by hostile public servants—the authors of the discarded",Paragraph
"conglomerate plan. Griffin, having achieved very little, resigned in 1920 from any further",Paragraph
involvement in Canberra. In 1921 Sir John Sulman headed the Federal Capital Advisory,Paragraph
"Committee, which was formed to procure the construction of the city and its suburbs. He",Paragraph
fashioned a sparse garden suburbia and “introduced a modified mediterranean style of red,Paragraph
"tile roofs, white stucco walls, [and] simplified classical details.”",Paragraph
"The Griffins’ Canberra Plan (1911, revised 1918) was consistent with the City",Paragraph
"Beautiful movement and with precedents by Daniel Burnham (e.g., the Chicago Plan,",Paragraph
"1909). The basic geometry of the Griffins’ Plan was put in place: the Land Axis,",Paragraph
"connecting Mount Ainslie, Capitol Hill, and a mountain peak beyond; the bisecting Water",Paragraph
Axis; and the overlay of a triangle of broad avenues between Capitol Hill and the Civic,Paragraph
and Municipal Centres via two bridges across the lake basin. These elements were fitted,Paragraph
"majestically into the terrain, but the building types that the Griffins had named for the key",Paragraph
nodes were not adhered to. Their crystalline suburban road network was not established;,Paragraph
"of their building designs in Canberra, only a military general’ gravestone survives intact.",Paragraph
"Capitol Hill had been the site for the Griffins’ major 1911 competition landmark, a",Paragraph
"national cultural archive building, a “ziggurat” that included imagery of Hellenic tombs",Paragraph
and Oriental temples. The politicians in 1974 legislated that Capitol Hill instead become,Paragraph
"the site for a new parliament building. However, in 1914 Griffin had organized and then",Paragraph
withdrawn a wartime international competition for a new parliament building on Camp,Paragraph
"Hill, a less elevated site on the Land Axis between Capitol Hill and the central lake basin.",Paragraph
"Louis Sullivan (Chicago), Otto Wagner (Vienna), John Burnet (London), and Victor",Paragraph
"Laloux (Paris) had been invited as judges. In 1927 John Smith Murdoch (chief architect,",Paragraph
Commonwealth Works) completed a temporary Parliament House located below Camp,Paragraph
Hill toward the lake. Consequently the politicians and government departments moved to,Paragraph
"Canberra from the interim capital, Melbourne.",Paragraph
Public servants have always been reluctant to relocate in Canberra. The city’s,Paragraph
development languished until Robert Gordon Menzies became prime minister in 1949.,Paragraph
Menzies engaged the British town planner William Holford and the British landscape,Paragraph
"architect Sylvia Crowe to evaluate Canberra’s prospects (Holford Report, 1957). Holford",Caption
described Canberra as “a camel—a horse designed by a committee” and as “suburbs in,Paragraph
"search of a city,” and recommended that the Griffins’ denser city proposal be reinstated.",Paragraph
Crowe nevertheless advocated the retention of Canberra as a garden city. The National,Paragraph
"Capital Development Commission (NCDC) was formed, directed by John Overall. The",Paragraph
Molonglo River was dammed in 1963; at last the lake system was filled and was,Paragraph
ironically named Lake Burley Griffin. The city has since been extended with distant,Paragraph
"suburban satellites on the postwar English model of new towns beyond a greenbelt, each",Paragraph
"with a civic center. Central Canberra became a park dotted with white modernist foci, but",Paragraph
today it has improved in amenity and urban coherence as it has been gradually filled in,Paragraph
with buildings.,Paragraph
"A new Parliament House competition for Capitol Hill, conducted in 1980, was won by",Paragraph
Romaldo Giurgola (Mitchell/Giurgola Thorp). The ziggurat-like configuration of the,Paragraph
Griffins’ projected capitol (1911) and its landscaped setting (1918) were the inspiration,Paragraph
for Giurgola’s scheme (1988)—the main central bulk of the reinforced-concrete building,Paragraph
complex was contained within two curving retaining walls topped by a huge flagpole,Paragraph
"(Holford Report recommendation, 1957) supported by four stanchions ghosting the",Paragraph
Griffins’ originally proposed shape. The House of Representatives and the Senate were,Paragraph
"roofed with red tile, each house placed in a courtyard on either side of the curved walls.",Paragraph
The public can still climb Capitol Hill and look down through the skylight on the,Paragraph
Members’ Hall. The Land Axis vista was architecturally emphasized: the colonnade of,Paragraph
Giurgola’s “Great Verandah” entrance appears integrated with the stripped classicism of,Paragraph
"Murdoch’s temporary parliament building, today a national portrait gallery.",Paragraph
The NCDC (now disbanded) located a few monumental buildings off the Land Axis,Paragraph

"designed and built in 1898-1904, was the last large commercial structure designed by",Paragraph
"Louis Sullivan. In later modernist historiography, this building was acclaimed for its",Paragraph
"forthright expression of steel-and-glass construction in its upper elevations. As such,",Paragraph
Carson Pirie Scott was seen as a forerunner of the International Style in commercia.,Paragraph
"architecture of the mid-20th century, epitomized by the later tall buildings of Ludwig",Paragraph
Mies van der Rohe. Carson Pirie Scott was also pivotal in the international development,Paragraph
of the department store as a building type in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. From a,Paragraph
"Postmodernist perspective of the 1980s, the building’s outstanding feature is Sullivan’s",Paragraph
ornamental enrichment of the show-window frames along the two-story base that served,Caption
to enhance the display of apparel to a largely female clientele.,Paragraph
Since 1881 the retail dry-goods firm of Leopold Schlesinger and David Mayer had,Paragraph
occupied parts of a preexisting structure on the southeast corner of State and Madison,Paragraph
Streets at the center of Chicago’s retail shopping corridor along State Street. Over the,Paragraph
years Schlesinger and Mayer had commissioned the firm of Adler and Sullivan (and,Paragraph
afterward Louis Sullivan alone) to design remodelings and expansions of their quarters.,Paragraph
"The principal client was David Mayer, who commissioned Sullivan’s design for the new",Paragraph
"Schlesinger and Mayer Store, first announced in May 1898. By this time, a group of new",Paragraph
"and projected buildings for retailing created by nearby competitors, as well as the high",Paragraph
"annual rental value of the corner property, had accentuated the need for a new building on",Paragraph
"the site. Sullivan’s original design called for a uniformly 12-story steel-frame structure,",Paragraph
including a rounded corner tower recalling that of the earlier building on the site. The,Paragraph
original design also featured a cladding of white Georgia marble for the steel frame above,Paragraph
the two-story base (the marble was changed to white enameled terra-cotta as built) and,Paragraph
cast bronze for the ornamentally elaborate frames of the show windows on the lower two,Caption
floors (the bronze became painted cast iron as built). The first three-bay section of the,Paragraph
"new Schlesinger and Mayer Store, built late in 1899, was only nine stories tall because of",Paragraph
a height limit of 120 feet imposed on tall buildings by Chicago’s city council. A,Paragraph
relaxation of that limit to 240 feet in 1902 enabled construction of the corner and State,Paragraph
"Street sections of the building in 1903-04 to the originally designed height of 12 stories,",Paragraph
extending seven bays down State Street south of the rounded corner.,Caption
The new building opened in October 1903 with additional interior work continuing,Paragraph
"into the spring of 1904. After the dissolution of the Schlesinger and Mayer firm, Carson",Paragraph
"Pirie Scott and Company acquired control of the building in August 1904. In December,",Paragraph
Carson’s commissioned D.H.Burnham and Company to add five bays to Sullivan’s 12-,Paragraph
"story structure, extending it 104 feet farther south on State Street. In 1948 the",Paragraph
overhanging cornice and top-floor colonnade along the whole building were removed and,Caption
replaced by a low parapet wall. In 1960-61 Holabird and Root designed an eight-story,Caption
addition adjoining the Burnham bays to the south on State Street. In 1979 Carson Pirie,Caption
"Scott commissioned architect John Vinci to partially restore their landmark building,",Paragraph
"including cleaning the terra-cotta and replacing damaged pieces, repainting the cast-iron",Paragraph
"base to approximate Sullivan’s original treatment, and restoring the main corner",Caption
vestibule’s interior. The structure has been in continuous use as a department store since,Paragraph
it opened over a century ago.,Paragraph
"When it was first completed, the Schlesinger and Mayer Store was considered a model",Paragraph
for a modern department store and a major work in Sullivan’s oeuvre. Sullivan’s style of,Paragraph
ornamental ironwork along the base was related to the processes of show-window display,Paragraph
"and newspaper advertising of women’s apparel, whose seasonal variations and elaborate",Paragraph
lacework corresponded to the ornament’s foliate motifs and intricate design. Like other,Paragraph
"stores nearby, the first- and second-story plate-glass show windows also had upper lights",Paragraph
filled with Luxfer prismatic glass to refract daylight into the depths of the sales floors.,Paragraph
"Originally, the store’s architectural interiors included a third-floor ladies waiting and",Paragraph
writing room and an eighth-floor restaurant featuring ornamentally elaborate sawed,Paragraph
"mahogany screens and columns with capitals of ornamental plasterwork, like the capitals",Paragraph
"visible atop the columns of the corner vestibule and the first, second, third, and fourth",Caption
sales floors.,Paragraph
The need to maximize spatial openness and interior daylight for shopping,Paragraph
(in an era when arc lamps were still the principal interior electrical fixtures,Paragraph
for such buildings) led to Sullivan’s design for the upper exterior,Paragraph
"elevations of Chicago windows (a wide, central, fixed glass pane flanked",Caption
on either side by an operable sash window). Sullivan’s upper fenestration,Caption

CASA MALAPARTE,Title
"Designed by Adalberto Libera, completed 1963 Island of Capri",Caption
The Casa Malaparte is a villa on the island of Capri designed by the Italian rationalist,Caption
architect Adalberto Libera (1903-63) for the writer and journalist Curzio Malaparte,Paragraph
(1898-1957). The building’s dominant position on its rocky outcrop reflect its expressive,Paragraph
and outward-looking spirit. Its bold volumetric form and symmetrical planning reflects,Paragraph
"Libera’s desire for “sin cerity, order, logic and clarity above all” (Malaparte, 1989). All in",Paragraph
"all, it is a textbook example of modernist 20th-century architecture. At first glance, this",Paragraph
"might seem to be an accurate description of the Casa Malaparte. However, a closer",Paragraph
examination reveals these seemingly uncontestable facts as increasingly problematic.,Paragraph
The Casa Malaparte is actually a curious and contradictory work that directly reflects,Paragraph
the nature of its curious and contradictory client: Curzio Malaparte. Born Kurt Erich,Paragraph
"Suckert into a Protestant family, Malaparte denounced these roots when beginning his",Paragraph
"writing career by taking his mother’s maiden name and then later, on his deathbed,",Paragraph
converting to Catholicism. Malaparte is best known for his writings that glorified,Paragraph
"Mussolini and the Fascist Party, yet he was jailed by that same party between 1933 and",Paragraph
"1935. While he subsequently tried to become a member of the Communist Party,",Paragraph
Malaparte also served as a liaison officer for the U.S. Army after World War II. These,Paragraph
examples are only the more concrete ones illustrating a soul who functioned in extremes,Paragraph
and was always torn between opposites.,Paragraph
"The architect Adalberto Libera, a member of the rationalist Gruppo 7, is best known",Paragraph
for his works that helped advertise Fascist Italy: the staging of the Exhibition of the Tenth,Paragraph
"Anniversary of the Fascist Revolution (1932), and the Italian Pavilions at the World",Paragraph
Expositions of Chicago (1933) and Brussels (1935). It is through these works that,Paragraph
"Malaparte most likely became familiar with Libera. Sometime in early 1938, Malaparte",Paragraph
"approached Libera to design a small villa on the island of Capri. The resulting design,",Paragraph
"which was submitted for approval to the Capri authorities in March 1938, was never",Paragraph
"built. For this reason, the attribution of the Casa Malaparte to Adalberto Libera can be",Paragraph
"questioned. However, Libera’s initial design, although different from what was actually",Paragraph
"built, can be seen as the “foundation” of the eventual building.",Paragraph
"Libera proposed a two-story, elongated rectangular building with rooms on one side",Paragraph
and a corridor on the other. The linearity of the project took advantage of the linearity of,Paragraph
"its site: the Massullo promontory. The project stepped up in section toward the sea, using",Paragraph
the lower portion’s roof as a sheltered terrace. The external ground-floor walls of the,Paragraph
"project consisted of rough stone, presumably from the site, with the upper portion of the",Paragraph
walls plastered smooth. These characteristics of the project can be seen in the building as,Paragraph
"built. However, this is where the similarity ends. Sometime during 1939, Libera and",Paragraph
"Malaparte lost touch concerning the villa. Without an architect, Malaparte, however,",Paragraph
"continued building, acting on advice from his builder, Adolfo Amitriano, and his circle of",Paragraph
artist friends as well as on his own thoughts and inspirations.,Paragraph
The most significant change to Libera’s initial project made by Malaparte is perhaps the,Paragraph
defining element of the Casa Malaparte: the curious wedge-shaped staircase to the roof,Caption
that extends for about one-third of the entire structure and gives the building its unique,Paragraph
silhouette. This form has been attributed to Malaparte’s memory of the Church of the,Paragraph
"Annunziata, experienced during his exile imposed by the Fascists on the island of Lipari.",Paragraph

The J-shaped plan of Casa Mila contains two internal courtyards whose rounded forms,Paragraph
are consistent with the building’s general lack of orthogonal planes and are echoed in the,Paragraph
building’s facade. One of the most significant aspects of Casa Mila is the open plan of,Paragraph

CATALAN (GUASTAVINO) VAULTS,Title
"This historic vaulting technique, popular in Spain and the United States in the early 20th",Paragraph
"century, is also called “cohesive construction,” “timbrel vault,” “laminated vault,” (in",Paragraph
"France), (“board vault,” in Spain), and (“layered vault” in Italy). It uses thin, flat clay",Paragraph
"tiles (about 12 by 6 by 5/8 inches) in laminated shell structures, assembled with an",Paragraph
"extremely adhesive and fast-drying mortar into vaults, normally in three or more layers of",Paragraph
overlapping tiles. The enormous stability stems from two major factors: the convergence,Paragraph
"of the tiles and mortar into a homogeneous, monolithic material that can absorb both",Paragraph
compression and tension and the thin (single or double) curved surfaces that obtain,Paragraph
additional strength by distributing them sideways as well as downward. Apart from being,Paragraph
"fireproof, the vault is lighter than any other masonry vault and produces only minimal",Paragraph
"lateral thrust at its springing points. As a result, it allows the placement of openings in the",Paragraph
shell and the easy combination of several units and does not require outside buttressing or,Paragraph
reinforcement beams. Skilled workers can erect even large vaults without scaffolding or,Paragraph
"formwork, as the lower rows of laminated clay tiles are usually strong enough when the",Paragraph
mortar has dried to carry the workers placing subsequent layers.,Paragraph
The roots of this vaulting technique can be traced back to medieval and even Roman,Paragraph
sources. The structure would typically be hidden from sight under plaster or suspended,Paragraph
ceilings or used as permanent formwork. The late 19th century developed a new interest,Paragraph
"in the technique, which eventually flourished simultaneously in the first half of the 20th",Paragraph
"century both in Catalonia, Spain, and in the United States.",Paragraph
In the 1860s it was rediscovered in Catalonia as a cheap method of vaulting spaces for,Paragraph
industrial buildings and warehouses. A prime example is the factory (1869-75; today,Paragraph
called The Clock Building) for the Battlé brothers in Barcelona by Rafael Guastavino.,Paragraph
Father and son Rafael Guastavino exhibited the method with great success at the,Paragraph
Philadelphia World’s Fair and subsequently proceeded to introduce the technique to the,Paragraph
United States. The Guastavino Company (1885-1963) held 24 patents and was involved,Paragraph
"in the construction of more than 1,000 buildings all across the United States, Canada, and",Paragraph
"11 other countries. During the 40 most active years of the company, the Guastavinos",Paragraph
"worked on some of the most spectacular public buildings of the day, including the Boston",Paragraph
"Public Library (McKim, Mead and White, 1898), Grand Central Terminal (Warren and",Paragraph
"Wetmore, 1913), and Pennsylvania Station (McKim, Mead and White, 1911) in New",Paragraph
"York, as well as private commissions, including the Biltmore Estate (Richard Morris",Paragraph
"Hunt, 1895) in Asheville, North Carolina. The widest span ever to be achieved with",Paragraph
Guastavino tiles is the 66-foot-wide dome above the crossing of the cathedral of St. John,Paragraph
"the Divine (Cram and Ferguson, 1893 and later) in New York. Although American",Paragraph
architects used Guastavino tiles mostly for conventional vaults and domes in historicist,Paragraph
"architecture, they frequently chose to expose the typical fish-grate pattern of the tiles on",Paragraph
the underside of a vault or dome without any ornamental embellishment. These patterns,Paragraph
can still be found in countless public structures.,Paragraph
"Simultaneously, the method gained popularity among the architects of the Catalan",Paragraph
movement in northeastern Spain. (Although several medieval applications in Catalonia,Paragraph
"are known, there is no evidence that the method was exclusive to this region or had",Paragraph
"originated there.) Fired by a search for an independent Catalan architectural expression,",Paragraph
several architects fully exploited the technique’s structural and expressive potential for,Paragraph
"complex vaults, undulating walls, and rolling ceilings. Among the prime examples are",Paragraph
Antoni Gaudi’s small school building (1906) at the Sagrada Familia cathedral in,Caption
"Barcelona, which features both a curvilinear outside wall and a wavelike roof structure.",Paragraph
"Gaudi’s contemporary, Lluis Doménech i Montaner, used the technique in the Palau de la",Paragraph
"Musica Catalana (1905-08) and his Hospital de Sant Paul (1902-10), both in Barcelona.",Paragraph
César Martinell built more than 30 agricultural cooperatives using the tiles in Catalonia,Paragraph
"between 1913 and 1919, and Lluis Muncunill i Parellada created perhaps the most radical",Paragraph
"application of the technique in his textile factory, Aymerich Amat i Jover (1907-09) in",Paragraph
"Terrassa, Catalonia, which features series of double-curved roof elements on cast-iron",Paragraph
posts that both shelter the interior and provide northern skylights.,Paragraph
"Eventually, the use of the technique succumbed to rising labor costs and new, cheaper",Paragraph
building methods that began to dominate the building markets in the Western world after,Paragraph
"World War II. There were only occasional later applications, as in Luis Moya Blanco’s",Paragraph
"St. Augustin church (1954) in Madrid or Le Corbusier’s use of simple, flat Catalan vaults",Paragraph
in his Maison Jaoul (1955) in Paris.,Paragraph
The two most spectacular applications since World War II have occurred outside the,Paragraph
highly industrialized Western building markets. A Catalan mason brought the vaulting,Paragraph
"technique in the late 1950s to Cuba, where it was applied to the first major building",Paragraph
"project of Fidel Castro’s government, a cluster of five art schools (Ricardo Porro, Vittorio",Paragraph
"Garatti, Roberto Gottardi, 1961-65, unfinished) featuring spectacular sequences of domes",Caption
and barrel vaults.,Paragraph
The Uruguayan architect Eladio Dieste (b. 1917) has continuously applied,Paragraph
the central principles of the Catalan vault since the late 1950s and,Paragraph
improved it structurally by using steel reinforcement rods and tie bars in,Paragraph
"conjunction with doublecurvature brick shells, thus increasing the span of",Paragraph
each unit. Among Dieste’s most stunning creations is a church (1958) in,Paragraph
"Atlantida, Uruguay, with undulating walls and ceiling based on a principle",Paragraph

Equally important is a warehouse (1960) in Montevideo that is spanned by double-curved,Paragraph

Terrassa. The thin laminated masonry vaults have influenced the development of thin,Paragraph
"concrete shells (for example, in the work of Spanish architects Edoardo Torroja and Felix",Paragraph
Candela) and Russian experiments with large vaults of prefabricated-concrete elements.,Paragraph
A renewed interest in the technique has led to attempts at reviving the vaulting technique,Paragraph
for the Western building market.,Paragraph

objectives of an emerging industry that contributed significantly to the development of,Paragraph
he computer industry and Silicon Valley. The plan served as a model that ultimately led,Paragraph
"o a comprehensive program known as the Center for Integrated Systems (1983), which",Paragraph
ought to coordinate scientific research and industrial development in related engineering,Paragraph
isciplines at Stanford University. These developments culminated in the 1983 CISX,Paragraph
building.,Paragraph
"By the early 1990s, the need arose to expand the original 70,000-square-foot CISX",Paragraph
"building by Ehrlich-Rominger, Architects. A laboratory with additional support space of",Caption
semiindustrial character was needed for a variety of experimental efforts. The location of,Paragraph
the existing facility on campus was west of the Main Quad and presented an early,Paragraph
opportunity to test the adopted revitalization plan. Because of the sensitive location and,Paragraph
"difficult technical requirements, a decision was made to host an invitation-only design",Paragraph
competition. Predock’s winning entry was distinct among the four competitors for,Paragraph
achieving several desirable goals for coherent expansion.,Paragraph
"Predock’s solution comprised three parts: a new courtyard, the new addition, and a",Paragraph
"new hazardous materials/mechanical equipment area, for a total of 53,000 square feet.",Paragraph
"Rather than butting up against the existing building, Predock designed the addition as a",Paragraph
"discrete building that spatially defines the Main Quad, presenting a powerful logic for a",Paragraph
building form that affords both an east entry visible from the Main Quad and a north,Paragraph
entry for easy access. His plan strengthened the nodal entry to the new Science and,Paragraph
"Engineering Quad to the south and the Biological-Chemistry science area to the north,",Paragraph
"created a private interior courtyard for informal gatherings, and defined interior",Paragraph
programmatic spaces.,Paragraph
The design suggests a traditional sense of solidity for which the Richardsonian,Paragraph
Romanesque-Mission style is noted. A concrete plinth provides a visual base for the,Paragraph
"building, similar to the Main Quad. The building is faced with Indian (Delhi) fossilized",Paragraph
sandstone veneer. The sense of weight is enhanced through contrast with a copper-clad,Paragraph
concrete-vault form that floats within the CISX main entry arcade and that proportionally,Paragraph
matches the Main Quad entry arches. Copper-sheet roof shingles are returned to cover the,Caption
"eave soffits, which, in conjunction with a continuous nine-inch strip window at the eave,",Paragraph
also cause the upper roof mass to hover. Together the copper-sheathed roof and vault,Paragraph
heighten the contrast and sense of gravity of the stone-faced building mass. The,Paragraph
stonework and copper materials complement a sense of permanence in the unusual,Paragraph
handling of mass and space that both delights and defies conventional sensibilities,Paragraph
"established by the original campus buildings. Overall, the design offers a 21st-century",Paragraph
"expression of a scientific endeavor that is genuine, rich, and appropriate in the context of",Paragraph
the traditional architectural style of the original campus.,Paragraph

CENTURY OF PROGRESS EXPOSITION,Title
"Chicago, Illinois, 1933-34",Caption
"The Century of Progress International Exposition, held in Chicago in 1933-34, played",Paragraph
a pivotal yet often underrecognized role in the development and acceptance of modern,Paragraph
architecture. The event was the largest architectural program realized in the United States,Paragraph
during the depths of the Great Depression. It attracted the attention of influential,Paragraph
architects and designers as well as building materials manufacturers and design critics.,Paragraph
The innovative exhibition pavilions introduced more than 38 million fair visitors to then-,Paragraph
current progressive ideas in modern architecture. Millions more became acquainted with,Paragraph
"the modern exposition designs through secondary sources, including a wide range of",Paragraph
"articles, newsreels, and souvenirs.",Paragraph
In 1928 a not-for-profit corporation was chartered to organize a world’s fair to,Paragraph
celebrate the centennial anniversary of the founding of Chicago. The fair organizers,Paragraph
quickly realized that this theme was too narrow to attract enough international or even,Paragraph
"national interest to guarantee a successful event. Additionally, the recent financial fiasco",Paragraph
of the Philadelphia Sesquicentennial International Exposition made it apparent that,Paragraph
relying on a structure and character common to past expositions would result in a,Paragraph
"financial and cultural catastrophe. To ensure the success of the Chicago exposition, the",Paragraph
organizers knew that they had to broaden the scope of the fair and present an event that,Paragraph
would be perceived by critics and the public as appropriate to modern times.,Paragraph
"Consequently, the organizers adopted a more inclusive, forward-looking theme: the",Paragraph
impact of scientific development on the betterment of humanity.,Paragraph
"The members of the architectural commission for the exposition—Paul Philippe Cret,",Paragraph
"Raymond Hood, John Holabird, Edward Bennett, Hurbert Burnham, Arthur Brown,",Caption
"Harvey Wiley Corbett, and Ralph Walker—knew that their designs had to reflect the",Paragraph
"modern theme of the fair. The struggle of these notable, Beaux-Arts-trained architects to",Paragraph
"achieve this through coming to terms with recent developments in their field, as well as",Paragraph
"the changing conditions of modern life, is clearly evident in the preliminary schemes for",Paragraph
the event. Early site plans consisted of neoclassical buildings laid out following a,Paragraph
symmetrical that emphasized a strong sense of axiality. The long and narrow exposition,Paragraph
"site, financial limitations resulting from the Great Depression, the lack of a rigid building",Paragraph
"code, and the ephemeral nature of the event all served as sources of inspiration and",Paragraph
limitation for the committee members in their efforts to create a modern world’s fair. The,Paragraph
final result was an asymmetrical layout of inexpensive yet innovative buildings of,Paragraph
prefabricated materials.,Paragraph
The fairgrounds covered three and a half miles of new manmade land along the shore,Paragraph
"of Lake Michigan directly south of the Loop. Recently completed neoclassical buildings,",Paragraph
"including the Field Museum of Natural History, the Shedd Aquarium, and Soldier Field,",Paragraph
framed the north end of the site. These historically derived buildings provided a,Paragraph
"monochromatic backdrop, reminiscent of Chicago’s Columbian Exposition of 1893,",Paragraph
"which con trasted sharply with the colorful, modern exhibition pavilions that covered the",Paragraph
fairgrounds.,Paragraph
Architects produced a wide range of building designs for the Century of Progress,Paragraph
"Exposition. These included large exhibition halls, futuristic model houses, progressive",Paragraph
"foreign pavilions, and historic and ethnic entertainment venues. Designs of the major",Paragraph
pavilions ranged from the “ultramodern” yellow and blue Administration Building,Paragraph
"(Bennett, Burnham, and Holabird), with its silver, undulating entrance and factory",Paragraph
"fenestration, to the flat, windowless, streamlined Sears Roebuck Building (Nimmons,",Caption
"Carr, and Wright). Several of the main pavilions, including the Hall of Science (Cret),",Paragraph
"which served as the centerpiece of the fair, and the Electrical Building (Hood), were",Paragraph
"decorated with panels of bas-relief sculpture containing stylized, allegorical figures",Caption
"representing the sciences. Many other buildings, however, including most of the",Paragraph
"corporate pavilions, contained little or no applied ornament, except letters spelling out the",Paragraph
company’s name across their facades. Pavilions such as the Time and Fortune Building,Paragraph
(Nicolai and Faro) and the Havoline Thermometer Tower (Alfonso Iannelli and Charles,Caption
Pope) strove for more immediate corporate recognition by including giant reproductions,Paragraph
of their products or related items as part of their building’s design. Several other,Paragraph
companies commissioned pavilions constructed out of their own new products. For,Paragraph
"example, the Owens-Illinois Glass Corporation Pavilion (Elroy Ruiz) con-sisted of a",Paragraph
"tower and two wings built out of glass bricks. A comprehensive color scheme, created by",Paragraph
"Joseph Urban, that articulated the individual exterior planes of the major buildings",Paragraph
"through the use of vivid hues, unified the diverse fair pavilions. At night, the use of",Paragraph
dramatic lighting effects created a magnificent spectacle. The fair presented the largest,Paragraph
quantity of electric lighting emitted at a single event up to that time and featured the first,Paragraph
major application of neon in architectural lighting.,Paragraph
"Millions of attendees stood in long lines to tour full-scale, modern houses on display",Paragraph
"in the Home and Industrial Arts Exhibit. For many visitors, the Chicago fair provided",Paragraph
their first exposure to modern residential design. Most of the model houses were,Paragraph
sponsored by building-material manufacturers. They promoted new construction,Paragraph
"materials, such as porcelain enamel panels or Rostone (a synthetic stone product), or",Paragraph
"demonstrated new uses for traditional building materials, such as “precast” brick walls.",Paragraph
"Other houses, including the Tropical House, focused less on materials and more on",Paragraph
"demonstrating new ideas in modern living. The House of Tomorrow, designed by George",Caption
"Frederick Keck, generated the greatest amount of attention. Keck designed his 12-sided",Paragraph
glass residence to appear as futuristic as possible in hopes of making the aesthetics of,Paragraph
modern architecture more familiar and thus more acceptable to the average American,Paragraph
home buyer.,Paragraph
"Because of poor economic conditions around the world, only a few nations",Paragraph
constructed their own pavilions at the exposition. Most countries chose,Paragraph
instead to promote themselves through national displays located in the,Paragraph
"general exhibition buildings. Notable exceptions included Sweden,",Paragraph
"Czechoslovakia, and Italy, which built large, modern pavilions. The Italian",Paragraph
"Pavilion (Mario De Renzi, Antonio Valent, and Adalberto Libera)",Caption
consisted of an assemblage of dynamic forms that clearly expressed the,Paragraph
major political goal of the displays inside: to increase support for Fascism,Paragraph
among the American public. The basic composition of the building,Paragraph

Not all buildings were aesthetically modern. Event organizers wished to celebrate,Paragraph
earlier cultural developments to provide a context from which visitors could measure,Paragraph
"current and future advances. Architecturally, the past was represented by recreations of",Paragraph
"historic structures, such as Chicago’s Fort Dearborn and the Maya Nunnery of Uxmal;",Paragraph
"ethnic settings for entertainment, such as the Belgium Village and the Streets of Paris;",Paragraph
"and a variety of other “midway” attractions. Although historical in formal characteristics,",Paragraph
these buildings were constructed using modern materials.,Paragraph
The fair designers relied heavily on the use of new building materials to minimize,Paragraph
construction costs. The exteriors of most of the pavilions consisted of wall panels,Paragraph
"produced from a variety of factory-made materials, including asbestos cement wallboard,",Paragraph
"precast gypsum board, plywood, metal siding, and laminated insulation board. In addition",Paragraph
"to aesthetics and cost, the factors involved in selecting a particular prefabricated material",Paragraph
"included strength and durability, weatherproofness, moisture resistance, relative",Paragraph
"resistance to combustion, lightness of weight, ease of securing to framework, and",Paragraph
"availability. A new type of Sheetrock, suitable for exterior use on temporary buildings,",Paragraph
was the favored wall surface material for the large exhibition pavilions.,Paragraph
Factory-made panels were ideally suited to two major concepts in building,Paragraph
construction gaining favor among progressive designers in the early 1930s: prefabrication,Paragraph
and disposable architecture. Architects designing buildings for the exposition explored,Paragraph
systematic construction techniques in their attempt to keep construction costs down to an,Paragraph
affordable level despite sharp increases in labor and material costs and a significant,Paragraph
decrease in available funds as a result of the poor economy. Workers assembled various,Paragraph
types of standardized wall panels to steel framing in modern assembly-line fashion.,Paragraph
Screwing or bolting the panels of the pavilions together provided for easy disassembly,Paragraph
and salvaging of the building parts after the close of the exposition. This led proponents,Paragraph
of “disposable architecture” to highlight the Chicago fair in American architectura.,Paragraph
journal discussions on the benefits of short-lived buildings.,Paragraph
The designers also looked toward new structural ideas for inspiration in the creation of,Paragraph
modern yet novel-looking pavilions. Two forms of thin membrane roofing highlighted,Paragraph
"structural advances at the event. The first, used in the rotunda of the steel Travel and",Paragraph
"Transport Building (Bennett, Burnham, and Holabird), was the first major catenary roof",Paragraph
constructed in the United States. The massive structure consisted of a drum with support,Paragraph
cables traveling from the roof upward to the tops of 12 tall columns and then downward,Paragraph
"to anchors at the outer edge of a broader, lower level of the building. The Brook Hil",Paragraph
"Dairy (Richard Phillipp and Anton Tedesko), built for the second fair season in 1934,",Paragraph
also demonstrated an advancement in roofing design. The building’s five contiguous,Paragraph
elliptical barrel vaults presented the first use of a multi-vaulted concrete-shell roof and,Paragraph
probably the first applications of the Zeiss-Dywidag process for reinforced thin-shell,Paragraph
"vaulting in the United States. A third, less apparent structural development was an",Paragraph
innovative system of low-cost pile footings. This proved more suitable than spread,Paragraph
footings for the unstable conditions of the recently created land of the fairgrounds.,Paragraph
The exposition also provided an opportunity for designers to explore and promote,Paragraph
"innovative architectural ideas through unbuilt designs for the event. Frank Lloyd Wright,",Caption
whose inability to work cooperatively with other architects kept him off the design,Paragraph
"commission, clearly realized the importance of the event in the development of American",Paragraph
"architecture. With encouragement from Lewis Mumford and other architectural critics, he",Paragraph
presented three schemes for the fair at a meeting of the American Union of Decorative,Paragraph
Artists and Craftsmen held in New York in February 1931. These conceptual designs,Paragraph
"explored housing the entire exposition in a skyscraper, under a massive tent structure, and",Paragraph
"on barges floating out on Lake Michigan. Industrial designer Norman Bel Geddes, who",Caption
"briefly served as a design consultant to the architectural commission, also promoted",Paragraph
"innovative ideas, including the concept of streamlining, through producing a series of",Paragraph
"unrealized, experimental theater and restaurant pavilions. Many of these designs,",Paragraph
"including a rotating aerial restaurant, were featured in his influential 1932 treatise .",Paragraph
"In contrast to the first Chicago world’s fair, which helped usher in a massive wave of",Paragraph
"neoclassical buildings throughout the United States, the Century of Progress Exposition",Paragraph
played a less discernible role in the development of modern American architecture,Paragraph
despite its tremendous public success. Although the exposition encouraged a greater,Paragraph
"acceptance of nonhistorical forms, few architects looked to the fair as a source of",Paragraph
aesthetic inspiration for their modern building designs. Reasons for this ranged from the,Paragraph
vast difference in functional needs between the temporary exposition halls and more,Paragraph
permanent architecture to the drastic reduction in all construction starts in the 1930s. Also,Paragraph
influential were the strong reactions of architectural critics to Wright’s omission from the,Paragraph
"commission and, later, to the formal qualities of designs produced for the event. Although",Paragraph
"the direct aesthetic impact of the exposition on everyday architecture was limited, the",Paragraph
"designs did influence the formal qualities of buildings with similar functional needs,",Paragraph
particularly the designs of later exposition pavilions. The Chicago fair’s most significant,Paragraph
contributions to the development of American architecture lay instead in the introduction,Paragraph
and promotion of innovative building products and processes adaptable to both,Paragraph
progressive and traditional designs.,Paragraph

"CHADIRJI, RIFAT 1926—",Title
"Architect, Iraq",Title
The driving force behind Rifat Chadirji’s work has been his attempt to reconcile,Paragraph
contemporary social needs with new technology. His search for a regional modernism,Paragraph
found expression in cement-concrete buildings and in his plans for Baghdad.,Paragraph
"In the Iraq of the 1950s, a flowering of the arts included intensive discussions among",Paragraph
"architects, artists, writers, and intellectuals about the need for appropriate artistic",Paragraph
"expressions, influenced by both European ideas and local traditions. The architects",Paragraph
"Wilson and Mason, who practiced in Iraq in the 1940s and whose buildings interpreted",Paragraph
"local architecture employing indigenous master masons, also shaped Chadirji’s ideas",Paragraph
"about regionalism. This approach stagnated somewhat after World War II, when new",Paragraph
technologies that bypassed the contribution of the indigenous building industry were,Paragraph
"introduced. Architects such as Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, and Frank Lloyd Wright",Paragraph
"visited Iraq in the 1960s, encouraging the local Iraqi architects to find their own",Paragraph
"expression of modern architecture. As a consequence, Chadirji sought to achieve a",Paragraph
synthesis between traditional forms and materials and modern technology and building,Title
"types. He studied local environmental features such as courtyards, screen walls, and",Paragraph
"natural ventilation. However, until the late 1960s his buildings were clearly functionalist",Paragraph
"and were determined by structural considerations and modern materials, as evidenced in",Paragraph
his Monument to the Unknown Soldier (1959) and in his Tobacco Monopoly Offices and,Paragraph
"Warehouse (1969), both in Baghdad.",Paragraph
Chadirji articulated his ideas concerning a modernism informed by tradition in his,Paragraph
"written works, theories that can be seen in his villa for H.H.Hamood (1972), designed as",Paragraph
"a dramatic series of parallel vaults. As Chadirji noted, it was not until the early 1970s that",Paragraph
he reached the view that the connection between form and structure was not inevitable.,Paragraph
This realization led the architect to increased freedom of construction and the plastic,Paragraph
possibilities of building form.,Paragraph
This sense of plasticity and a graphic approach to buildings characterize the facades of,Paragraph
"his buildings, as demonstrated in his published portfolio of etchings and drawings for the",Paragraph
Federation of Industries and for the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs. His,Paragraph
buildings are characterized in plan by parallel walls and in elevation by facades of solid,Paragraph
"planes with indented openings, often with protruding tall, thin, arched windows and",Paragraph
"curving corners. The concrete buildings were usually designed to be faced in brick or, in",Paragraph
"other countries of the Middle East, in stone. Together with Mohamed Makiya, Chadirji’s",Paragraph
buildings influenced much of the architecture in the Arab Middle East in the 1970s and,Paragraph
early 1980s.,Paragraph
"In his analysis of built form, Chadirji led the way in the Middle East to",Paragraph
reevaluate architecture’s role in culture and politics. The effects of his,Paragraph
contributions have been long lasting and include his vision of rapidly,Paragraph
changing architectural forms as mediators between social needs and,Paragraph
"prevailing technology. The failure to come to terms with this, he",Paragraph
"postulated, partly explained the collapse of architecture seen in Iraq after",Paragraph
"1945. Second, Chadirji saw the relationship between local traditional",Paragraph
building and international modernism as one in which an “authentic,Paragraph
regionalism” based on an abstraction of tradition and modernity could,Paragraph
"emerge. Third, in the 1960s, Chadirji was early to recognize the potential",Paragraph
importance of the computer to design and urban planning such that,Paragraph

"Chandigarh is the modern, new state capital built by the government of India in the",Paragraph
immediate aftermath of its independence from 200 years of colonial rule. On 15 August,Paragraph
"1947, India’s hard-won freedom was accompanied by a partition that established Pakistan",Paragraph
"as a separate country. As a result, the Indian state of Punjab lost its historic capital,",Paragraph
"Lahore, to Pakistan. Consequently, the search for a replacement capital for East Punjab",Paragraph
was high on the agenda of the fledgling Indian nation-state.,Paragraph
A burgeoning sense of national pride focused attention on the search for this new,Paragraph
"capital, and the project took on great symbolic value as a demonstration of the new",Paragraph
"government’s effectiveness, ideals, and abilities. Although the development of this new",Paragraph
"capital was ostensibly a state project, the central government took an active role in the",Paragraph

"of choosing an existing city, Nehru advocated the making of a new capital that would",Paragraph
"express the ideals of the new nation-state, which was precipitously embracing modernism",Paragraph
as a catalyst for change.,Paragraph
This kind of ideological momentum propelled the project quickly to a developmental,Paragraph
stage. The new capital was intended to resettle not only the Punjabi government and,Paragraph
university but also thousands of refugees displaced in the political upheaval. The new city,Paragraph
was named Chandigarh after an existing village which had a temple dedicated to the,Paragraph
"Hindu goddess Chandi. A site for the project had been chosen by 1948, but in 1949 it was",Paragraph
changed to its present location in an effort to reduce the number of people whom the,Paragraph

practices of England to derive his vision for a modern Chandigarh.,Paragraph
"In 1948, English town-planning practices were strongly influenced by the principles of",Paragraph
the Garden City movement and Ebenezer Howard’s 1898 book (republished as,Paragraph
in 1902). Howard’s fundamental goal was to invent new living environments that could,Paragraph
coexist with industry without suffering from the congestion and squalor that resulted,Paragraph
"from industrial pollution and agglomeration of labor. By the 1930s, garden city principles",Paragraph
"had influenced the construction of several experimental new English towns, including",Paragraph
"Letchworth (1903) and Welwyn (1919), and Radburn, New Jersey (1929). Eventually, its",Paragraph
principles were adapted to develop the greater London plan of 1944 and the New Towns,Paragraph
"Act of 1946, which was used to design a ring of new towns around London.",Paragraph
Fletcher recommended a vision for Chandigarh based on these ideas and proposed,Paragraph
sending officials to England to recruit appropriate town planners and architects for,Paragraph
"Chandigarh. However, Nehru quickly vetoed this idea, saying, “There is too great a",Paragraph
tendency for our people to rush up to England and America for advice. The average,Paragraph
American or English town-planner will probably not know the social background of,Paragraph
India. He will therefore be inclined to plan something which might suit England or,Paragraph
"America, but not so much India” (Kalia, 1987).",Paragraph
"Instead, Nehru suggested Albert Mayer for the job. Mayer was an American town",Paragraph
planner who had been strongly influenced by Lewis Mumford and Clarence Stein and,Paragraph
who had been working on an innovative pilot project for rural development in the state of,Paragraph
Uttar Pradesh and the urban development plan of greater Bombay. Although his ideas,Paragraph
"were quite close to those of the Garden City movement, he had made considerable effort",Paragraph
to ensure that there was effective citizen participation in the design process based on the,Paragraph
"principle of what Mayer called “inner democratization.” Nehru, attracted by Mayer’s",Paragraph
"modern ideals and innovative practice, maintained friendly relations with him.",Paragraph
"Mayer accepted the commission and began work on Chandigarh early in 1950, along",Paragraph
"with four (non-Indian) associates: Julian Whittlesey, Milton Glass, Clarence Stein, and",Paragraph
Matthew Nowicki (a Siberian trained in Warsaw who joined the work on Stein’s,Paragraph
recommendation). The idea was that this team of architects would direct and supervise,Paragraph
the work of a group of Indian architects who could continue the job after their departure.,Paragraph
This apprenticeship model was carried through the remainder of the project.,Paragraph
Mayer’s plan centered around the basic unit of a superblock that would serve the daily,Paragraph
"needs of a community with amenities such as markets and schools. A larger, three-block",Paragraph
"unit that he called the Urban Village was to house a theater, hospital, meeting hall, and",Paragraph
"additional shopping facilities. The Urban Villages were organized in a gridlike pattern,",Paragraph
although the main streets in Mayer’s plan were allowed to follow the natural topography,Paragraph
and thus broke from the geometric rigidity of the grid.,Paragraph
"With the institutional campuses of the government and Punjab University at the north,",Paragraph
the city plan widened out in a triangular shape toward the south. A large business district,Paragraph
"was sited at the center of the city, and an industrial site was proposed at the southeast",Paragraph
corner of the plan. Mayer’s plan accounted for a future phase of southward expansion,Paragraph
"that could bring the town’s projected population from 150,000 to 500,000. Architectural",Paragraph
"designs, including sketches and standards for the capitol complex, the commercial",Paragraph
"buildings (bazaars), and much of the housing, were taken on by Nowicki, who was",Paragraph
largely responsible for envisioning the details that would determine the quality of life in,Paragraph
Chandigarh. Nowicki’s hand is also evident in a proposed continuous park system that,Paragraph
linked the various parts of the city.,Paragraph
"Following Nowicki’s tragic and unexpected death in a plane crash on 31 August 1950,",Paragraph
progress on the project was deterred by Mayer’s increasing communication difficulties,Paragraph
"with the Indian bureaucracy. As a consequence, Punjabi state officials began a search for",Paragraph
a new architect that resulted in the selection of the professional with whom the project is,Paragraph
"most often associated: Swiss-French modern architect Le Corbusier, who viewed",Paragraph
Chandigarh as the superlative opportunity to model his theories on town planning in a,Paragraph
manner more befitting his conception of the true potential and purpose of modern,Paragraph
"civilization. Modern Western civilization, according to Le Corbusier, had lost contact",Paragraph
"with the “essential joys” of life in its clamor for money. In India, with its rural and",Paragraph
"primitivistic way of life, Le Corbusier saw the potential of a civilization that was still in",Paragraph
touch with these atavistic desires but had as yet to advance into modernity.,Paragraph
Le Corbusier’s enchantment with this “humane and profound civilization” only served,Paragraph
to reassure him of the veracity of his vision for a true modernism. There seemed to be a,Paragraph
"vindication at hand, and Le Corbusier set to work at the task of upgrading India to what",Paragraph
"he described “the second era of mechanization” (quoted in Sarin, 1982)",Paragraph
Le Corbusier redesigned the Mayer master plan; what had been named an Urban,Paragraph
"Village in Mayer’s plan, Le Corbusier renamed a “sector.” Each sector featured a green",Paragraph
"strip running north to south, bisected by a commercial road running east to west. Le",Paragraph
Corbusier’s plan comprised a smaller area than Mayer’s (5380 acres versus 6908 acres),Paragraph
"reorganized into a more rationalized, orthogonal order and rectangular shape. A light",Paragraph
"industrial zone was planned at the eastern limit of the city, with an educational zone on",Paragraph
the western. Le Corbusier’s strategy for organizing the city in the modular mode,Paragraph
stemmed from his view of the city as a living organism. Well-defined cellular,Paragraph
"organization predicted orderly growth, with the unencumbered flow of traffic acting as",Paragraph
vital circulation to link the city’s head (the government complex) to its heart (the central,Paragraph
commercial sector) and to its various extremities.,Paragraph
"In the end, Le Corbusier was responsible only for the overall master plan of",Paragraph
Chandigarh and almost nothing of the city itself. He prepared the guidelines for the,Paragraph
"commercial center, and in an adjoining sector he designed a museum and a school of art.",Paragraph
The majority of the buildings within the city (other than those developed privately) were,Paragraph
"designed by Jeanneret, Fry, and Drew, with assistance from their Indian team. Housing",Paragraph
designs for sectors 22 and 23 were the first to be developed. As most of Chandigarh’s,Paragraph
"original housing was intended for government employees, it was decided that the housing",Paragraph
costs would be determined by a set percentage of a government employee’s income.,Paragraph
"Jeanneret, Fry, and Drew devised 13 (later 14) “types” of housing based on a spectrum of",Paragraph
incomes from employees earning less than Rs. 50 per month to the chief minister. Each,Paragraph
design was given a designation with a number (denoting the economic sector for which it,Paragraph
"was envisioned) paired with a letter (indicating the architect who designed it), type 13J or",Paragraph
"14M, for example. All the designs were visibly “modern,” exhibiting unornamented stark",Paragraph
"geometries broken only by sunscreening devices, such as deep overhangs and recesses,",Paragraph
"perforated screens, and open verandas. There was even a “frame-control” system devised",Paragraph
to regulate all the construction that was privately developed.,Paragraph
Chandigarh’s more adolescent years have been burdened by the onus of carrying out,Paragraph
the idealistic and formalistic vision on whic!,Title
h the city was founded while dealing with the,Paragraph
"massive housing and economic problems that are, in part, the legacy of this vision. It is",Paragraph
one of the ironies of history that Chandigar],Paragraph
the center of a political divide. Punjab was,Paragraph
"h, born of a partition, once again found itself",Paragraph
"further partitioned in 1965, creating the new",Paragraph
"state of Haryana. At that point, Chandigarh acquired the unique status of a centrally",Paragraph
administered “Union Territory’ while also,Paragraph
Haryana. This was accompanied by the,Paragraph
functioning as the capital of both Punjab and,Paragraph
redrawing and reduction of the municipal,Title
boundary of the city and the location of Chandigarh right at the line of division.,Paragraph
"This repartition resulted in the establishment and growth of “satellite” towns,",Paragraph
"bordering Chandigarh but legally in Punjab and Haryana. Now, “greater Chandigarh,”",Paragraph
"originally designed for a population of 800,000, is approaching the one million mark.",Paragraph
Although efforts are under way to increase the density of the city and to accommodate,Paragraph
"the changes, the most glaring omission of the city’s “master plan” continues to be",Paragraph
neglected by its new development plans. There is still no comprehensive plan to integrate,Paragraph
"the poorest dispossessed people, who form almost 20 percent of the city’s population and",Paragraph
"cater to most of its service needs, into the urban fabric. They continue to live in illegal,",Paragraph
substandard slums along the edges of the city.,Paragraph
"In its ideological purity, Chandigarh belongs to the roster of cities such as Canberra,",Paragraph
"Brasilia, and Islamabad, pregnant with the brazen optimism of their time. Brought to life",Paragraph
"and now aging, it is one of the rare events of our modern era that, in its unadulterated",Paragraph

London’s Channel 4 was founded in 1982 primarily to commission and air programs,Paragraph

"compete with large corporations, such as the BBC. By the late 1980s, the company",Paragraph
employed more than 500 people whose offices were dispersed among several buildings in,Paragraph
Bloomsbury. In 1990 the station decided to move to a single building that could handle,Paragraph
"the large number of employees as well as the channel’s changing technological needs,",Paragraph
"brought about by its shift to digital broadcasting. Richard Rogers Partnership, a London",Paragraph
"firm, won the commission, and the resulting design, with its sense of openness and",Paragraph
"references to modern media technology, fit the image of a company known for its",Paragraph
"progressive, sometimes radical, programming.",Paragraph
"The building is situated on a corner lot in Westminster, midway between the Houses",Paragraph
"of Parliament and Victoria Station. Targeted for housing, the site became available when",Paragraph
"the developer went bankrupt, and the borough of Westminster approved the use of the",Paragraph
site by Channel 4 as long as the scheme included a certain number of residential flats.,Paragraph
"The competition brief also stipulated other requirements, such as 15,000 square meters of",Paragraph
"flexible office space, conference rooms, viewing and editing rooms, an underground",Paragraph
"parking garage, and a public garden.",Paragraph
The site plan consists of four rectangular blocks that surround a central,Paragraph
landscaped garden. The southern and eastern wings—designed by Lyons,Caption
"Sleeman and Hoare, not Rogers—are the required residential blocks,",Paragraph
consisting of 100 apartments. Rogers’s input on the design of the flats was,Paragraph

"containing the main entrance, accessible once one walks up a stepped ramp that leads",Paragraph
"from the street through a paved piazza. A lightweight glass bridge, covered by a steel-",Paragraph
"and-glass canopy, allows the visitor to peer down into the station’s underground quarters.",Paragraph
The basement space is a vestige of an earlier building whose construction had begun in,Paragraph
the 1970s but had never been completed. The entrance facade is flanked by a tall vertical,Paragraph
"tower, topped by television antennae and containing the building’s utilities as well as the",Paragraph
"elevators, whose movements are visible from the street.",Paragraph
"On entering the curved reception area that links the two wings, one can see past it to a",Paragraph
"glass-walled public restaurant, several steps down from the entranceway. The open",Paragraph
design—penetrated by red steel supports for the entrance canopy—allows the visitor,Paragraph
immediately to see all the way through to the central garden area that lies behind the,Paragraph
building. The steel cables and rods that support the curving glass entrance wall are,Paragraph
slender yet clearly visible in the central atrium of the building. The upper floor of the,Paragraph
concave portion of the building contains sliding-glass doors that lead from executive,Caption
offices to a terrace that offers views to the garden below and overlooks the surrounding,Paragraph

"complementing the evident vertical movements of the lifts, both of which are meant to",Paragraph
"expose and highlight the constant activity and energy of the building’s users. Second,",Paragraph
Rogers’s extensive use of glass walls in the Channel 4 Headquarters reveals his interest in,Paragraph
"transparency—the glazed entrance wall, for example, functions as a screen through which",Paragraph
the visitor can see a series of windowed walls and glass blocks. The view is one of an,Paragraph
overlapping sequence of metal and glass that continues until the eye is led through the,Paragraph
final glazed wall of the ground-floor restaurant. Rogers intended the visitor to be drawn,Caption
toward the building by noting the dynamism of its moving elements (such as the,Paragraph
elevators) from afar and then visually to peel away each layer and each successive screen,Paragraph
by moving through the building. The use of materials that appear light allows for,Paragraph
"complex, interpenetrating layers while still maximizing the views through and out of the",Paragraph
building. The visual lightness was also meant to reduce the effect of a large office,Paragraph
building’s being placed in an already dense area of the city.,Paragraph
"The obvious precedent, both aesthetically and conceptually, for the Channel 4",Paragraph

Le Corbusier’s Chapel of Notre-Dame-du-Haut (1956) stands on a hill overlooking the,Paragraph
"village of Ronchamp, France, just miles from the Swiss border. A pilgrimage site since",Paragraph

one of the masterpieces of modern architecture and a landmark work in Le Corbusier’s,Paragraph
"formidable oeuvre, the building’s peaceful hilltop setting belies a controversial history.",Paragraph
The courting of Le Corbusier (born Charles-Edouard Jeanneret in 1887) began in early,Paragraph
"1950, when the task of rebuilding what remained of a war-wrecked chapel on Bourlémont",Paragraph
hill was designated to La Société Immobliére (development corporation) de Notre-Dame-,Paragraph
du-Haut. The corporation’s original intention was to restore what remained of the,Paragraph
"existing chapel, which had been destroyed by German bombing in 1944. After reviewing",Paragraph
"the costs of restoration, however, it became clear to members of the corporation that",Paragraph
"complete reconstruction was a more sound decision. In need of an architect, the group",Paragraph
"turned to the Commission d’Art Sacré, the body of the French Church that made such",Paragraph
"recommendations, and specifically to two local members of the commission—Canon",Paragraph
Ledeur of Besancon (the commission’s secretary) and Frangois Mathey—for suggestions,Paragraph
on whom best to solicit for the new design. There was little doubt that they would,Paragraph
nominate Le Corbusier.,Paragraph
"Skeptical about a project for the Catholic Church, Le Corbusier, who was raised a",Paragraph
"Protestant, initially refused the offer to submit drawings for the chapel. Just a few months",Paragraph
"earlier, his design for a subterranean basilica at Sainte-Baume had been rejected, and it",Paragraph
was no secret that the architect remained bitter about what he perceived as the Church’s,Paragraph
"lack of vision. However, his interest was piqued on learning more about Ronchamp. The",Paragraph
hilltop had been home to a third-century B.C. pagan temple and a number of different,Paragraph
"structures dating as far back as the l4th century A.D., when church records reveal",Paragraph
"worshipers first flocking to the site. Informed of the sanctity of the spot, Le Corbusier",Paragraph
made his first visit to Ronchamp in June 1950. After many hours spent walking and,Paragraph
"sketching the hillside, the concept of building on the significant site became more",Paragraph
"appealing, and the architect began to reconsider.",Paragraph
"It was undoubtedly the support and friendship of Ledeur, Mathey, and their colleague",Paragraph
clergyman Pierre Marie Alain Couturier that led Le Corbusier to accept the commission,Paragraph
and allowed him to carry out the controversial design. All three were leaders of a,Paragraph
movement that aimed to revive the French Church through the application of,Paragraph
"contemporary art and architecture. Together, the trio offered Le Corbusier free rein, and,",Paragraph
"not surprisingly, Le Corbusier found it impossible to refuse.",Paragraph
The commission left him with a singular opportunity to manifest his belief in the,Paragraph
integral relationship between architecture and nature and between nature and religious,Title
"experience. His career and reputation established, the decision to accept the job was also",Paragraph
in keeping with a resolution to take on only work with a personal resonance. The project,Paragraph
at Ronchamp satisfied the architect on all counts.,Paragraph
"The construction of Notre-Dame-du-Haut began in 1953, after the Besancon",Paragraph
Commission d’Art Sacré approved a refined scheme for the building. The building was,Paragraph
constructed of walls of sprayed untreated concrete ( or ) and whitewashed with a coat of,Paragraph
"plaster to leave a rough surface. In fact, the use of concrete was as much a pragmatic",Paragraph

"chapel for 10,000 worshipers, the focal point of the annual pilgrimage masses at the",Paragraph
hilltop.,Paragraph
"The west facade, the only blind facade on the building, features a double-barrel gutter",Caption

program given to the architect by the parish). The rain pool contains three pyramids and a,Paragraph
"cylinder, all in —a sculptural composition vaguely reminiscent of Le Corbusier’s roof",Paragraph
garden for the Marseilles Unite d’Habitation (1947-53). These geometric elements,Paragraph

"Punched through the wall’s thick membrane, clear windows offer a blurred view of the",Paragraph
"landscape beyond, painted panes pay tribute to the Virgin Mary, and colored glass filters",Paragraph
light throughout the central space. Le Corbusier relieved the weight of the roof on the,Paragraph
interior by separating the south and east walls from the ceiling with a narrow strip of,Paragraph

additional spaces for private services. All are placed in the bases of the chapel’s,Paragraph
periscope-like towers and benefit from the dramatically filtered light that pours down the,Paragraph
towers’ shafts.,Paragraph
Le Corbusier conceived of Ronchamp as a three-dimensional work of sculpture to be,Paragraph
viewed from all sides and intended visitors to follow what he described as a “promenade,Paragraph
"architecturale” in order to capture a series of ""événements plastiques” (plastic events)",Paragraph
when approaching the building and entering its spaces. Le Corbusier’s concept of,Paragraph
architectural procession was clearly influenced by the architecture of the ancient Greeks,Paragraph

CHICAGO SCHOOL,Title
"Named for the city in which it materialized and flourished, the Chicago School of",Paragraph
skyscraper design marked the emergence of the first truly American style of architecture.,Paragraph
A concern for the economic use of materials in a speculative environment resulted in a,Paragraph
"radically new solution for the high-rise building, quite removed from the historicism and",Paragraph
"eclecticism of the past. Beginning in the mid-1870s and peaking in the early 1900s, the",Paragraph
"skyline of Chicago underwent an amazing transformation, evoking the “Brown City”",Paragraph
designation made so famous in the critical work by Lewis Mumford. The so-called death,Paragraph
of the Chicago School style in 1922 resulted in part from the ever-increasing popularity,Paragraph
"of the White City and coincided with the Chicago Tribune Tower Competition. Yet, with",Paragraph
the 1938 arrival of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe at the Armour Institute of Technology,Paragraph
"(later renamed Illinois Institute of Technology), a so-called Second Chicago School of",Paragraph
architecture emerged. This synthesis of late 19th-century structural efficiency and mid-,Paragraph
20th-century materials demonstrated the long-ranging contributions of Chicago School,Paragraph
"architects, such as Louis Sullivan, on skyscraper design and modern architecture as a",Paragraph
whole.,Paragraph
"In 1871 the Great Fire decimated the central business district in Chicago, destroying",Paragraph
"18,000 buildings and causing over $200 million in property damage. An area four miles",Paragraph
"long and nearly three-quarters of a mile wide was affected. Yet from this devastating loss,",Paragraph
"Chicago arose like a phoenix, reborn from the ashes, as speculators funded an enormous",Paragraph
amount of commercial highrise building. Their desire for economical and functional,Paragraph
buildings contributed nearly as much to the aesthetic of the Chicago School as did the,Paragraph
architects who flooded there seeking to define the skyscraper. The primary characteristics,Paragraph
of the late 19th-century Chicago School included the economic use of and,Paragraph
"experimentation with modern materials, resulting in little applied ornamentation and a",Paragraph
greater use of large glass windows.,Paragraph
"As is the case in many urban centers, tremendous land costs made it desirable to build",Paragraph
tall and to build in a very concentrated area. Architects responded to the challenges,Paragraph
"presented by speculators. In order to reap the greatest profit from their investment,",Paragraph
"investors required maximum profitability from the interior space, so high-rent offices",Paragraph
with windows providing adequate natural lighting were preferred. The Chicago window,Paragraph
was developed and was repeated across the wall surfaces: a large central pane flanked on,Paragraph
"either side by narrow, movable sash windows. In addition, as dictated by the building",Caption
"plots and in the desire for greater interior light, Chicago School skyscrapers tended to be",Paragraph
either tall and narrow or to possess a U-shaped light court. Steel-cage construction,Paragraph
"provided far greater fire protection than wrought- or cast-iron framing, a concern in a city",Paragraph
that had so recently suffered a catastrophic fire. The uniformity of the steelframe grid,Paragraph
"improved construction time and aided in the ease of erection, yet the sodden soil",Paragraph
demanded the use of caisson foundations and limited the heights to which architects,Paragraph
could build. Masonry or terra-cotta encased the steel frame not only to express it clearly,Paragraph
"but also to provide fireproofing. With restrictive budgets, speculators, such as the Brooks",Paragraph
"brothers of Boston, also frowned on excessive and expensive ornamentation.",Paragraph
Most discussions of the Chicago School have emphasized the lack of exterior,Paragraph
"ornamentation and have focused on the aesthetics of form. This is not entirely the case, as",Paragraph
recent scholars such as Bruegmann and Willis have argued. Speculators were willing to,Paragraph
"pay for some degree of ornamentation if it appealed to prospective renters. Thus,",Paragraph
"embellishments commonly appeared in lobbies or in courtyards, anywhere easily visible.",Paragraph
"However, the overt large-scale application of historicism did not seem appropriate,",Paragraph

"Asiatic Bank, completed in 1901 and designed by H. Becker. This was the first building",Paragraph
"in China to be constructed with reinforced-concrete, equipped with modern conveniences",Paragraph

been the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank building designed by British architects Palmer,Caption
and Turner and completed in 1923. This seven-storied steel-framed building was,Paragraph
decorated in the neoclassical style surmounted by an imposing dome.,Paragraph
"Apart from these buildings that are shadows of their European prototypes,",Paragraph
ecclectic-style buildings mixing traditional Chinese architecture with the,Paragraph
Western style were also attempted. The earliest example in this style is the,Paragraph
"Peking Union Medical College in Beijing, designed by Harry Hussey",Caption
between 1916 and 1918. The scale and proportion of these buildings are,Paragraph
"clearly Western classical in inspiration, whereas the details and the",Paragraph
gigantic roof are Chinese. Many foreign architects adopted this style for,Paragraph
"residences, churches, and colleges, among whom the most accomplished",Paragraph
"was American architect Henry K.Murphy (1877-1954), who completed",Paragraph
many university campus projects in what he called “Adaptive Chinese,Paragraph
"Renaissance” style (Cody, 1989).",Paragraph
1929-49,Title
This period of modernist nationalism in architecture is significant in the development of,Paragraph
20th-century Chinese architecture in that many Chinese architects trained abroad returned,Paragraph
to make important contributions to the architectural scene. Among these were Zhuang,Paragraph
"Jun, who returned from the University of Illinois, Urbana, in 1914; Liu Dunzhen returned",Paragraph
"from Japan in 1923; and Yang Tingbao, Tong Jun, and Liang Sicheng all graduated from",Paragraph
the University of Pennsylvania and returned to China between 1927 and 1930. These,Paragraph
"architects either taught in the first architectural schools in China, worked for foreign",Paragraph
"architects in China, or formed partnerships in private practice. Their monumental designs",Paragraph
with minimal decorations were a direct result from their monumental training in the,Paragraph
Beaux-Arts tradition in the West. In this they followed the Hungarian architect L.E.,Paragraph
"Hudec, whose modernist architecture was first seen in a church completed in 1925 and",Paragraph
"some residences. The Chinese architects were increasingly given major commissions,",Paragraph
"such as government buildings, banks, hotels, commercial buildings, and academic",Paragraph
buildings. Some high-rise buildings along the Shanghai Bund are also modernist in spirit.,Paragraph
Chinese architects influenced by the Bauhaus also designed buildings with clean lines,Paragraph
and devoid of decorations.,Paragraph
The other architectural style seen in this period was developed from the,Paragraph
Chinese ecclectic style of the foreign architects working for foreign,Title
"missions. With the Chinese style roof as the prominent feature of the style,",Paragraph
it was considered as a national style promoted heavily by the newly,Paragraph
formed national government at the end of the 1920s. Many government,Paragraph
"buildings were constructed in this style in the new capital, Nanjing",Paragraph
(designated in 1927 and the planning of which was undertaken by Henry,Paragraph
"Murphy). In 1929 a competition for the mausoleum for Sun Yat-sen, the",Paragraph
"father of nationalistic China, was organized, and the brief clearly asked for",Paragraph
a nationalistic style. The winning design submitted by Lu Yanzhi displays,Paragraph
a symmetrical monumentality based on the Lincoln Memorial while,Paragraph
"incorporating distinctive Chinese elements, including the roof, bracket",Paragraph
"system, window surrounds, and decorative architrave. Just as the foreign",Paragraph
"architects saw in the style the representation of Chinese tradition, the",Paragraph
"government used the style for nation building. However, the style was",Paragraph
increasingly criticized by the advocates of the Modern movement for,Paragraph
being wasteful in material and for not representing the spirit of the modern,Paragraph
society China was moving toward. Heated debates were fully argued in,Paragraph
"architectural journals for many years in the 1930s, only to be abruptly cut",Paragraph
due to the Japanese occupation of eastern China between 1937 and 1945.,Paragraph
1949-79,Title
"After the setting up of the People’s Republic of China, institutional buildings were",Paragraph
"designed following closely the Russian Monumental style. Between 1949 and 1957,",Paragraph
Russian experts helped in building the new China by promoting the principle of,Paragraph
neoclassicist monumentality with Chinese characteristics. Together with the first Five-,Paragraph
"year Plan, many new functionalistic buildings were constructed for the new social order.",Paragraph
"Invariably, these buildings are symmetrical both on the facade and in the internal layout.",Paragraph
Over the central entrance is usually a high tower. This form had a long-lasting influence,Paragraph
"on the modern Chinese architectural style right through to the end of the century, due",Paragraph
partly to the influence of the centralizing symmetry of traditional Chinese architecture.,Paragraph
Two good examples are the Sovietdesigned Beijing and Shanghai Exhibition Halls of,Paragraph
1954.,Paragraph
With the Communist rule also came the reform of architectural practice.,Paragraph
Replacing the private architectural and engineering offices were many,Paragraph
"state-owned design institutes, which are comprehensive professional",Paragraph
"offices surviving to this day (Lin, 1988). At the end of the 1950s, Russian",Paragraph
"experts were expelled from China, and the leading design principle",Paragraph
"adopted was essentially nationalistic. However, unlike the earlier Chinese",Paragraph
"Renaissance style of foreign architects or the national style of the 1930s,",Paragraph
"the nationalistic style of this period was much restrained, using less of the",Paragraph
massive tiled roof and relying more on minor traditional decorative,Paragraph
elements. The ten major projects to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the,Paragraph
founding of the People’s Republic are important examples of this style.,Paragraph
"Completed in 1959, some of these buildings are located at the heart of",Paragraph
"Beijing, such as the Great Hall of the People (Zhao Dongri) and the",Paragraph
Revolutionary and History Museum (Zhang Kaiji). And others served,Paragraph
"important political and infrastructure functions, such as the Cultural Palace",Paragraph
of Nationalities (Zhang Bo) and the Beijing Railway Station (Chen,Paragraph
Dengao). Other examples of this nationalistic style can be seen in other,Paragraph
"parts of the country, such as the Great Hall of the People in Chongqing",Paragraph
"(Zhang Jiade, 1954). Soon after the tenth anniversary, the country was",Paragraph
thrown into turmoil again with many political movements culminating in,Paragraph
the Cultural Revolution—all normal social activities stopped until 1976.,Paragraph
"However, there were also pragmatic functionalist buildings constructed",Paragraph
"even in this period, such as the extension to the Beijing Hotel (Dai Nianci,",Paragraph
1974).,Paragraph
1979-2000,Title
"With the liberalization of the Chinese economy in 1979, the nationalistic style continued",Paragraph
to be adopted only for political purposes during this period of internationalization. This is,Paragraph
"particularly apparent in buildings along the main east-west boulevard of Beijing,",Paragraph
"Chang’an Jie, which are required by city officials to adopt national characteristics in their",Paragraph
form. This is accomplished by adding small Chinese pavilions on otherwise multistoried,Paragraph
"modern buildings. However, there was also more genuine integration of the two forms,",Paragraph
"such as the Beijing Library (Yang Yun, 1987), the Beijing West Railway Station (Zhu",Paragraph
"Jialu, 1996), and the Peking University Library (Guan Shaoye, 1998). In these attempts",Paragraph
"large tiled roofs appeared again on top of tall buildings, much like the examples from the",Paragraph
1920s. The search for a new Chinese architecture had found a new interpretation in the,Paragraph
Fragrant Hill Hotel completed in 1982. In it LM.Pei used traditional elements from,Paragraph
"southern China, such as diagonal windows and whitewashed walls, integrated in modern",Paragraph
and yet distinctive Chinese spaces. Similar examples designed by Chinese architects,Paragraph
"include the Queli Hotel in Qufu (Dai Nianci, 1984) and a housing design in Ju’er Hutong",Paragraph
"in Beijing (Wu Liangyong, 1990).",Paragraph
"However, the most significant development of the period was the return of foreign",Paragraph
architects to the Chinese architectural scene in the last two decades of the century. They,Paragraph
were involved in joint ventures with local design institutes in the design of new hotels,Paragraph
"operated by major Western hotel chains, such as the Beijing Jianguo Hotel (1982), the",Paragraph
"Great Wall Sheraton of Beijing (1983), the Nanjing Jinling Hotel (1983), and the Crystal",Paragraph
Palace Hotel (1987). These buildings served important purposes of introducing the,Paragraph
"International Style and modern construction technology to China, rapidly updating China",Paragraph
from its 20-year isolation from the rest of the world. In the 1990s other commercial and,Paragraph
cultural projects also benefited from international designers. These included the Beijing,Paragraph
"Chinese-Japanese Youth Center (Kisho Kurokawa, 1990), the Shanghai Center (John",Caption
"Portman and Associates, 1990), the Shanghai Grand Theater (Arte Jean Marie",Paragraph
"Charpentier and Associates, 1998), the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China",Paragraph
"Building, Beijing (Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, 1998), and the Bank of China, Beijing",Caption
"(I.M.Pei and Partners, 1999). Some of these were the first facilities built to international",Paragraph
standards in China. The Shanghai Grand Theater has successfully utilized the curtain wall,Paragraph
both as a symbol of modernization in the day and a bright jewel at night. The curved roof,Paragraph
soaring into the sky is reminiscent of the traditional curved roof of south China and is a,Paragraph
source of inspiration for many buildings in China. Although some architects were,Paragraph
"particularly sensitive to the local context, the majority designed massive curtain-wall",Paragraph
"buildings totally out of context with the surroundings. Sadly, these buildings became the",Paragraph
icons of modernization and were copied all over China in a lesssatisfactory manner.,Paragraph
"With the development of Pudong district in Shanghai, imposing skyscrapers, unseen",Paragraph
"before in China, started to dominate the generally flat skyline. The two most notable",Paragraph
"examples from this district are the 421-meter-tall Jin Mao Building (Skidmore, Owings",Paragraph
"and Merrill, 1998) and the 460-meter World Financial Center (KPF Associates, 2000).",Paragraph
"These projects were mainly won in an international competition, which was becoming the",Paragraph
norm for larger and joint-venture projects in the late 1990s. The foreign designers of,Paragraph
these projects were clearly sensitive to the Chinese tradition within which the buildings,Paragraph
"are located. They often incorporated Chinese elements, motifs, or symbolism in their",Paragraph
"design. For example, the tallest building in China, the Jin Mau Building, was conceived",Paragraph
"as a Chinese pagoda with a shimmering curtain wall, whereas the Word Financial Center",Paragraph
was designed to invoke the Chinese conception of the heaven as round and the earth as,Paragraph
square.,Paragraph
"Other than the nationalistic and International Styles, there are Chinese architects who",Paragraph
boldly attempt architectural symbolism in building form. The Shanghai Museum is,Paragraph
"designed in the shape of an ancient bronze cauldron (Xing Tonghe, 1996), and the",Paragraph
Memorial to the Victims of Japanese Massacre used a stark granite surface and dry,Paragraph
"landscape to evoke the extreme horror of the massacre (Qi Kang, 1985). However, the",Paragraph
most controversial project that epitomizes the tension between internationalism and,Paragraph
nationalism in architecture is the winning entry of the design competition for the National,Paragraph
Grand Theater of China in Beijing. The design of Paul Andreu consists of a gigantic glass,Caption
dome covering three separate theater structures. Located next to the Great Hall of the,Caption
"People, the heart of political China, this project has generated heated debates in the local",Paragraph
architectural community and was put on hold in 2000. The stark contrast of the,Paragraph
ultramodern structure with nationalistic architecture at such an important site and the,Paragraph
cultural symbolism of the glass dome are two major objections to the scheme. On the,Paragraph
other hand the supporters argue that China needs national icons of this sort to launch,Paragraph
itself into the new millennium. This is perhaps a clear indication that Chinese architecture,Paragraph
was standing at the crossroad at the end of the century. The desperate search for a,Paragraph
"Chinese identity has so far yielded no satisfactory answer. In the meantime, the pressure",Paragraph
of commercial development has produced two extremes: well-conceived buildings,Paragraph
"designed by international offices and big design institutes in major cities, and mediocre",Paragraph
buildings by the thousands all over the vast country.,Paragraph

The term “church” refers both to the Christian congregational body and to the buildings,Paragraph
in which public Christian worship takes place. Although churches share with secular sites,Paragraph
"functional attributes common to all types of built structures, they also are endowed with",Paragraph
symbolic meanings consonant with their purpose as sites of sacred ritual. Because,Paragraph
"international modernism, which dominated the middle years of the 20th century, was",Paragraph
"selfreferential, antiemblematic, and ahistorical in character, its practitioners sought new",Paragraph
"ways to express sacredness using space and light, with traditional forms reduced to subtle",Paragraph
"references. Since the 1960s, however, symbolism has been recognized as implicit in all",Paragraph
"architecture, countering the tendency Pier Luigi Nervi saw to “reduce the ‘house of God’s",Paragraph
"people’ to a cold compound of human functions” (Bozzo, 1990).",Paragraph
"Representations of sacredness respond to a number of different factors, including",Paragraph
"ritual practice and conventional signification. Many forms are ancient in origin, dating",Paragraph
"from the third century A.D., when public Christian observance first became legal under",Paragraph
the Romans. Early Christians adopted the basilica from Greek and Roman courts of,Paragraph
justice; the longitudinal interiors lit by a clerestory were ideal for congregational,Paragraph
"assembly. The introduction of transepts gave rise to the Latin-cross plan, seen as an",Paragraph
"emblem of that most fundamental of all Christian symbols. The Gothic rib vault,",Paragraph
"perfected in the Ile de France in the 12th century, then elevated the basilica to the status",Paragraph
"of quintessential Christian representation, because the Church of Rome was at the height",Paragraph
of its influence across Europe. Not only did the basilican or processional plan continue to,Paragraph
"hold significance into the modern era, but also as recently as the early 20th century,",Paragraph
Gothic churches still were being built in the traditional manner.,Paragraph
Centralized plans based on Roman tombs and Greek treasure houses were reserved for,Paragraph
"baptisteries and . During the Renaissance, however, both centralized and Greek-cross",Paragraph
"plans enjoyed a wider use, because neo-Platonic aesthetics influenced architects to look",Paragraph
on these forms as symbols of divine perfection. It was only in the wake of the,Paragraph
Reformation that the Church of Rome decreed a return to more conventional sacred,Paragraph
expression to articulate its opposition to dissent.,Paragraph

CHURCH ON THE WATER,Title
"Designed by Tadao Ando; completed 1988 Hokkaido, Japan",Caption
Tadao Ando’s Church on the Water (1988) signaled a critical shift in the designer’s,Paragraph
approach and for that reason was widely heralded in the international press. Ando’s,Paragraph
earlier residential works were structured private domains that were isolated from their,Paragraph
"surrounding urban contexts. The chapel, however, was a communal building designed for",Paragraph
"an idealized landscape, Ando’s response to an earlier chapel on Mount Rokko (1986),",Paragraph
rather than for a specific site or client. This is why published presentation drawings do,Paragraph
"not reflect the realities of the site, a point that would be otherwise odd, considering the",Paragraph
importance of nature in the design. It is also the reason that such a long period passed,Paragraph
between the building’s design in 1985 and its construction in Hokkaido in 1988.,Paragraph
"In the Church on the Water, nature becomes an active force. The sanctuary is",Paragraph
"essentially an open-ended shallow box, overwhelmed by a flat artificial pool. When the",Paragraph
"only separation between the two territories, a large glass wall, is rolled to the side, it",Paragraph
"erases any distinction between interior and exterior. Notably, this is also the only one of",Paragraph
"Ando’s churches in which the altar area is depressed rather than raised, a gesture that",Paragraph
increases the sense of spatial continuity and that is echoed in shallow terraces in the pond.,Paragraph
"In the 1986 essay “Mutual Independence, Mutual Interpenetration,” Ando wrote,",Paragraph
"“Within a site, architecture tries to dominate emptiness, but at the same time emptiness",Paragraph
"dominates the architecture. If a building is to be autonomous and have its own character,",Paragraph
not only the building but the emptiness itself must have its own logic.” There are clear,Paragraph
parallels between Martin Heidegger and Eastern thought that make it difficult to,Paragraph
"determine the roots of Ando’s phenomenology, but this character of nothingness, found",Paragraph
"in the blank pool, holds an important place in both philosophical systems. It is not God",Paragraph
"but, rather, man in nature that is the focus of this chapel. As Ando declared, “To",Paragraph
"experience God in this natural setting, perhaps, is to experience the encounter with one’s",Paragraph
"own spirit” (Ando, 1989). Elsewhere, Ando goes further: “For me, the nature that a",Paragraph
"sacred space must relate to is man-made, or rather an architecturalized nature. I believe",Paragraph
"that when greenery, water, light or wind is abstracted from nature-as-is according to",Paragraph
"man’s will, it approaches the sacred” (Ando, 1991).",Paragraph
The building was intended not as a religious structure but simply as a commercial,Paragraph
chapel for wedding services. In a country where only an infinitesimal percentage of the,Paragraph
"population is Christian, the fashion of having “Christian” weddings is merely a reflection",Paragraph
"of Westernization. Thus, many of the conventional accoutrements of a church are",Paragraph
"unnecessary, in keeping with Ando’s characteristic ascetic minimalism. With economic",Paragraph
"pros-perity in the 1980s, young Japanese also embraced the larger Christian wedding",Paragraph
"ceremony as an opportunity for display. As a result, Ando’s wedding chapels share with",Paragraph
several other projects from the 1980s an irony: although he established a critical attitude,Paragraph
"in opposition to the comfort and decorative tendencies in architecture of the period, his",Paragraph
works were embraced by the very consumer culture he denounced.,Paragraph
Some critics have implied that this was merely a “radical chic” gesture by fashionable,Paragraph
"Japanese, but it is worth noting that Ando’s work was also compatible with a narcissism",Paragraph
"characteristic of the time. In 1986, Ando was developing a conception of space based on",Paragraph
"the physicality of the body and the use of the walls and floors as framing devices,",Paragraph
"articulated in his 1988 Englishlanguage piece “Shintai and Space.” In Japanese, the word",Paragraph
has three meanings; the most common use of the word refers to religious icons and other,Paragraph
"objects intended for worship. In addition, the word indicates one’s own body or a course",Paragraph
"of action. Had Ando used Japanese characters in writing his piece, he would have had to",Paragraph
"choose one of these meanings. In English, it was possible for him to fuse them; he",Paragraph
explains that refers not only to the body but also to “spirit and flesh” and declares that,Paragraph
the ofa site is grasped only through the .,Paragraph
It is difficult not to measure the space with one’s body. Small granite pavers in the,Caption
sanctuary are only slightly more than shoulders’ span in length. The markings of,Paragraph
"formwork on Ando’s trademark concrete walls are the size of a single bed, and because",Paragraph
"the walls of this building are almost three feet thick, the imprints of form-tie separator",Paragraph
"cones are very close together. Risers are shallow and benches low, and the chairs for the",Paragraph
"nervous bride and groom are fragile perches. Thus, despite Ando’s austere and even",Paragraph
"brutish use of unfinished concrete, the building has a delicacy and human scale.",Paragraph
Kenneth Frampton notes that the Church on the Water was “patently influenced” by,Paragraph
Kaija and Heikki Siren’s Otaniemi Chapel (1957) for the Helsinki Institute of,Caption
Technology. The building is less often considered in literature today because the concepts,Paragraph
that Ando initiated here are more skillfully carried out in subsequent works. The religious,Paragraph
implications of architecture as a site for the body in nature are more convincingly,Paragraph
executed in the later Water Temple (1992). The shallow proportions of the Church on the,Caption
"Water’s sanctuary led to Ando’s many outdoor amphitheaters, in which inconsequential",Paragraph
"stages and the lack of a backdrop make nature the real drama—including the first, the",Paragraph
"Theater on the Water (1987), planned for another site at the same Hokkaido resort. Even",Paragraph
the avatar-like cross standing in the pool and the framework of crosses on the roof of the,Paragraph
church later reemerged as freestanding colonnades forming spatial filters in Ando’s,Paragraph
works from the late 1980s.,Paragraph
Francesco Dal Co has written that Ando is “completing building after building with,Paragraph
"astonishing speed, but only able to do so by falling back on the design and conceptual",Paragraph
"procedures he had worked out in earlier researches.” In this designer’s work, it is often",Paragraph
not the variations on concepts that are of interest but their genesis. More than 15 years,Paragraph

CITY BEAUTIFUL MOVEMENT,Title
"Begun in the United States in the late 19th century, the City Beautiful movement enjoyed",Paragraph
"a relatively brief reign, fading into obscurity during the New Deal and the rise of",Paragraph
modernism. City Beautiful architects and planners sought to bring elements of city,Paragraph
"planning, architecture, and landscape architecture into a harmonious unity. It aspired to",Paragraph
"many of the principles of baroque or neoclassical city design, which had transformed the",Paragraph
medieval cores of European cities such as Rome from the reign of Pope Sixtus V in the,Paragraph
late 16th century to Paris under the prefecture of Baron Georges Eugene Haussmann in,Paragraph
the mid19th century. Equally embedded in City Beautiful was a celebration of,Paragraph
"neoclassical architecture, transplanted to American soil by architects loyal to the aesthetic",Paragraph
principles promoted by the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris.,Paragraph
"Although its intellectual seeds were sown by a handful of 19th-century figures, such as",Paragraph
"landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted and city planner Charles Mulford Robinson,",Paragraph
the possibilities of the City Beautiful ideal were most dramatically portrayed at the,Paragraph
"World’s Columbian Exposition, opening in Chicago in 1893. With Daniel H.Burnham in",Caption
"charge of the overall design and construction process, highly regarded architects such as",Paragraph
"Van Brunt and Howe; McKim, Mead and White; Peabody and Stearns; Adler and",Paragraph
Sullivan; Burling and Whitehouse; Jenny and Mundie; and Henry Ives Cobb contributed,Paragraph
"designs for individual buildings and features. Rendered in a special type of plaster, their",Paragraph
work resulted in magnificent exhibition halls designed in classical Greco-Roman and,Paragraph
Renaissance architectural styles. Olmsted’s landscaping talents infused the site plan of,Paragraph
"the fair and included a lagoon, canals, ceremonial plazas, promenades, gardens,",Paragraph
"fountains, and statuary. By the fair’s end well over 20 million people had visited and",Paragraph
retumed to their home cities and countries around the world with an idealized vision of,Paragraph
the future city. This idealized view characterized the City Beautiful movement wherever,Paragraph
"it was pursued, in small town and large city alike.",Paragraph
At its heart City Beautiful was less an aesthetic ideal and more fundamentally a,Paragraph
"concept that at that time was largely alien in North America, namely, that cities should",Paragraph
result not from random and cumulative decisions by individual architects and builders but,Paragraph
"from a holistically conceived and visually coherent plan that prescribes siting, scale, and",Paragraph
"other design principles in a rational and balanced ensemble. A bold idea, to be sure, City",Paragraph
"Beautiful arose in the context of the reformist fervor that sought to transform politics,",Paragraph
"government, and social policy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries within an orderly",Paragraph
and humanly scaled urban setting combining nature and planning.,Paragraph
"Eight years after the exposition’s close, the nation’s capital became the first U.S. city",Paragraph
to seriously pursue City Beautiful principles. As consultants to the McMillan,Paragraph
"Commission, Burnham, Olmsted, Charles F. McKim, and Augustus St. Gaudens sought to",Paragraph
restore the essence of Washington’s original 1792 plan as prepared by Pierre Charles,Paragraph
L’Enfant and refined by Andrew Ellicott. The plan resulted in the removal of railroad,Paragraph
"tracks, a polluted creek, and several buildings from the Mall. The Mall was relandscaped",Paragraph
in the tradition of French formalism. Building heights and massing were carefully,Paragraph
"limited, and structures were sited so as to enclose the Mall in a balanced and harmonious",Paragraph
"composition. Although many details have been altered, the 20th-century redevelopment",Paragraph
of the Mall and environs in central Washington has more or less embraced the spirit of,Paragraph
the McMillan Commission plan.,Paragraph
"Several other communities followed suit. For example, Virgil G.Bogue’s plan for",Paragraph
Seattle (1911) and Edward H.Bennett’s plans for Minneapolis (1917) and Denver (1917),Paragraph
"also promoted City Beautiful ideals. However, for sheer aspirations and comprehensive",Paragraph
"vision of present and future conditions, the 1909 plan of Chicago knew no equal in terms",Paragraph
of boldness and departure from the city’s 19th-century status quo. Written by Burnham,Caption
"and Bennett, the plan prescribed a great civic center plaza in the downtown, framed by",Paragraph
"federal and state buildings and a new city hall; a lakefront park, its symmetrical jetties",Paragraph
embracing a view corridor westward to the civic center; broad boulevards and diagonal,Paragraph
"avenues intersecting at magnificent circles and squares containing obelisks, columns,",Paragraph
"fountains, and decorative focal features; and carefully proportioned buildings built to",Paragraph
"uniform cornice heights. Today, in the city of skyscrapers and gridded streets, Grant",Paragraph
"Park, Wacker Drive, Michigan Avenue, and the city’s associated cultural institutions and",Paragraph
sprawling park system echo the grandiose utterances found in the plan.,Paragraph
"Beyond Chicago, fragments of City Beautiful plans appeared in other",Paragraph
cities. Burnham’s modified plan for San Francisco resulted in construction,Paragraph
"of a civic center embraced by the domed neoclassical City Hall (1915),",Paragraph
"library (1916), courthouse (1926), and other civic and government",Paragraph
"edifices. Burnham, John M. Carrére, and Arnold W.Brunner prepared",Caption

"malls were added to Indianapolis, Denver, and St. Louis, all in the early 20th century.",Paragraph

"carefully organized vistas, elevated public buildings, ceremonial boulevards, formalistic",Paragraph
"landscaping, and near uniform building heights bespeak the legacy of Burnham, Bennett,",Paragraph

CITY HALL,Title
"The city hall is an ancient building type, its origins found at least as far back as the",Paragraph
classical Greek the assembly chamber of the city-state. In medieval Europe the city hall,Paragraph
"took on a number of auxiliary spaces that complemented the council chamber, such as",Paragraph
"market halls, office spaces, and social rooms. Some, such as the Palazzo Pubblico in",Paragraph
"Siena or the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, celebrated the corporate identity of the",Paragraph
independent city with soaring towers and instructive works of art. As cities grew in size,Paragraph
"and administrative complexity, their city halls grew ever larger and assumed a",Paragraph
prominence in the urban form of their cities that rivaled only the greatest sacred edifices.,Paragraph
"By the end of the 19th century, enormous piles, such as Alfred Waterhouse’s Manchester",Paragraph
"Town Hall (1867-77) and John McArthur’s Philadelphia City Hall (1871-1901), marked",Paragraph
the seats of municipal authority with complex historical allusions and equally convoluted,Paragraph
silhouettes.,Paragraph
"At the beginning of the 20th century, it was unquestioned that a building typology as",Paragraph
representational as a city hall would be expressed in a historical style. In northern Europe,Paragraph
"this historicism often meant an investigation of medieval forms, as the type was closely",Paragraph
associated with its medieval antecedents and the National Romantic movement. Martin,Paragraph
Nyrop’s Copenhagen Town Hall (1892-1905) was the most significant example of the,Paragraph
northern European city hall and a primary inspiration for Ragnar Ostberg’s Stockholm,Paragraph
"City Hall (1911-23), which fused medieval and Renaissance detailing with an extensive",Paragraph
"art program. In more southern nations, Renaissance and baroque models were often",Paragraph
emulated. Contemporaneous city halls in the United Kingdom often interpreted the,Paragraph
baroque. A.Brumwell Thomas appropriated Wren’s vocabulary at St. Paul’s to create his,Paragraph
"grand but rather literal Belfast City Hall (1897-1906), and John Belcher’s Colchester",Paragraph
City Hall (1897-1902) did much to establish the English “free baroque.” Across the,Paragraph
"English Channel, the influential French architect and theorist Victor Laloux built several",Paragraph
city halls modeled on those of the 17th century; his (1898-1900) at Tours inspired,Paragraph
several interpretations across the Atlantic.,Paragraph
"In the United States many cities had built their city halls in the 1880s and 1890s, when",Paragraph
the Richardsonian Romanesque style suited the desirable images of permanence and,Paragraph
"monumentality. Later, the civic improvement movement known as the City Beautiful",Paragraph
encouraged many cities to build new city halls as the centerpiece of a multistructure civic,Paragraph
center modeled on the “White City” of the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in,Paragraph
Chicago. The most complete and successful of these efforts was built after the great,Paragraph
earthquake and fire of San Francisco (1906); Bakewell and Brown’s City Hall (1912-16),Caption
dominates the 15-block Civic Center with a 300-foot-high dome sometimes described as,Paragraph
a Doric fusion of those of Hardouin-Mansart and Michelangelo. The skyscraper as city,Paragraph
"hall was first executed across the bay in Oakland, California, where Palmer and",Paragraph
Hornbostel won a competition with a 14-story tower in 1911. The skyscraper idiom,Paragraph
"became more common in the 1920s and is best exemplified by Austin, Martin and",Paragraph
"Parkinson’s Los Angeles City Hall, a severe classical tower, and G.Lloyd Preacher’s",Paragraph
Gothic skyscraper Atlanta City Hall (1928-30); Art Deco forms dominated the 1930s—,Paragraph
Dietel and Wade and Sullivan Jones’ Buffalo City Hall remains an important American,Paragraph
example of this international movement. In some locales regionally important revival,Paragraph
styles were employed to reinforce the city’s past or to promote an idealized fictive past;,Paragraph
Bakewell and Brown’s Pasadena City Hall (1923-27) was an amalgamation of,Paragraph
Mediterranean sources intended to evoke a Spanish heritage that the community did not,Paragraph
actually possess.,Paragraph
The emergence of the Modern movement in Europe in the 1910s and 1920s was not,Paragraph
"often evidenced in city halls, largely because few new city hall projects were initiated",Paragraph
between the wars and because the political nature of the type nearly precluded,Paragraph
experimental form. Several notable exceptions were built. Willem Dudock’s Town Hal,Paragraph
"(1924-30) for Hilversum, the Netherlands, is well known. Dudock contrasted several",Paragraph
"austere horizontal masses, including a primary volume containing the council chamber,",Paragraph
with a soaring tower. Each mass interlocked with several others and yet remained,Paragraph
"distinctly legible, the assembly presenting a balanced composition in repose. Fritz",Paragraph
"Hoéger’s Town Hall (1928-30) for Rtistringen, Germany, exemplified his interest in",Paragraph
dramatic geometric form within the limitations of brick masonry; the ceremonial entry,Paragraph
"and council chamber are marked by an enormous |2-story tower, a pure solid broken",Paragraph
only by a series of vertical fins and a clock tower on the primary elevation.,Paragraph
After World War II a large number of city centers in Europe required complete,Paragraph
"rebuilding. Naturally enough, in many places city halls were repaired or even",Paragraph
"reconstructed in order to preserve a continuity with prewar civic life. Some cities,",Paragraph
"particularly in Germany, adapted surviving structures to a new civic purpose, with the",Paragraph
intention to build a representational structure at some time in the future. Most of the,Paragraph
continent’s new city halls were modern in orientation. Perhaps the most famous are those,Paragraph
"by Alvar Aalto, whose civic complexes for Saynatsalo (1950-52) and Seinajéki (1952—",Paragraph
66) wove the town hall and auxiliary build-ings into the landscape and demonstrated as,Paragraph
much concern for the space between the buildings as for the buildings themselves. At,Paragraph
Seinaj6ki the city hall is marked by its axial siting within the civic center and by a,Paragraph
commanding monitor roof through which light pours into the council chamber.,Caption
American postwar city halls came in two forms: the unassuming suburban,Paragraph
"multipurpose civic building, which usually was designed on a decidedly",Paragraph
"domestic scale, and the overscaled, inner-city modernist monument, which",Paragraph
usually served as the centerpiece of a large urban-renewal scheme. The,Paragraph
"former conception, city hall as ranch house or colonial farmstead,",Paragraph

CLASSICISM,Title
In the 20th century architectural classicism continued in its centuries-old custom,Paragraph
(traditional classicism) and also was appropriated by those who abstracted its principles,Paragraph
in the modern effort for an ahistorical architecture (early modernism). Among those,Paragraph
"extending the classical tradition, the terms and have been used as if interchangeable.",Paragraph
"However, most would use as the more inclusive term referring to premodernist",Paragraph
architectural habits in various cultures and societies around the world. Many would,Paragraph
describe as including a more specific species of traditional architecture drawing from,Paragraph
the Western tradition of building.,Paragraph
The contrast in how traditional classicism was employed in the 20th century may be,Paragraph
witnessed in the work of architects as apparently dissimilar as Walter Gropius and Paul,Paragraph
"Philippe Cret, both of whom utilized such fundamentals as bilateral symmetry, axes and",Paragraph
"cross axes as organizing plan elements, and proportional systems based on",Paragraph
anthropomorphic sources. It would be of little consequence to identify as classical any,Paragraph
"building employing axes of symmetry in an organizational strategy, yet classical",Paragraph
principles proved themselves useful throughout the century and to architects of every,Paragraph
aesthetic preference. Buildings whose elevations and massing are as different as the,Paragraph
"Werkbund Pavilion (Cologne, 1914), First Church of Christ, Scientist (Berkeley, 1910),",Caption
"and Rockefeller Center (New York, from 1931) share fundamentally classical planning",Paragraph
techniques of axes of symmetry disciplining complex building programs. After,Paragraph
"midcentury a notable exponent was Louis Kahn, trained in the University of",Paragraph
Pennsylvania’s Beaux-Arts program. Kahn employed the general geometries of,Paragraph
"classicism and axial organization, altering the classical ideals of ceremonial circulation",Paragraph
laid out on primary axes separating the levels of important spaces into his theory of,Paragraph
"“servant” and “served” spaces, as seen in his 1963 Parliament Building at Dacca (in what",Paragraph
is now Bangladesh).,Paragraph
"Overt classical allusions were present in surprising places early in the 20th century,",Paragraph
"notably in the AEG Turbine Factory designed by Peter Behrens (Berlin, 1908), hailed for",Paragraph
"its sleek curtain wall and exposed structure. However, the impression of the classical",Paragraph
"temple is undeniable despite the obvious expression of the factory function, even if here",Paragraph
"the triangular pediment is replaced by the polygonal profile of the building’s truss roof,",Paragraph
and the colonnade is a series of steel columns. Through this metaphor Behrens could,Paragraph
intentionally express that his era had elevated industrial tasks to the level of cultural,Paragraph
"endeavor; he could not have communicated such in a newly invented vocabulary. Here,",Paragraph
classicism was essential for the meaning of this primary monument of the factory,Paragraph
"aesthetic. More ingenious with its use of the “elements” of classicism, Gunnar Asplund’s",Paragraph

buildings that have ranked high in the traditional hierarchy.,Paragraph
Critical attention has tended to favor modernist stylistic innovation over the,Paragraph
"application of classical principles. Even so, the recognizable signs of ancient building",Paragraph
types and ornament—in particular the orders—were employed consistently by advocates,Paragraph
of architecture’s classical heritage through the 20th century. In the early part of the,Paragraph

"was changed, especially in the hands of architects and patrons who strove to articulate",Paragraph

"Their simplified but recognizable classicism embraced the monumental scale, sense of",Paragraph
"discipline, order, and bright whiteness associated with classical antiquity, but in a form",Paragraph

The more visually obvious manifestations of classicism typified by McKim and Cret,Paragraph
"coincided with peaks in the publication of ancient and Renaissance treatises, whose",Paragraph
appearance at the start and conclusion of the century reveals a significant readership of,Paragraph
architects applying the lessons and details of these books in their buildings. Vitruvius’s,Paragraph
was continually published in the 20th century. Revealing its importance to architecture,Paragraph
"worldwide, the treatise was brought out in Spanish, French, Italian, German, and Latin;",Paragraph
two notable English translations of Vitruvius mark either end of the century (1914 and,Paragraph
"1999). Similarly, several versions of William Ware’s were published in the first decade",Paragraph
"of the century, and two more appeared in its final decades. These publication events",Paragraph
correspond with the early flourishing of the classical tradition. Their interruption during,Paragraph
"the century’s middle decades coincided with the apparent triumph of “orthodox,” or high",Paragraph
"European, modernism, which by the 1960s was deemed by many as fundamental to the",Paragraph
"failure of urban renewal and slum clearance schemes, construction of disastrous CIAM-",Paragraph
"inspired public housing projects, and the demolition of historic structures (notably the",Paragraph
1963 destruction of the aforementioned Penn Station). As the architectural devastation,Paragraph
visited on cities gave impetus to both a growing backlash against ahistorical modernist,Paragraph
"architecture and historic preservation initiatives, tradition and classicism emerged as",Paragraph
"viable correctives to the disasters of the Modern movement. Concurrently, several works",Paragraph
of Renaissance theory appeared in the last four decades of the century: Alberti’s was,Paragraph
published in 1966 and translated in 1986; Palladio was retranslated in 1965 and again in,Paragraph
"1997; and several of Serlio’s books were reprinted in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. In",Paragraph
1993 the Getty Center’s Texts and Documents series added the 17th-century by,Caption
Claude Perrault to its ambitious list of publications.,Paragraph
New theory drawing from the old also appeared in these later decades (notably Robert,Paragraph
Venturi’s 1966) and found a wide audience whose growing dissatisfaction with,Paragraph
modernism stimulated the rise of Postmodernism. In its approach to infuse classical,Paragraph
"ornament with meaning relevant in an era of relativity, which has led to doublecoding,",Paragraph
Postmodernism at once acknowledges the importance and value of ornament and antique,Paragraph
"forms in architecture, at times with the intentional hazard of weakening the tradition by",Paragraph
making such references ironic or comical. Postmodernism’s contribution has been judged,Paragraph

CLIMATE,Title
"Climate is characterized by the global, regional, and local distribution of solar radiation,",Paragraph
"precipitation, temperature, wind, and humidity at the earth’s surface. The earth-sun",Paragraph
"relationship that defines season combines with latitude, surface cover (land versus sea),",Paragraph
"the water cycle, and movement of air masses, to generate global weather patterns. As",Paragraph
"opposed to weather that takes place over a short time span, climate represents long-term",Paragraph
trends that are averaged over a time scale of several decades. These trends are classified,Paragraph
into climate types with names indicative of their dominant temperature and precipitation,Paragraph
"features. Knowledge of the macroclimate of a representative city or region, in",Paragraph
"combination with a qualitative understanding of local microclimate, allows architects,",Paragraph
"builders, city planners, and landscape architects to modify indoor and outdoor",Paragraph
"environments in ways that improve human comfort, reduce building energy consumption,",Paragraph
and optimize site resource use.,Paragraph
Indigenous builders recognized the relationships between shelter and,Paragraph
"climate. James Marston Fitch, in his 1960 article “Primitive",Paragraph
"Architecture and Climate,” clarified the empirical and evolutionary",Paragraph
"wisdom of these builders to create efficient, comfortable, climate-",Paragraph
responsive structures in all regions of the world. Fitch also challenged,Paragraph
contemporary architects to demonstrate skill comparable to their,Paragraph
“primitive” counterparts in designing energy- and resource-efficient,Paragraph
structures that would satisfy their occupants’ needs. This challenge,Paragraph
became the focus of climate-responsive architecture for the 20th century:,Paragraph
to combine the wisdom of indigenous builders with contemporary building,Paragraph
"science, technology, and design. The achievements of this era can be",Paragraph
summarized in three main categories: refined regional guidelines for,Paragraph
climate-responsive environmental design; new methods for assessing the,Paragraph
"relationship between climate, human comfort, and energy use in buildings;",Paragraph
and an improved understanding of how urban environments influence,Paragraph
climate.,Paragraph
Regional Climate Analyses and Design,Title
Guidelines,Title
The most important contributions advancing architectural knowledge of climatic design,Paragraph
in the 20th century occurred in the post-World War II era. In 1949 the American Institute,Paragraph
"of Architects’ Climate Control Project was the first major contribution to the field,",Paragraph
appearing both as a series of articles in the popular press and technical briefs in the,Paragraph
"The principal author of these reports, climatologist Dr. Paul Siple, was hired by the",Paragraph
American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers to create regional climate,Paragraph
analyses and design data for a number of U.S. cities and their surrounding areas. The,Paragraph
project—to analyze climatic data in terms of its implications for residential design—was,Paragraph
the first major effort to summarize climate data for use by the architectural design,Paragraph
community.,Paragraph
There have been subsequent publications of regional climatic design,Paragraph
guidelines for buildings and their surrounding environments. The U.S.,Paragraph
Department of Housing and Urban Development contracted with the,Paragraph
American Institute of Architects’ Research Corporation to publish,Title
"(1980), which provides general climatic design recommendations for the",Paragraph
"continental United States and Hawaii. (Watson and Labs, 1993) and",Paragraph
"(Brown and Dekay, 2000) use design illustrations, monographs, rules of",Paragraph
"thumb, and case study examples to communicate architectural design",Paragraph
strategies that respond to climate. Most works have been inspired by the,Paragraph
"ideas presented in the 1963 book by Victor Olgyay, which has",Paragraph
greatly influenced several generations of architects interested in climatic,Paragraph
design.,Paragraph
Design Methods,Title
The text was a substantive addition to the architect’s understanding of climate-,Paragraph
responsive design beyond the provision of design guidelines. The author developed a,Paragraph
quantitative method for assessing human comfort in relationship to exterior climate,Paragraph
"conditions. The “Bioclimatic Chart,” as it is called, plots dry-bulb temperature against",Paragraph
"relative humidity and delineates a portion of the chart as the “comfort zone”; that is, the",Paragraph
range of thermal conditions in which a sedentary young adult dressed in lightweight,Paragraph
"clothing would experience comfort in the shade. For climate conditions outside this zone,",Paragraph
"the chart indicates how modifications of sun, wind, and moisture can render comfort in",Paragraph
spite of the naturally occurring conditions. The Bioclimatic Chart still enjoys a place in,Paragraph
architectural design methods although it has evolved through the contributions of others.,Paragraph
"Givoni and Milne (1976) showed, in this case adopting the psychometric chart, how",Paragraph
comfort can be achieved indoors through passive and low-energy design strategies. The,Paragraph
"relationship between human comfort, acclimatization, and appropriate building strategies",Paragraph
is an emerging field of study as architects and engineers realize the need to optimize both,Paragraph
energy consumption and environmental performance in buildings.,Paragraph
Computer software to analyze regional climate data and their design implications is,Paragraph
another important development in design methods in the 20th century. The most notable,Paragraph
software packages in this category are Climate Consultant from UCLA and,Paragraph
METEONORM from Meteotest. Sources for U.S. climatological data used by these,Paragraph
software packages and by other calculation methods include the National Oceanic and,Paragraph
"Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), and",Paragraph
the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). When based on actual,Paragraph
"measurements, these data are compiled from a sparse observation network of weather",Paragraph
stations on the ground or of sky-based instruments (such as satellites and weather,Paragraph
"balloons), typically recorded for agricultural or military purposes. When actual data are",Paragraph
"not available, they can be approximated using mathematical or statistical methods.",Paragraph
"Typical Meteorological Year (TMY2) data from NREL, for example, are based on actual",Paragraph
measurements and mathematical models. Climate data are instrumental to climate,Paragraph
"analysis for building energy simulation software (e.g., Energy-10, Energy Scheming,",Paragraph
Solar-5) that allows designers to estimate the effect of climate on indoor temperatures as,Paragraph
well as building energy consumption. More research is needed for the application of these,Paragraph
data to modeling of microclimates around buildings and open spaces at the city scale.,Paragraph
Climate Modification,Title
Although the effects of urbanization on climate have been noted since Roman,Paragraph
antiquity—from the writings of architect and engi-neer Marcus Vitruvius Pollio in the Ist,Paragraph
century B.C. to the odes of Quintus Horatius Flaccus around 24 B.C_—measurement and,Caption
modeling of these effects gained greater attention in the 20th century A.D. Motorized,Paragraph
traverses of urban centers to measure air temperature gradients between cities and their,Paragraph
"surrounding rural countrysides began in 1917. The field of urban climatology, which",Paragraph
"examines the effect of cities on climate, has emerged as the principal discipline engaged",Paragraph
"in this study. Its purpose is to assess the effects of urban buildings, transportation",Paragraph
"systems, and industrial activities on the atmospheric and hydrologic cycles and their",Title
associated energy and water balances. Detailed studies of one climate phenomenon in,Paragraph
"particular, the urban heat island effect, preoccupied many scientists and researchers in the",Paragraph
20th century.,Paragraph
Urban heat islands are attributed to a combination of influences that cause air,Paragraph
temperatures in cities to be higher than in surrounding suburban or rural areas. Cities,Paragraph
"exhibit increased thermal storage potential, for waste heat as well as incident solar",Paragraph
"radiation, by their massive construction materials commonly used in buildings and",Paragraph
"streetscapes (such as concrete and asphalt, respectively). The effect is more pronounced",Paragraph
at night because cities have a slower rate of nocturnal radiant cooling than surrounding,Paragraph
"rural areas. Finally, cities experience less evaporative cooling because of increased runoff",Paragraph
from paved surfaces and limited vegetation to retain moisture in urban environments. The,Paragraph
urban heat island effect has been documented in cities throughout the world using,Paragraph
satellite imagery and ground-based measurement. Because of the negative effect on,Paragraph
"cooling energy consumption in most cities (except in cold climates), design",Paragraph
"recommendations, such as white roofs and selective planting, are cited as mitigation",Paragraph
measures for the urban heat island effect.,Paragraph
The question of climate change on a global scale fueled a central debate at the end of,Paragraph
the 20th century. Large computer programs called GCMs (known as General Circulation,Paragraph
or Global Climate Models) were being used by scientists to predict the magnitude of,Paragraph
change in temperature and precipitation for changes in atmospheric concentrations of,Paragraph
carbon dioxide. Evidence of climate change has also been detected in paleoclimatological,Paragraph
"records obtained from ice cores, for example. The Interagency Panel on Climate Change",Paragraph
"(IPCC), formed in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United",Paragraph
"Nations Environmental Program, continues an internationally coordinated effort to",Paragraph
investigate the hypothesis that surface temperatures worldwide have been increasing as a,Paragraph
"result of anthropogenic change and, to a lesser degree, natural climatic variability.",Paragraph
"In the last two decades of the 20th century, world leaders and a wide array of",Paragraph
international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) convened to determine appropriate,Paragraph
policy responses to global climate change. The most notable policy actions resulting from,Paragraph
"these landmark events were the 1987 Montreal Protocol to combat ozone depletion, the",Paragraph

"CODERCH Y DE SENTMENAT, JOSE",Title
ANTONIO 1913-84,Title
"Architect, Spain",Title
José Antonio Coderch y de Sentmenat was a Catalan architect born in Barcelona. He,Paragraph
"completed his architectural education at the Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura,",Paragraph
"Barcelona, in 1940, later teaching there as a professor between 1965 and 1968. From",Paragraph
"1936 to 1939, he fought in the Spanish civil war. Until he established his own private",Paragraph
"architectural practice in 1947, he gained architectural experience at the offices of the",Paragraph
"Director-General of Architecture in Madrid; the City Architect in Sitges, Spain; Obra",Paragraph
Sindical del Hogar in Barcelona; and Barcelona’s Naval Institute. He was an active,Paragraph
"participant in the architectural group Team X, which he joined in 1961. After an",Paragraph
"accomplished career in Spanish architecture, he died on 6 November 1984 in Barcelona.",Paragraph
Coderch was influenced by the work of Madrid architect Secundino Zuazu and greatly,Paragraph
admired the work of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. He admired popular Mediterranean,Paragraph
"architecture, adapting it with a contemporary modern idiom. This combination prompted",Paragraph
Kenneth Frampton in to refer to him as a “Catalan Regionalist.” The first built,Paragraph
example of this hybridization was Coderch’s eight-story ISM apartment block (1951) in,Paragraph
Barcelona.,Paragraph
Arguably one of Coderch’s most significant contributions to 20th-century architectural,Paragraph
thinking was his questioning of the importance of architectural geniuses. In his article,Paragraph
"“There Are No Geniuses That We Need Now,” Coderch contests the need for great",Paragraph
"leaders with absolute doctrines and universal principles. Rather, he argues for a transfer",Paragraph
"of responsibility to individual architects, empowered by their devotion, goodwill, and",Paragraph
"honor, all guided by the architect’s personal intuition. Similarly, he advocated for the",Paragraph
return of an architectural “trade.”,Paragraph
"More recently, Coderch has been recognized for his contributions to post-World War",Paragraph
"II Spanish architecture. For example, Barcelona architect Ignacio de Sola-Morales has",Paragraph
reappraised Coderch’s work to demonstrate his lasting contributions. Although,Paragraph
"previously dismissed by some of his colleagues, Coderch has won new recognition",Paragraph
"among critics, leading to his receipt of the professional Merit Medal FAD, Barcelona, in",Paragraph
1977.,Paragraph
An important pursuit for Coderch was the deconstruction of pedagogical systems in,Paragraph
architecture. His teaching and concern for the training of young Spanish architects were,Paragraph
outlined most clearly in his “Letter to Young Architects” in (174 [July-September,Paragraph
1987]). He contended that architectural students should engage with life rather than,Paragraph
"architectural history alone. His outspoken, aggressive, and reactionary position to",Paragraph
architectural education is well known. His teaching has been characterized by his,Paragraph
"impatience with student laziness and ignorance. Despite this approach, he was forever",Paragraph
hopeful of the impact of the independent architectural graduate.,Paragraph
Coderch’s work has been described as inquisitive and transgressive. His interest lay in,Paragraph
"architectural form and its plasticity. One of his most renowned domestic projects, the",Paragraph
"Casa Ugalde (1951), exemplifies this interest. Influenced by its location in Cadeques, an",Paragraph
"isolated beach town near Barcelona, the Casa Ugalde translates the local vernacular into a",Paragraph
"piece of “modern” abstract architecture. Characterized by its framed views, the house",Paragraph
exploits the landscape. In plan it has been described as both poetic and arabesque. An,Paragraph
enormous shaded terrace moderates the effects of the Mediterranean sun. This interest in,Paragraph
climatic control is reflected in a number of other important housing projects designed by,Paragraph
Coderch. These include the single-family dwellings Casa Catasus (1956) in Sitges and,Paragraph
Casa Uriach (1961) in L’Ametlla del Vallés. The experimentation in climatic control by,Paragraph
"Coderch continued in a number of multifamily-housing schemes, including the ISM",Paragraph
"apartments (1951) in Barcelona, the Il Girasol apartments (1966; inspired and translated",Paragraph
"as the sunflower) in Madrid, and the Las Cocheras apartment building (1968) in",Paragraph
"Barcelona. These projects used hinged panels, louvers, roll-down screens, balconies, and",Paragraph
"stepped facades to allow, black, or filter light into interior rooms.",Paragraph
Not all Coderch’s work was residential. Two notable commercial projects that he,Paragraph
designed are the Trade Office Building (1965) and Institute Frances (1972) in Barcelona.,Paragraph
Both projects exploit the glass facade made famous by German architect Ludwig Mies,Paragraph
van der Rohe.,Paragraph
Exhibitions were another important activity in Coderch’s career. His seven-by-eight-,Paragraph
meter pavilion for the 1951 Ninth Trienniale in Milan sought to confirm the Spanish,Paragraph
"presence on the European architectural scene. A Spanish-made straw cloth sheet; a large,",Paragraph
rotating natural finish timber shutter; and a table occupied the pavilion space and were,Paragraph
"decorated with sculptures, ceramics, and photographs of Spanish crafts. For this",Paragraph
exhibition he was awarded a Gold Medal and a Grand Prize. He exhibited at the National,Paragraph
"Fine Art Exhibition in Madrid in 1960, received a Gold Medal for the Centre Pompidou",Paragraph
"in Paris in 1978, and exhibited at the Transformations in Modern Architecture Exhibition",Paragraph
"at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1979,",Paragraph
Coderch’s early architectural career was relatively unrecognized. Exhibitions at the,Paragraph
Centre Pompidou and the Museum of Modern Art toward the end of his career increased,Paragraph
"his profile, elevating acceptance of his work internationally and in his own country. The",Paragraph
recently cited effect of his Casa Ugalde on the Cap Marinet House (1985-87) of Spanish,Paragraph

"With the Rhine River winding slowly through the city and its towering cathedral spires,",Paragraph
Cologne has long provided the German imagination with rich images of artistic and,Paragraph
national Romanticism. Its idyllic landscape and key location on a major waterway have,Paragraph
supported the city’s evolution as an important commercial and industrial center. The,Paragraph
history of Cologne’s architectural developments in the 20th century clearly joins the two,Paragraph
strands of artistic enchantment and dynamic economy.,Paragraph
The city’s built landscape served a distinct defensive function at the close of the 19th,Paragraph
century. Developments in military technology had brought about an increased target,Paragraph
"range of weapons, and Cologne’s medieval city wall with its buffer zone leading up to",Paragraph
fortification structures was insufficient to protect Cologne from enemy fire. In 1881 the,Paragraph
"Prussian government moved the inner medieval fortress ring outward, and the",Paragraph

"city wall, Cologne’s turn-of-the-century population of over 400,000 had room to continue",Paragraph
its process of growth and urbanization. In 1907-14 the defensive structures underwent,Paragraph
"further alterations. The fortification numbered 182 units on the eve of World War I, and",Paragraph
"almost all these were subsequently torn down per the Treaty of Versailles, putting an end",Paragraph
"to Cologne’s military and architectural status as a”fortress city.” Konrad Adenauer,",Paragraph
"Cologne’s lord mayor from 1917 to 1933, successfully convinced the Allies to allow a",Paragraph
handful of the fortresses to remain as historical documents.,Paragraph
"As modern military technology changed the location and layout of the city, suburbs",Paragraph
dominated by factories began to crop up around the outskirts of the city. The population,Paragraph
"continued to grow, helped along by a pattern of incorporating communities, extending the",Paragraph
geographic contours of the city eastward across the river. The industrialization and,Paragraph
commercialization of Cologne brought about construction projects that facilitated the,Paragraph
transportation of goods and people throughout the city. The construction of the Deutzer,Paragraph
"Bridge (1911-13) united both sides of the Rhine, and the widening and merger of",Paragraph
existing alleys into the Giirzenichstrasse created a modern access road to the bridge on,Paragraph
the east side of the river.,Paragraph
The construction of major department stores such as Kaufhaus Tietz (designed by,Paragraph
"Wilhelm Kreis, 1912-14) supported the trend toward urbanization. The Kaufhaus Tietz",Paragraph
"building, situated between Hohe Strasse and Giirzenichstrasse, represented a new",Paragraph
"architectural form with its symmetrical, imposing form and three glass-covered",Paragraph
courtyards. In 1933 the Tietz firm was one of the first victims of the National Socialists’,Paragraph
policy of “Aryanization.” The Jewish family Tietz lost their position as head of the,Paragraph

Such monumental architecture reflected Rhineland architects’ belief that they could,Paragraph
"affect the world with their constructions, and this conviction led to buildings that were",Paragraph

constructed one of the first Expressionist buildings with his polygonal Glaspalast (the,Paragraph

"now the trade-show grounds. Under the pavilion’s cupola, made up of diamond-shaped",Paragraph
"glass bricks, a band of six short rhymes by Paul Scheerbart celebrated the potential for",Paragraph

"only pains us). The building, which has not survived, and the exhibition firmly",Paragraph
established Cologne as a major figure on the international and national architecture,Paragraph
stages.,Paragraph
Under Konrad Adenauer the city saw a number of new designs in the,Paragraph
"interwar period, from Rhine Romantic to international modern, but all",Paragraph
with a decidedly German reference. Although the war had suffocated an,Paragraph
"explicitly Expressionist architectural movement, the prewar Utopian",Paragraph
"vision of beauty, light, and glass continued to influence construction plans,",Paragraph
particularly with reference to the emerging social interest in hygiene and,Paragraph
sports and the growing population. Before the war Cologne’s population,Paragraph

"architects designed the apartments of the neighboring estate, Weisse Stadt, at a slant to",Paragraph
provide optimum lighting; its row-by-row layout of units became quite popular for,Paragraph
housing. Their residential area Zoll-stock Siedling (1927-29) comprised apartments,Paragraph
designed to reflect the shared economic and social status of the middle-class civil,Paragraph

Color had always been fundamental to the visual and symbolic human experience of,Paragraph

"By the beginning of the 20th century, the scientific understanding of color through",Paragraph
"theories of physical light, pigments, and human perception was accepted within standard",Paragraph
artistic methods and incorporated into art and design education. Following the color,Paragraph
"experiments of Cubism, the Dutch De Stijl movement conceptualized a spatial use of",Paragraph
"color to unify two-and three-dimensional forms. In (1923), Cor van Eesteren, Theo van",Paragraph
"Doesburg, and Gerrit Rietveld argued, “We have given color its rightful place in",Paragraph
architecture and we assert that painting separated from the architectonic construction (i.e.,Paragraph
the picture) has no right to exist.” This theory was followed rigorously in architectural,Paragraph
"examples, such as Gerrit Rietveld’s Schréder-Schrader House, a design that dispersed",Paragraph
painter Piet Mondrian’s floating planes of color into three dimensions.,Paragraph
Design instruction at the Bauhaus carefully limited color application to abstract,Paragraph
compositions and the intrinsic color of materials. Color theory and composition was one,Paragraph
"of the fundamental principles taught within the Preliminary (“Basic”) Course, and color",Paragraph
was considered to be instructional content of the same importance as building materials,Paragraph
in later courses. Among the significant instructors at the Bauhaus who contributed to the,Paragraph
"evolution of color theory were Paul Klee, Johannes Itten, and Josef Albers.",Paragraph

recognized to be as intentionally spatial as the architectural forms themselves.,Paragraph
"Among architects who designed through modernism’s influence, Luis Barragan",Paragraph
integrated color most fully into spatial effects. His Cuadra San Cristobal in Mexico,Paragraph
"(1968) and the Francisco Gilardi House (1976), with its striking blue-walled dining room",Paragraph
"and floating red column over water, are among his most significant achievements.",Paragraph
By midcentury advances in engineering and psychology began to create new,Paragraph
“functional” color sciences that ranged from thermal absorption of surfaces to human,Paragraph
visual recognition. Schemes of colorization were classified for building safety and egress,Paragraph

and Richard Rogers used these as an aesthetic in the Pompidou Center (1977) by,Paragraph
"exposing major building systems on the exterior, painted in colors based on the",Paragraph
appropriate standard. The building industry also began to institute color standards for the,Paragraph
selection of building products and finishes.,Paragraph
The advent of Postmodernism in the 1960s returned the possibilities of color to,Paragraph
architectural design. Robert Venturi argued against modernism through a reinvigorated,Paragraph
"interest in the complex, evocative, and ambiguous characteristics of architecture. His first",Paragraph

"original content” (Colquhoun, 1989, ix). For Colquhoun there is no final or completed",Paragraph
"order to architecture, as any history leads to the object and activity of criticism.",Paragraph
Colquhoun is committed to a critical and didactical engagement with architecture that,Paragraph
"fully incorpo-rates the claim that no one, including himself, can offer a final argument",Paragraph
from a final (universal) perspective.,Paragraph
"Beginning in the middle of the 20th century, Colquhoun’s writing explores the",Paragraph
"problems presented to architects by historical repetition and functional logic, problems",Paragraph
that he has recently approached from an anthropological and philosophical turn to,Paragraph
language. Colquhoun took pains to separate Modern architecture from the more purely,Paragraph
visual or “picturesque” transformations of the 19th century by pointing out the distance,Paragraph
"from “Historicism,” a distance increased by the didactic demands of Modern architecture.",Paragraph
"Early on, his critical interest was in the element of architecture that defined its connection",Paragraph
"to its age—that is, he wanted to know what it was that generated style in 20th-century",Paragraph
architecture. Colquhoun explicitly linked this style to the function of the building such,Paragraph
"that “the visual hierarchy always reflects a functional hierarchy, an understanding of",Paragraph
which intensifies the aesthetic pleasure derived from the forms.” His later work expanded,Paragraph
this notion with the assertion that there did not exist any singular style for any one,Paragraph
context but there were “a multiplicity of ‘language games’ that may vary according to,Paragraph
"circumstance” (Colquhoun, 1988, 5). His work has been influenced to some extent by",Paragraph
"recent attention to language in social theory, particularly the works of the philosophers",Paragraph
"Walter Benjamin, Claude Lévi-Strauss, and Jean-Frangois Lyotard. Colquhoun’s",Caption
discovery of a state of architectural affairs similar to the state of social science affairs,Paragraph
offers him ways to examine the world without relying on universal commitments or,Paragraph
teleological narratives.,Paragraph
Colquhoun’s early theoretical and architectural work focused on the role of function in,Paragraph
"an attempt to conceptualize the building as a self-contained entity, the form of which was",Paragraph
"created out of the internal requirements of the building itself. On the other hand, his later",Paragraph
work examines the question of the individual building as a part of larger spatial and,Paragraph
"historical contexts. The use of historical typology, however, is typically less important",Paragraph
than concerns of logical function and abstraction.,Paragraph
Colquhoun’s architectural work followed a trend coeval with his theoretical and,Paragraph
critical work. He began his architectural career as a detail assistant to Tom Ellis and,Paragraph
"Lawrence Israel for the firm of Lyons, Israel and Ellis. There he worked on early",Paragraph
"Brutalist buildings, such as a workshop and scene-painting building for the Old Vic",Paragraph
Theater in South London. In 1961 he formed a partnership with John Miller. In 1975,Paragraph
"Richard Brearley became a partner, and Su Rogers became one in 1987, the year that the",Paragraph
"firm’s name was changed from Colquhoun and Miller to the more descriptive Colquhoun,",Paragraph
Miller and Partners. In the 1960s the firm’s work focused on medium- to large-size,Paragraph
"public buildings, and by 1970 public housing comprised the largest part of their work.",Paragraph
"During the 1980s their work focused on museums, including their renovation work on",Paragraph
Whitechapel Art Gallery in London that improved and reinterpreted the building’s,Paragraph
"already diverse elements with a concern for the historical, social, and contextual fabric of",Paragraph
the building’s exterior and the functional utility of the building’s interior.,Paragraph

"COLUMBUS, INDIANA, UNITED STATES",Caption
"In many respects, Columbus, Indiana, is a typical small town of the American Midwest",Paragraph
"with a population of only 32,000 and a single company dominating its economic and",Paragraph
"civic life. Its main street, laid out in 1821, retains much of its 19th-century character, as",Paragraph
"does its most visible public building, the Victorian Bartholomew County Courthouse",Paragraph
"(1874) on the town square. However, Columbus also possesses one of the densest",Paragraph
"concentrations of modern architecture in the United States, with more than 50 buildings",Paragraph
designed by internationally known firms.,Paragraph
Columbus’ involvement with modern architecture is due largely to the patronage of,Paragraph
"J.Irwin Miller, the (now retired) chairman of Cummins Engine Company. Miller was",Paragraph
"exposed to modernism as an undergraduate at Yale University, where he developed an",Paragraph
enthusiast’s interest in architecture and a belief in its potential to express the spirit of a,Paragraph
"community. In 1937, when his uncle and aunt donated land in downtown Columbus for",Paragraph
"their congregation’s new church, Miller persuaded his relatives to give the commission to",Paragraph
"Eliel Saarinen, whose Cranbrook School of Art had deeply impressed him. Saarinen’s",Paragraph
"First Christian Church (1942) is a restrained, boxlike structure of buff brick with a",Paragraph
"gridded limestone facade and a detached, shaftlike campanile. Furnishings for the church",Caption
were designed by Saarinen’s son Eero (Miller’s classmate at Yale) and Charles Eames.,Paragraph
The church’s departure from its predecessor’s Gothic Revival style caused local,Paragraph
"controversy on its completion, but eventually Columbus became receptive to modern",Paragraph
architecture.,Paragraph
"Miller continued to press the cause of modern architecture in the following decades,",Paragraph
"commissioning Eero Saarinen to design a series of buildings, including the North",Paragraph
Christian Church and his own house. The church is a simple geometric composition of,Paragraph
"concrete and slate. Its hexagonal form, symbolizing unity, is articulated in steel by",Paragraph
prominent roof ribs that rise to form a spire marking the centralized sanctuary within. The,Paragraph
"Miller house, one of Saarinen’s few residential commissions, features a transformable",Paragraph
"open plan, a conversation pit, and plastic “scoop” dining chairs designed for the house.",Paragraph
Saarinen also designed a new branch and central office for Miller’s family’s bank. The,Paragraph
Irwin Union Bank and Trust (1954) was the first example of Miesian modernism in,Paragraph
Columbus. Although its steel frame and transparent glass facade defied small-town,Paragraph
"expectations for a bank, its open plan and cageless teller stations were welcomed by",Paragraph
patrons for their friendliness and informality. Subsequent Irwin Union branches and,Paragraph
office additions were designed by Harry Weese (1958) and Roche Dinkeloo (1973).,Paragraph
Under Miller’s aegis these firms also designed buildings for the Cummins Engine,Paragraph
"Company, including factories, offices, and research facilities. Roche Dinkeloo’s",Paragraph
Components Plant (1973) maximized manufacturing flexibility and productivity while,Paragraph
"enhancing the work environment for the plant’s 2,000 employees. Designing a 13-acre",Paragraph
"glass-and-steel shed set in a parklike campus, the architects utilized innovative air and",Paragraph
noise pollution control systems and provided extensive views to the exterior. To avoid,Paragraph
"marring these views, the architects accommodated automobiles on the plant’s roof. When",Paragraph
"the design was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970, it was hailed as a",Paragraph
prototype for the factory of the future. Roche Dinkeloo’s corporate office complex (1984),Caption
for Cummins was as significant for its location as for its design. Determined to make,Paragraph
"downtown Columbus continually relevant to the life of the city, Miller chose to locate",Paragraph
Cummins World Headquarters on three square blocks in the central business district,Caption
rather than on the urban periphery. A long arc of a building with a sawtooth east facade,Paragraph
"embracing a public park, it is flanked by a covered public walkway that connects with",Paragraph
"nearby structures (post office, bank, and shopping mall) used by employees. The Roche",Paragraph
Dinkeloo design also included the renovation of a brick building from 1881 that was part,Paragraph
of the original garage and machine shop where the Cummins diesel engine was born.,Paragraph
The renovation of this building reflected architecture’s burgeoning interest in adaptive,Paragraph
reuse as well as Miller’s own awareness of his company’s local historical significance.,Paragraph
"As early as the 1960s, Miller hired Alexander Girard to renovate his family’s 1881 Irwin",Paragraph
Bank building to house his private offices. Although the interior was thoroughly,Paragraph
"modernized, the building’s castiron-and-brick facade was restored to approximately its",Paragraph
original appearance. This renovation was part of a master revitalization plan that Girard,Paragraph
prepared for the Columbus Redevelopment Commission. Focusing on a ten-block area of,Caption
downtown Columbus that had declined in the 1950s because of suburban retail,Paragraph
"competition, Girard preserved the Victorian character of the district while adapting it for",Paragraph
"contemporary use, introducing coherent signage and color coordination across the",Paragraph
corridor’s storefronts. This revitalization effort was given added impetus by the,Paragraph
"construction of the Courthouse Center and Commons (1973), a Miller-financed shopping",Paragraph
"and civic complex. Occupying a superblock site along Washington Street, the complex",Paragraph
was designed by Cesar Pelli to minimize its obtrusive scale by respecting the cornice,Paragraph
lines of nearby buildings. Its brown mirrored glass sheathing gives way on the,Paragraph
"Washington Street facade to clear glass, better connecting the enclosed commons with",Caption
the life of the street. Inside is a Jean Tinguely sculpture fabricated of metal scraps,Caption
"collected from the Columbus area. This work is the focal point of the complex, serving as",Paragraph
"a popular public gathering place, thus satisfying Miller’s desire that the Commons add",Paragraph
vitality to downtown and become a contemporary equivalent to the town’s original public,Paragraph
"plaza, namely, the courthouse square immediately to the south.",Paragraph
Miller’s direct patronage brought a substantial amount of modern,Paragraph
"architecture to Columbus, but of even greater impact was the architectural",Paragraph
program that he established through the Cummins Engine Foundation in,Paragraph
1954. Alarmed that post-World War II business and population expansion,Paragraph
was negatively affecting Columbus’ built environment and its quality of,Paragraph
"life, Miller proposed to improve both. His foundation would pay the",Paragraph
"architect’s fees for any civic building in Columbus, provided that the",Paragraph

"inception, the Cummins Engine Foundation has spent nearly $15 million in design fees",Paragraph
for more than 30 buildings. Although critics have complained that the program produces,Paragraph
"expensive buildings and favors high-style designers over local architects, it is generally",Paragraph
regarded as a success. The program has been cited as a model of innovative public/,Paragraph
"private partnership, garnering praise from the National Building Museum, the American",Paragraph

The impact of the Cummins architectural program has extended beyond the individual,Paragraph

COMPETITIONS,Title
Throughout the 20th century professional architectural competitions were a constant,Paragraph
source of debate and controversy among those in the discipline. They were used as,Paragraph
"pedagogical tools, as means for determining excellence, as a method for awarding",Paragraph
"commissions, as battlegrounds of opposing ambitions, and as political tools.",Paragraph
"Competitions can discover new talent, challenge contemporary ideas about architecture,",Paragraph
and involve the general public in a dialogue. As an institution within the practice of,Paragraph
"architecture, they are also capable of reflecting contemporary or predicting future trends.",Paragraph
The most common types of architectural design competitions are idea competitions,Paragraph
and project competitions. Project competitions imply an intention and a commitment to,Paragraph
"build, whereas idea competitions are promoted as theoretical exercises in design intended",Paragraph
primarily to promote discussion and attract awareness to a particular issue. An idea,Paragraph
"competition is most beneficial for dealing with problems with a broad social interest,",Paragraph
"exploring different ways of using a building material, bringing attention to the potentials",Paragraph
"of a site, or examining new approaches to a particular building form or type.",Paragraph
"Competitions can also be open, limited, or invited and conducted in one or two stages.",Paragraph
Open competitions are used for selecting an architect or firm for a real project. They can,Paragraph
"be done in one or two stages, and the client retains the right to modify the winning",Paragraph
"design. In the case of a two-stage competition, the purpose of the first stage is to narrow",Paragraph
"the field, and the winner is selected in the second stage. The benefit of a two-stage",Paragraph
"process is the opportunity for the architect to engage the client in a dialogue, an option",Paragraph
not usually available in an open competition. Disadvantages of the open competition,Paragraph
"process include the risk of choosing an inexperienced architect, the possibility of",Paragraph
"receiving far too many submissions for the jury to evaluate adequately, the expense borne",Paragraph
"by the individual firms or architects who participate, and the selection of a project that is",Paragraph
not economically viable to build.,Paragraph
"In the case of an invited or limited competition, a few architects or firms are",Paragraph
commissioned to submit designs and customarily are paid an honorarium for their,Paragraph
participation. This type of competition is often used when it is important for the sponsor,Paragraph
to obtain a limited number of solutions from qualified competitors.,Paragraph
"Often, one of the first steps a sponsor takes in the competition process is the selection",Paragraph
"of a professional adviser to act as a competition consultant. The adviser, a qualified",Paragraph
"professional, is paid by the sponsor to advise on every aspect related to staging the",Paragraph
competition. The professional adviser is expected to act as an impartial liaison between,Paragraph
the client or sponsor and the competitors and to ensure that the competition is executed in,Paragraph
a fair and equitable manner for both the client and the competitors. The adviser also,Paragraph
assists the jury in their understanding of the competition program.,Paragraph
"In an effort to ensure an open and fair competition process, many countries have",Paragraph
adopted competition regulations and guidelines. The American Institute of Architects,Caption
(AIA) issued its “Guidelines for Architectural Design Competitions” in 1976 (a revision,Paragraph
"of its 1972 code, which required AIA approval and participation in competitions). The",Paragraph
AIA document is divided into the following seven parts: General Advantages and,Paragraph
"Disadvantages of Competitions, Definitions and Classifications, General Principles for",Paragraph
"the Conduct of Competitions, The Role of the Professional Adviser and Other Details for",Paragraph
"the Conduct of Competitions, The Jury and Judging Guidelines, Costs and Time, and",Paragraph
Suggested Form of Architectural Design Competition Program.,Paragraph
For international competitions there is the “Regulations for International,Paragraph
Competition in Architecture and Town Planning” of the Union,Title
"Internationale des Architectes (UIA), published in 1974. The stated",Paragraph
purpose of the UIA regulations is to outline the principles on which,Paragraph
international competitions are based. The regulations are divided into two,Paragraph
basic parts. The first consists of 51 articles divided into the following,Paragraph
sections: General Provisions; Professional Adviser; Drawing Up the,Paragraph
"Conditions; UIA Approval; Registration of Competitors; Prizes,",Paragraph
"Honoraria, and Mentions; Insurance; Copyright and Right of Ownership;",Paragraph
and Exhibition of Entries and Return of Designs. The second part includes,Paragraph
instructions and recommendations to promoters.,Paragraph
Chicago Tribune Tower (1922),Caption
One of the most significant 20th-century competitions was for the new office tower.,Paragraph
"An announcement for the open, international competition appeared in major American",Paragraph
"and European newspapers, in professional journals, and in the national and international",Paragraph
editions in June 1922.,Paragraph
"In a sense this was a two-stage competition, as in addition to the open entries, ten",Paragraph
architects were invited to participate for a fee of $2000 each. The invited architects were,Paragraph
to be judged with the ten best projects chosen from the more than 200 submissions,Paragraph
"received, the majority of which were from the United States. From this group of 20, three",Paragraph
"were to be awarded prize money of $50,000, $20,000, and $10,000. The composition of",Paragraph
"the jury (one architect, Alfred Granger, AIA, and four members of the Tribune Building",Paragraph
"Corporation) was a source of criticism by the AIA, which felt that the jury was heavily",Paragraph
weighted on the side of the layperson.,Paragraph
From the outset the competition was highly publicized and extremely well,Paragraph
"documented. At the conclusion of the competition, the sponsored a touring exhibition of",Paragraph
"the perspective renderings to universities, public institutions, and office buildings. The",Paragraph
publicity was intended to promote the as a newspaper committed to such lofty values as,Paragraph
"public education. In fact, during the period that the competitors were working on their",Paragraph
"submissions, the ran a series of weekly articles on the subject of historic and modern",Paragraph
architecture that might have influenced some of the participants.,Paragraph
An important outcome of this competition was the exposure of a mass,Paragraph
audience to modern architecture during the exhibition’s 27-city tour of the,Paragraph
United States and Canada. It was also a demonstration of the benefit of the,Paragraph
"competition process even to the so-called losers, as they profited from the",Paragraph
"exposure as well. In fact, it is often noted that Eliel Saarinen’s second-",Paragraph
place design (the last entry received) was regarded more highly than the,Paragraph
"more traditional, winning design of Howells and Hood.",Paragraph
League of Nations (1926),Title
"The open, international competition of 1926 for the League of Nations Building in",Paragraph
Geneva is generally regarded as a disaster in the history of 20th-century competitions.,Paragraph
The building was intended to symbolize the effort to achieve greater international,Paragraph
"harmony and world peace, objectives that were to be reflected in the architecture.",Paragraph
"Politically charged from the outset, the initial jury of six men represented six different",Paragraph
"countries. Soon the jury grew to nine, with the result that three additional countries were",Paragraph
represented (all Western European).,Paragraph
"When the jury evaluated the 377 entries, they were unable to come to consensus on a",Paragraph
"winner. Most of the designs were deemed too expensive to build, and only Le Corbusier",Paragraph
and Pierre Jeanneret had stayed within the budget. Problems with their drawings kept,Paragraph
them from being named the winners. As a result each of the nine jury members chose a,Paragraph
winner and two runners-up. None of the 27 architects nominated received more than one,Paragraph
"vote. Nine architects representing five different countries shared first prize. Immediately,",Paragraph
Le Corbusier embarked on an unsuccessful campaign to convince the jury that his design,Paragraph
should win.,Paragraph
"The League of Nations intervened at this point, and a second round was scheduled",Paragraph
with five jury members who did not represent any of the prize-winning countries. They,Paragraph
"too found the winners’ design unsuitable. However, two voted for Le Corbusier and two",Paragraph
for Vago. As a compromise four of the winners (all traditionalists) were commissioned to,Paragraph
produce another new design.,Paragraph
In the meantime a sizable donation from the Rockefellers necessitated the,Paragraph
"search for a larger building site. When one was located, permission",Paragraph
"depended on the signature of Héléne de Madrot, the host of the 1928",Paragraph
meeting where the Congrés Internationaux d’ Architecture Moderne,Title
(CLAM) was founded. She said that her permission was contingent on all,Paragraph
the prize winners having the chance to submit new designs for the site. In,Paragraph
"addition, Le Corbusier would be allowed to clarify his design. Only Le",Paragraph
"Corbusier and Erich zu Putlitz took advantage of the opportunity, yet the",Paragraph
jury decided to stand by their earlier decision. This competition is,Paragraph
generally regarded as an example of the battle between the modernists and,Paragraph
the traditionalists as well as a competition plagued by nationalistic,Paragraph
allegiances.,Paragraph
Sydney Opera House (1956),Caption
"Despite such problems as drastically escalating construction costs, conflicting political",Paragraph
"ambitions, and the fact that the winning architect ultimately abandoned the project, the",Paragraph
Sydney Opera House is today the much admired symbol of both Sydney and Australia.,Paragraph
"The competition was initiated by J.J.Cahill, prime minister of New South Wales, in an",Paragraph
attempt to garner votes for the Labour Party.,Paragraph
In 1956 an open international competition was organized. Two hundred and thirty-,Paragraph
"three designs, all line drawings as required by the program, were submitted. The jury",Paragraph

"The winner, Jorn Utzon, had worked for and been influenced by both",Paragraph

projects had consisted primarily of single-family residences. His,Paragraph
inexperience became evident when he attempted to solve the problem of,Paragraph
"the construction of the roof shell structure. Eventually, under time",Paragraph
"constraints and political pressure, he resigned in 1966, relinquishing the",Paragraph
"project to Australians Peter Hall, David Littlemore, and Lionel Todd.",Paragraph
Boston City Hall (1962),Caption
"This open, two-stage competition for a new city hall and surrounding public open spaces",Paragraph
was sponsored by the Government Center Commission of the City of Boston. The,Paragraph
competition was announced in October 1961. Deadlines for the preliminary stage were 17,Paragraph
January 1962 and for the final stage 25 April 1962. The jury announced their decision on,Paragraph
4 May 1962. This competition is generally considered a successful example of an open,Paragraph
competition because of its extraordinarily complete program and the establishment in,Paragraph
"1958 of the Government Center Commission, which included representatives from the",Paragraph
"government, the business community, the architectural profession, and the building",Title
trades. This commission was charged with the task of developing the program for the,Paragraph
competition.,Paragraph
Although the actual building itself has been a source of criticism by its,Paragraph
"users and others, the competition was exemplary for its fair and",Paragraph
democratic urban practice for design. There was no evidence of political,Paragraph
"favoritism, and the competition provided the opportunity for a young,",Paragraph
"relatively unknown firm, Kallmann, McKinnell, and Knowles, to give the",Paragraph
"city an extraordinary design. More important, the Boston City Hall",Paragraph
competition restored faith in the competition process in general.,Paragraph
Centre Nationale d’ Art et de Culture Georges Pompidou (1971),Caption
"This competition is notable for its effect on architecture in general. With 681 proposals,",Paragraph
at the time it was the most widely entered in the history of architectural design,Paragraph
"competitions. Officially commissioned by the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, the project",Paragraph
"was actually initiated by French President Georges Pompidou, who wanted to be",Paragraph
remembered after the end of his seven-year term of office. The program was for a,Paragraph
"complex that could accommodate all forms of art and, perhaps more important, draw",Paragraph
large numbers of visitors.,Paragraph
"Among others the jury included architects Philip Johnson, Oscar Niemeyer, and Jorn",Paragraph
"Utzon. When it came time for the jury to assess the projects, Utzon was absent for health",Paragraph
"reasons. To maintain the international character of the jury, he was replaced by Herman",Paragraph
"Liebaers, Belgian director of the Royal Library in Brussels, and not by the original",Paragraph
"reserve jury member, French architect Henri-Pierre Maillard. In a nearly unanimous vote,",Paragraph
the design of Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers was selected as the winner. The entry was,Paragraph
"cited for its use of only half the available site, the flexibility of the interior, and the",Paragraph
transparency of the exterior.,Paragraph
"Unfortunately, the enthusiasm of the jury was not shared by the public. Protests began",Paragraph
as soon as the jury decision was announced and lasted for several years. A group of,Paragraph
"French architects even went so far as to attempt, through legal channels, to prevent the",Paragraph
design from ever being built. That they were unsuccessful in these attempts is a tribute to,Paragraph
"President Pompidou, who himself was less than enamored of the project initially yet",Paragraph
stood by the expertise of his jury. The jury was correct in noting that architecture was,Paragraph
“entering a phase the effects of which will not be confined to France but which will make,Paragraph
themselves felt throughout the world.”,Paragraph
The competition was to have a lasting effect on architecture in Paris. Expanding on,Paragraph
"Pompidou’s example, when Francois Mitterand became president of France in 1981, he",Paragraph
initiated a series of competitions that resulted in the Grands Projets (Grand Projects).,Paragraph
"Although architectural design competitions remain a source of controversy, they",Paragraph
continue to be held because they provide many benefits despite drawbacks such as the,Paragraph
"cost of the competition to the client and to the profession, the possibility of selecting an",Paragraph
"inexperienced architect, and the absence of a dialogue between the client and the",Paragraph
architect. They are an excellent source for discovering new talent and provide a venue for,Paragraph
exploring new methods for conceiving architecture. They are usually able to maintain the,Paragraph
focus on design rather than on other aspects of the architectural process. Competitions,Paragraph
can also stimulate a public dialogue.,Paragraph
Although the major 20th-century architectural design competitions are too numerous,Paragraph

COMPUTERS AND ARCHITECTURE,Title
"To realize an example of architecture, the object must be described. However, this in",Paragraph
itself is insufficient—the process of realizing the object must itself be supported. It is in,Paragraph
both these dimensions that computers have been of benefit in the practice of architecture,Paragraph
in the 20th century. The use of computers in architectural design has been motivated by a,Paragraph
"number of factors and driven by others, and has come to reflect the evolution of practice",Paragraph
through the last half of the 20th century.,Paragraph
The work of an architect started the century relying heavily on teams of,Paragraph
"colleagues, employees, consultants, and contractors; by the close of the",Paragraph
"century, although the practice of architecture was much the same, the",Paragraph
picture had changed to include computing tools in almost every team and,Paragraph
"every practice, drawing the participants closer together through the whole",Paragraph
sequence of events leading to the construction of a building. As this,Paragraph
"change took place, the challenge with the use of computing tools came to",Paragraph
"be recognized as the challenge of management, not technology.",Paragraph
Describing the Building,Title
Buildings can be described in two ways. They can be described by performance,Paragraph
"(including quantities), or they can be drawn. Initially, computers were seen as",Paragraph
"manipulators of data in the simplest sense: calculators and organizers. Thus, when",Paragraph
"computers were first made accessible to designers, it was largely in the areas of planning",Paragraph
"and engineering that applications were first undertaken. In these fields, design could be",Paragraph
seen to rely on the handling of large data sets as well as the manipulation of equations in,Paragraph
"the calculation of quantified results. More traditionally, a building is drawn: The",Paragraph
"geometries of the building are set forth by means of lines, straight or curved, or volumes.",Paragraph
A second application of computers is in the creation and manipulation of graphics.,Paragraph
Although computers could be applied to data manipulation and calculation with more,Paragraph
"simple interfaces of card readers and printers, architectural graphics required more",Paragraph
sophisticated user interfaces such as display screens and input devices supporting,Paragraph
pointing and drawing. Because the practice of architecture relies heavily on graphic,Paragraph
"communication, the development of computer graphic devices was highly influential on",Paragraph
the spread of computer use in design. The evolution of computer graphics can therefore,Paragraph
be considered discretely when reviewing the history of computer-aided architectural,Paragraph
design.,Paragraph
Computer Graphics,Title
The first implementation of such systems supporting what we might recognize as a,Paragraph
"computer graphics system can be found in 1950, when MIT’s Whirlwind computer",Paragraph
system was used to support a refreshed vector screen for display of graphics. This system,Paragraph
"can be considered a first-generation computer, running with vacuum tubes and",Paragraph
consuming considerable space and power. Limitations in the interfaces as well as cost-,Paragraph
effective access to computational systems meant that it was not until 1963 that Ivan E.,Paragraph
"Sutherland presented _ the first full-fledged, operational computer-aided design system.",Paragraph
"This system ran on second-generation TX-2 computers, using transistors for computation,",Paragraph
and refreshed vector displays and light pen for the user interface. Several other,Paragraph
implementations of computer graphic systems were developed in academic settings,Paragraph
"during the early 1960s, leading to the conference “Architecture and the Computer” in",Paragraph
1964.,Paragraph
In late 1964 IBM demonstrated their DAC-1 system to support graphic interaction in,Paragraph
automobile design. From the introduction of this system came increasing use of,Paragraph
"interactive computer-aided design systems by automobile and aerospace firms, so that by",Paragraph
"end of the 1960s, commercial use of computer graphics was proven, although only in",Paragraph
applications that supported high-cost factors. The first computer graphic tool specifically,Paragraph
"for architectural application was ARK-2, introduced in the early 1970s.",Paragraph
"General use of computers in architectural design had to wait until the early 1980s,",Paragraph
when computer systems had reduced in cost by a factor yet again to make it feasible for,Paragraph
large practices to purchase workstations. The final impetus for widespread use of,Paragraph
computer graphics came when miniaturization of computer circuits was achieved and,Paragraph
computing systems dropped by yet another factor. The personal computer was introduced,Paragraph
(1982) and software developers provided tools that could be used in a normal office,Paragraph
"environment at a lower cost. As hardware became cheaper and hence more accessible,",Paragraph
computers came to be widespread and were common tools in every design practice and,Paragraph
activity.,Paragraph
"Software developed initially to describe buildings as threedimensional data models,",Paragraph
"but as workstations became more common, users demanded simpler two-dimensional",Paragraph
"descriptions for drawing, rather than digital modeling. As personal computers were",Paragraph
"adopted in practice, the most popular computer tools in practice were drafting systems.",Paragraph
"As the smaller workstations became more powerful, more complex software could be",Paragraph
"developed for use on these cheaper platforms, and rendering and presentation software",Paragraph
"became widely available. Initially capable of displaying only simple forms and colors,",Paragraph
"these software systems evolved to portray lighting, surface textures, and colors more",Paragraph
accurately. By the 1990s such systems were being used in architectural practice to,Paragraph
"prepare animations of design ideas for presentation to clients, regulators, and potential",Paragraph
users.,Paragraph
"Traditionally, building designs are communicated visually by two-dimensional",Paragraph
"descriptions, such as in drawings, as well as by three-dimensional descriptions, such as",Paragraph
models. From the start computer graphic systems supported three-dimensional,Paragraph
"descriptions, although it was not easy to convert these to paper-based drawings.",Paragraph
Computer graphics thus came to be categorized into distinct tool sets: drawing tools in,Paragraph
which two-dimensional descriptions are created and virtual reality systems in which the,Paragraph
user interacts with three-dimensional representations. Some software avoids the problems,Paragraph
of full three-dimensional representation with simulating three-dimensional forms by,Paragraph
extruding two-dimensional shapes or assembling (as in a card model) two-dimensional,Paragraph
drawings in a three-dimensional space. Virtual reality systems have proved to be,Paragraph
"cumbersome and overly complex for either designers or clients to use and, after 30 years",Paragraph
"of development, have not yet realized the benefits anticipated in architectural design.",Paragraph
"As computers came to be used in design, it was found to be possible to",Paragraph
describe forms digitally that may not be apparent or obtainable through,Paragraph
"manual methods of working. For example, parametric design came to be",Paragraph
"used—a method in which particular properties of a shape, dimensional or",Paragraph
"otherwise, could be adjusted as the design progressed. If the parameters",Paragraph
"were geometric, for example, the shape of a design might change",Paragraph
according to other properties such as time or capacity. Using these,Paragraph
"computational attributes, designers have explored forms that are",Paragraph
sufficiently complex to require computer-driven digital output devices,Paragraph
such as robotic cutters or rapid prototyping machines. By use of these,Paragraph
"devices, a more sculptural architecture came to be explored by the end of",Paragraph
"the century (see, e.g., Gehry’s works from the late 1990s). These",Paragraph
sculptural forms also pushed the use of robotics in manufacturing of,Paragraph
architectural components.,Paragraph
Nongraphic Descriptions,Title
Graphic descriptions of a building are not sufficient to erect or maintain a building. Many,Paragraph
"aspects of design rely on quantitative analysis, such as the prediction of the energy",Paragraph
consumption of a particular design. These quantitative design procedures typically lend,Paragraph
themselves to automation and were the first type of design activity to which computers,Paragraph
were applied. Numerous computer programs have been written to help designers estimate,Paragraph
"the cost of their design—its performance in various parameters such as energy, wind,",Paragraph
"noise, and structural behavior, among others. Later, these nongraphic analyses came to be",Paragraph
integrated with graphics and the results of the calculations displayed on the digital model,Paragraph
"of the building proposed. Thus, the results of a structural analysis program can be shown",Paragraph
with the building bending in digital wind.,Paragraph
The construction of a building is supported not only by drawings but also by textual,Paragraph
"descriptions, such as specifications of tabular quantifications of materials (e.g., bills of",Paragraph
quantities). Computers are particularly useful in organizing and accessing large quantities,Paragraph
"of data; that is, as database management tools. In early software developments,",Paragraph
applications were created that linked geometric descriptions to nongeometric,Paragraph
"descriptions, permitting the generation of text descriptions directly from graphical",Paragraph
"descriptions; for example, the automated printing of draft construction specifications.",Paragraph
With the recognition of the programmers that building design itself,Paragraph
"represents only a small portion of the life cycle of a building, computers",Paragraph
have come to support facilities management through the remainder of the,Paragraph
"life cycle, tracking building use and maintenance. Computers now are",Paragraph
"extensively used in the management of buildings, both for monitoring and",Paragraph
operating particular equipment within a building (which processes,Paragraph
generate data that can be used in design analysis for subsequent designs),Paragraph
and for tracking usage and scheduling maintenance and replacement of,Paragraph
elements.,Paragraph
Supporting the Process,Title
The use of computer tools in architecture can be seen to track architectural theory in the,Paragraph
"20th century, although perhaps time shifted by a few decades at the start. Initial",Paragraph
applications of computers were quantitative and focused on calculating answers to,Paragraph
specific questions arising in design. In the 1960s this application of computers fit well,Paragraph
with the attitude that design was a problem-solving task in which specific design,Paragraph
questions could be isolated and solved and the results integrated to produce a final,Paragraph
answer. Design could be considered an optimization of solution searching in a well-,Paragraph
defined problem space (see Simon 1981 for a particularly clear exposition of this,Paragraph
"perspective). In this approach to design, the architect can structure the problem space and",Paragraph
"inform the computer of the data to be considered, and the computer can search, through",Paragraph
"calculation and data manipulation, all possible permutations of solutions and identify the",Paragraph
optimal answer. Computational tools were developed through the 1960s to solve,Paragraph
"particular problems, such as needs analysis and schedules of accommodation,",Paragraph
"minimization of energy consumption, optimization of space layouts, traffic flow analysis,",Paragraph
and plan layouts based on synthesis of quantified factors. Applications were used in,Paragraph
"producing optimized standard plans for hospitals and schools, in designing industrialized",Paragraph
"construction methods, and in planning new urban centers and housing areas.",Paragraph
"After a decade or more of such use, it became obvious that approaching design as",Paragraph
segmented questions to be solved through individually optimized solutions did not,Paragraph
"adequately address the broader synthetic aspects of successful design. At the same time,",Paragraph
computer tools had developed to the point that large databases could be stored for online,Paragraph
access and querying. Research in artificial intelligence has led to successful rule-based,Paragraph
computer programming tools to query databases and to simulate reasoning. This led to,Paragraph
design applications being developed to support knowledge-based design processes.,Paragraph
"Drawing on successes in technical applications such as oil exploration, rule-based expert",Paragraph
"systems were developed for architectural design. In these, expert knowledge and",Paragraph
reasoning processes were captured from successful designers and design domains to,Paragraph
create knowledge bases in particular. The shift to knowledge-based design reflected a,Paragraph
"broader perception that architectural design needed to incorporate a wide range of issues,",Paragraph
not merely those expressible in simple computational terms.,Paragraph
The third fundamental shift in computer-aided architectural design came,Paragraph
about when the Internet provided widespread connectivity. Architectural,Paragraph
"design has always been practiced in teams, requiring that team members",Paragraph
collaborate on the evolving description of a building and communicate,Paragraph
these descriptions to one another to ensure that all team members work,Paragraph
toward the same goal. By the mid-1990s such teams were commonly,Paragraph
"communicating by sending data between team members on disks or tapes,",Paragraph
thereby bringing together the work of team members through the computer,Paragraph
and facilitating the division of work to permit concurrent activities. On the,Paragraph
"advent of the Internet, communication moved away from physical media",Paragraph
"and toward purely digital forms, allowing projects to be built with the",Paragraph
"majority of communication in digital form. Thus, the computer and its",Paragraph
"connectivity came to support the collaborative production of buildings,",Paragraph
bringing together not only architects but also consultants and contractors,Paragraph
and enabling team members to proceed on their own tasks while,Paragraph
maintaining close coordination of the parts.,Paragraph
Supporting the Business,Title
The business of architecture has adapted to accommodate the use of computers. Tasks,Paragraph
"and duties in architecture extend beyond design and include project management,",Paragraph
"research, and construction administration. In these functions as well as design, computers",Paragraph
"have come to be essential tools. For example, in construction administration Internet-",Paragraph
based communication enables the construction administrators to observe construction,Paragraph
progress using Web-cam video images transmitted from the site back to the office.,Paragraph
Robotics is being applied to particular construction projects to execute procedures not,Paragraph
"easily carried out by hand, to speed up construction times, or to reduce the dangers to",Paragraph
which people are exposed on-site. Workers in remote site offices can access online,Paragraph
drawings and documentation as easily as their colleagues in the main office. Project,Paragraph
managers can access online current financial information and use this to complete,Paragraph
"projects on budget and schedule. Using digital technologies, team members, including",Paragraph
"clients, have been drawn together and coordination has been improved through better",Paragraph
"communication. By the end of the century, several e-commerce web sites were actively",Paragraph
"supporting design communication, component sourcing, and construction processes.",Paragraph

SWEDEN,Title
"Designed by Sven Markelius, completed 1932",Caption
The Halsingborg Concert Hall was built in 1932 on Drottning-gatan opposite St.,Paragraph
"Jérgen’s Square. Hailed as a pioneering work of functionalism, it is also the first",Paragraph
monumental exponent of the modern style in Sweden. The long and complicated history,Paragraph
"reflects changes that occurred in the first decades of the 20th century, not only",Paragraph
architecturally but also socially.,Paragraph
In 1911 a permanent orchestra was established in Halsingborg with its spa. In 1915 it,Paragraph
was suggested that the local authori ties should erect a society house (Borgarnas Hus),Paragraph
"with a concert space. Because public funding was not forthcoming, the industrialist",Paragraph
Henry Dunker suggested in 1916 a corporate venture; Dunker managed to secure a,Paragraph
"majority of shares and became, in practice, the builder. Later, it gave him the possibility",Paragraph
to offer unflagging support for the radical new ideas of the architect.,Paragraph
From the outset two lines were represented in the building committee: the idea of a,Paragraph
"multipurpose society house and the idea of a single-purpose concert hall. Initially, the",Paragraph
"first idea came to influence the various projects proposed, whereas the latter idea won out",Paragraph
"in the end. In 1918, on their own initiative, two young architects, Sven Markelius and",Paragraph
"Olof Lundgren, submitted drawings for a hotel, including a concert space and assembly",Paragraph
"rooms, that was never realized. They had already won an architectural competition for a",Paragraph
local residential area that only Markelius was commissioned to execute as his first,Paragraph
independent project.,Paragraph
In 1925 an architectural competition was announced for a society house containing a,Paragraph
"concert hall, spa, assembly rooms, lecture halls, banqueting halls, and a movie theater.",Paragraph
"Among the invited architects, Markelius appeared once more and was subsequently",Paragraph
awarded the commission.,Paragraph
"Architecturally, the 1920s in Sweden are famed for their classicism, internationally",Paragraph
"dubbed “Swedish Grace.” Following the lead of his former employer, Ivar Tengbom,",Paragraph
"whose famous Stockholm Concert Hall was conceived in 1920 and inaugurated in 1926,",Paragraph
Markelius originally turned his eye to classical architecture to find his inspiration. The,Paragraph
main facade of his final winning contribution offered an austere prostyle Roman temple,Paragraph
"front with columns of giant order based on the temple of Hadrian, thereby strongly",Paragraph
resembling its Stockholm forerunner. Even the rectangular ground plan for the concert,Paragraph
hall was based on classical precepts.,Paragraph
"Meanwhile, social and cultural conditions changed. In response to this, Markelius",Paragraph
made new drawings in 1929-30. Jadelius has shown that he then felt that contemporary,Paragraph
"needs were better served with a more anonymous, democratic architecture that did not",Paragraph
"demand a classical humanistic education from its audience. Thus, when the project was",Paragraph
"finalized, all traces of classicism had been stripped from the proposed building.",Paragraph
"Professional critics were thrilled at the result, but locally there arose a furor, as the",Paragraph
architect had not bothered to inform the authorities of the change in formal character. In,Paragraph
the end the architect was sued but won in court because he had followed all legal,Paragraph
stipulations as to security and hygienic issues.,Paragraph
"In keeping with the tenets of functionalism, the exterior form now emanated from the",Paragraph
"bold plan, which was based on strict rationality and separation of functions. The building",Paragraph
"was given an L shape, but with semicircles bulging out from each side of the entrance",Paragraph
wing. The latter part of the building contained three floors and was considerably lower,Paragraph
"than the major wing, where the concert space and the movie theater below were housed.",Paragraph
The members of the audience were expected to arrive by car and enter the concert hall,Paragraph
under a cantilevered roof carried by straight pillars that was supposed to protect from,Paragraph
inclement weather. Tickets could be purchased in a specially designed space on the first,Paragraph
"floor. The visitor would then proceed to the cloakrooms placed inside the semicircles,",Paragraph
whose very shape and organization were designed to facilitate an efficient decloaking and,Paragraph
"a smooth flow toward the main vestibule preceding the concert hall. Originally, both a",Paragraph
"restaurant and an outdoor cafe were intended for the audience, the former placed below",Paragraph
the cloakrooms and the latter on top of them on the roof. Eva Rudberg has pointed out,Paragraph
similarities between the larger auditorium and Alvar Aalto’s Finnish Theater (inaugurated,Paragraph
in 1928) in Abo.,Paragraph
"Because music consumption had become the main purpose, the acoustics became of",Paragraph
"paramount importance. Although in 1929 Markelius visited the paradigmatic Salle Pleyel,",Paragraph
"built in 1927 to house the Paris orchestra, he chose to retain the rectangular form of the",Paragraph
"concert hall rather than copying Lyon’s irregular plan based on bisecting parabolas. Still,",Paragraph
Lyon was contracted to aid him in improving the acoustics in Halsingborg. Even though,Paragraph
"the acoustics turned out to be excellent, the rectangular plan was later criticized, as it was",Paragraph
"regarded an unfortunate remnant of classical form. Therefore, the Halsingborg Concert",Paragraph
"Hall did not gain followers in its interior arrangements, and the concert hall that was",Paragraph
erected in Gothenburg had other inspirational sources.,Paragraph
"The exterior was highly acclaimed by the critics, with its stark, white concrete walls",Paragraph
enlivened by huge areas of glazing and the side buttressing necessary to support the roof,Paragraph
"over the concert hall. In particular, the glazing of the entrance facade is a major feature,",Paragraph
intended to entice passersby into the building. From the outside one may follow the flow,Paragraph
of the entering welldressed audience until people vanish inside the concert space. This,Paragraph
"spectacle was meant by the architect to create a living decorative effect, making any other",Paragraph
"ornament superfluous. In other spaces, the glazing served the people inside the building,",Paragraph
"as in the restaurant, where the opening of the wall offered a spectacular view over the sea.",Paragraph
"Unfortunately, the dining room was felt to be discouragingly naked and simple and never",Paragraph
"became a success. After only two years, this space was given over to the city library.",Paragraph
"Despite this and other minor changes, the Halsingborg Concert Hall has not seen much",Paragraph
alteration and is still considered a masterpiece of the functionalist era.,Paragraph

CONCRETE,Title
It is difficult if not impossible to imagine the 20th century without concrete. Surely the,Paragraph
landscape of modernity and modernization would be unrecognizable without it. By 1900,Paragraph
"concrete may indeed have been considered modern, but as pointed out by technical",Paragraph
"manuals throughout the century, it was by no means a new material. Ancient builders put",Paragraph
"it to use, most notably the Romans, who built walls (faced with brick) and arcuated spans",Paragraph
(the 145-foot span of the Pantheon’s dome the most famous and well-preserved,Paragraph
"example). This classical pedigree appealed to many architects of the early 20th century,",Paragraph
although modern concrete practice had more recent origins. Europeans experimented,Paragraph
"with it in the 18th century, when the English engineer John Smeaton used a form of",Paragraph
hydraulic cement (a cement that hardens underwater) to rebuild the wall and lighthouse at,Paragraph
Eddy-stone off the Cornwall coast in 1756. The French began their own experiments,Paragraph
"some 30 years later, using a combination of clay and cement from limestone. Louis Vicat",Paragraph
"perfected hydraulic cement around 1800, and by 1850 Joseph Monier was producing",Paragraph
concrete flowerpots and sewer pipes using wire mesh and timber molds. In 1824 the,Paragraph
"English bricklayer John Aspdin invented a type of cement dubbed “Portland,” after the",Paragraph
"stone it resembled. This high-strength variety proved crucial, for it became, and remains,",Paragraph
the standard binding agent in the concrete used today. Portland cement was exported to,Paragraph
"the United States at the end of the American Civil War, and as in much of Europe,",Paragraph
concrete frame structures were constructed for a variety of industrial uses. Particularly,Paragraph
"valuable for fireproof attributes, concrete effectively insulated the iron or steel embedded",Paragraph
"within. In some places, such as the American northeast, they were a relatively common",Paragraph
sight by the start of the 20th century. By 1887 the French engineer and building,Paragraph
entrepreneur Fran¢ois Hennebique patented a host of techniques for embedding steel bars,Paragraph
in concrete.,Paragraph
How best to utilize concrete and how to appreciate and interpret its,Paragraph
cultural meaning remained one of the more interesting and politically,Paragraph
volatile architectural debates of the century. This ongoing state of flux,Paragraph
involved more than technical development. By the end of World War II,Paragraph
"engineers, architects, builders, and others helped develop concrete as a",Paragraph
common building material across the globe. From great hope to corporate,Paragraph
"or state-induced eyesore, perhaps no other material would be perceived in",Paragraph
so many contrasting ways during the 20th century. One of several,Paragraph
materials embraced by avant-garde architects for its revolutionary,Paragraph
"prospects, critics would come to vilify the material, associating it with the",Paragraph
oppressive characteristics of modern power structures. Through it all the,Paragraph
material maintained a pragmatic usefulness.,Paragraph
Technical Aspects,Title
Concrete is a composite material produced by mixing a paste of cement and water with,Paragraph
"inert materials called aggregates. Because concrete is mixed and poured, it is well suited",Paragraph
"for molds and can be molded around reinforcing steel, a practice so common that by 1900",Paragraph
nearly all concrete structures were reinforced in some way by steel hidden from view.,Paragraph
"The first ingredient, cement paste, is the binding agent, and a number of different types",Paragraph
"were developed throughout the century. Consisting of Portland cement and water, this",Paragraph
"paste hardens via a curing process called hydration. The second ingredient, aggregates,",Paragraph
varies considerably in size from sand particles to 3-inch rocks mixed with the paste.,Paragraph
"Lightweight varieties of concrete substitute these aggregates for expanded shale, slate, or",Paragraph
slag to reduce the finished product’s weight. Because concrete’s usefulness is,Paragraph
"complicated by its own dead load, a variety of engineers and builders have sought",Paragraph
inventive alternatives. One of the more unusual experiments was conducted by the,Paragraph
"American architect Bernard May-beck (1923), who sought a low-cost remedy for the",Paragraph
"housing shortage after a fire devastated a portion of Berkeley, California. In a clothes-",Paragraph
"washing drum he combined cement paste, water, and sand; added some chemicals; and",Paragraph
after mixing the concoction he dipped burlap sacks into the tank and pasted them onto,Paragraph
wooden wall studs to form a concrete cladding. Calling this technique Bubble Stone for,Paragraph
"its unique appearance, Maybeck boasted that home owners could use it themselves",Paragraph
because an average man could lift a hay-bale-sized chunk of this “stone” above his head.,Paragraph
"Well-made concrete enjoys significant resistance to compression, but unlike steel it",Paragraph
has little strength against tensile stress. The compressive strength of concrete is primarily,Paragraph
based on the ratio of water to cement. Experiments both in the field and in laboratories,Paragraph
led engineers in an ongoing effort to increase the material’s strength and decrease curing,Paragraph
"time. Generally speaking, the smaller the ratio of water to cement paste (i.e., the less",Paragraph
"water compared to cement paste), the stronger the concrete.",Paragraph
"Once mixed, concrete is poured into molds called formwork, which may vary from a",Paragraph
"hole dug out of the earth for a foundation, to wood boards bolted together, to fiberglass",Paragraph
"panels. In some cases an entire substructure of forms must be constructed, itself a self-",Paragraph
supporting structure requiring careful design and inspection by engineers and contractors.,Paragraph
"In order to ensure a more controlled mixing process, concrete elements are often poured",Paragraph
in a factory or in a semiremote location on the building site set aside for the purpose. The,Paragraph
pour is crucial because laborers must work the paste and aggregates evenly throughout,Paragraph
the formwork so that they do not shift prelaid rebar out of its intended positions. Pipes,Paragraph
and conduits that must pass through the finished concrete must be set into position prior,Paragraph
to the pour as well and remain undisturbed by laborers’ efforts to fill the forms. As the,Paragraph
"mix is spread within the formwork, laborers must ensure that all voids are filled and that",Paragraph
"the aggregate is evenly distributed. The more fluid the mix, that is, the greater the ratio of",Paragraph
"water to cement paste, the more workable the pour. Increasing the water makes for easier",Paragraph
"construction, but weakens compressive strength. In colder climates air-entraining agents",Paragraph
are often added to increase workability and resistance to the heaving resulting from water,Paragraph
turning to ice.,Paragraph
"Concrete must be mixed for a sustained period of time, so that the finished product",Paragraph
exhibits the properties of strength and durability designed by engineers. The development,Paragraph
and widespread marketing of gasoline-powered automobiles and trucks have had an,Paragraph
"influence in the mixing process, especially in the United States. The truck was both a",Paragraph
prerequisite and a consequence of the parallel development of concrete construction.,Paragraph
"Improvements in road construction, a development that was facilitated by the concrete",Paragraph
"industry, in turn facilitated the widespread acceptance of the automobile. Likewise, the",Paragraph
cement-mixing gasoline-powered truck is ideally suited to concrete construction because,Paragraph
"while en route from the factory the truck mixes the cement paste, water, and aggregates",Paragraph
"in a revolving drum. Once poured and left to remain still, concrete sets in up to three",Paragraph
"days, then cures for usually one month, depending on the type of ingredients in the",Paragraph
mixture and the climatic conditions at the site or factory. After engineers determine the,Paragraph
"concrete is strong enough to support its own weight, laborers remove the formwork for",Paragraph
reuse at the next pour. In cold conditions curing concrete must be covered to ensure the,Paragraph
temperature necessary for developing a designed compressive strength. Curing is a,Paragraph
chemical process (not a process of desiccation) in which water reacts with the cement,Paragraph
paste and generates heat. Although hydration can occur even when concrete is,Paragraph
"underwater, even well-made concrete is not completely watertight. Over time exposed",Paragraph
surfaces tend to absorb water that can pass into imterior space. Other liabilities were,Paragraph
"discovered throughout the century, such as the material’s poor insulating properties and",Paragraph
the particularly dangerous problem called creep. Horizontal concrete structural members,Paragraph
"(slabs and beams) develop the tendency to gradually deflect over long periods of time,",Paragraph
and this can become so severe as to make buildings uninhabitable. Structural engineers,Paragraph
devised prestressing strategies to counter this creeping deflection.,Paragraph
Properties of strength and workability have not monopolized,Paragraph
experimentation. Designers and builders have devised myriad ways of,Paragraph
altering the construction process to obtain specific aesthetic effects.,Paragraph
"Various admixtures, especially those added at the end ofa pour, have been",Paragraph
used to alter the color of the finished material. Paolo Soleri experimented,Paragraph
with using mounds of sand as a formwork in building concrete shells and,Paragraph
"half domes in the Arizona desert, even using the red and yellow color of",Paragraph
the local sand and clay as part of the cement paste and aggregate mixture,Paragraph
"(Arcosanti, 1970). These colors were transferred to the finished product.",Paragraph

aesthetic possibilities at the close of the century.,Paragraph
The fact that steel-reinforced concrete structures were already fairly common by the,Paragraph
"start of the 20th century, at least in parts of Western Europe and North America, is",Paragraph
attested to by the number of notable works designed and constructed between 1900 and,Paragraph

"some 30 years as an industrial building material, by the turn of the century it was still too",Paragraph
"new to be associated with industrialism. That distinction belonged to iron and steel, the",Paragraph
constituent elements of a landscape troubled by smokestacks and locomotives. Many,Paragraph
"architects and engineers also looked to concrete as an alternative to stone, perhaps",Paragraph
because of the many similarities between the two materials. The weight of stone tended,Paragraph
"to be a prime factor as a building material, requiring extensive formwork during",Paragraph
"construction. Concrete was perceived as the thinking man’s building material, requiring a",Paragraph
"scientific mind to fully exploit its properties, which helped rehabilitate its status as a",Paragraph
"rough and crude version of stone. Mixtures and ratios, after all, required experimentation",Paragraph
and theorizing by engineers who took out patents on their ideas. The possibility of,Paragraph
creating a monolithic structure excited architects who understood that with concrete each,Paragraph
"element (walls, columns, floor, and roof) would resist loads as one integrated structure.",Paragraph
"This was an important and tantalizing potential, because for many architects in the early",Paragraph
"20th century, the key problem of the day was finding a way to bring pragmatic",Paragraph
considerations of the engineer together with the architect’s taste for beauty and formal,Paragraph
unity.,Paragraph
The French architect Perret is generally looked to as the first 20th-century architect to,Paragraph
fuse the new medium of concrete with existing attempts to find a modern and modernized,Paragraph
"expression of architecture. Greatly influenced by the ideas of Viollet-le-Duc, Abbé",Paragraph
"Laugier, and especially his mentor Julien Guadet, he sought to extend and embrace",Paragraph
classical ideas about proportions and order to the technology of the 20th century. He saw,Paragraph
"concrete as an ideal medium for creating frame structures, articulating columns in a clear",Paragraph
"and rational expression of their structural use, rather than clothing and thus obscuring",Paragraph
them in cladding. To emphasize the trabeated character of the structural frame at the,Paragraph
"apartment building at 25 bis, rue Franklin, Perret designed the street-facing fenestration",Caption
"as large as local ordinances allowed. The structure was not clearly articulated; however,",Paragraph
Perret used a subtle technique of varying color and texture to distinguish what was load,Paragraph
bearing from what was not. By varying the color and texture of the facade panels and by,Paragraph
recessing windows and cantilevering the second floor beyond the ground floor ever so,Paragraph
"slightly, Perret deemphasized the mass-wall characteristics of the concrete. The effort to",Paragraph
"read the facade like a frame-and-panel assemblage, a more truthful reading of the",Paragraph
"structure, was Perret’s way of maintaining continuity with the neorational ideas of the",Paragraph
past.,Paragraph
"The engineer, builder, and pioneer in concrete construction, Francois Hennebique,",Paragraph
acted as consultant on Perret’s project. Hennebique had several patents for concrete,Paragraph
"members already, and unlike the architect who strove for a homogeneous and uniform",Paragraph
"structural expression, Hennebique articulated the joints between column and beam by",Paragraph
thickening the columns and extending the beams in a cantilevered bracket (Hennebique,Paragraph
"House, Paris, 1904). Engineers such as Robert Maillart and Eugene Freyssinet, however,",Paragraph
were the first to appreciate concrete’s nonrectilinear potential. Maillart designed arcuated,Paragraph
"bridges whereas Freyssinet built factories with curvilinear concrete-shell roofs, and",Paragraph
perhaps their lack of concern over spatial enclosure allowed them the freedom to,Paragraph
experiment more easily with form and thus more fully capitalize on the unique prospects,Paragraph
of the material. Late 19th-century experiments with concrete reinforced by wire mesh,Paragraph
produced curvilinear ship hulls that prefigured this later engineering development. Perret,Paragraph
"by necessity had to think in terms of both space and structure, and influenced by the",Paragraph
"architectural concerns of his day, he was less willing to depart from the rectilinear norm",Paragraph
that marked architectural design at the turn of the century. Although concrete may have,Paragraph
"seemed an alternative to the industrial steel aesthetic, ironically architects increasingly",Paragraph
saw in the material an opportunity to use it as a medium for expressing the machine age.,Paragraph
For many repetition of the rectilinear module was the key. Le Corbusier’s influentia.,Paragraph

embodied in the clean and ornament-free lines of the steel-reinforced concrete. Le,Paragraph
"Corbusier asserted this system was an economical solution that could be mass-produced,",Paragraph
with wall elements added to complete this housing scheme. Although this model had little,Paragraph
"practical application during and immediately after the war, it was nonetheless a powerfu.",Paragraph
inspiration among architectural thinkers who sought a fit between modern materials and,Paragraph
"modern architectural aesthetics. As an idealized shelter, stripped of non-load-bearing",Paragraph
"elements and reduced to the purity of column and horizontal planar members, it was",Paragraph
hailed as a bold gesture toward a new symbolic architectural representation free of,Paragraph
historical iconography.,Paragraph
"Thirty years later Le Corbusier was busy designing an entire city (Chandigarh, India)",Paragraph
"out of concrete and masonry, but in 1946 he remarked on an important transformation of",Paragraph
thought that had taken place. From a “machine infatuation” to a more “spiritual” pursuit,Paragraph
"of the material’s potential, he claimed that architects now sought to tease out less sterile",Paragraph
formal aspects of concrete. The small music pavilion for the Phillips Company at the,Caption
1958 World Exposition in Brussels reveals how concrete could be thought of as more,Paragraph
than a respite from historical reference. As a technologically sophisticated building,Paragraph
"material ripe with technical problems, it was deemed ideal for creating a space that",Paragraph
celebrated a marriage between multiple and technologically sophisticated art forms. The,Paragraph
"project architect, Iannis Xenakis, designed the general layout, leaving Le Corbusier to",Paragraph
concentrate on finding formal expression to match the “electronic poem” composed by,Paragraph
"Edgard Varése, the multimedia piece that combined visual projection with electronic",Paragraph
sound. The architects devised a hyperbolic paraboloid shell to enclose the exhibition,Paragraph
"space, believing that using concrete here would be economical because this complex",Paragraph
form could be created with straight lines and repetitive rectilinear sections. The shells of,Paragraph
"the paraboloid needed to be thin—too thin, in fact, to cast in place—so the architects",Paragraph
sought the expertise of engineers in devising a system of prestressed panels formed on,Paragraph
"sand in a nearby warehouse, then bolted together and stiffened by longitudinal precast",Paragraph
ribs.,Paragraph
"The Phillips Pavilion, however, was an exception. For the most part, concrete had",Paragraph
supplanted stone as the building material of weight and dignity. Although engineers,Paragraph
occasionally utilized its fluid-form properties to advantage (see especially the most,Paragraph
"famous case, the Chapel Notre-Dame-du-Haut by Le Corbusier), architects typically",Paragraph
bowed to the thrift of rectilinearity. Concrete remained a conservative but increasingly,Paragraph
popular building material. Louis Kahn’s Salk Institute (1959-65) is perhaps the best,Paragraph
example illustrating how an architect could use the modernist idiom to create dignified,Paragraph
space. The blank gray laboratory facades alternating with fenestration and the mass of,Paragraph
concrete stair towers created a serene yet monumental outdoor court. Kahn christened,Paragraph
"this space “sublime,” a term repeated by critics at a loss to surpass the analysis of the",Paragraph
designer. The spiritual quality of this central but little-used space was the result of the,Paragraph
architect’s effort to bring together in an artistic treatment two disciplines that seemed to,Paragraph
"be yawning further apart in the 20th century. Again, architecture was to marry the",Paragraph
"rationalism of science to the romanticism of art, a marriage many architectural thinkers",Paragraph
believed was more important than ever after World War II and the advent of what many,Paragraph
"thought was the ultimate work of science, the atomic bomb. It was, in fact, the technical",Paragraph
"demands of materials like concrete that led architects like Pier Luigi Nervi, a pioneer in",Paragraph
"the use of concrete himself, to insist that “architecture is and must be a synthesis of",Paragraph
"technology and art,” rather than “separate aspects” of a building process. The architect’s",Paragraph
"role was changing—no longer an agent of technological change, but a mediator of",Paragraph
technology. Nervi gave a series of lectures at Harvard University in the early 1960s,Paragraph
"urging students and practitioners to embrace a disciplinary unity, a sentiment that belied",Paragraph
anxieties over the architect’s weakening influence. The technical demands of concrete,Paragraph
"forced engineers to specialize in its design and maintenance, a task few architects were",Paragraph
capable of handling competently.,Paragraph
"Although a naive booster of a synthesized design process, Nervi was at least prescient",Paragraph
about one aspect of concrete’s future. In those same lectures he predicted that concrete,Paragraph
would be utilized as the principal building material in ever-larger public and commercial,Paragraph
"projects. Across the globe governments and government agencies, as well as wealthy",Paragraph
"groups of profit-interested private companies, had already been forcing dramatic",Paragraph
"interventions in the landscape. Urban renewal and new towns, often composed of large-",Paragraph
"scale multiblock buildings, housing blocks, hotels, convention centers, and government",Paragraph
"administration centers, came to dominate wherever they were built. Modernist vocabulary",Paragraph
did not change by this embrace of the large and the hard as much as it grew in scale. The,Paragraph
"Brutalism movement grew out of this application of concrete and masonry, and the",Paragraph
multilane freeway elevated on giant-sized piers designed entirely by civil and structural,Paragraph
engineers came to mark the American urban landscape in particular. Even before Nervi,Paragraph
"finished his lectures, a skepticism of this progressive gigantism gained momentum,",Paragraph
particularly with such books as Jane Jacobs’s (1964). She fronted a chorus,Paragraph
questioning the inhumane character that resulted in part from gross-scaled concrete,Paragraph
"construction. Although but one of many building materials put to use in this boom,",Paragraph
concrete had finally supplanted steel as the epitome of modernity’s failings. Archi tects,Paragraph
who achieved fame via an expertise in the design of the monolithic concrete environment,Paragraph
watched as their careers withered into obscurity (see especially Paul Rudolph).,Paragraph
"The rise of critical regionalism as a critique of modernism, and especially the",Paragraph
"development of Postmodern architecture, has meant a shift away from the monolithic at",Paragraph
many scales. The large-scale concrete block has given way in architectural importance to,Paragraph
smaller works that have been built in a whole range of locales across the world. Even,Paragraph
large-scale building complexes have been commissioned in smaller pieces to a handful of,Paragraph
"architects. By the end of the 20th century, however, concrete continued to offer a small",Paragraph
number of architects the possibilities of abstract design in a medium affording a range of,Paragraph
formal possibilities limited not so much by physics as by budgets.,Paragraph
"Although concrete remained a vital structural material, as an aesthetic",Paragraph
medium it was perceived as a stylistically austere means of creating,Paragraph
minimalist space but only at great expense. Architects such as Enrique,Paragraph
Norton of Mexico City and Tadao Ando of Osaka relied on many,Paragraph
"techniques from the modernist boom, using concrete as a decorative as",Paragraph
well as spatial and structural medium. They went to the trouble of,Paragraph
designing the formwork themselves to create a grid of indentations,Paragraph
punctuated by bolt holes left over from the forms during curing. In House,Paragraph
"Le by Norton (Mexico City, 1995), the three-story concrete facade was",Paragraph
articulated with this pattern in a way that softened the otherwise massive,Paragraph
plane while maintaining an expression of urban privacy that embodies the,Paragraph
heart of this compact courtyard house. Ando’s austere but elegant Church,Paragraph
"of the Light (Osaka, 1989) used a similar texture derived from impressions",Paragraph
left by the formwork. In this case the partitioning of the concrete walls by,Paragraph
"the grid of form lines gave the finished surface a taut effect, one that",Paragraph
makes the mass wall seem more like a tensile surface. The small size of,Paragraph
"the church, coupled with the application of simple but stark openings",Paragraph
"articulating one space from the next, meant that as the principal finish",Paragraph
"material, the concrete was not overwhelming or oppressive.",Paragraph
Political and Economic Influences,Title
Concrete persistently teased architects with the allure of its fluid form and sculptural,Paragraph
potential. Steel-reiforced concrete has indeed been designed and constructed as,Paragraph
"curvilinear elements, but such practice proved expensive because forms typically had to",Paragraph
be customized and could not be used repetitively. Using concrete as a finish material,Paragraph
meant ensuring a smooth and visually clean and stainless appearance. This required,Paragraph
"increased care, skill, and on-site inspection, which translated into higher budgets. It is",Paragraph
"perhaps ironic that at the end of the century, when curvilinear forms had become an",Paragraph
"obsession for many architects in a wide variety of materials, concrete had become",Paragraph
associated with a rectilinearity that Perret would have appreciated 100 years earlier. The,Paragraph
"Stone Cloud House by Kyu Sung Woo (Seoul, 1996) reveals the pragmatic uses concrete",Paragraph
was often put to at the end of the century. The villa encloses a courtyard that spatially,Paragraph
"unites the extended family, each unit of the family dwelling in spaces enclosed by cast-",Paragraph
"in-place concrete bearing walls, but finished with stone from a local quarry. The stone is",Paragraph
arranged in a pattern of square-panel courses that echo the stone flooring as well as the,Paragraph
rectilinearity of the various spatial units that enclose the court-yard. The pattern is also,Paragraph
vaguely reflective of the concrete it hides and adorns.,Paragraph
The success of concrete as a building material early in the century stemmed in large,Paragraph
"part from the argument by builders, engineers, and architects that concrete was cheaper",Paragraph
than timber and stone. This was true only because the majority of labor required in,Paragraph
creating concrete structures demanded less skill and training than stonemasonry.,Paragraph
"Concrete construction demanded a shift in thinking, a shift that had profound",Paragraph
consequences in the construction industry at large. At the turn of the century those few,Paragraph
"architects, engineers, and contractors who insisted on the application of steel-reinforced",Paragraph
concrete strove to bring science into a practice dominated by a craft tradition. In their,Paragraph
view the demands of concrete construction meant that technical innovation would prevail,Paragraph
over what was perceived as the monopoly of an artisan class.,Paragraph
"Unlike stone construction, a monumental material that concrete ultimately came to",Paragraph
"supplant in many respects, concrete requires a small group of highly skilled technicians to",Paragraph
ensure a proper and safe construction process. This stratification of labor between the,Paragraph
"skilled engineers and foremen, and the unskilled and in some cases untrained laborers,",Paragraph
proved to be an important and distinctive aspect of the modernization of the building,Paragraph
industry as a whole and became typical of virtually every modernizing industry.,Paragraph
"Demanding empirical testing both in the laboratory and in the field, as well as inspections",Paragraph
"that only well-educated and trained engineers were capable of, this new organization",Paragraph
effectively diminished the power of older family and regionalbased trade networks. These,Paragraph
"older craft unions, as historian Amy Slaton has argued, the bricklayers and the",Paragraph
"stonecutters in particular, “had little influence in the concrete industry, and technological",Paragraph
advance helped render their diminished role both possible and permanent” (2000).,Paragraph
The success of this managerial transformation has been amply demonstrated by the,Paragraph
"widespread synthesis of the concrete construction industry across the globe, particularly",Paragraph
"in the post-World War II period, and its effect on other construction trades. Steel-",Paragraph
"reinforced concrete structures, many resembling in skeletal form Le Corbusier’s Dom-ino",Paragraph
"house, have appeared in regions where unskilled labor is plentiful. The limiting factor in",Paragraph
such construction tended to be set by the cost of reinforcing steel rather than the technical,Paragraph
"expertise of the engineering profession in the newly liberated nations, many of which",Paragraph
"realized an acute need for large-scale buildings to house new political, financial, and",Paragraph
"domestic populations. Many governments, particularly in the Soviet Union, as well as",Paragraph
"myriad newly independent nations after the war, built large-scale projects in concrete to",Paragraph
house the populace. Urban renewal in the United States and postwar reconstruction,Title
largely funded by the Marshall Plan vaulted concrete into a position as the preeminent,Paragraph
building material during the 1950s and 1960s and even later. In some regard the,Paragraph

epitomized by massively scaled visions of new cities such as Le Corbusier’s plans to,Paragraph

"including barrel vaults, octagonal domes, and hyperbolic paraboloids.",Paragraph
The introduction and early promotion of concrete shells in the United States stemmed,Paragraph
"primarily from the efforts of one man: Anton Tedesko. By 1932 Tedesko, an employee of",Paragraph
"Dyckerhoff-Widmann, had moved to the United States and persuaded the Chicago",Paragraph
engineering firm of Roberts and Schaefer to acquire the American rights to the Zeiss-,Paragraph
Dywidag process. The first building in the United States to take advantage of this,Paragraph
"technique was the Brook Hill Farm Dairy Pavilion, built in 1934 for the Century of",Paragraph
Progress International Exposition in Chicago. The multi-barrel-vaulted building was,Paragraph
designed by Richard Phillipp. Roberts and Schaefer served as design consultants. Within,Paragraph
months the engineering firm was also involved in the design of a concrete-shell dome for,Paragraph
the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.,Caption
"Articles on these buildings, appearing in both engineering and architectural journals,",Paragraph
"promoted concrete shells as an ideal solution for roofing large, unobstructed spaces, as",Paragraph
"they eliminated the need of rafters, purlins, or heavy trusses and were considered",Paragraph
fireproof. The development of reusable formwork in the construction of concrete barrel,Paragraph
vaults made shell roofs economically competitive with steel-truss designs.,Paragraph
Roberts and Schaefer dominated the American concrete-shell market prior to World,Paragraph
War II. By 1941 the firm had built concrete shells covering almost ten million square feet,Paragraph
of area. Most of their commissions during these years consisted of barrel-vaulted airplane,Paragraph
"hangars and sports halls. Included was the Hershey Sports Arena in Hershey,",Paragraph
"Pennsylvania, which, when completed in 1936, was roofed by the largest concrete shell in",Paragraph
the world. During World War II concrete shells provided an ideal alternative to steel,Paragraph
"trusses for roofing large structures, including the many warehouses, factories, and",Paragraph
hangars built to meet war-related needs. Benefits of concrete shells recognized by the,Paragraph
"military included speed of construction, ability to withstand intense heat, and, if the",Paragraph
"structure became damaged, ability to change distribution of stress.",Paragraph
After the war other American architects and engineers became involved in the creation,Paragraph
of concrete shells. Most notable was the New York engineering firm of Ammann and,Paragraph
"Whitney. The company developed its own barrel-vaulted shell design, which it then used",Paragraph
"in the construction of a series of wide-span airplane hangars, including a double hangar",Paragraph
for American Airlines (1948) at Midway Airport in Chicago. In the mid-1950s the firm,Paragraph

The organic shape of Saarinen’s TWA Terminal reflected a desire among architects,Paragraph
around the world in the 1950s to take advantage of the ability of shell structures to be,Paragraph
molded into a wide range of artistic forms. The Spanish engineer Felix Candela explored,Paragraph

by the Nazi proscription of the Modern movement in Germany. CIAM activities were,Paragraph
"ended in the Soviet Union, and German CIAM members such as Walter Gropius and",Paragraph

"CONNELL, WARD AND LUCAS",Title
"Architecture firm, England",Title
"The London-based architectural firm Connell, Ward, and Lucas was founded in 1933",Paragraph
by two architects from New Zealand—Amyas Connell (1901-80) and Basil Ward (1902—,Paragraph
76)—and one from England—Colin Lucas (1906-84). Connell and Ward arrived in,Paragraph
"England in the 1920s and studied at the Bartlett School of Architecture, University of",Paragraph
London; in 1926 both won prizes to study architecture in Rome. Lucas studied at the,Paragraph
University of Cambridge and in 1928 formed a building company whose main goal was,Paragraph
to experiment with concrete construction. Although the partnership lasted only six years,Paragraph
"and was disbanded in 1939, it was nonetheless one of the leading modernist firms active",Paragraph
"in Britain during the 1930s, and the architects were important, vocal proponents of",Paragraph
modern architecture.,Paragraph
"Before forming the partnership, the three were already known in architectural circles",Paragraph
"for innovative projects. Connell designed High and Over (1928-31), a home for the art",Paragraph
"historian and archaeologist Bernard Ashmole, who later became the director of the",Paragraph
"British Museum in London. Located on a 12-acre site in Buckinghamshire, High and",Caption
Over is often considered the first significant modern house built in England. Local,Paragraph
"residents protested that its white-walled exterior, ribbon windows, and Y plan were",Paragraph
incongruous in the rural setting. In 1930 Lucas designed the first reinforced-concrete,Paragraph
"house in England, Bourne End in Buckinghamshire. Bourne End’s extensive glazing,",Paragraph
"unornamented surfaces, and flat roof show a strong identification with the modernist",Paragraph
"language of the International Style. With Connell in 1932, Ward designed New Farm in",Paragraph
"Surrey, a home with an open, spacious plan whose structural system was modeled on Le",Paragraph
Corbusier’s Dom-ino Houses.,Paragraph
"In 1933 Connell, Ward, and Lucas not only officially established their partnership but",Paragraph
"each became a founding member of the MARS (Modern Architectural Research) Group,",Paragraph
the British branch of CIAM (Congrés Internationaux d’Architecture Moderne). The,Paragraph
firm’s involvement with MARS is indicative of the architects’ support for the Modern,Paragraph
"movement in general, as well as their interest in architectural developments on an",Paragraph
"international scale, innovations in technology and construction, and solutions for mass",Title
"housing. Despite opposition from the British building industry, the architects consistently",Paragraph
developed new building techniques to make the walls of their reinforcedconcrete,Paragraph
"structures progressively thinner, and they rightly looked at their own work as",Paragraph
experimental.,Paragraph
"The firm’s commitment to the new architecture, as International Style and modernist",Paragraph
"works were often described, was immortalized in a 1934 BBC radio debate titled “For",Paragraph
"and Against Modern Architecture,” when Connell agreed to be challenged on the air by",Paragraph
"architect Reginald Blomfield. Connell, who had been unknown to the public before the",Paragraph
"debate, responded boldly to Blomfield’s fierce attacks on the International Style for its",Paragraph
"foreignness, its overemphasis on function, its lack of an artistic vocabulary, and its break",Paragraph
with venerated traditions. Blomfield criticized the use of the flat roof in a thinly veiled,Paragraph
attack on French and German modernism derived from Le Corbusier and Walter,Paragraph
"Gropius’s Bauhaus aesthetics, respectively. A transcript of the debate was made public,",Paragraph
"Connell emerged as a public figure, and the firm began to receive more commissions.",Paragraph
One of the partnership’s most well known works is a house at 66 Frognal Way (1938),Caption
"in Hampstead, London. Built for a lawyer and his family in a neighborhood of neo-",Caption
Georgian villas—one of which was owned by Blomfield—the house celebrated the,Paragraph
"elements Blomfield despised: unornamented, white exterior walls; ribbon windows; a",Paragraph
"free plan; and a free facade. Once again basing the structural system on Dom-ino Houses,",Paragraph
"Connell, Ward, and Lucas used their ample experience with reinforced concrete to",Paragraph
"puncture the house with gardens, concrete patio slabs on all three levels, a sun deck, and",Paragraph
"an observation point. A colorful, lush interior, most of whose furnishings the architects",Paragraph
"designed, is masked by the unadorned street facade. The design of the house, first made",Paragraph
"public in 1936, resulted in a series of lawsuits precipitated by Blomfield, accusing the",Paragraph
architects of destroying the character of the neighborhood. The comparatively,Paragraph
unquestioned presence of E.Maxwell Fry’s modernist Sun House (1936) around the,Paragraph
corner is most likely testament to Blomfield’s personal hatred of Connell.,Paragraph
"Although Connell, Ward, and Lucas is most famous for designing private homes, in",Paragraph
1935 it participated with other MARS members in a competition for public housing. The,Paragraph
"firm’s entry—reinforced-concrete flats (apartments)—did not win, but in that same year",Paragraph
"the firm built other blocks of low-cost flats; the first, Kent House, is in the Chalk Farm",Paragraph
"neighborhood in London, and the second, in Surrey, was designed as an extension of a",Paragraph
Regency-style house. The blunt modernist style of this addition was criticized for,Paragraph
"clashing with the existing, more traditional building.",Paragraph
"Despite the firm’s defense of modernism and its controversial works, a 1936 design",Paragraph
"for the Newport Civic Building, with its overt references to Ragnar Ostberg’s Stockholm",Paragraph
"Town Hall (1909-23), seemed to Connell, Ward, and Lucas’s peers to have betrayed the",Paragraph
modernist cause. Several MARS Group members objected to the design’s particular use,Paragraph
"of brick, its classical symmetry, and its symbolism of function, and the firm was forced to",Paragraph
explain and defend the work in front of a MARS meeting. An attempt to officially,Paragraph
"censure Connell, Ward, and Lucas was abandoned, but from that point on, the three had",Paragraph
"little interaction with the group, despite remaining members for several more years.",Paragraph
"With few commissions at the beginning of World War II, Connell, Ward, and Lucas",Paragraph
closed in 1939 and did not reopen after the war. Each of the three architects continued to,Paragraph
"practice on his own. Connell went to Nairobi, Kenya, and established a new firm,",Paragraph
TRIAD. His works include the Aga Khan Platinum Jubilee Hospital (1959) and the,Paragraph
Parliament Buildings (1963); he returned to England in 1977. Ward set up a new firm as,Paragraph
"well, became the Lethaby Professor of Architecture at the Royal College of Art in",Paragraph
"London, and then led the School of Architecture at the Manchester College of Art.",Paragraph
Ward’s firm designed the microbiology building (1960) at Oxford University as well as a,Paragraph

CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT,Title
Construction management refers to those management services performed by an,Paragraph
"architect, engineer, or contractor under separate or special agreement with the owner of a",Paragraph
"construction project. Traditionally, these services are not a part of the architect’s or",Paragraph
"engineer’s basic services, but additional services.",Paragraph
Often these services are included in a comprehensive service or construction,Paragraph
management contract. The construction management contract formalizes the arrangement,Paragraph
"wherein responsibilities for coordination and accomplishment of project planning, design,",Paragraph
and construction are given to a single construction firm.,Paragraph
Construction management services include nine primary activities: developing and,Paragraph
"operating the overall management system, estimating the project cost, project planning,",Paragraph
"project scheduling, reduction of project time duration, resource management, project time",Title
"control, the project cost system, and contract administration.",Paragraph
Developing and operating the overall management system provides for the general,Paragraph
management of the project from its conception through any warranty period. It is the,Paragraph
oversight mechanism that ties all phases of a project together.,Paragraph
Estimating the project cost affords the owner and potential construction contractor a,Paragraph
measure of the complexity of a project as well as a way of seeing whether finances are,Paragraph
adequate. Project cost estimating is an iterative process that starts often at the time of,Paragraph
project conception and continues until the project completes its warranty period.,Paragraph
Project planning is a general planning process that details the steps by which a project,Paragraph
can be accomplished. Project planning often continues throughout the entire project,Paragraph
implementation period.,Paragraph
Project scheduling is tied to project planning and attempts to attach work or time,Paragraph
periods to each of the project implementation steps. Often the project scheduling process,Paragraph
"is undertaken within the framework of a formal scheduling process, often incorporating",Paragraph
the critical path method (CPM).,Paragraph
Reduction of project time duration is the iterative process whereby the project,Paragraph
schedule is adjusted to reflect time constraints imposed either by the project owner or the,Paragraph
contractor and subcontractors.,Paragraph
"Resource management looks at the availability of labor, equipment, and material",Paragraph
resources during the course of the project. Often resource management is a subfunction of,Paragraph
the project scheduling function and is accomplished during the scheduling function.,Paragraph
Project time control is a general management function that provides an accounting of,Paragraph
labor and equipment expenditures in terms of time and money on various project,Paragraph
"activities. Often performed on-site by the clerk of the works, project time control is often",Paragraph
incorporated along with the resource management and project scheduling activities to,Paragraph
provide the owner and contractor with an overall project status report.,Paragraph
Project cost system is the activity that provides the project owner and contractor with,Paragraph
detailed information regarding the status of project expenditures. In addition to the,Paragraph
"management of payments, the project cost system provides management of change orders",Paragraph
and other construction contract modifications.,Paragraph
Contract administration is a general function that provides for a review of construction,Paragraph
contract provisions to ensure that both the owner and contractor comply with the,Paragraph
provisions of the contract between them.,Paragraph
"According to the Construction Management Association of America, modern",Paragraph
"construction management takes several forms, the most common being Traditional",Paragraph
"Design Build, Construction Management at Risk, Multiple-Prime Contracting, and",Title
Agency Construction Management Services.,Paragraph
Traditional Design Build remains the most common form. Here the owner engages an,Paragraph
"architect or engineer who prepares the design of the complete facility, including",Paragraph
"construction drawings, specifications, and contract packages. Once completed, the design",Paragraph
package is offered to interested general contractors who prepare bids for the work and,Paragraph
"execute contracts with subcontractors to construct various specialty items. Usually, but",Paragraph
"not always, the contractor submitting the lowest bid that meets all of the project",Paragraph
specifications is selected to perform the construction. This contractor is then responsible,Paragraph
for constructing the facility in accordance with the design. The architect-engineer may,Paragraph
"also assist the owner in administering the construction contract, including determination",Paragraph
"of project progress, for interim payments made to the contractor. Some disadvantages of",Paragraph
"the Design Build Process are that the process is time-consuming, as all design work must",Paragraph
be completed before solicitation of the construction contract; the owner generally faces,Paragraph
exposure to contractor claims over design and construction issues because the owner,Paragraph
accepts liability for design in its contract with the contractor; the contractor pursues a,Paragraph
"least-cost approach to completing the project, requiring increased oversight and quality",Paragraph
review by the owner; and the absence of a contractor’s input into the project design may,Paragraph
limit the effectiveness and constructibility of the design. Important design decisions,Paragraph
affecting both the types of materials specified and the means of construction may be,Paragraph
made without full consideration of a construction perspective.,Paragraph
Construction Management at Risk is a system adopted and promoted by many large,Paragraph
general contracting firms. It is similar to the Traditional Design Build approach in that,Paragraph
"the construction manager acts as a general contractor during construction. Yet, although",Paragraph
the construction manager holds the risk of subletting the construction work to trade,Paragraph
"subcontractors and guaranteeing completion of the project for a fixed, negotiated price",Paragraph
"following completion of the design, in this approach the construction manager also",Paragraph
"provides advisory professional management assistance to the owner before construction,",Paragraph
"offering schedule, budget, and constructibility advice during the project-planning phase.",Paragraph
"Thus, rather than dealing with a traditional general contractor, the owner deals with a",Paragraph
hybrid construction manager/general contractor. Besides providing the owner with the,Paragraph
"benefit of preconstruction services, which may result in advantageous changes to the",Paragraph
"project, the Construction Management at Risk form offers the opportunity to begin",Paragraph
construction before completion of the design. The primary disadvantages cited in the,Paragraph
Construction Management at Risk form involve the contractual relationship among the,Paragraph
"architect, engineer, general contractor, and owner once construction begins. Once",Paragraph
"construction is under way, the construction manager converts from a professional",Paragraph
"advisory to the contractual role of the general contractor. Often, tensions over",Paragraph
"construction quality, the completeness of the design, and effects on the schedule and",Paragraph
budget can arise because of this change. Interests and stakeholding can also become,Paragraph
"similar to the Traditional Design Build system, and adversarial relationships may result.",Paragraph
Multiple-Prime Contracting is a system in which the owner holds separate,Paragraph
"contracts with contractors of various disciplines, such as general",Paragraph
"construction, structural, mechanical, and electrical. In this system the",Paragraph
"owner, or its construction manager, manages the overall schedule and",Paragraph
budget during the entire construction phase. Work in each construction,Paragraph
"discipline is bid separately, allowing the flexibility of awarding",Paragraph
construction contracts on the first portions of the project as soon as the,Paragraph
"respective aspect of design is completed. Furthermore, the system allows",Paragraph
"the owner to have more control over the project schedule, as the owner",Paragraph
"sets the schedule for bidding individual portions of the work. For example,",Paragraph
"if an initial phase of construction is delayed, the owner may reduce",Paragraph
liability for delays by postponing the bidding of follow-on work. The,Paragraph
problems primarily arise from lack of coordination and contractor delay,Paragraph
issues. Although the general construction prime contractor is often given,Paragraph
"contractual responsibility to coordinate the work among trades, including",Paragraph
"schedule, this contractor lacks the contractual authority to dictate the",Paragraph
schedule of another contractor.,Paragraph
"Agency Construction Management Services, or construction management-for-fee,",Paragraph
encompasses a range of services provided by a construction manager on behalf of an,Paragraph
owner. It is a common misconception that Agency Construction Management Services,Paragraph
represents a distinct project delivery system. In fact it consists of a distinct set of services,Paragraph
that are applicable to any project delivery system. These services can be used by the,Paragraph
owner as necessary to extend or supplement the owner’s own expertise and that of its,Paragraph
own staff and to manage the construction process to help address some of the shortfalls of,Paragraph
the project delivery system chosen. A construction manager working as an agent of the,Paragraph
"owner primarily provides the benefit of independent, professional services provided on",Paragraph
"the owner’s behalf throughout the project. In contrast to some other project participants,",Paragraph
the Agency Construction Management Services manager has no stake in the project—in,Paragraph
either its design or construction—and maintains a fiduciary duty to act on the owner’s,Paragraph
behalf and to provide impartial advice concerning the construction project. The Agency,Paragraph
Construction Management Services form may include predesign and design services such,Paragraph
"as selection of a design team, budget and cost estimating, constructibility review (a",Paragraph
review of design plans and specifications will help the owner verify that the design as,Paragraph
"presented is clear to the contractor, poses no construction conflicts, and is economically",Paragraph
"feasible to build), value engineering, and contract bidding. Construction services include",Paragraph
"construction inspection and surveillance, project controls, and change order review.",Title
"When considering whether to use Construction Management Services, an owner may",Paragraph
wish to consider the following items to determine the proper delivery method: type of,Paragraph
"project, size of project, owner capabilities, time considerations, and likelihood of",Paragraph
changes.,Paragraph

CONSTRUCTIVISM,Title
"For the 15 or so years of its existence, from the first years of Soviet power to the early",Paragraph
"1930s, Constructivism endeavored to alter conceptions of architectural space, to create an",Paragraph
"environment that would inculcate new social values, and at the same time to use",Paragraph
"advanced structural and technological principles. Paradoxically, the poverty and social",Paragraph
"chaos of the early revolutionary years propelled architects toward radical ideas of design,",Paragraph
many of which were related to an already thriving modernist movement in the visual arts.,Paragraph
"For example, El Lissitzky’s concepts of space and form, along with those of Kazimir",Paragraph
"Malevich (1878-1935) and Vladimir Tatlin (1885-1953), played a major part in the",Paragraph
"development of an architecture expressed in “stereometric forms,” purified of the",Paragraph
"decorative elements of the eclectic past. The experiments of Lissitzky, Vasily Kandinsky,",Paragraph
and Malevich in painting and of Tatlin and Alexander Rodchenko (1891-1956) in,Paragraph
"sculpture had created the possibility of a new architectural movement, defined by",Paragraph
Lissitzky as a synthesis with painting and sculpture.,Paragraph
"In its initial phase, Constructivism was closely associated with radical design studios.",Paragraph
The preeminent institution was named VKhUTEMAS (the Russian acronym for “Higher,Paragraph
"Artistic and Technical Workshops”), following a reorganization of the Free Workshops in",Paragraph
"1920. In 1925 it was reorganized yet again, subse quently to be called the Higher Artistic",Paragraph
and Technical Institute (WKhUTEIN). VkhUTEMAS-VKhUTEIN was by no means the,Paragraph
only Moscow institution concerned with the teaching and practice of architecture in the,Paragraph
"1920s, but it was unique in the scope of its concerns (which included the visual and the",Paragraph
applied arts) as well as in the variety of programs and viewpoints that existed there before,Paragraph
its closing in 1930.,Paragraph
Theoretical direction for VKhUTEMAS was provided by the Institute of Artistic,Paragraph
"Culture (INKhUK, also founded in 1920), which attempted to establish a science",Paragraph
“examining analytically and synthetically the basic elements both for the separate arts,Paragraph
"and for art as a whole.” Its first program curriculum, developed by Kandinsky, was found",Paragraph
"too abstract by many at INKhUK, and Kandinsky soon left for Germany and the",Paragraph
"Bauhaus. However, the concern with abstract, theoretical principles did not abate with",Paragraph
Kandinsky’s departure.,Paragraph
"Indeed, the issue of theory versus construction became a major source of factional",Paragraph
"dispute in Russian modernism. The crux of the debate between the rationalists, or",Paragraph
"formalists, and the Constructivists lay in the relative importance assigned to aesthetic",Paragraph
theory as opposed to a functionalism derived from technology and materials.,Paragraph

"Hénard’s (1910; Street of the Fu-ture). The other was the Dom-ino House, which would",Paragraph

"house form, he also sought to develop the urban context of his architecture. The",Paragraph
"Contemporary City was aimed at achieving fundamental, standardized principles of town",Paragraph
planning.,Paragraph
"Four times the size of Manhattan, the City consisted of a series of concentric,",Paragraph
rectangular belts. At the center was the ad-ministrative and business section of 24,Paragraph
cruciform 60-floor towers that were spaced far apart. Their plan profile recalled Khmer or,Paragraph
Indian temple forms and symbolized the centrality of the secular power of control. The,Paragraph
"towers had evolved from the ideas that Le Corbusier had published in in 1921, follow-",Paragraph
ing the suggestions of Auguste Perret. The cruciform tower was opposed to the American,Paragraph
"skyscraper, which in 1920 appeared as a viable urban form. What was new was not the",Paragraph
cruciform shape but the rigid geometry that was part of the purist machine aesthetic.,Paragraph
The next two rings contained residential blocks of six stacked-up duplexes with,Paragraph
garden terraces that were either grouped around vast interior courtyards or arranged in a,Paragraph
"linear pattern of “setback,” or formation. Each repre-sented a different conception of the",Paragraph
"city. In the former the cellular perimeter blocks formed streets, with the vertical plane",Paragraph
"form-ing both a barrier and a linking screen. The blocks, taken from Heénard,",Paragraph

L’Esprit Nouveau in 1925. It contributed to the formation of the five essential elements,Paragraph
that Le Corbusier published in 1926 as (Five Points for New Architecture): the free,Paragraph
"plan; free facade; long, horizontal sliding windows; and roof garden. Both the cruciform",Caption
towers and the apartment blocks posed a possible rational solution to the urban problems,Paragraph
"of overcrowding and traffic congestion. Although Le Corbusier’s emphasis on air, light,",Paragraph
"and greenery recalled the garden city, his solution was radically different in its emphasis",Paragraph
on centralization and increased densities. Another major aim of the project was,Paragraph
facilitating traffic. Fast automobile traffic was completely separated from the pedestrian,Paragraph
traffic. Elevated highways intersected the city and were joined to a peripheral highway,Paragraph
system. Pedestrian traffic was to take place amid parks and gardens. Despite the abstract,Paragraph
"and general character of the Contemporary City, its program addressed the postwar",Paragraph
"situation of Paris. Next to the Contemporary City, Le Corbusier exhibited a small sketch",Paragraph
proposing an adaptation of the plan to the situation of Paris. In 1925 the reorganization of,Paragraph
Paris was the theme of the Voisin Plan for Paris.,Paragraph
The influence of the Contemporary City was immense. As Le Corbusier remained an,Paragraph
"outsider of the planning establishment and received few design commissions, his",Paragraph
influence was largely indirect. Yet the Contemporary City formed the basis of one of the,Paragraph
"most pervasive urban images of the 20th century, a conception of environment that",Paragraph
underlay every radical major city plan discussed through the 1960s. The project,Paragraph
"synthesized many prevalent concepts of urban design, including the idea that the modern",Paragraph
"city represented a problem to be solved and the idea of the separation of the road,",Paragraph
"pedestrian route, and buildings.",Paragraph
"Although much more developed than most precedents, the Contemporary City",Paragraph
"contained Utopian and dystopian characteristics. Many streets would, in reality, be",Paragraph
practically empty of pedestrians. Related is the preoccupation with nature. Derived partly,Paragraph
"from the tradition of Parisian urban planning incorporating public gardens, the idea of",Paragraph
bringing nature into the city was more philosophical than practical and reflected Le,Paragraph
"Corbusier’s deep belief in nature and an interest in broad vistas. In practice, from the",Paragraph
"office high-rises one would lose any contact with nature. Amid the lower, residential",Paragraph
"blocks, the parks had a more useful function. Whereas Le Corbusier continuously",Paragraph
"evolved any given type, unfortunately the midcentury American urbanrenewal projects",Paragraph
"ignored Le Corbusier’s and only replicated the towers, which now served as the mode!",Paragraph
for social housing.,Paragraph
The undifferentiated open space also posed difficulty in developing varied types and,Paragraph
"sizes of open space for a range of uses. Moreover, one of the most decisive consequences",Paragraph
of the cutting off of the building from the land was the separation of architecture and,Paragraph
"landscape design, which in practice made the total environment suffer. Not only shortfalls",Paragraph
but the apparent success of large-scale planning has also generated concern. The,Paragraph
philosophy underlying the Contemporary City was inspired by regional syndicalism,Paragraph

"architectural design was long a guideline for integral city planning. Nevertheless, extreme",Paragraph
urban growth and concentration of rural masses in late 19th-century cities challenged,Paragraph
"traditional models of urban contextuality, producing vast standardized speculative",Paragraph

guarantee identification of the city’s inhabitants became a central topic of 20th-century,Paragraph
"architectural debates. Against the strict geometric patterns of new urban agglomerations,",Paragraph
"Camillo Sitte in 1889 proposed a structural revitalization of traditional, picturesque",Paragraph
cityscapes. His proposal influenced the planning of new urban quarters in the early 20th,Paragraph
"century as well as Postmodern debates of the 1980s. Avant-garde planners of the 1920s,",Paragraph
"especially Le Corbusier and Ludwig Hilberseimer, rejected Sitte’s ideas and instead",Paragraph
"proposed a radical new paradigm composed of semi-industrial, standardized architectural",Paragraph
elements in functionally separated and geometrically ordered spaces that dismissed all,Paragraph
relation to the city’s history. Only after the destruction of European cities during World,Paragraph
War II could these modernist planners realize their ideas on a scale beyond that of a few,Paragraph
prewar suburban housing developments . Modernist postwar reconstruction in West,Paragraph
"Germany, urban renewal in the United States, crude modernization programs in Latin",Paragraph
"America (including Mexico, Venezuela, and Brazil), and Soviet functionalism during the",Paragraph
Khrushchev administration in the 1960s fostered supposedly rational standards in,Paragraph
"urbanism and architecture. Their prefabricated boxlike buildings in open, linear, and one-",Paragraph
"dimensional spaces virtually required the destruction of the city’s existing, contradictory,",Paragraph
but memorable structural contexts. Historical monuments and traditional city cores lost,Paragraph
their function as cultural orientation points and sites of social identification.,Paragraph
"Nevertheless, with few exceptions (such as the ideal modernist city of Brasilia,",Paragraph
"Brazil), urban reality confirmed the city’s capacity to adapt even contrasting urban",Paragraph
"patterns. When modern urban elements were implanted in historic settings, the result was",Paragraph
a kind of collage with both isolated elements and other features that were integrated into,Paragraph
a new concept of spatial references. Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter’s emphasized several,Paragraph
contemporary revisions of modern architecture and urbanism. These included late,Paragraph
"modernist dissidents of Team X centered around Aldo van Eyck, Aldo Rossi’s treatise",Paragraph
"(1966), and later Robert Venturi’s (1966). These theoretical approaches recognized",Paragraph
the city’s multidimensionality and rejected dogmatic and exclusive modernist concepts.,Paragraph
Contextualism as a method of architectural planning tended to respect the architectural,Paragraph
heritage and interpret its complex relation within the urbanistic frame. In aesthetic,Paragraph
fractures and structural conflicts were rehabilitated as creative forces in the contemporary,Paragraph
design process. Even the monuments of modern architecture and commercial vernacular,Paragraph
"buildings formed part of a new, intricate, and vivid urban network that was meant to",Paragraph
inspire various processes of identification. Based on empirical and psychological studies,Paragraph
of the city form—elaborated mainly by Kevin Lynch and supported by Michel Foucault’s,Paragraph
philosophical idea of the “heterotopia”—contextualism since the 1960s became an,Paragraph
important paradigm in urban and architectural thinking.,Paragraph
The two most influential architectural tendencies of the last three decades of the 20th,Paragraph
century were Postmodernism and deconstructivism. Both used and transformed the idea,Paragraph
of contextualism. Postmodern architectural thought and ideology reduced the complexity,Paragraph
of the concept to a mere retrospective view of historically isolated forms and images of,Paragraph
"the preindustrial city. Prince Charles’s with its anti-Modern tone, tried to revitalize",Paragraph
neoclassical harmony of architecture and the urban setting. The long-term effect of,Paragraph
"Postmodern contextualism can be seen in the “New Urbanism” of the 1990s, which",Paragraph
"attempted to replicate and codify urban patterns of the 19th and early 20th centuries, as in",Paragraph
"Celebration (Florida), built by the Disney Corporation.",Paragraph
"By contrast, deconstructivist architectural thought interpreted contextualism within",Paragraph
less-obvious references and relations of the urban texture. Peter Eisenman’s designs—,Paragraph
"such as the City of Culture of Galicia in Santiago de Compostela, Spain (2000-",Paragraph
"present)—demonstrate that deconstructivist contextualism tends to be self-referential,",Paragraph
"nonintegrative, or even superficial.",Paragraph
"At the end of the 20th century, fragmentation and dissolution of urban contexts were",Paragraph
"caused mainly by megaprojects, such as shopping malls or spectacular museum buildings",Paragraph
sited in degenerated urban landscapes (such as the Bilbao port area in Spain that was,Paragraph
radically altered by Frank Gehry’s 1997 Guggenheim Museum). These globalized,Paragraph
megaprojects often ignore the historical complexity and structural diversity of the site-,Paragraph
specific contextualism and question subtle balances of the collage city.,Paragraph
Despite European trends of the 1990s—as in Berlin after the German reunification or,Paragraph
in the Olympic city of Barcelona—to reanimate the characteristic metropolitan urbanism,Paragraph
"of 1900, fragmentation became the dominant mode of architectural theory and practice.",Paragraph
Contextualism at the beginning of the 21st century still bears symbolic importance for the,Paragraph

Architecture firm Austria,Title
The Viennese architecture and design firm Coop Himmelb(l)au was founded in 1968,Paragraph
by Wolf D.Prix and Helmut Swiczinsky. The name Coop Himmelb(l)au (Heavenly Blue,Paragraph
Cooperative or Heavenly Building Cooperative) is a play on words that reflects the,Paragraph
linguistic and philosophical nature of their work best expressed through the postwar,Paragraph
international deconstructivist movement.,Paragraph
The roots of Coop Himmelb(l)au’s work are markedly futuristic and organic. Well-,Paragraph
"known early projects include the Reiss Bar (1977) and the club café Roter Engel (1981),",Paragraph
"with its fractured and fissured facade in the First District of Vienna, as well as the",Paragraph
inventive Humanic shoe store branches (1979-81) in Vienna and in Mistelbach. The,Paragraph
Kon’yo Arts and Crafts Shop in Tokyo (1986) and the two Funderwerk factory-glazed-,Paragraph
entry additions in St. Veit/Glan (1988) are also significant statements of their design,Paragraph
thinking.,Paragraph
"The Falkestrasse rooftop addition of 1988 in Vienna, with its winglike winter garden",Paragraph
"roof and aquiline attitude, created an international sensation, raising the international",Paragraph
community’s awareness of Coop Himmelb(1)au as an established design entity.,Paragraph
Coop Himmelb(])au’s 1987 competition-winning entry for the new town of Melun-,Paragraph
"Senart, located on the southern periphery of Paris, is an urban-planning scheme to",Paragraph
connect three small settlements. The three-phase proposal defined a triangular region,Paragraph
composed of a dense settlement node completed by radial “force lines” created by the,Paragraph
TGV railway lines and the N6 emanating from this center. A “web” of streets of small,Paragraph
"houses would be built, and two dense “beams” of loft apartments would be interlaced",Paragraph
"with the scheme, activating the urban environment. Finally, the long housing blocks",Paragraph
would also be vertically separated and horizontally interconnected to allow for enhanced,Paragraph
public circulation.,Paragraph
In 1987 Coop Himmelb(l)au developed a challenging scheme for the renovation of the,Paragraph
"classical Viennese theater, the Ronacher. A modern and flexible theater facility was to be",Paragraph
located in a strictly historically protected 19th-century theater facade. Coop,Caption
Himmelb(1)au created the perfect inwardly turned “black box” environment—high-tech,Paragraph
and accessible for both the public and its personnel. The opening of a multilevel interior,Paragraph
volume and utilization of a flexible assembly system for the stages ensured that spaces of,Paragraph
"differing sizes could be custom configured. Additionally, two restaurants and bars were",Paragraph
planned to alleviate high-traffic conditions. The tension and the counterbalancing forms,Paragraph
to ease this transition are clearly evident in the execution of the added facade elements,Paragraph
"that function as vertical circulation to the roof terrace with its open-air stage, videothek,",Paragraph
"and café/ bar. The rooftop theater, with new stage house below, cantilevers and pivots",Caption
"over the classic Ronacher’s roof, sheltering the terrace and adding to the drama of the",Paragraph
interplay of old and new.,Paragraph
The Groniger Museum’s East Pavilion (1993-94) was Coop Himmelb(lau’s,Paragraph
"contribution to a tripartite museum scheme with overall design by Studio Mendini, Milan,",Caption
Italy. In the museum the need for spatial exhibition volumes using natural light and,Paragraph
artificial lighting was combined with the primary intention of providing multiple,Paragraph
viewpoints from which to experience the art. The flexible exhibition system that,Paragraph
"comprises the “interior skin,” as well as the varying levels of the interior circulation,",Paragraph
allows the possibility of several viewing platforms from which a given work of art can be,Paragraph
"experienced. The museum was prefabricated and was assembled economically, using",Paragraph
computer-directed shipbuilding methods. The original architectural sketch was greatly,Paragraph
enlarged to create the evocative signature graphic on the exterior.,Caption

Jeanneret returned to La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1909 and joined a group of his former,Paragraph

Gandhi’s ashram on the banks of the Sabarmati River in Ahmedabad (1963). Designed,Caption

formed the central device in the Gandhi Sangrahalaya.,Paragraph
The existing buildings in Gandhi’s ashram were whitewashed one-story masonry,Paragraph

Education and Public Health. Disregarding the results of a competition,Paragraph
"dominated by traditional architects, Minister Gustavo Capanema requested",Paragraph

Costa’s designs for multiple dwellings demonstrated his concern for more comprehensive,Paragraph
planning. His Parque Guinle complex (1948-54) included three of six projected,Paragraph
"apartment blocks in a verdant setting, closely following ideas suggested by CIAM in the",Paragraph
"Athens Charter. The horizontal slab apartments, ranging from seven to eight stories,",Paragraph
"included single- and double-level units, open communal areas on the interiors, and",Paragraph
parking at ground level. As usual the architect incorporated indigenous building materials,Paragraph

multifamily habitations at the First Biennial Exposition in Sao Paulo in 1953.,Paragraph
The architect’s winning design in the 1956 international competition for the Pilot Plan,Paragraph

COUNTRY CLUB,Title
From its origins at the end of the 19th century as a converted farmhouse to its maturity as,Paragraph
"a fully developed building type, the country club has been most popular in British and",Paragraph
North American locations suitable to the wealthy classes and to the requirements of,Paragraph
outdoor sport. Farmhouses originally met these requirements and were less expensive to,Paragraph
"convert and augment than building new structures. At the same time, some members",Paragraph
undoubtedly preferred the ambience of a farmhouse over a new building. While the,Paragraph
"farmhouse has continued to serve as a model for clubhouse design, club leaders have",Paragraph
increasingly opted to construct new buildings rather than convert old ones.,Paragraph
"When converting a farmhouse into a clubhouse, designers were forced to develop a",Paragraph
"site plan that centered on the farmhouse’s location. However, on an undeveloped site the",Paragraph
clubhouse location was determined not only by its proximity to a road but also by how to,Paragraph
develop the best golf course. Using the high ground was a key criterion for engineering a,Paragraph
club’s grounds. The clubhouse had to be on high ground to accommodate sewer and,Paragraph
water needs. The high ground also had to be sufficiently large in area to handle tennis,Paragraph
"courts, parking, and auxiliary buildings kept near the clubhouse. Once basic service needs",Paragraph
"were met, aesthetics dominated the choice of clubhouse location. The architect located",Paragraph
the clubhouse and designed a landscape to create aesthetic vistas—from the building to,Paragraph
the golf course and vice versa. Because members often wanted the clubhouse to be the,Paragraph
"focal point atop a hill, problems of shading and wind were handled through landscaping.",Paragraph
"Whereas physical constraints played a role in clubhouse location, aesthetics was the",Paragraph
primary means to convey a prestigious setting.,Paragraph
Although golf was the major outdoor sport at a time when equestrian sports were in,Paragraph
"decline, the popularity of tennis led to the building of new and additional tennis courts",Paragraph
that were typically near the clubhouse. In moderate climates a totally new addition was,Paragraph
"the swimming pool. The Wichita, Kansas (1913), Peninsula, California (1914), and San",Paragraph
"Antonio, Texas (1917), country clubs provided swimming pools with their new",Paragraph
"clubhouses. Some clubs, such as Wichita and Ridgewood, New Jersey, provided dance",Paragraph
"pavilions for outdoor dances, but most clubs held dances indoors and used verandas and",Paragraph
porticoes as an outer room for fresh air. Although architects introduced some new design,Paragraph
"features, automobile sheds, parking lots, and tennis courts were the primary additions that",Paragraph
changed the clubhouse’s outdoor setting.,Paragraph
"In the period 1900-20, architectural styling became more important and reflected the",Paragraph
values and lifestyles of the club’s members. Progressing increasingly from remodeled,Paragraph
"farmhouses to architect-designed clubhouses, the country club changed in its scale,",Paragraph
"setting, and appearance. Some of the oldest institutions, such as the Country Club in",Paragraph
"Brookline, remained in converted farmhouses. The prestigious Piping Rock Country Club",Paragraph
"of St. Louis, Missouri, built a new two-story clubhouse that was visually modest with",Paragraph
wood-slat siding. In contrast the Bellereive Country Club of St. Louis built a three-story,Paragraph
Georgian brick structure with a clerestory and dome on its roof as well as a large two-,Paragraph
story portico. Clubs with wealthy members could afford grand clubhouses built with,Paragraph
expensive materials and in a style that conveyed a stately appearance.,Paragraph
Architectural styling for country clubs during the early 20th century was diverse. The,Paragraph
"Brae Burn and Vesper country clubs in Massachusetts, the Country Club of Virginia in",Paragraph
"Richmond, and the Chevy Chase in Washington, D.C., were all designed in a tradition",Paragraph
characteristic of the region. In the Midwest country clubs were designed in a variety of,Paragraph
"styles, including Classical Revival, Colonial, Tudor, and Shingle. Midwestern architects",Paragraph
trained in the East undoubtedly imported traditional designs from the East Coast. Some,Paragraph
country clubs in the Southwest and California decided to build clubhouses in the Mission,Paragraph
"style, which was indigenous to the region. The San Antonio (1917) and the Santa Barbara",Paragraph
"(1918) country clubs both adopted the style, which recognized the region’s ethnic",Paragraph
heritage.,Paragraph
"Although the country club was a new American building type, many clubhouse",Paragraph
"functions duplicated what earlier city clubs provided. Beyond the obvious needs, such as",Paragraph
"a kitchen, plans for many country clubs included a ballroom and stage, bedrooms for",Paragraph
"members, and game rooms. Bedrooms continued to be important because of",Paragraph
"transportation limitations. At the Houston Country Club, bachelors rented upstairs",Caption
"bedrooms, as they had done historically in men’s city clubs. Elites still preferred to have",Paragraph
the clubhouse as a place for guests to spend the night. Although the club setting had,Paragraph
"changed, many habits of club life remained the same.",Paragraph
In the 1920s there was an increasing demand for architects who were knowledgeable,Paragraph
"about clubhouse design. In this prosperous decade, most new clubs could afford a new",Paragraph
"clubhouse, especially when club organizers and a real estate developer worked together",Paragraph
to relate the country club’s development to an adjoining elite housing subdivision. Early,Paragraph
country clubs benefited from the initial economy of converting a farmhouse into a,Paragraph
"clubhouse. However, with a growing, active membership, a club had to either renovate",Paragraph
the clubhouse or build a new one.,Paragraph
Architects increasingly suggested that the clubhouse’s best location was just below a,Paragraph
"hilltop, a location that allowed for air ventilation without the building experiencing",Paragraph
"extreme wind velocities. Moreover, locating a clubhouse below the hilltop offered the",Paragraph
possibility of some shading and a scenic backdrop to golfers approaching the clubhouse.,Paragraph
"Minimizing the clubhouse’s distance from a main road reduced on-site road construction,",Paragraph
and locating the entrance road on the high ground reduced grading costs and erosion,Paragraph
"problems. For the golf course, design ers reiterated the need for the nine-hole loop plan,",Paragraph
the Ist and 10th tees as well as the 9th and 18th greens being near the clubhouse.,Paragraph
"However, they acknowledged the difficulties of maintaining this principle when a club",Paragraph
decided on developing a 36-hole course and wanted other sports activities around the,Paragraph
"clubhouse. Designers needed to avoid steep grades, especially at the end of a round, to",Paragraph
prevent golfers from becoming overfatigued. Providing or keeping trees allowed for,Paragraph
"windbreaks along fairways, scenic backdrops for greens, visual barriers between parallel",Paragraph
"holes, and visual walls to hide ugly surroundings. Landscape design was critical for",Paragraph
creating a sense of entrance to the club’s grounds and to integrate the clubhouse with,Paragraph
surrounding sports facilities and the golf course. The general goal was to blend efficiency,Paragraph
with the picturesque.,Paragraph
"Architects developed basic clubhouse plan types. First, the most illustrated type was",Paragraph
"the finger plan. Basic functions, such as the lounge and dining rooms, were in a central",Paragraph
"building, and building wings typically housed locker rooms, guest bedrooms, and",Paragraph
sometimes an indoor swimming pool. This plan type worked best for large clubs that had,Paragraph
"multiple functions. With a large building complex, the building wings enabled the",Paragraph
architect to orient the floor plan to existing land contours and provide a V or U stage set,Paragraph
"that looked on the golf course. Second, the corridor plan type connected the major club",Paragraph
"functions along a single corridor. This type was most adaptable in small country clubs,",Paragraph
where an architect could easily organize a small number of functions along a corridor,Paragraph
pine that was not excessively long. Another alternative for the small country club was,Paragraph
he great hall plan. The club’s main dining room or lounge served as a central space with,Paragraph
"he club’s other functions surrounding it. In a large country club, an architect had",Paragraph
"ifficulty placing all the club’s functions around the great hall. Finally, there was the",Paragraph
ourtyard plan. The courtyard served as a pivotal open space around which architects,Paragraph
"rganized a club’s functions, but, as in the great hall plan, all a club’s activities could not",Paragraph
"Iways be efficiently arranged around a central space. However, these four plan",Paragraph
"Iternatives were ideal types, and architects with commissions for large country clubs",Paragraph
"lesigned a variety of hybrids, enabling them to incorporate some types best suited for",Paragraph
small country clubs.,Paragraph
Architects emphasized interior design and decor more than they had in the past by,Paragraph
"focusing on the need for the clubhouse’s interior to convey a feeling of family, dignity,",Paragraph
and comfort. They paid special attention to the fireplace’s design and placement in the,Paragraph
main room because it was the symbolic center of club social life. The recommended,Paragraph
"dining room, lounge, and great hall height was at least a story and a half to give dignity",Paragraph
and importance to the club’s main social spaces. The staircase design was important not,Paragraph
only as a social place centrally located to club activities but also as an integral feature for,Paragraph
ZI,Title
ee.,Paragraph
ae po,Title
particular traditional building styles that conveyed the visual dignity that club members,Paragraph
wanted.,Paragraph
In the 1920s perhaps the main design anomaly in relation to the country,Paragraph
club ideal was the men’s grillroom. Although the country club was,Paragraph
"promoted as a family club, men dominated its membership rosters and",Paragraph
club definitions of social terrain. Men particularly enjoyed the grill as a,Paragraph
"place to eat and drink after a round of golf, where their dress and language",Paragraph
could be informal. The grillroom had its historic roots in city social clubs,Paragraph
"that were exclusively for men, and it was continuing that traditional",Paragraph
exclusivity in the country club.,Paragraph
In the United States architectural styling in country clubs continued to repeat past,Paragraph
"practices and regional styles, with some minor variations. The clubs in Florida and",Paragraph
"California almost universally adopted Spanish or Italian styles of architecture, whereas",Paragraph
"those in New England were influenced by American Colonial, English, Georgian, and",Paragraph
French farmhouse design. Spanish Colonial became a popular style in Florida during its,Paragraph
"real estate boom in the 1920s. In the Southwest architects used the Pueblo style, as seen",Paragraph
"at the Trinidad Country Club of Trinidad, Colorado. Modernism, however, was largely",Paragraph
missing. In 1924 Frank Lloyd Wright produced schematic drawings for the Nakoma,Paragraph
"Country Club of Madison, Wisconsin, but a new, conservative board of governors",Paragraph
"rejected his innovative design proposal. Thus, by the 1920s architects had incorporated",Paragraph
all the major styles used for other building types in the United States into clubhouse,Paragraph
design.,Paragraph
"In the early postwar era, modernism became the dominant style. By the 1950s",Paragraph
"progressive architects had rejected the classical styles for modernism, and this shift is",Paragraph
"seen in country club designs of the time. Glass, steel, and concrete were the basic",Paragraph
materials used to express this modernist style. In the 1940s Chicago’s Tam O’Shanter,Paragraph
"Club and the Des Moines, Iowa, Golf and Country Club built two of the first clubhouses",Paragraph
that exemplified the International Style. Organic architecture reflected the influence of,Paragraph
"Wright, who designed buildings to fit imto the site rather than to dominate it. His",Paragraph
"architecture emphasized indigenous building materials, and in the 1950s some architects",Paragraph
were highly influenced by his buildings that used asymmetrical plans and triangular,Paragraph
"forms. Completed in 1958, the Paradise Valley Country Club of Scottsdale, Arizona,",Caption
exemplified the Wrightian influence. There were clubhouse designs that mixed these two,Paragraph
modernist variations by using the rectilinear formalism and flat roofs of the International,Paragraph
Style while using indigenous materials that gave the appearance of organic architecture.,Paragraph
"Regardless of the particular purity or mix of modernist options, newly organized country",Paragraph
clubs chose modernism as it increasingly became the most popular architectural style in,Paragraph
the nation.,Paragraph
Some country clubs that built a modernist style clubhouse later replaced it with a,Paragraph
traditional design. Modernist architecture removed the traditional building cues that,Paragraph
conveyed an elite lifestyle. Club members soon longed for a return to heavy timber and,Paragraph
"stone in clubhouse construction. By the 1980s architects returned to using historic styles,",Paragraph
although some clubs in western states still preferred the modernist style. Members of the,Paragraph
"Sedge-field Country Club of Greensboro, North Carolina, so adamantly preferred their",Paragraph
Tudor-style clubhouse that they restored it. Some architectural firms revived some of,Paragraph
"modernism’s early beginnings. In 1994 Klages, Carter, Vail and Partners designed the",Paragraph
Coto de Caza Country Club of California in a manner that reflected the Arts and Crafts,Paragraph
style of Bernard Maybeck and the Greene brothers. Architects began taking a personal,Paragraph
approach to choosing an architectural style for the country club and its clubhouse. They,Paragraph
visited club members’ homes to determine what style they would find most comfortable,Paragraph
"in their club life. Thus, modernism’s popularity fell as country club members sought",Paragraph
building styles that better reflected their tastes and values.,Paragraph
Some changes in plan layouts in the postwar era were directed largely by the,Paragraph
"introduction of air conditioning. In the past verandas were often part of a clubhouse plan,",Paragraph
but air conditioning now made these porches obsolete. Attempts to create cross venti,Paragraph
lation or to have high ceilings for better air circulation were no longer needed as long as,Paragraph
an air-conditioning system was installed. By the 1950s automobile ownership was,Paragraph
"common, and most roads were paved; there was no longer a need for club members to",Paragraph
remain overnight at the clubhouse. Women were increasingly provided equal treatment,Paragraph
with men and women jointly used the same rooms for socializing. The men’s grillroom,Paragraph
often became simply the grillroom in new country clubs. Women were also taking a more,Paragraph
"active role in sports, and larger women’s locker rooms reflected this involvement. Thus,",Paragraph
the country club’s floor plan reflected both technical and social changes throughout the,Paragraph
20th century.,Paragraph

CRAFTSMAN STYLE,Title
"Reaching the height of its popularity in the first decades of the 20th century, the",Paragraph
Craftsman style in America was informed by both European and Japanese architectural,Paragraph
"design. The Craftsman style and the Arts and Crafts movement, of which Craftsman was",Paragraph
"a part, hearkened back to medieval times, when the creative labor of human beings rather",Paragraph
than the constant hum of machinery was the driving force behind the built environment,Paragraph
"and craft objects. The Craftsman movement would reinvigorate handicraft, return the",Paragraph
"skilled artisan to a position of respect, and serve as a reminder that honest labor could be",Paragraph
joyful rather than dehumanizing. In England the Arts and Crafts movement originated,Paragraph
"with such thinkers and architects as John Ruskin, William Morris, C.R.Ashbee, and",Paragraph
"M.H.Baillie-Scott. On the Continent, Craftsman buildings tended to use more masonry",Paragraph
"than wood, to incorporate tiled roofs, and to use half-timbered exterior ornamentation",Paragraph
with Tudor overtones. The American Arts and Crafts movement drew on these influences,Paragraph
while adapting itself to liberal capitalism and the varying climates and landscapes of the,Paragraph
United States. The movement and its design principles were popularized through such,Paragraph
publications as Gustav Stickley’s magazine . In contrast to the Victorian buildings that,Paragraph
"preceded them, Craftsman structures eschewed applied ornamentation in favor of the",Paragraph
natural beauty of construction materials and a simplicity of line. Perhaps the greatest,Paragraph
irony of this preference for simplicity and honesty of materials was the reality that much,Paragraph
"Craftsman joinery, in both architecture and furniture, was extremely elaborate and",Paragraph
difficult to execute.,Paragraph
The Craftsman style reached its fullest expression mainly in domestic rather than,Paragraph
"public buildings. The style was characterized by the use of natural building materials,",Paragraph
"such as brick, stone, and regionally available woods. A hallmark of Craftsman design was",Paragraph
"the use of exposed joinery on both the exterior and the interior of buildings, an art",Paragraph
arguably brought to its most dra-matic realization in the Blacker House (1907) and,Paragraph
"Gamble House (1908), designed by Charles Sumner Greene and Henry Mather Greene in",Caption
"Pasadena, California. It is in the work of the Greenes that the Japanese influence on the",Paragraph
"Craftsman style is most apparent, particularly in the roof supports, lanterns, and reflecting",Paragraph
"pool on the rear terrace. In addition to natural building materials and exposed joinery,",Caption
Craftsman domestic structures generally featured low-pitched roofs that served to anchor,Paragraph
the buildings to their surrounding landscape. Even the three-story Gamble House appears,Paragraph
relatively low to the ground. In addition the tasteful use of stained and art glass as well as,Paragraph
prominent fireplaces (often incorporating handmade tiles as a decorative element),Paragraph
surrounded by inglenooks or seating areas were components of the style. The homes,Paragraph
"typically (although not universally) worked toward an open plan, minimizing obstacles",Paragraph
between rooms. Craftsman style was also characterized by a belief in comprehensive,Paragraph
design where it was possible. In homes designed for wealthy clients by Frank Lloyd,Paragraph
"Wright and the Greene brothers, for example, furniture, lighting fixtures, textiles, and",Paragraph
accessories were all designed as integral parts of the domestic space rather than as,Paragraph
afterthoughts.,Paragraph
In the United States the work of the Greene brothers is perhaps most frequently,Paragraph
"associated with the Craftsman style at its best. Indeed, David P.Handlin (1979) has",Paragraph
argued that California was the most active region of the country for Arts and Crafts,Paragraph
design. The Greenes’ “Ultimate Bungalows” in Pasadena and additional projects,Paragraph
"throughout the state, such as the Thorsen House (1908) in Berkeley, provide the best-",Paragraph
preserved and most fully articulated examples of the style. Peter Davey describes the,Paragraph
Greenes’ style as one “in which complexity was built up from elements of great,Paragraph
"simplicity, an architecture of timber in which beam was piled upon beam, rafter upon",Paragraph
rafter to form ordered nests of smooth sticks with great overhanging eaves and projecting,Paragraph
balconies to provide shade from the sun. Every member and every joint is made explicit”,Paragraph
"(1980, 212). Craftsman-style buildings on the West Coast tended to draw on the work of",Paragraph
"the Greenes and on Stickley’s designs, incorporating more wood than stone, including",Paragraph
"shingles, and ample porches enhanced with rough stones or masonry.",Caption
"In addition to the Greenes, Frank Lloyd Wright’s Prairie style is recognized as a part",Paragraph
of the Arts and Crafts movement despite the visible differences between Wright’s designs,Paragraph
"and those of other Craftsman architects. While the Greenes were busy on the West Coast,",Paragraph
Wright was changing domestic architecture in the Midwest. His own home and studio,Paragraph
"(1889) in Oak Park, Illinois, exhibit many of the features described previously, such as",Paragraph
"the tasteful use of art glass, prominence of natural woods, and fireplace inglenook.",Paragraph
"Further, Wright’s Robie House (1906-09) in Chicago demonstrates the clean horizontal",Paragraph
"lines, spectacular woodwork, free-flowing space, and dramatic central fireplace which",Paragraph
were key elements of Wright’s Prairie style. An excellent example of the Craftsman style,Paragraph
applied to a public building is Bernard Maybeck’s First Church of Christ Scientist (1909-,Paragraph
11) in Berkeley. The exposed brackets supporting the low-pitched roof and dramatic,Caption
windows exemplify the Craftsman style on a large scale.,Paragraph
"With the onset of World War I, the Arts and Crafts movement in America began to",Paragraph
decline in popularity. The ideals that gave rise to the movement were losing their appeal,Paragraph
"for many, and the allure of mass-produced housing components made pos sible in part",Paragraph
through the advances of wartime construction became increasingly hard to resist. The,Paragraph
simplicity of the Arts and Crafts movement was gradually replaced by the even more,Paragraph
"simplified International Style, with its clean lines and blank facades. Even so, in almost",Paragraph
"any town in the country, one can still feel the influence of the Craftsman style and its",Paragraph
domestic architectural ideals.,Paragraph

"Architect, United States",Title
Ralph Adams Cram was without question the foremost practitioner of the Gothic style,Paragraph
"of architecture of his day in the United States, but he was a writer and advocate of no less",Paragraph
"energy and stature. The author of 24 books and scores of magazine and journal articles,",Paragraph
Cram was a member of the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from,Paragraph
"1914 to 1922, and he toiled ceaselessly to advance his reasons for the continuation of an",Paragraph
architectural tradition stretching back to medieval times.,Paragraph
"Born in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, Cram lacked the money to attend college and",Paragraph
instead became an apprentice in the Boston architectural firm of Rotch and Tilden.,Paragraph
"Through his expanding circle of acquaintances in the Boston artistic world, Cram fell",Paragraph
under the influence of the work of the English designer-writers John Ruskin and William,Paragraph
"Morris and came to admire the work of Henry Vaughan, an English Gothicist (and",Paragraph
follower of George F.Bodley) who would go on to design the National Cathedral in,Paragraph
"Washington, D.C.",Caption
"Cram was a devotee of high-church Anglicanism, a belief that made his enthusiasm",Paragraph
"for the Gothic more than merely stylistic. Indeed, art and religion to Cram were virtually",Paragraph
inseparable. In his view the Gothic was not a style of the past but rather one that was,Paragraph
capable of continuing evolution and that embodied the highest spiritual aspirations. “My,Paragraph
"idea,” he wrote in his 1936 autobiography, “was that we should set ourselves to pick up",Paragraph
the threads of the broken tradition and stand strongly for Gothic as a style for church,Paragraph
building that was not dead but only moribund and perfectly susceptible of an awakening,Paragraph
to life again.”,Paragraph
So vigorously did Cram pursue the Gothic that he has come to be thought of almost,Paragraph
"exclusively as a Gothic architect, but he was also highly skilled in the classical,",Paragraph
"Byzantine, Georgian, and Lombard styles.",Paragraph
"Over his long career, Cram worked with numerous collaborators, but his most fruitful",Paragraph
"association was with Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, who joined him in 1891 and soon",Paragraph
became a partner in the firm. Cram’s greatest strength was in the development of the plan,Paragraph
"and the overall composition of a building, whereas Goodhue proved a master at detail.",Paragraph
"Among the many brilliant ecclesiastical buildings that they designed together, the finest",Paragraph
example of their combined talents is St. Thomas Episcopal Church on New York City’s,Paragraph
"Fifth Avenue, completed in 1914. A serenely confident sense of mass and space is",Paragraph
"enlivened with striking ornamentation, especially in the enormous reredos, or sculptural",Paragraph

it creates an almost theatrical focus for the earnest overall composition.,Paragraph
"Despite the unabashed historicism of St. Thomas, Montgomery Schuyler, the",Paragraph
"distinguished architecture critic, saw the beginnings of a new architectural direction",Paragraph
"lurking beneath its details. “In the block,” Schuyler wrote, “without a single tool mark of",Paragraph
"ornament, the new St. Thomas’s would already be a noble building. The highest praise",Paragraph
the decoration of such a building can deserve is that it heightens and develops the,Paragraph

"Architect, United States",Title
Paul Cret can be seen as one of the leading examples of the architectural generation,Paragraph
that formed the bridge between neoclassicism and modernism.,Paragraph
"Whereas many American architects, starting with Richard Morris Hunt, traveled to",Paragraph
"France to study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Cret was a native. Born in Lyons in 1876, he",Paragraph
"studied at the Ecole from 1897 to 1903, absorbing its principles of rationality and",Paragraph
symmetry and its devotion to the sources of classicism. Although he distinguished,Paragraph
"himself in his studies and might have flourished professionally in France, in 1903 Cret",Paragraph
accepted a position on the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.,Paragraph
"While there, he helped establish the university’s school “of architecture as one of the",Paragraph
"most influential in the United States, counting among his students Louis I.Kahn, who",Paragraph
would go on to prominence in later life.,Paragraph
"In his own practice, Cret concentrated heavily on civic buildings, to which he brought",Paragraph
a steadily more refined style of Beaux-Arts classicism. Describing his professional goals,Paragraph
"in the early 1930s, he wrote, “The characteristic of this practice is the planning of",Paragraph
"important city improvements, the planning of government...buildings and important",Paragraph
"memorial buildings.” However, the aim of his aesthetic was to convey, as Elizabeth",Paragraph
"Grossman has written in her 1996 monograph, an “intimate monumentality.”",Paragraph
"Cret eagerly adopted new construction techniques, particularly in the use of steel",Paragraph
"framing, but he remained committed to the essentially Beaux-Arts idea that the",Paragraph
architecture of a building should flow from an analysis of its program. He was averse to,Paragraph
the idea that a building should make a personal statement about its creator.,Paragraph
Cret’s earliest major commission was won in a competition he entered in association,Paragraph
"with Albert Kelsey for the International Bureau of American Republics, later called the",Paragraph
"Pan American Union, in Washington, D.C., completed in 1910. The building was richly",Paragraph
"ornamented, but beneath the trim lay a rigorous organization of masses and spaces that",Paragraph
gave it a fundamental sculptural power.,Paragraph
Cret interrupted his career to return to his homeland and serve with the French army,Paragraph
during World War I. (He was first an infantryman and later an interpreter on the staff of,Paragraph
"American General John Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force; the",Paragraph
"frontline experience left him partially deaf.) On his return to the United States, Cret",Paragraph
embarked on a gradual simplification of the ornamental palette that he had employed on,Paragraph
"the Pan American Union building, reducing columns to flat piers, stripping them of",Paragraph
"capitals and bases, and eliminating moldings.",Paragraph
"This austere aesthetic, powerfully exemplified by the Hartford County Building (1930)",Paragraph
"in Connecticut and the Folger Shakespeare Library (1932) in Washington, D.C., proved",Paragraph
especially effective for the many memorials that Cret designed for the dead of World War,Paragraph
"I both in France and in such American cities as Providence, Rhode Island. However, his",Paragraph
reach extended well beyond these high-minded structures to include such mundane,Paragraph
"projects as the Central Heating Plant for Washington, D.C.",Paragraph
Although some have argued that Cret’s “stripped classicism’”—which he,Paragraph
preferred to call “new classicism’—reflected a return to conservative,Paragraph
"sources in reaction to the upheavals of World War I, a more convincing",Paragraph
argument can be made that Cret was seeking a version of a style in whose,Paragraph
fundamental principles he still believed but whose embellishment had,Paragraph
become overly familiar and socially suspect. He suffered among other,Paragraph
critics for the superficial similarities of his work to that of contemporary,Paragraph
"architects in Italy and Germany, whose less sensitive",Paragraph

overtone of racial “purity.”,Paragraph
Cret retired from the University of Pennsylvania faculty in 1937 and a year later was,Paragraph
awarded the Gold Medal by the American Institute of Architects. In his acceptance,Paragraph
"speech, Cret said, “In the art of Architecture, collective effort counts more than individual",Paragraph

"Carolina. His vision of a “new classicism” had long since been overtaken by modernism,",Paragraph

"Located only 90 miles from the United States, Cuba is one of the few truly socialist",Paragraph
"countries left in the world. Socialist Cuba has created a radically different economic,",Paragraph
"social, and cultural life for its citizens. Architecture is intended to serve the masses’ needs",Paragraph
"of efficient and affordable housing, schools, hospitals, offices, and industrial production",Paragraph
"space. Ornamentation, excess, and waste are all frowned upon. The irony of Castro’s",Paragraph
socialist revolution was that the imperialist architecture of Spanish colonialism was,Paragraph
replaced with imperialist Soviet International Style. Efforts to create a unique and,Paragraph
original Cubano style free from other styles have largely been a failure.,Paragraph
One of the great myths and disappointments is that Havana has a large collection of,Paragraph
"Art Deco and Art Nouveau buildings. Some exist, but only a few are notable and",Paragraph
"deserving of attention, such as the 1930 Bacardi building designed by Esteban Rodriguez",Paragraph

Modern architecture before the revolution produced the widely praised Solymar,Paragraph

"celebrate the sea with wide circular balconies that represent ocean waves. This building,",Paragraph
"and the Tropicana Cabaret designed in 1951-56 by Max Borges Recio, are representative",Paragraph

"patterns of extreme hot weather—rooms became hotter because the ceilings were lower,",Paragraph
"windows were fewer, and heat could not escape to higher floors. Moreover, the",Paragraph

Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach.,Caption
Cultural and political ideology is difficult to separate from Cuban architecture. Shortly,Paragraph
after Wallace K.Harrison and Max Abramovitz designed the United Nations Building in,Paragraph
"New York, they designed the United States Embassy in 1953, which fits awkwardly",Paragraph
among the historic buildings of Havana’s Malecon. This building was widely criticized,Paragraph

American demonstrations.,Paragraph
Cuba also uses its large public squares for public rallies. José Marti is honored in,Paragraph
"Havana’s Plaza de la Revolucién, a collective effort built between 1938 and 1952. In",Paragraph
"Santa Clara a stark square honors Che Guevara, and in Santiago another commemorates",Paragraph
revolutionary leader Antonio Maceo. If the goal of monumentalism is to make the person,Paragraph

Churches are largely Spanish colonial in design with the exception of the modernist,Paragraph

"Housing and places of work were designed to maximize production of space. Playful,",Paragraph
"individualistic, and human-scale housing production became almost nonexistent during",Paragraph

and efficient design. The Soviet school was greatly influenced by the work of Le,Paragraph
"Corbusier. All schools, residences, hospitals, and offices were to be built using",Paragraph
laborsaving devices based on the factory model—no more inefficient design. It is,Paragraph
difficult to quantify a reliable number of how many prefabricated housing units were,Paragraph
"built in Cuba, but the estimate is approximately one million. The Cubans insist that",Paragraph
"everyone is guaranteed a house, food, education, and transportation, yet many dislike the",Paragraph
houses for their lack of character and personality. The Cuban lament is that you need a,Paragraph
"house number to find your own place. Over 100,000 units were lost due to lack of upkeep",Paragraph
"during the socialist period. Many blame this on Cuban housing law, which did not factor",Paragraph
"in maintenance and repair of roofing, walls, and plumbing. The average Cuban pays",Paragraph
about $2 per month for an apartment.,Paragraph
One development that Castro boasted would be a model socialist city and the envy of,Paragraph
"the world is Alamar. More than 100,000 units were constructed there. Today, this",Paragraph
"formalistic, factory-built concrete design is roundly considered a major architecture and",Paragraph
"planning failure. Even Cuban architects call it a dormitory devoid of services, shops,",Paragraph
"style, and exuberance. Much of it stands abandoned and incomplete. Instead of building",Paragraph
"in the cities, Castro wanted new housing developments to be outside the city. For Alamar",Paragraph
residents the average commute time is three hours per day back and forth to available,Paragraph
work in Havana. It is a good example of “socialist sprawl.” These buildings do,Paragraph
demonstrate Cuban ingenuity for using unorthodox materials such as wall partitions made,Paragraph
"out of processed sugarcane waste. Perhaps the most successful building design is CUJAE,",Paragraph
"which is the flagship Cuban university for planning, architecture, and engineering.",Paragraph
CUJAE was a collective effort built in the early 1970s by untrained builders. This,Paragraph
building is located near Havana International Airport about 30 minutes from downtown,Paragraph
Havana. A more interesting and successful result is achieved when old and new are fused,Paragraph
"together. Las Ruinas Restaurant in Lenin Park, also near the airport, was built atop the",Paragraph
ruins of a stone church by architect Joaquin Galvan in 1971. Here he recaptures the,Paragraph

Soviet prefab buildings into a modern version of Spanish colonial design. The only,Paragraph

Postmodern Architecture,Title
In 1991 José Antonio Choy was the lead architect who put together two of Cuba’s most,Paragraph
important pieces of Postmodern architecture: the Santiago train station and Santiago,Paragraph
Hotel. Choy does not get much credit in Cuban architecture books because few architects,Paragraph
make the 14-hour drive from Havana to eastern Cuba. Choy’s work is similar in many,Paragraph
"ways to Frank Gehry’s in its use of unusual building materials, sharp and bold angles,",Paragraph
"and nonfunctional, playful, and provocative spaces. Corrugated metal is prominent. For",Paragraph
Cuba these buildings represent a bold departure from the highly rationalized Soviet style,Paragraph
"of modular design that is faceless, cold, predictable, uninspiring, and demoralizing. Yet",Paragraph
"Cuban citizens see this building as extravagant, inefficient, and wasteful. Both these",Paragraph
buildings are far more political and powerful because of their symbolism. Hotel Santiago,Paragraph
salutes the mighty sugar mills of the past with a Postmodern design. It is important,Paragraph
because it stands against the faceless rationalization of communism by saying the world,Paragraph
"is illogical, confusing, and confounding. It says that beauty cannot be found in a simple",Paragraph
straight line but in a curved line that sometimes goes nowhere. The Santiago train station,Paragraph
"is even more radical and utilizes stairs climbing up three flights to nowhere, a bridge that",Paragraph
"is without function, large pillars that support nothing, and large square blocks tossed",Paragraph
"randomly on the front entrance. The Gehry corrugated metal and storm fences are here,",Paragraph
too. More interesting is that this building was built at a time when Russians were cutting,Paragraph
financial support for Cuba. The train building is a powerful commentary on socialist,Paragraph
"Cuba—broken, unfinished, and illogical.",Paragraph
The biosphere of Las Terrazas is a one-hour drive west of Havana in Pinar del Rio.,Paragraph
Las Terrazas has undergone a significant reforestation program that utilizes community,Paragraph
"gardens, recycling, papermaking, and trees that grow through the buildings. UNESCO",Paragraph

exist free of the usual prosocialist political propaganda.,Paragraph
Socialism meant the end of architecture in Cuba. Very little has been written on Cuban,Paragraph
architecture under socialism. Only a handful of reliable and useful books exist on the,Paragraph
topic in English or Spanish. Two of the best books were written by Americans: by,Paragraph
Rachel Carley and by John A.Loomis. The very best Cuban writer on architecture is,Paragraph
"Eduardo Luis Rodriguez, whose chief role is to document significant pieces of",Paragraph
"architecture for restoration and preservation. Although highly regarded internationally,",Paragraph
Rodriguez has been reluctant to write critical articles on architecture under socialism.,Paragraph
"Interestingly, his most recent book on Modern architecture in Havana, published by",Paragraph
"Princeton University Press, stops in 1965—skipping 36 years of socialist architecture,",Paragraph
which is probably of greater interest than many of the derivative buildings he reviews.,Paragraph
"Until recently, foreign travel to Cuba, especially outside Havana, has been difficult. If",Paragraph
"foreigners do publish articles critical of Cuban socialist architecture, they face a possible",Paragraph

CUBISM,Title
The aesthetic movements of the early 20th century were frequently and closely connected,Paragraph
"with new ideas in architecture. Futurism, the Dutch group De Stijl, the purist manifesto of",Paragraph
"Le Corbusier and Ozenfant, Suprematism and Constructivism in Russia, and",Paragraph
Expressionist German painting resonated with the development of modernist ideas and,Paragraph
"forms in architecture. However, the question of the relationship of Cubist painting and",Paragraph
"sculpture to architecture is not straightforward. Rather, Cubism was a point of departure,",Paragraph
contributing to the development of new concepts in Modern art.,Paragraph
"In 1907 and 1908, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, inspired by the aperspectival,",Paragraph
"cubic treatment of space in the paintings of Paul Cézanne and by primitive African art,",Paragraph
developed a radically new approach to the object in their paintings. When they showed,Paragraph
"their new paintings at the Salon des Indépendants in 1909, the critic Louis Vauxcelles",Paragraph
referred to Braque’s landscapes as “bizarreries cubiques.” Vauxcelles’ remark was,Paragraph
"immediately adopted in Parisian art circles, giving a name to the new approach: Cubism.",Paragraph
Cubism represented a break with the painterly tradition since the Renaissance. The object,Paragraph
was not represented in the central perspective but rather was deconstructed into prismatic,Paragraph
"surfaces, simultaneously representing different perspectives on the canvas. This formal",Paragraph
"analysis reduced what was depicted to geometric elements, similar to the relationship",Paragraph
between words and syntax.,Paragraph
"The new approach of Braque and Picasso quickly became a movement, as other artists,",Paragraph
"each with his own interpretation of Cubist principles, joined in the experiment. Albert",Paragraph
"Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Robert Delaunay, the brothers Duchamp, Fernand Léger, Juan",Caption
"Gris, and many others went through a shorter or longer Cubist period in their work.",Paragraph
"Cubism also quickly spread beyond France, influencing art in many countries for some",Paragraph
time. The break with classical perspective and the composition of the image independent,Paragraph
"of observation of nature opened up possibilities for abstract art, futurism, and other",Paragraph
movements. These developments took place very quickly between 1909 and 1915 and,Paragraph
"were accompanied by changes in other art forms, including architecture and its theory, in",Paragraph
the years ahead. The new poetics expressed in Guillaume Apollinaire’s poem “Zone” of,Paragraph
1912 and the first atonal composition by Arnold Schoenberg of 1909 serve as examples,Paragraph
for poetry and music.,Paragraph
"Architecture, however, remained relatively untouched by Cubist painting and",Paragraph
"sculpture during this time with only two exceptions, and these were incidents rather than",Paragraph
profound stimulation for new architectural developments: the — project of Raymond,Title
Duchamp-Villon (1912) and the work of the group (Group of the Visual Artists) in,Paragraph
Prague.,Paragraph
Duchamp-Villon (1876-1918) was a sculptor who belonged to a group of Cubist,Paragraph
"artists in Puteaux, outside Paris. For the exhibition of the group’s work at the Salon",Caption
"d’Automne in 1912, Duchamp-Villon and others presented the project, a kind of",Paragraph
(total work of art) complete with furniture and articles of use. For lack of space and,Paragraph
"organizational problems, only the first story of the model was built in the Grand Palais.",Paragraph
This work is known only from pictures of the plaster model and charcoal drawings.,Paragraph
"The two-story facade has a traditional, symmetrical arrangement. Cubist principles are",Paragraph
"visible only in the details; traditional cornice and pillars, as well as the door and window",Paragraph
"frames, were replaced by broken surfaces and prismatic shapes. These plastic forms are",Paragraph
"abstract, and the overlap between them is the architectural equivalent of the painterly",Paragraph
principle of superimposed planes.,Paragraph
The was the attempt of a sculptor to apply the principles of contemporary painting,Paragraph
to architecture. By contrast the acceptance of Cubism by the group in Prague in 1911,Paragraph
was more systematic. Besides several painters and the sculptor Otto Guttfreund (1889—,Paragraph
"1927), the architects Josef Chochol (1880-1957), Josef Gocar (1880-1945), and Pavel",Paragraph
"Janak (1882-1956) were cofounders of the group. They were active in architecture,",Paragraph
"interior design, arts and crafts, and set design and expressed themselves at the level of",Paragraph
theory.,Paragraph
The interest of these architects in the latest developments in painting represented a,Paragraph
reaction against the Wagner school’s dominant rationalism and leaning to social,Paragraph
engineering. Cubism seemed to offer an opening to a more artistic approach to,Paragraph
architecture. In 1910 Janak—himself one of Otto Wagner’s students—published an,Paragraph
"article in the journal titled “From Modern Architecture to Architecture,” noting that",Paragraph
Modern architecture had an exclusively practical orientation and had no interest in,Paragraph
"questions of space, material, and form.",Paragraph
"However, the transposition of the principles of Cubist painting to architecture turned",Paragraph
out to be a formidable task because of fundamental differences in the two art forms. In,Paragraph
"fact the Prague architects only adopted the principle of decomposition, that is, the",Paragraph
"fragmented representation of the image, and applied it to the design of the facade. The",Paragraph
"plane of the facade was undermined by slanting, prismatic forms that replaced the",Paragraph
"traditional, orthogonal composition of the facade. The result was comparable to the detail",Paragraph
"inthe . This approach had very little spatial significance, except in a few architectural",Paragraph
sketches and installations for exhibitions and in the Kurhaus at Bohdanec (health,Caption
administration building) (1911-12) by Gocar and the apartment building (1912) on,Caption
"Neklan Street in Prague by Josef Chochol, which demonstrate a spatial application of",Paragraph
"these principles. However, most of the architects concentrated on facades while their",Paragraph
plans remained conventional.,Paragraph
The underlying theory of the Prague group was different from Cubist painting. The,Paragraph
main objective was to achieve a plastic unity in the design of the facade through,Paragraph
"dynamism and movement. They were concerned with movement in an abstract sense, as",Paragraph
"an expression of the will to form, which subdues matter. These Czech architects saw the",Paragraph
Wagner school’s visible honesty in construction and use of material as imposed by,Paragraph
"matter, materialist, and devoid of spiritual content. Historian Alois Riegl’s formulation of",Paragraph
"(the will to art), in contradiction to the function, material, and technique of the artwork,",Paragraph
"and the theories of Theodor Lipps and Wilhelm Worringer, which were based on the",Paragraph
"subjective nature of observation and intuition, positioned themselves against the",Paragraph
rationalism and materialism of contemporary art theory in the same spirit.,Paragraph
"Prague’s architectural Cubism, which became increasingly more formal and",Paragraph
"decorative after 1914, and even became a sort of national style of the Czechoslovak",Paragraph
"Republic between 1918 and 1925, in actuality brought forth an Expressionist",Paragraph
"architecture—at least within the framework of architectural history, in which the notion",Paragraph
of Cubist architecture simply does not exist. From the point of view of aesthetic,Paragraph
"conception and analysis of style, the Prague designs are related to the Amsterdam School",Paragraph
"and to German Expressionism, with which it is sometimes possible to identify direct,",Paragraph
formal similarities. There are also formal similarities with the work of the Moscow group,Paragraph
"Zhivskulptarch, which attempted the integration of painting, sculpture, and architecture",Paragraph
between 1918 and 1920 under the leadership of the Cubist sculptor Boris D.Korolyov.,Paragraph
The work of the architects Nikolai A.Ladovsky and Nikolai I.Istselenov from this short,Paragraph
period is distinctively Expressionist.,Paragraph
The significance of Cubism in painting to Expressionist architecture amounts to the,Paragraph
"most definite, direct relationship be tween the two art forms. The causal connection rests",Paragraph
"formally in the decomposed fragments and prismatic forms of Cubist painting, which led",Paragraph
to comparable three-dimensional forms in architecture. A deeper connection may reside,Paragraph
"in the anticlassical aspect of Cubism, particularly the break with classical perspective",Paragraph
since the Renaissance. An anticlassical stance was also characteristic of Expressionism.,Paragraph
"With respect to the relationship between modernist architecture and Cubism, it is",Paragraph
interesting that the protagonists of renewal in the 1920s sometimes took positions against,Paragraph
"Cubism, or at least referred to it with considerable reserve, without identifying with it.",Paragraph
The purism of Amédée Ozenfant and Le Corbusier may have been a further development,Paragraph
"following in the wake of Cubism, but their 1918 manifesto “Aprés le Cubisme” does not",Paragraph
evince much appreciation for the movement. The manifesto rejected Cubist principles,Paragraph
"and called Cubism as a whole an esoteric game of ornamental forms. Instead, there is an",Paragraph
"emphasis on rational arrangement in the construction of an image, on a sort of",Paragraph
"standardization of the depicted object, and on the plastic values of the image. The purist",Paragraph
manifesto represented a return to the classical tradition; elements of purist painting are,Paragraph
"significant for the architectural work of Le Corbusier, including the aesthetic concept of a",Paragraph
standard and the emphasis on plastic values.,Paragraph
The direct influence of Cubism on modernist architecture is more difficult to identify.,Paragraph
"Although some authors, such as Sig-fried Giedion, Reyner Banham, and Colin Rowe, see",Paragraph
Cubist painting as an important impulse for the work of Le Corbusier and Walter,Paragraph
"Gropius, that remains a matter of interpretation. Without a doubt the pathbreaking role of",Paragraph
Cubist painting in general led to an analogy with the pathbreaking role of modernist,Paragraph
"architecture, but this would appear to be more a matter of legitimation than a causal",Paragraph
"connection. Some aspects, such as the reduction of the object to geometric forms, spatial",Paragraph
"penetration, and transparency, bear a programmatic relationship to the conception of",Paragraph
"architecture of the pioneers of architectural modernism, but it is not clear whether these",Paragraph
derive from Cubism or whether they were discovered because of Cubism.,Paragraph
"Historically speaking, these aspects of architecture cannot be traced back exclusively",Paragraph
to Cubism. The reduction of building volumes to geometric forms may as well be,Paragraph
connected to Roman church architecture or the work of Enlightenment architects Claude,Paragraph
Ledoux and Etienne Boullée. It was no accident that the work of Ledoux and Boullée,Paragraph
"received attention in 1933, precisely in relation to Le Corbusier. Transparency in",Paragraph
architecture had earlier been applied in the iron-and-glass buildings of the engineers of,Paragraph
"the 19th century, whereas in Cubist painting transparency is more conceptual than",Paragraph
"visually present. Moreover, penetration and simultaneity in Cubist painting are closer to",Paragraph
deconstructivist architecture than to Gropius’s Bauhaus aesthetic. It is also possible to,Paragraph
doubt the exemplary nature of the supposed rational construction of the image of,Paragraph
"analytical Cubism, already seen as not rational enough immediately after World War I.",Paragraph
Another problem that complicates the reception of Cubism in architecture is the,Paragraph
"confusion between “Cubist” and “cubic.” As early as the 1920s, the word “cubist” was",Paragraph
"applied by some writers to the new, unornamented architecture that relied on the",Paragraph
"arrangement of stereometric volumes. The work of Adolf Loos, J.J.P.Oud, Willem",Caption
"M.Dudok, and others has been called Cubist in this fashion, and as such the descriptor",Paragraph
seems to be a global designation of form rather than a connection to be French avant-,Paragraph
gardism in painting.,Paragraph
That contradictory pronouncements have been made about Cubism and architecture,Paragraph
"may be related to the fact that the artistic revolution of Cubism was a symptom, not the",Paragraph
"cause, of a new experience and interpretation of a changing world. A similar",Paragraph
"phenomenon took place in other movements, and architecture was one of them.",Paragraph

"boundaries of a structural frame, considered to represent curtain-wall construction? Such",Paragraph
construction is certainly “attached” to the structural frame but not exactly “hanging” from,Paragraph
"it. When is a window just a window within a frame, and when does it transform into a",Paragraph
curtain wall? The answer might have more to do with one’s aesthetic bias than with the,Paragraph
actual functional relationship between cladding and structure.,Paragraph
"From a functional perspective, curtain walls necessarily appeared precisely at the same",Paragraph
time as skeletal frameworks—toward the end of the 19th century. Yet the first such walls,Paragraph
were often strikingly similar to the thick masonry walls that they might have been,Paragraph
"expected to supersede. Although no longer load-bearing structures, relatively thick",Paragraph
masonry curtain walls continued to be used in steel-and concrete-framed buildings for,Paragraph
"other reasons. First, thinner masonry walls—before the development of internal cavities",Paragraph
to block the migration of moisture through the wall—tended to have problems with water,Paragraph
"penetration. Second, lighter facades consisting of metal or glass panels were often",Paragraph
considered aesthetically unsuitable for serious works of architecture because of a legacy,Paragraph
"and tradition that linked monumental architecture to masonry construction. Third, the use",Paragraph
of more modern cladding alternatives required breakthroughs in environmental control,Paragraph
technologies—air conditioning and insulation being the most important—before they,Paragraph
"could be deployed over large surface areas enclosing habitable spaces. Finally, building",Paragraph
"code officials, increasingly sensitive to the real danger of urban conflagrations, prevented",Paragraph
"the use of new, lightweight materials in exterior walls—even after other technical and",Paragraph
environmental issues had been addressed—if they were unable to match the proven fire,Paragraph
resistance of masonry.,Paragraph
"Although defined initially in terms of its functional relationship to structure, toward",Paragraph
the middle of the 20th century the curtain wall began to be alternatively defined by its,Paragraph
function as an environmental filter—as a membrane mediating between desired interior,Paragraph
"conditions and variable exterior circumstances. Sunscreens double glazing, and",Paragraph
"pressure-equalized rain screens were among the functional responses to this concern,",Paragraph
culminating in the late 20th century’s technologically sophisticated “bioclimatic” designs.,Paragraph
"In these “green” buildings, an array of computer- and user-controlled devices may be",Paragraph
embedded within the curtain wall to encourage the use of fresh air and natural daylighting,Paragraph
"while at the same time aiming to improve user comfort, reduce energy consumption, and",Paragraph
promote a “sustainable” lifestyle.,Paragraph
Curtain walls can also be defined as the embodiment of an aesthetic intention—the,Paragraph
second of the three perspectives mentioned previously. Numerous such curtain-wal,Paragraph
"themes can be identified in 20th-century architecture. They coalesce, in general, around",Paragraph
"the revolutionary “new” materials of metal and glass: metal (as industrialized, mass-",Paragraph
"produced, streamlined panel), glass (as transparent or reflective surface, crystalline solid,",Paragraph
"or harbinger of an enlightened culture), or metal and glass com- bined (as woven “fabric”",Paragraph
"or abstract grid). Still, other more traditional materials and systems, including stucco,",Paragraph
"concrete, brick, and stone veneer, have also played a role in validating the curtain wal",Paragraph
within various aesthetic domains and not merely as the by-product of functiona.,Paragraph
considerations. The ideal of an all-glass skin perhaps was the most persistent curtain-wal,Paragraph
theme of the 20th century. Starting with metal window systems containing relatively,Paragraph
"small glass panes and moving toward larger glass sizes with smaller mullion profiles, the",Paragraph
most technically advanced glass walls of the late 20th century managed to eliminate,Paragraph
"mullions entirely, whether by using the glass itself as a structural material, relying on",Paragraph
"structural sealant joints, or by pinning the glass to elegantly detailed lightweight stee:",Paragraph
substructures.,Paragraph

"Ironically, the initial aesthetic formulation of the modern metal-and-glass curtain wal",Paragraph
preceded the invention of multistory skeletal frameworks. Greenhouses were being built,Paragraph
"in Europe, even in the mid-17th century, with large areas of glass divided by wooden, and",Paragraph
"later iron, mullions. By the mid-19th century, skins of metal and glass were commonly",Paragraph
"used for the roofs of markets, gallerias, and train stations. London’s Crystal Palace of",Caption

supporting panels of glass or metal—increasingly began to appear on commercial and,Paragraph
institutional buildings. The newly invented float process made large areas of glass even,Paragraph
more feasible beginning in the 1950s.,Paragraph
Other panelized curtain-wall systems also appeared as cladding options: these,Paragraph
included composite metal panels containing lightweight cores of honeycombed materia,Caption

"centuries of ethnic oppression, and Germanization and Hungarization by foreign rulers,",Paragraph
"the language, culture, and national identity of the Czechs and Slovaks have survived.",Paragraph
The new republic of Czechoslovakia arose from the ruins of the Austro-Hungarian,Paragraph
Empire in 1918 after World War I. The accord between the Czechs and the Slovaks was,Paragraph
ratified in the Cleveland and the Pittsburgh declarations. The founders of the republic,Paragraph
"were its first president, Tomas Masaryk, and Garrigue Milan Rastislav Stefanik. The",Paragraph
foundation of democratic principles gave the intellectuals of the young republic a new,Paragraph
platform of liberal ideology. Influential in the cultural sphere was the Devetsil (the Nine,Paragraph
"Powers), an avant-garde group of artists, writers, architects, musicians, and actors, started",Paragraph
in 1920 in Prague and in 1923 in Brno. Architect Josef Havlicek was one of the founding,Paragraph
"members, and the activist writer and graphic designer Karel Tiege was the leader of the",Paragraph
group. They published a journal and organized lectures and exhibitions. The ARDEV (the,Paragraph
Architects of Devetsil) members maintained contact with a number of representatives of,Paragraph
the international avant-garde and invited them to visit and lecture in Czechoslovakia.,Paragraph
"Among them were Theo van Doesburg, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Jacobus Johannes Pieter",Paragraph
"Oud, Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier, Amédée Ozenfant, and Adolf Loos. The visits of",Paragraph
"Loos, a native of Brno, were particularly influential. The ARDEV members, concerned",Paragraph
"with the situation of social housing, produced studies of communal housing. These ideas",Paragraph
"came from the socialist ideals of Soviet Constructivism. In 1932 Karel Tiege, who was",Paragraph
"also an art critic and a theorist of architecture, summarized the housing studies in his",Paragraph
book (The Smallest Flat).,Paragraph
"At the turn of the 20th century, Czech, Moravian, and Slovak architects contributed to",Paragraph
Art Nouveau. Czech Art Nouveau architecture was not based merely on an endeavor to,Paragraph
dispense with historicism and to create original and independent principles of form and,Paragraph
decorative elements of new style. A pupil of the Viennese modernist architect Otto,Paragraph
"Wagner, Prague architect Jan Kotera (1871-1923), preferred a functional layout and",Paragraph
"volume to counter the aesthetics of eclecticism. Simultaneously, Kotera emphasized",Paragraph
truthfulness in architecture to counter a slavish imitation of historical motifs. He required,Paragraph
"a creative search for the new. Finally, Kotera’s design principles emphasized a building’s",Paragraph
purpose and the clear expression of its structural elements. In 1910 Kotera was appointed,Paragraph
professor of architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. His teaching was very,Paragraph
influential on the new generation of architects in Bohemia (Czechia).,Paragraph
"In the midst of Art Nouveau, the evolution of modern Czech architecture was",Paragraph
characterized by a rather homogeneous design philosophy noted for its rationalism. Apart,Paragraph
"from the work of Kotera, this rationalism is seen in the designs of the rest of the pioneers",Paragraph
"of Czech modern architecture (Otakar Novotny, Josef Gocar, and Pavel Janak), Slovak",Caption
"modern architecture (Dusan Jurkovic, Michal Harminc, and Emil Bellus), and Moravian",Paragraph
"modern architecture (Ammost Wiesner, Jan Visek, Jiri Kroha, and Bohuslav Fuchs). Their",Paragraph
"familiarity with the progressive ideas of Otto Wagner, Adolf Loos, P.H.Berlage, Henry",Caption
"van de Velde, Tony Garnier, Auguste Perret, and Peter Behrens fueled the process.",Paragraph
"Kotera consistently enhanced serviceability and simplicity of form, using traditional",Paragraph
"building materials. His first significant Art Nouveau building, the Peterka House (1899—",Paragraph
"1900) on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is a mixed-use row building. Other notable Art",Paragraph
"Noveau projects include the National House in Prostejov, the Chamber of Commerce",Paragraph
"Pavilion (1908) at the exhibition in Prague, and the Municipal Museum (1906-12) in",Paragraph
Hradec Kralove.,Paragraph
Kotera’s significant residential architecture also includes the Laichter Apartment,Paragraph
"House (1908-09) and his own villa (1908-09), both in Prague, noteworthy for their",Paragraph
"careful fenestration and brick and stucco finishes. Similarly, in the Laichter Apartment",Paragraph
"House, the materials for the five-story structure are brick and stucco. Devoid of any",Paragraph
"embellishment, the asymmetrical composition of the building’s plan and corresponding",Paragraph
facade features an offset cantilevered mass. The restraining simplicity and the lack of,Paragraph
decor distinguish these designs.,Paragraph
"The Mozarteum (Urbanek Department Store, 1912-13) in Prague is a symmetrical",Paragraph
composition separated from its neighbors by a rectangular concrete frame topped by a,Paragraph
triangular gable. The building’s dynamic facade is a precedent to Kotera’s Cubist period.,Paragraph
His 1913 entry in the competition for the monument to Zizka on Vitkov Hill in Prague,Caption
represents an articulate application of the Cubist language widely accepted among Czech,Paragraph
modernists.,Paragraph
The search for a new architecture preoccupied many early 20th-century architects.,Paragraph
Social and political changes were accompanied by a search for national identity.,Paragraph
Architects returned to their ancestral origins for elements specific to the people and their,Paragraph
region. Architect Dusan Jurkovic (1868-1947) relied on traditional peasant wooden,Paragraph
architecture. He was interested in the indigenous architecture of villages and in the Arts,Paragraph
"and Crafts movement. After studies in Vienna, Jurkovic’s first built works were the",Paragraph
mountain resort buildings located in Radhost and Rezek. In his Luhacovice Spa (1902-,Caption
"03), the half-timber construction buildings for lodging, dining, and services were",Paragraph
"designed in the Art Nouveau style. During World War I, in 1916-18, Jurkovic designed",Paragraph
"for the military command in Krakow a series of soldier cemeteries, monuments, and",Paragraph
"grave markers located in southeastern Poland. Here, inspired by the indigenous",Paragraph
"architecture, he used carved wood. A singularly important work of Jurkovic’s is the",Paragraph
Memorial to General Stefanik (1925-28) at Bradlo. Working conscientiously with the,Paragraph
"landscape, Jurkovic designed stations (1936-38) for the cable car to the Lomnicky",Paragraph
"(peak) in the High Tatras. A leader in modern architecture in Slovakia, Jurkovic designed",Paragraph
the four stations by combining the natural features of each site with the demands of,Paragraph
technical operations and human habitation.,Paragraph
Architect Vladimir Karfik (1901-96) apprenticed with both Le Corbusier (1924-25),Paragraph
"and Frank Lloyd Wright (1927-29). From 1930 to 1946, he was the chief architect of the",Paragraph
"Bata Company, where he developed “Zlin Architecture,” based on an efficient and",Paragraph
economic construction system of a distinctive industrial image applied to a variety of,Paragraph
building types. The Zlin Architecture construction system was used for a number of one-,Paragraph
factory towns in Czechoslovakia and abroad. After World War IL Karfik was appointed,Paragraph
"to the new school of architecture at the Slovak Technical University in Bratislava, where",Paragraph
he was one of the most influential professors.,Paragraph
The history of Czechoslovakia has been tumultuous. In 1938 Nazi Germany forced the,Paragraph
European powers to agree to divide the country into a Czech protectorate and the Slovak,Paragraph
"Republic. After World War II, Czechoslovakia reunited, but soon the population faced",Paragraph
"another catastrophe with the communist political takeover in February 1948, when the",Paragraph
Soviet government took over Czechoslovakia. Architects had to give up private offices to,Paragraph
become employees in large state-controlled design institutes. Functionalism was,Paragraph
condemned as an expression of a bourgeois cosmopolitanism.,Paragraph
"Despite the oppressive conditions, extraordinary buildings were designed under the",Paragraph
totalitarian regime. The 1969 International Union of Architects (UIA) Perret Award was,Paragraph
"given to the Television Tower (1963—71) on Jested Hill near Liberec, designed by Karel",Caption

Ludwig was one of the most influential of the new patrons of contemporary architecture,Paragraph

and Crafts movement because of his frequent trips to England and his having already,Paragraph
commissioned Baillie Scott in 1897 to design furniture and interior decorations for the,Paragraph
dining and drawing rooms of his palace at Darmstadt. C.R.Ashbee was invited to design,Paragraph
"the light fittings, and his Guild and School of Handicraft in London was asked to make",Paragraph
both furniture and fittings. The colony was a response to a memorandum prepared for the,Paragraph
"parliament and important local people by Alexander Kock, proprietor of a local wallpaper",Caption
factory. He and others acknowledged the important role that the applied arts might play,Paragraph
"in future economic development. Aware of English developments, the memorandum",Paragraph
included ideas for the development of homes for artists and ateliers for applied art. Seven,Paragraph
"artists were invited to form the colony on the Matildehdhe, and they were to design and",Paragraph
direct the production of goods by other craftspeople and workshops. The outcomes were,Paragraph
"published and promoted by Kock through his journals, and the latter a German",Paragraph
imitation of the English . Twenty-three artists worked there at various times from 1899,Paragraph
"to 1914, when the venture ceased.",Paragraph
"Parklike grounds (already containing a reservoir), the Russian Chapel, and a number",Paragraph
of villas were offered by Ernst Ludwig. The colony was to be a “living and working,Paragraph
"world” and to form a public exhibition, (A Document of German Art), to be held in",Paragraph
1901. The intention was to show the public a model style of home decoration in,Paragraph
"individually designed artists’ houses. The artists—Hans Christiansen, Paul Biirck, Patriz",Paragraph
"Huber, Josef Olbrich, Peter Behrens, Ludwig Habich, and Rudolf Bosselt—were given a",Paragraph
"three-year contract and a housing subsidy, although they had to pay construction costs",Paragraph
"themselves. Work started immediately, and the resulting villa suburb formed the main",Paragraph
"part of the exhibition, creating an event in the field of architecture and interior decoration",Paragraph
that bore witness both to the individuality of the members and to the collective strength,Paragraph
"of the colony. Olbrich organized the layout of the exhibition in 1901, designing most of",Paragraph
"the buildings himself. Architecture included not only Olbrich’s Ermst-Ludwig-Haus, the",Paragraph
"artistic center, and a theater but also various temporary structures and the artists’ houses",Paragraph
themselves. Writings of the artists reveal that they were concerned with aesthetic rather,Paragraph
"than functional considerations. No reference is made to machinery, mass production, or",Paragraph
cost-effectiveness in projects undertaken by the colony. In one of three articles on the,Paragraph
Darmstadt colony by W. Fred in Behrens gave a cogent analysis of the aims of the Arts,Paragraph
"and Crafts in Germany: “Architecture is the art of building, and comprises in its name",Paragraph
two ideas: the mastery of the practical and the art of the beautiful. There is always,Paragraph
something exhilarating in being able to combine in one word the two ideas—that of,Paragraph
practical utility and that of abstract beauty—which unfortunately have too often been,Paragraph
opposed to each other.” The architecture and design at the colony showed progressive,Paragraph
"unification of the practical and the beautiful, going beyond the possibilities of artistic",Paragraph
hand production to the wider field of industry.,Paragraph
"Built on a gradient, the two-story Ernst-Ludwig-Haus, a long, low, shedlike design",Paragraph

"behind the other, to provide useful, well-lit spaces. The lower story contained living",Paragraph
"rooms for the bachelors along with the general fencing, gymnastic, and recreational",Paragraph
rooms.,Paragraph
"Grouped around the atelier were the private houses, which adhere to two basic types:",Paragraph

"Vienna, with its emphasis on the square block of the house with larger windows, sudden",Paragraph
"projection, and a flat roof extending far out over the walls. The Gliickert II house is a",Paragraph

"vocabulary, in which he repeats linear border patterns and mold forms derived from",Paragraph
nature into stucco and plaster. All his designs provide interesting color harmonies and,Paragraph
"demonstrate a simplification of form, tending toward geometry, but all bear the hallmark",Paragraph
"of quality, craftsmanship, and respect for materials. The first story of Olbrich’s own",Paragraph
house had glazed tiles on the facade.,Paragraph
"Behrens designed his own small villa, employing a compact plan. The exterior shows",Caption
the free interpretation of vernacular forms combined with an attempt at structural,Paragraph
rationalism that contrasts with the picturesqueness of Olbrich. He employed brick and,Paragraph
"green terra-cotta tiles to invoke the vernacular of the Baltics, which he admired.",Paragraph
"Internally, curvilinear echoes of Art Nouveau are outweighed by simplified forms that are",Paragraph
more in accordance with contemporary Viennese trends. The pavement running between,Paragraph
"the artists’ houses is designed in a black-and-white linear geometric pattern, formed out",Paragraph
of small flat cobbles and serving to unite the individually designed villas.,Paragraph
"The exhibition of 1901 was a financial failure, and the critical reception was mixed,",Paragraph
although it was recognized as an important point in the development of German design.,Paragraph
"A less ambitious exhibition followed in 1904, responding to the criticism that objects",Paragraph
were too expensive and sometimes “eccentric.” Olbrich created a “group of three houses”,Paragraph

recalled vernacular work.,Paragraph

"respect for technological inventions and the design principles of modernism, including its",Paragraph
"Utopian goals. Nonetheless, he has protested against the rigidity of the Modern",Paragraph
"movement and the International Style. In his multifaceted career, however, his name will",Paragraph
"inevitably be linked with Urbino, the hill town in the Marches, where Renaissance",Paragraph
architecture reached its summit in Federigo da Montefelto’s Ducal Palace. His work in,Paragraph
"Urbino is ongoing, beginning with his master plan and now clearly visible in his",Paragraph

"When international modernism was at its zenith, De Carlo condemned the",Paragraph
preoccupation with style divorced from the social realities of the day.,Paragraph
"While remaining open to the enriched possibilities of Postmodernism, he",Paragraph
"decried its superficiality, even frivolity. In fact, he believed that",Paragraph
architecture was too important to be limited to the narrow domain of,Paragraph
"architects. Rather, it is the architect’s “responsibility” to humanity that",Paragraph
constitutes the basis of their life and work. Evidence of this creed is found,Paragraph
"in De Carlo’s housing complexes, where he encourages participation",Paragraph
"between architect and users, a type of collaborative planning fully",Paragraph
cognizant of the needs of inhabitants. Mindful of the inhumanity—and,Paragraph
"severe lack—of postwar housing, with its disregard for scale, social",Paragraph
"realities, and historical circumstances, he challenged the idea of",Paragraph
“minimum living standard” as set forth at the CIAM conference in,Paragraph

"Still, a paradigm for architect/client collaboration is the Village Matteotti (1969-74) in",Paragraph
"the industrial town of Terni, 60 miles northeast of Rome. Meetings with the steelworkers",Paragraph

"phases of construction. When completed, the Village Matteotti raised the standard for",Paragraph
"workers’ housing. Unlike Terni, the housing at Mazzorbo, begun in 1950 on an island in",Paragraph
"the Venetian lagoon, focused primarily on morphological considerations. Because of the",Paragraph
"distinct identity of Mazzorbo’s residents, De Carlo emphasized the unique setting and a",Paragraph
strong vernacular tradition in his effort to design new forms that evoke the past by,Paragraph
articulating it and enriching it with the use of local color and variety in building types and,Paragraph
plans.,Paragraph

DECONSTRUCTIVISM,Title
"Deconstructivism is a theoretical term that emerged within art, architecture, and the",Paragraph
philosophical literature of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The movement refers mainly to,Paragraph
"an architectural language of displaced, distorted, angular forms, often set within",Paragraph
conflicting geometries. With origins in the ideas of French philosopher Jacques Derrida (,Paragraph
"1930), deconstructivism generated an iconoclastic style of the avant-garde whose",Paragraph
"principle architec tural exponents included Coop Himmelb(l)au, Zaha Hadid, Behnisch",Paragraph
"and Partners, Bernard Tschumi, Peter Eisenman, Morphosis, Rem Koolhaas, Daniel",Paragraph
"Libeskind, and Frank Gehry, among others. Curiously, while these and other architects",Paragraph
"have continued to practice in a related formal language, the terms once used to describe",Paragraph
their work have long since dropped out of usage.,Paragraph
Deconstruction in the field of architecture owes its origins to two parallel events that,Paragraph
took place in 1988. One was an exhibition titled “Deconstructivist Architecture” held at,Paragraph
the Museum of Modern Art in New York City; the second was a conference titled,Paragraph
“Deconstruction in Art and Architecture” held at the Tate Gallery in London. The,Paragraph
different terms employed by the organizers to describe their respective events highlighted,Paragraph
their differing trajectories. The exhibition in New York—originally to be called “Neo-,Paragraph
Constructivist Architecture” with reference to a revival of the Russian stylistic movement,Paragraph
from the early part of the 20th century—highlighted the formal language emerging in the,Paragraph
"work of a group of avant-garde architects, including several of those aforementioned. The",Paragraph
"event in London, meanwhile, stressed the connection to Derridian philosophy.",Paragraph
"Deconstruction emerged out of the poststructuralist tradition of literary theory, which,",Paragraph
"in opposition to structuralism, stressed the slippage and fluctuation of meaning that is",Paragraph
always at work in the process of linguistic and cultural signification. Derrida first used,Paragraph
the term to refer to a mode of inquiry that sought to expose the paradoxes and value-laden,Paragraph
hierarchies that exist within the discourse of Western metaphysics. Although,Paragraph
"deconstruction dismantles or analyses such concepts, it was never meant to be nihilistic,",Paragraph
"according to Derrida. Rather, it serves as an epistemological method of engagement with",Paragraph
"the world. Although Derrida once described the philosopher as a “would-be architect,”",Paragraph
"always searching for secure foundations on which to construct an argument, the links",Paragraph
between the philosophical term and architecture are clearly metaphorical. Derrida’s sense,Paragraph
of the word is a method and not a style.,Paragraph
The connection between Deconstruction and architecture stemmed largely from,Paragraph
Bernard Tschumi’s use of Derrida’s ideas in his competition-winning 1983 design for the,Paragraph
Parc de la Vilette in Paris. Tschumi proposed a nonhierarchical grid of dispersed,Paragraph
"pavilions instead of a more traditional building, echoing deconstruction’s own",Paragraph
"challenging of linguistic arrangements. Later, Derrida himself collaborated with Peter",Paragraph
"Eisenman in the design of a small section of the landscaping of the park, and he",Paragraph
"subsequently wrote a commentary on Tschumi’s project, reading the random play of",Paragraph
forms as metaphors for the aleatory or contingent play of meaning in language. Derrida,Paragraph
"significantly referred in this piece to the “architecture of architecture.” In other words, if",Paragraph
"thinking about architecture is itself already a social construct, one might conclude that",Paragraph
what needs to be deconstructed are not the architectural forms themselves but rather the,Paragraph
theoretical assumptions that lie behind the design of those forms.,Paragraph
"In effect, there were two competing events claiming Deconstructivism as",Paragraph
"their own; it either referred to a purely stylistic phenomenon, or it referred",Paragraph
to a broad intellectual shift that encompassed not only philosophy but all,Paragraph
"the visual arts. As Bernard Tschumi noted, “The multiple interpretations",Paragraph
that multiple architects [have given] to deconstruction [have become],Paragraph
more multiple than deconstruction’s theory of multiple readings could,Paragraph
ever have hoped.”,Paragraph

deconstructivist style in architecture relates to what art historian and critic Hal Foster has,Paragraph

"recuperation within a cyclical, historical process that leads to ever-new emergent",Paragraph
expressions of modernisms.,Paragraph
"Derrida himself consistently refused to articulate what, if any, connection there was",Paragraph

"The transition from Neoclassicism to the Nordic adaptation of the Modern movement,",Paragraph
"commonly referred to as functionalism, is most clearly seen in the area of housing, as",Paragraph
living standards and housing shortages were of political and social importance in,Paragraph
Denmark following World War I. One of the leaders in improving housing was,Paragraph
"Copenhagen’s Public Housing Association (KAB), which oversaw the construction of the",Paragraph
Studiebyen demonstration project (1920-24) to examine alternatives for singlefamily,Paragraph
"houses, duplexes, and row houses. Among the architects participating were Thorkild",Paragraph
"Henningsen and Ivar Bentsen, Anton Rosen, and the influential teacher and architect Kay",Paragraph
"Fisker. During the same period, Henningsen and Bentsen were also commissioned by the",Paragraph
KAB to build a series of row houses around Copenhagen that provided small back and,Paragraph

The search for an appropriate expression and a defining style is evident in the new,Paragraph

from the work of Leon Kreir and employs traditional town-planning principles in an,Paragraph

Buildings that resulted from competitions during the late 1980s and early 1990s also,Paragraph
reveal the lack of a defining style that is characteristic of recent Danish architecture. In,Paragraph
"1988, a competition was held for a new Museum of Modern Art to be built south of",Paragraph
"Copenhagen. Completed in 1996 by Seren Robert Lund, this building is one of the few in",Paragraph
Denmark that appears to have been influenced by the briefly fashionable,Paragraph
deconstructivism. Two recent additions to major buildings in Copenhagen have resulted,Paragraph
"from competitions in the 1990s: the Royal Library (1993-99) by Schmidt, Hammer, and",Paragraph
Lassen and the National Gallery (1998) by C.F.Mellers Tegnestue. Both of these,Caption
additions illustrate a current tendency to create buildings appearing as freestanding,Paragraph
objects that bear little relation to the immediate context.,Paragraph
Whereas some architects have aggressively experimented with a range of styles,Paragraph
"imported from abroad, others have quietly worked to develop an architecture devoid of",Paragraph
superficial effects. Of particular note are the summer cottage (1985-87) on the island of,Paragraph
"Leese, the Holstebro Art Museum (1981, addition 1991) by Hanne Kjerholm, and the",Caption
"work of the firm Fogh and Felner, including the Bornholm Art Museum (1993), Egedal",Paragraph
"Church (1990), and Tornbjerg Church (1994). Perhaps the most significant contributions",Paragraph
to the development of an architecture sympathetic to material and context have come,Paragraph
"from Gerhdt Bornebusch, as evident in the Danish School of Forestry (1981-92) in",Paragraph
"Nedebo, the extension and renovation of the National Museum (1990-92), and the",Paragraph
Danish Forest and Landscape Institute (1995).,Paragraph

"“industrial combine” Allgemeine Elektricitats Gesellschaft (AEG); and Karl Schmidt,",Paragraph
director of the Dresdner Werkstatten fiir Handwerkskunst (Dresden Workshop for,Paragraph

"what he perceived as an ideal model for a native craft culture, and Naumann’s (1906;",Paragraph

Initial membership of the Werkbund included 12 architects and 12 industrial firms.,Paragraph
"Architects included such important figures as Peter Behrens, Theodor Fischer, Josef",Paragraph

array of contemporary design disciplines.,Paragraph
"With the industrial revolution, the traditional roles of art and architecture—modes of",Paragraph

examining industrial production and mass consumption on the entire field of applied art,Title

"Practical Aesthetics). Coupled with contemporary scientific, economic, and industrial",Paragraph

anthropology and the natural sciences—provided much of the impetus for a rethinking,Paragraph
the role of art and architecture in modern German society during the 19th and 20th,Title
"centuries. Accordingly, members of the Deutscher Werkbund recognized that the shifting",Paragraph
attitudes toward the arts and crafts were not merely based on stylistic motivations but,Paragraph
were the result of a more generalized critique of cultural production and its place within,Paragraph
"society. Thus, individuals associated with the Werkbund recognized the social",Paragraph
responsibility of the artist and architect. This led to the Werkbund’s acknowledgment (in,Paragraph
"the footsteps of 19th-century English theorists Augustus Welby Pugin, William Morris,",Paragraph
"and John Ruskin) of the significance, indeed power, of a coherent, exemplary range of",Paragraph
industrial and consumer products on the world stage.,Paragraph
Germany (a loose federation of duchies and nation-states until 1866) had long suffered,Paragraph
from the perception that its art and architecture exposed a general ignorance of tasteful,Paragraph
“culture.” Although Germany was traditionally recognized for the manufacture of,Paragraph
"efficient, practical, and cost-effective goods and products (most notably its instruments of",Paragraph
"war), these products were usually criticized—often rightfully—as being of inferior design",Paragraph
"quality. The Werkbund sought to correct this perception, if not reality, by seeking to",Paragraph
"broadly inculcate a seamless marriage between economy, form, and artistic taste. This",Paragraph
new vision—as a practice and an idea—was referred to by the term a word that,Paragraph
"translates literally as “functional art.” As a new approach to design, the application of",Paragraph
principles derived from would better not only consumer products for use by the,Paragraph
Germans themselves but also competitive products for export purposes. In promoting the,Paragraph
"nation’s manufactured goods, the Werkbund also sought to articulate a fundamental",Paragraph
revision of the nation’s (culture). Germany was to be perceived no longer as a,Paragraph
militarist—if efficient—nation devoid of the cultural élan of the rest of Europe but as a,Paragraph
"participating, sophisticated equal on the world stage. Thus, the strength, wealth, and spirit",Paragraph
"(in accordance with Semper, among others) was implicitly, if not explicitly, rendered by",Paragraph
the products that it produced. (It should be noted that this faith in domestic products was,Paragraph
not specific to Germany but exemplified a more general trend throughout Europe and the,Paragraph
Americas whereby capitalist economic models for industrial production and economic,Title
development were increasingly seen as extensions of national culture.),Paragraph
"In the 1910s, Walter Gropius, who, with fellow German architect Adolf Meyer,",Paragraph
advanced some of the newer techniques and materials in their architectural work of the,Paragraph

published his “Aims of the Werkbund” on behalf of the society. His earlier reports on,Paragraph

"and Crafts movement for his German audience, along with his advo cacy of engineering",Paragraph
"and standardization in projects such as the Eiffel Tower, station halls, and bicycle wheels,",Paragraph
"had already lent Muthesius notoriety, if not credibility, among his peers. In “Aims of the",Paragraph
"Werkbund,” Muthesius proposes what may be regarded as a “call to arms” for artists,",Paragraph
"architects, and their associates, an argument that he supports with the suggestion that",Paragraph
cultural production has not enjoined the revolutionary changes of the day and that it is not,Paragraph
only the social but also the spiritual responsibility of his compatriots to embrace change.,Paragraph
"Indeed, Muthesius not only emphasized the material and technical problems confronted",Paragraph
"by his contemporaries but also heralded a “spiritual purpose” for the arts and architecture,",Paragraph
a purpose that extended to the economy as a whole—what Frederic Schwarz (1996),Paragraph
"refers to as the pursuit of a “spiritualized economy” (75). Accordingly, architectural",Paragraph
culture “remains the true index of a nation’s culture as a whole...without a total respect,Paragraph
"for form, culture is unthinkable, and formlessness is synonymous with lack of culture.",Paragraph
"Form is a higher spiritual need” (Conrads, 27). In addition, Muthesius saw his project for",Paragraph
"the arts and architecture as a logical expression of Germany’s vocation, a nation that",Paragraph
"enjoyed, according to Muthesius, its “reputation for the most strict and exact organisation",Paragraph
"in her businesses, heavy industry, and state institutions of any country in the world.” For",Paragraph
"Muthesius, the will to “pure Form” (elaborated as the synthesis of form and function)",Paragraph
"was an extension of the nation’s “military discipline” and, consequently, a manifestation",Paragraph
ofits (inner being).,Paragraph
"Seeking to counter Muthesius’ arguments in “Aims of the Werkbund,” the Belgian",Paragraph
architect Henry van de Velde joined Muthesius in propounding what became the,Paragraph
internally contradictory document “Werkbund Theses and Antitheses”—irreconcilable,Paragraph
differences that both architects expressed publicly during the proceedings of the,Paragraph
Werkbund Congress of 1914. Whereas Muthesius proclaimed “concentration and,Paragraph
standardization as the aims of Werkbund design” (a statement implicitly supporting the,Paragraph
"collective project of the design arts, including architecture), his colleague, van de Velde,",Paragraph
defined the essential nature of the argument as a struggle between two opposing ideals:,Paragraph
“Type versus Individuality.” Although it is true that van de Velde was espousing what,Paragraph
was already a rear-guard position by suggesting that artists are first and foremost,Paragraph
"“creative individualists,” the argument did not end with the imminent success of a",Paragraph
"standardized economy. Dispensing with any attempt at dialectical fusion, both architects",Paragraph
wrote several axioms supporting their stances regarding standardization and creative,Paragraph
freedom. Presented on the occasion of the first great exhibition of the Deutscher,Paragraph
"Werkbund in Cologne in July 1914, the document, coupled with the ideologically diverse",Paragraph
designs for the exhibition (as in Peter Behrens’s Neoclassicism versus Gropius and,Paragraph
"Meyer’s model office building and factory, Faguswerk), continued to affect discussions",Paragraph
surrounding cultural production and arts and design education well into the future. It,Paragraph
"should be noted, however, that both Muthesius and van de Velde maintained a belief in",Paragraph
"the spiritual nature of cultural production, but Muthestus sought a universal set of values,",Paragraph
"reflected by a dominance of “good taste.” It is also significant that Gropius, founder of",Paragraph
"the Staatliches Bauhaus Weimar in 1919—a program that, not incidentally, was housed in",Paragraph
the building where van de Velde had directed his own state-funded School of Arts and,Paragraph
Crafts—partook in the discussions surrounding the aims and directions of the Werkbund.,Paragraph
These same ideological differences would have a bearing on the formulation and,Paragraph
development of Gropius’s Bauhaus pedagogical programs as well.,Paragraph

The literal meaning of the name Dhaka is “concealed.” The enigmatic name might,Paragraph
have originated from the “dhak” trees that are presumed to have been common in the area,Paragraph
or the renowned 16th-century Dhakeswari Temple. Dhaka went through waves of decay,Paragraph

"Like similar cities undergoing rapid transformations, Dhaka is also a city of social,",Paragraph

"called developing cities (overpopulation, pollution, traffic problems, housing crisis, etc.),",Paragraph
Dhaka is the center of an exuberant Bengali culture expressed in its literary and artistic,Paragraph
life and various urban rituals and festivities.,Paragraph
"Once located on the northern banks of the river Buriganga, Dhaka has grown largely",Paragraph
"toward the north, being delimited on all other sides by rivers and mostly fertile",Paragraph
agricultural land subject to heavy flood. The extent of greater Dhaka now comprises the,Paragraph
river port of Naryanganj in the south and the industrial town of Tongi and Gazipur on the,Paragraph
"north. Although most of Dhaka city is still on a higher level, population increase in recent",Paragraph
times has driven people to build on the low-lying flood-prone areas.,Paragraph
The city is now constituted of roughly five distinct urban morphologies: (1) the so-,Paragraph
"called old city, the original settlement that grew along the river Buriganga and later",Paragraph
"developed into a thriving Mughal city, with its jostling mixed-use buildings, narrow,",Paragraph
"winding streets, and legendary neighborhood traditions; (2) the so-called colonial part,",Paragraph
"the site of new governmental, cultural, institutional, and residential buildings, especially",Paragraph
around the Ramna area in a bungalow and garden typology; (3) post-1947 developments,Paragraph
"of a mixture of regulated and planned residential areas, and sporadic commercial and",Paragraph

"with inadequate infrastructure, symptomatic of planning incapacity in addressing",Paragraph
demographic and economic pressures. The fifth morphology is that of the exclusive,Paragraph
"National Capital Complex, better known as Sherebanglanagar that represents Kahn’s",Paragraph
vision of a government and civic complex.,Paragraph
The unassuming status of Dhaka belies its substantial role in the history of the Indian,Paragraph
"subcontinent. Historically, Dhaka has experienced paradoxical political orientation: On",Paragraph
"the one hand, it was the base of a Muslim ideology that led to the formation of Pakistan,",Paragraph
"and on the other hand, it was home to a Bengali nationalism that eventually led to the",Paragraph
breakup of Pakistan and the formation of Bangladesh.,Paragraph
A strong Muslim culture was established with the consolidation of Mughal,Paragraph
"rule over Bengal in 1596, making it the eastern edge of a vast empire ruled",Paragraph
from Delhi and Agra. For the nearly 150 years that Bengal was a Mughal,Paragraph
"province, the capital vacillated between Dhaka, Rajmahal, and",Paragraph
"Murshidabad, and with that fluctuated the economic and cultural spirit of",Paragraph
the city. Dhaka went into a slow decline when it finally lost its capital,Paragraph

and resources. The slump was deepened when the,Paragraph

© Aga Khan Trust for Culture,Title
English wrested control of Bengal (1757) and established Calcutta as the base of their,Paragraph
trading outfit. The economy of Dhaka was particularly hurt when its legendary,Paragraph
production was literally destroyed by English trade and tax machinations. Population,Paragraph
"would decrease drastically (from 450,000 in 1765 to 69,000 in 1838), and buildings",Paragraph
would be overrun by vegetation. Dhaka would not gain a new momentum until the,Paragraph
beginning of the 20th century under different English policies.,Paragraph
Since the 19th century Dhaka and Calcutta have played out a sort of tale of two cities,Paragraph
"in the history and psyche of modern Bengal. As Dhaka came to be seen, and in some",Paragraph
"ways projected itself, as the bearer of a Muslim culture, Calcutta became, despite or",Paragraph
"because of a stronger English presence, a Hindu-dominant city. The partition of Bengal",Paragraph
"into two provinces in 1905 that established Dhaka as the capital of East Bengal, again",Paragraph
"annulled in 1911, triggered a nationalist uprising that was to be a basis of the Indian",Paragraph
independence movement. It was in Dhaka that the Muslim League took root as a political,Paragraph
party in 1906 whose leadership was eventually to go to the Bombay-based M.A. Jinnah in,Paragraph
the articulation of a separate state for Muslims. That political program was realized in the,Paragraph
partitioning of India and the formation of Pakistan in 1947. Pakistan was to be constituted,Paragraph
"of two provinces, separated physically by India, where Dhaka became the capital of the",Paragraph
eastern province. The argument for a Capital Complex in Dhaka came up as a result of,Paragraph
this improbable condition when the government decided to transfer the parliamentary,Paragraph
business between the central capital in Islamabad in West Pakistan (designed as a brand-,Paragraph
new city by Doxiadis) and Dhaka (where a “Second Capital” was to be built). The defeat,Paragraph
of the Pakistan Army in Dhaka during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971,Title
represented the ascendance of a Bengali nationalist ideology and the establishment of the,Paragraph
city as the capital of an independent country.,Paragraph
"Dhaka has been described variously as “the city of mosques,” with every conceivable",Paragraph
"neighborhood hosting a structure or two, and the city with “ba-anno bazaar, tepanno goli”",Paragraph
"(52 bazaars and 53 alleys), referring to the intricate network of winding streets forming",Paragraph
the fabric of the old city. Although the profusion of mosques bespeak of a predominant,Paragraph

"and mosques, residential neighborhoods of that time established morphology of dense,",Paragraph
"cellular buildings and courtyards along commercially active streets, traces of which can",Paragraph
"still be seen in parts of the old city (such as Shakhari Bazar, Islampur). Buildings of the",Paragraph
colonial era were devoted mostly to administrative and institutional types that shifted,Paragraph
stylistically between European neoclassical and quasi-Mughal modes. The typology of,Paragraph
the bungalow in a garden setting became established at that time as a mode of urban,Paragraph

"practice in Basel, Switzerland. From 1978 until 1984, the younger Diener collaborated",Paragraph
"primarily with Wolfgang Schett and Dieter Righetti, who already worked in Marcus’s",Paragraph
practice. Other key members of the Diener and Diener design team included Jens Erb and,Paragraph
Andreas Ruedi; both joined the firm in 1983 and have remained perhaps the most,Paragraph
influential members of the group. Roger Diener has taught at the ETH (Eidendssiche,Paragraph
Technische Hochschule Zurich) Lausanne and at Harvard University’s Graduate School,Paragraph
of Design.,Paragraph
Diener and Diener are best known for their large residential complexes and housing,Paragraph
"plans, which are most recognizable by their simple features and severe facades. The firm",Paragraph
has also won a number of town-planning commissions. Their designs are sophisticated,Paragraph
"and functionalist, adhering to the most positive traits of the modern philosophy while",Paragraph
using the most unpretentious methods and materials possible.,Paragraph
When Diener and Diener first began designing large-scale apartment complexes in the,Paragraph
"late 1970s, postmodernism was at its height in Europe. The team wisely steered clear of",Paragraph
these stylistic leanings and made their own mark with simplicity as their goal. The team’s,Paragraph
"modern vocabulary, attention to function, and commitment to a variety of materials and",Paragraph
construction methods set the firm apart. Their trademark materials have remained stone,Paragraph
and colored concrete. The firm interprets the culture and history of Basel through many,Paragraph
"of their buildings, either via the facade and its conscious relationship to the urban design",Paragraph
and street or in their pedestrian choices of materials. Diener and Diener employ design,Paragraph
"methods such as gridded mullions and lourves, and that often reappear throughout a range",Paragraph
"of different types of buildings, from office buildings to apartments.",Paragraph
The Hammerstrasse Apartment Complex (1981) in Basel exemplifies the firm’s design,Paragraph
preferences. Diener and Diener’s challenge was to sensitively link the 19th-century urban,Paragraph
plan to the new housing complex. The firm’s design is an analogous display of a,Paragraph
"traditional peripheral apartment block of the late 19th century, where residences face the",Paragraph
"street, and communal space and walkways abound behind a row of studios. Apartments",Paragraph
open up to the rear courtyard through large windows. Smaller apartments of different,Paragraph
"designs are intended for singles and the elderly, and larger units are intended for small",Paragraph
families or communal living situations. Floor plans are of the utmost importance. The,Paragraph
"appeal to external variety is answered in the many different facings, ranging from",Paragraph
corrugated aluminum to green glass and painted concrete. In many of the firm’s,Paragraph
"residential buildings, windows will span nearly the entire wall to allow for light and a",Paragraph
sense of space without encroaching on the proportions of the room.,Paragraph
Because most of their commissions are communal in nature—offices or housing,Paragraph
estates—Diener and Diener developed early on a sensitivity to the role of the individual,Paragraph
"within the society. Naturally, they questioned the differences between the individual and",Paragraph
the collective and how to express this in built form. They developed interrelationships,Paragraph
"between the city center and residential neighborhoods, neighborhood streets and",Paragraph
"courtyards of houses, and this space and the apartment with the apartment’s relationship",Paragraph
"to everything around it. Within this scheme, it is the spaces where all these relationships",Paragraph
"intersect that define Diener and Diener’s approach to space. Each project is unique, even",Paragraph
"when details are repeated from previous commissions, and reflects the urban environment",Paragraph
around it. The firm has been key to the unique development of buildings in Switzerland.,Paragraph
"This is particularly true in the Basel area, where the government obliges architects to",Paragraph
"consider the urban pattern, the region’s culture, and its inhabitants when planning a minor",Paragraph
housing estate or a full city plan. A discipline to use minimal means and available,Paragraph

"Architect and engineer, Uruguay",Title
"Eladio Dieste was born in Artigas, Uruguay, in 1917. He received his engineering",Paragraph
"degree in 1943 from the University of the Republic in Montevideo, where he taught",Paragraph
structures from 1943 until 1973. In 1953 Dieste begin his association with the engineer,Paragraph
"Eugenic Montafiez. For almost half a century, Dieste conducted research and worked",Paragraph
with reinforced brick. He developed structural masonry techniques using brick for water,Paragraph
"tanks, factories, horizontal silos, churches, towers, and bus stations.",Paragraph
Dieste recognized that the conditions that generated modern architecture in Europe,Paragraph
and North America were distinct from those in Latin America. He reasoned that the,Paragraph
design opportunities presented in Latin American countries did not demand that solutions,Paragraph
resemble those produced in developed nations. He therefore understood that each culture,Paragraph
"could integrate technological change in its own manner, according to its own reality.",Paragraph
"Dieste relied on the rational economic use of construction materials and methods, a",Paragraph
"respect for natural resources, and a knowledge of materials’ properties. Convinced that",Paragraph
"development results from using regional techniques and technologies, he proposed",Paragraph
construction methods and materials that considered the social and economic conditions of,Paragraph
"his country and the regions where he worked. Because Dieste used brick, one of the",Paragraph
"oldest and most humble construction materials, his work proved that it is possible to",Paragraph
combine austerity and beauty and to understand local conditions while experimenting,Paragraph
rigorously.,Paragraph
Dieste employed the principles of simple and double curvature in concrete and,Paragraph
transferred it to brick and reinforced ceramic. This structural innovation allowed him to,Paragraph
"benefit from the characteristics of the new material. His use of brick, as opposed to",Paragraph
"concrete, offered lightness, responded to deformations, sustained the test of time, and",Paragraph
minimized maintenance. Because ceramic brick is more resistant to temperature changes,Paragraph
"than concrete, it offers excellent thermal insulation. It is also inexpensive, acoustically",Paragraph
"resilient, and easy to repair or modify.",Paragraph
Dieste experimented with two principal structural types: the Gaussa vault and the self-,Paragraph
"supporting vault. The Gaussa vault contains a double curvature that combines brick, iron,",Paragraph
"and mortar. The word coined by Dieste, refers to vaults that he employed to cover large",Paragraph
spaces using a minimal amount of reinforcement. The second type of vault that he often,Paragraph
"employed was designed to be completely self-supporting. In both cases, he relied on",Paragraph
skills of regional workmen and used machinery that he designed and assembled.,Paragraph
One of the best examples of Dieste’s work can be seen in the celebrated Atlantida,Paragraph
"church (1960, formerly a rectilinear warehouse. Dieste conceived a series of linear brick",Paragraph
walls that are straight at the base and begin to undulate in the middle as they approach a,Paragraph
"double-curvature, continuous membrane roof. The conoidal-shaped walls and the",Paragraph
Gaussian vaults create a monolithic and powerful form. The spatial light recalls Le,Paragraph
"Corbusier’s Notre-Dame-du-Haut, Ronchamp, yet its conceptual distinction is seen in the",Paragraph
changing brick textures and sculptural lightness. The bell tower is constructed with,Paragraph
reinforced brick.,Paragraph
Dieste’s search for structural expression and formal richness is also achieved in the,Paragraph
"Church in San Pedro, Durazno (1971). This church was built over the ruins of a parish",Paragraph
church that had been destroyed by fire. The old parish followed the traditional layout of a,Paragraph
central nave and two aisles separated by columns. The new structure consists of three,Paragraph
"folded slabs, two walls slanting toward the interior, and the roof, all of which are",Paragraph
constructed of reinforced-brick membranes. The church follows the plan of the former,Caption
"parish but eliminates the columns between the nave and the side aisles, achieving a",Paragraph
"unified space. The interior is sober, enriched only by an altar and a rosette that is made up",Paragraph
of a five-centimeter-thick hexagonal screen that is unified by iron spokes. The brick bell,Caption
tower can be climbed to admire the landscape.,Paragraph
"In the late 1960s, Dieste collaborated with the Brazilian government to build a series",Paragraph
"of markets, the most significant of which is the enormous structure for the market at",Paragraph
Porto Alegre. Its central pavilion spans 47 meters and contains double-curved vaults and,Paragraph
skylights. Dieste designed other areas of the complex with self-supporting vaults.,Caption
"While exploring structural innovations with the Gaussa vault, Dieste began to",Paragraph
"experiment in the early 1960s with self-supporting vaults. He first used these light,",Paragraph
"supporting structures in his home (1962). Later, in Salto, Uruguay, he designed several",Paragraph
"buildings: the Municipal Bus Terminal (1974), the factory for the soft drinks “Refrescos",Caption
"del Norte” (1978), and the Turlit Terminal (1980) for a private bus company. He",Paragraph
continued to develop these vaults at the Production Halls of Massaro Industries (1978) in,Paragraph
"Joanicé, Uruguay, where he constructed pre-stressed vaults for the roof structure that",Paragraph
"spanned 35 meters between pillars. One of these self-supporting vaults, only 10",Paragraph
"centimeters thick, cantilevered 16 meters out from the entrance of the building. His",Paragraph
"explorations culminated with works at “Lanas Trinidad” (1979-91) in Alta, where he",Paragraph
constructed vaults spanning up to 40 meters. In the Shopping Center of Montevideo,Caption
"(1985), his explorations resulted in the reinterpretation of the thematic ideas vested in the",Paragraph
"Atlantida church. An undulating line in the middle of the wall mediates the wall’s form,",Paragraph
which this time is straight at the base and the top. The undulating characteristic in the,Paragraph
wall expresses structural pressure exerted by the set of two self-supporting ceramic vaults,Paragraph
of the roof. This characteristic further absorbs lateral thrust and wind pressure. The floor,Paragraph
slab is part of the entire structural system. It illustrates Dieste’s ability to integrate his,Paragraph
formal sensitivity and material knowledge with structural demands.,Paragraph
"Since the 1960s, Dieste’s work has been seriously studied in Latin America. His ideas",Paragraph
inspired those interested in the development of an architecture that responds to a Latin,Paragraph
"American context. Outside Latin America, both his structural innovations and his poetic",Paragraph
approach to construction received only peripheral attention. He remains lesser known,Paragraph
"than other Hispenic structural innovators, such as Felix Candela or Eduardo Torroja.",Paragraph
A refined and subtle beauty characterizes Dieste’s work. It embodies sophisticated yet,Paragraph
simple structures that combine varying brick-changing tonalities and patterns with,Paragraph
technical rigor. His projects reflect three major considerations: an expressive force of,Paragraph
"local tradition, an integration of artistic and moral issues, and a knowledge of material",Paragraph
property and capabilities.,Paragraph

a compact sequence of numerous movie fantasies. The principle behind Disney’s success,Paragraph

of inhabitable simulations and imagery that resonated well with a public raised on,Paragraph
nostalgia and the vicarious thrills of the movies and who yearned for a more benign form,Paragraph
of urbanism than the one confronting them daily. Combining aspects of amusement parks,Paragraph

Disney had set out his intentions in a plaque located at the entrance to Disneyland,Paragraph
"when it opened in 1955 on a site in Anaheim, California, a suburb of Los Angeles: “Here",Paragraph
"you leave today and enter the world of yesterday, tomorrow and fantasy.” Disneyland’s",Paragraph
"popularity was instantaneous. Designed largely by the in-house “Imagineers,” a talented",Paragraph
"group of artists, artisans, and technicians who became the anonymous midwives of Walt",Paragraph
"Disney’s vision, the park was shaped around explicit narrative concepts in which",Paragraph
buildings played the roles of symbolic characters in a landscape of picturesque settings,Paragraph
"and sequenced storybook relationships. The plan for Disneyland was based on a simple,",Paragraph
"almost classical diagram of axially joined thematic precincts: Main Street, a stage-set",Caption
"reconstruction of a small 19th-century American town, began at the entrance and",Paragraph
terminated in a central hub in front of the towering fantasy figure of Sleeping Beauty’s,Paragraph
"Castle. From there paths led off like the spokes of a wheel to Frontierland,",Paragraph
"Adventureland, Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland.",Paragraph
The structure of the plan was filled out with lavish figural architectural settings that,Paragraph
"replicated images drawn largely from popular culture, many of them planted by Disney’s",Paragraph
own animated films. The Disney strategy was to invert the formfollows-function formula,Paragraph
of modern architecture: by wrapping the attractions and their elaborate supporting,Paragraph
"technology in scenographic costumes, the park was constructed like a stage set. Most of",Paragraph
the elaborate machinery that made the park work and the vast network of underground,Paragraph
tunnels and utilities that served and serviced the surface imagery were made invisible to,Paragraph
"create the illusion that the purified simulations were operating independently, effortlessly,",Paragraph
and without distractions.,Paragraph
Disney’s vision of delight was filled with unabashed sentimentality and nostalgia;,Paragraph
Disneyland took the form of a small town of the kind that was rapidly disappearing from,Paragraph
"the American scene. However, the town that was being portrayed was a denatured one, a",Paragraph
deliberate contrivance built of images that were idealized and mythical. The architecture,Paragraph
"at Disneyland was designed to look right in ensembles of well-proportioned spaces,",Paragraph
"formal relationships, and illusionary scale that were achieved, for example, by reducing",Paragraph
the buildings on Main Street to five-eighths scale to make them appear more toylike and,Paragraph
"friendly. However, the park was also technically sophisticated and well planned and",Paragraph
"engineered: As noted by many observers, Disney had produced something that had",Paragraph
"eluded real cities, a truly integrated system of multilevel mass-movement systems that",Paragraph
"included people movers, nonpolluting vehicles, monorails, pedestrian concourses, and",Paragraph
vast urban infrastructure.,Paragraph
Disneyland was hemmed in by uncontrolled peripheral growth that limited its size and,Paragraph
left it marooned in Los Angeles’s sprawl. When Disney began scouting sites for a second,Paragraph
"park, his plans were far more expansive and ambitious. He had begun to think in Utopian",Paragraph
"terms, imagining a vast urban plan that included not simply a single park but a series of",Paragraph
them as well as an industrial park and residential community. Where Disneyland is a day,Paragraph
"trip, Walt Disney World becomes a weeklong expedition consisting of the Magic",Paragraph
"Kingdom as well as EPCOT, Disney MGM Studios, Pleasure Island, several water parks,",Paragraph
"two shopping centers, and dozens of hotels, all organized into an interconnected unit",Paragraph
more than 180 times larger than Disneyland.,Paragraph
"Disney’s principle interests focused on EPCOT, an acronym for “Experimental",Paragraph
Prototype Community of Tomorrow.” He envisioned an idealized city based on modern,Paragraph
"planning principles that, in one of its iterations, was contained under a vast glass bubble",Paragraph
to ensure a perfect climate. The plan reflected some of the ideas of the 19th-century,Paragraph
"English planner Ebenezer Howard’s radial garden cities, rendered here in sleek, futuristic",Paragraph
architecture. Commerce was located in a dense cluster of modern towers at the center,Paragraph
"surrounded by a series of expanding rings containing apartments, a green belt, and finally",Paragraph
"low-density, suburban-style neighborhoods. Reflecting Disney’s interest in transportation",Paragraph
"technology, the city was to be linked by a monorail and a network of people movers.",Paragraph
Disney imagined the city as a demonstration of the potentials for a modern city built,Paragraph
along scientific principles as an alternative to the degradation he saw in the environments,Paragraph
"of America’s cities. He described EPCOT as “a planned, controlled community, a",Paragraph
"showcase for American industry and research, schools, cultural and educationa",Title
opportunities. In EPCOT there will be no slum areas because we won’t let them,Paragraph
develop.”,Paragraph
"However, the EPCOT that was built in 1982 after Walt Disney’s death resembled",Paragraph
"nothing so much as a world’s fair. The World Showcase, a collection of nationality",Paragraph
pavilions designed to show typical architecture or familiar landmarks of the represented,Paragraph
"countries, was arranged in a loop around a man-made lagoon. Future World, the other",Paragraph
"part of the park, featured giant corporate-sponsored pavilions, including General Motors",Paragraph
"(“motion”), Exxon (“energy”), and Kodak (“imagination”). The two parts of the park are",Paragraph
"separate realms, each with different architectural treatments. Where the Future World",Paragraph
"pavilions are huge, nondescript sheds with little exterior detail or figuration beyond their",Paragraph

many of them using traditional crafts of the represented countries. The central figure is a,Paragraph
"huge, silver geodesic dome symbolizing “Spaceship Earth,” reminiscent of the United",Paragraph
States Pavilion at Expo ’67 in Montreal.,Paragraph
Scholar Alfred Heller summed up the disappointment of many who had expected a,Paragraph
"more ambitious agenda for EPCOT. Writing in he said, “It’s not an experimental",Paragraph
community or a prototype community or an experimental prototype of a community. It’s,Paragraph
not a community at all. It may be a prototype adult amusement park for the world of,Paragraph
tomorrow.” Disney’s dream of creating a real residential community would have to wait,Paragraph
"until Celebration Florida was constructed in the early 1990s. By then, however, the vision",Paragraph
had changed to the terms of the new urbanism. Celebration looked more like Main Street,Paragraph
in the Magic Kingdom than the futurist city Disney originally imagined for EPCOT.,Paragraph
"Michael Eisner, Walt Disney’s successor as head of the Disney enterprises, developed",Paragraph
an enthusiasm for architecture that led to the commissioning of buildings by some of the,Paragraph
most distinguished architects of the day. Eisner provided a fertile ground for Postmodern,Paragraph
architects to push the limits of convention in a succession of flamboyant buildings that,Paragraph
"were clearly influenced by Disney’s philosophy of playfulness, irony, and wit. Michael",Paragraph
"Graves’s designs for the Swan and Dolphin hotels (1989 and 1990, respectively) at Walt",Paragraph
"Disney World in Florida, the first of these large commissions, were startlingly colorful",Paragraph

their roofs. The hotels seemed to push the Postmodernist tendencies then on the rise into,Paragraph
the realm of self-parody by subverting the well-composed facades with Disney-style,Paragraph
kitsch.,Paragraph
Confidence in the success of the theme park formula led to the packaging of plans and,Paragraph
"technology for Tokyo Disney, which opened in 1983. However, Disney officials had set",Paragraph
"their eyes on Europe and a site in Marne-la-Vallee, a short distance outside Paris. Euro",Paragraph
"Disney (now Disneyland Paris) presented the designers with a number of new problems,",Paragraph
among them the cultural question of how to make the essentially American imagery,Paragraph
compelling in a country that had its own traditions and its own real castles. They decided,Paragraph
to intensify the American theme rather than attempting to replicate local traditions.,Paragraph
Convinced of the importance of creating a destination resort rather than simply a,Paragraph
"freestanding park, Disney officials embarked on an ambitious plan that included not only",Paragraph
"the park itself, which was in many respects simply a more refined copy of Walt Disney",Paragraph
"World in Florida, but a surrounding village of six hotels as well. Like the international",Paragraph

kitsch.,Paragraph
All Disney’s built projects have been the subject of considerable critical attention.,Paragraph
"From their inception, the theme parks in particular were easy targets for social critics,",Paragraph
who made them into sacrificial symbols of American consumer culture. To many,Paragraph
"architects and critics, the term “Disney” became synonymous with fakery and",Paragraph
"disingenuousness. However, the ambience of Disney was the art of the simulation—",Paragraph
"“masterpieces of falsification,” as semiologist Umberto Eco wrote; and as long as they",Paragraph
"remained corralled within the precincts of the theme parks, they were the circumscribed",Paragraph
experiences of entertainment.,Paragraph
"However, architecture itself was shifting away from modernist ideals and into a",Paragraph
romance with the ingratiating image. The proliferation of the synthetic over the natural,Paragraph
"had invaded the whole culture; as cultural geographer Edward Soja put it, a new wave",Paragraph
had “carried hyperreality out of the localized enclosures and tightly bound rationality of,Paragraph
"the old theme parks and into the geographies and biographies of everyday life, into the",Paragraph
"fabric and fabrication of exopolis.” With certain reservations, urbanists often marveled at",Paragraph
the consummate skill with which the parks were put together and managed. Architectural,Paragraph
historian Reyner Banham praised Disneyland as “an almost faultless organization for,Paragraph
"delivering, against cash, almost any type at all of environmental experience that human",Paragraph
"fancy, however inflamed could ever devise” (1971). Architect Charles Moore described",Paragraph
the park as “the most important single piece of construction in the West in the past,Paragraph
several decades” (1965).,Paragraph
Disney was an analogical thinker; his particular kind of inventiveness was to see the,Paragraph
new possibilities available by investing in things already at hand or in memory. It was a,Paragraph
combination of nostalgia and pragmatism: building the new out of reinterpretations and,Paragraph
recombinations of what had become before. This also became one of the principles of the,Paragraph
"New Urbanism, a movement that rejected the urban experiments of modernism and",Paragraph
sought instead to create urban models patterned on the things that worked in the past. In a,Paragraph
"somewhat curious involution, the art and science of Disneyland were being imitated in",Paragraph
"real-life places—in the malls, in resorts, and in the redevelopment of towns and",Paragraph
townscapes. The theme park and the realities of living communities were beginning to,Paragraph
"join seamlessly together. However, to do so, as Disney demonstrated, required a",Paragraph
purification of the sources and a simplification of the problem and a strong measure of,Paragraph
central control.,Paragraph

DOM-INO HOUSES,Title
"Housing design by Le Corbusier, 1914-15 and later",Caption
"Between 1914 and 1915, Le Corbusier, partly encouraged by his friend Max du Bois,",Paragraph
"conceived of a standardized system of construction using reinforced concrete, which was",Paragraph
to provide the structural basis of most of his houses through the mid-1930s. These were,Paragraph
the Dom-ino prefabricated houses with independent skeletons. The frame was to be,Paragraph
completely independent of the floor plans of the houses. Derived from the Hennebique,Caption
"frame, it consisted of six thin concrete columns that simply carried two horizontal slabs",Paragraph
as the floors. The columns and slabs were connected by staircases. Apart from this,Paragraph
"structural core of the houses, nothing else was fixed, thus permitting a great flexibility to",Paragraph
"suit demands on the basis of aesthetics, climate, composition, or view. The floor plan was",Paragraph
"also extremely flexible, as interior partitions were independent of the grid. This utterly",Paragraph
simple and clear “open plan” method did away with load-carrying walls. Supporting,Paragraph
"beams for the ceiling slabs were eliminated. The vertical supports, recessed with respect",Caption
"to the exterior walls, allowed the facade to be freestanding, allowing windows to go",Paragraph
easily around corners. The houses were to be built of standardized elements to be,Paragraph
"attached to one another in a wide variety of combinations, allowing for a great range in",Paragraph
the grouping of the houses. This was not only a highly innovative idea from the technical,Paragraph
"standpoint but also an entirely new method of construction that promised rapid,",Paragraph
economical mass housing.,Paragraph
"At this time, reinforced concrete was still a relatively unused material for construction.",Paragraph
"After Tony Garnier and Auguste Perret, Le Corbusier was one of the first to advocate its",Paragraph
"use. For Dom-ino houses, there was to be a special on-site arrangement for pouring",Paragraph
concrete to produce completely smooth and even floor slabs. A contractor would provide,Paragraph
"the frames. Other, specialized contractors would furnish different, mass-produced",Paragraph
building material on the order of the architect-planner or the client. After windows and,Paragraph
"doors had been attached, the exterior walls would be built.",Paragraph
The system was conceived as a solution for the post-World War I rebuilding problem.,Paragraph
"At the time, reports of war devastation in Flanders were the major news. Dom-ino houses",Paragraph
demonstrate Le Corbusier’s awareness of housing not only as an important social and,Paragraph
architectural problem but also an industrial process. Construction would be transformed,Paragraph
"into a scientifically run, large-scale activity. The Dom-ino house marked a significant",Paragraph
"step in Le Corbusier’s quest for developing a standardized, rational solution to the",Paragraph
problem of housing.,Paragraph
The name “Dom-ino” invites several levels of interpretation. “Dom-ino” invoked,Paragraph
"Latin for “house.” As a patent industrial label, it was also a play on the word",Paragraph
"appropriate for a standardized house. In plan, the six-point supports resemble a",Paragraph
rectangular domino chip. The physical form of the houses could also be interpreted in,Paragraph
"terms of dominoes, with the columns as domino dots and the zigzag pattern of a group of",Paragraph
these houses as formations of dominoes. Le Corbusier also saw Dom-ino as a product,Paragraph
"(the architectural equivalent), in both form and mode of assembly, of a perfectible",Paragraph
industrial object. Experiments with the Dom-ino prototype and the Citrohan House of,Paragraph
1920-22 were based on his belief that a perfectible housing type could be formulated. He,Paragraph
expressed this belief in the famous phrase “a house is a machine for living” in in 1921.,Paragraph
"Widely misinterpreted as a functionalist statement, this meant that a house could be just",Paragraph
"as rationally produced as any object-type. In (Toward a New Architecture), Le",Paragraph
"Corbusier wrote, “if we erase all rigid notions of the house from our hearts and minds and",Paragraph
"look at the question from a critical and objective point of view, we will inevitably arrive",Paragraph
"at the ‘house-tool,’ the mass-production house within everyone’s reach, incomparably",Paragraph
healthier than the old (even morally) and imbued with the beauty of the working tools of,Paragraph
our daily lives.” The universal house-machine was to provide aesthetic pleasure as well,Paragraph
as functional efficiency and healthy surroundings.,Paragraph
Dom-ino houses were not built in Flanders during the war; its principles as economical,Paragraph
housing only began to be applied in 1928 in France with the passing of the Loucheur,Paragraph
"Law, which was aimed at building 200,000 low-income housing units. In the meantime,",Paragraph
the principles of the Dom-ino house were applied to the elegant Villa Schwob in La,Paragraph
"Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland (1916), which successfully synthesized the potential of the",Paragraph
Hennebique frame and stylistic elements drawn from elsewhere. It is one of the first,Paragraph
concrete-frame villas in Europe. The Dom-ino house was further evolved into the,Paragraph
"Citrohan House, which was exhibited at the Salon d’Automne of 1922. Much more",Paragraph
"sophisticated than the Dom-ino house, the Citrohan House represented for the first time a",Paragraph
"duplex design with a double-height living space, a mezzanine, and children’s bedrooms",Paragraph
on the roof. This marked the initial development of one of Le Corbusier’s characteristic,Paragraph
"spatial treatments: interlocking spaces of different, proportional heights. These",Paragraph
"superimposed duplexes with two-to-one interior space, spiral staircases, and garden roofs",Caption
would be a major recurrent theme and also figure as the villa blocks of the Contemporary,Paragraph
City for Three Million Inhabitants (1922). This type was derived from the 19th-century,Paragraph
artist’s atelier and the of Mediterranean architecture.,Paragraph
Le Corbusier’s houses up to 1935 evolved from the structures of the Dom-ino house,Paragraph
and the Citrohan House and consisted of freestanding columns and cantilevered floor,Paragraph
"slabs. The almost cubelike Cook House (1962) in Boulogne, one of the high points of this",Caption
"period, incorporated mechanistic analogies and the aesthetics of purist painting. The Villa",Paragraph
"Stein/de Monzie (1927) in Garches, with a unique outdoor room that is half inside and",Paragraph

Balkrishna V.Doshi belongs to the generation of architects that commenced working,Paragraph
soon after India’s independence in 1947. Influenced by the thinkers of the independence,Paragraph
"movement, Doshi’s career is devoted to establishing an identity for the contemporary",Paragraph
"Indian architecture, and he has accomplished this by rooting his work in the regional",Paragraph
"context, marrying his designs with the local environment, and building on India’s rich",Paragraph
architectural and building traditions.,Paragraph
"Born in 1927 in Poona (Pune), a city near Bombay (Mumbai), Doshi was raised in a",Paragraph
religious family that was engaged in the traditional carpentry business. Observing his,Paragraph
"drawing skills, his art teacher encouraged him to pursue architectural education. In 1947,",Paragraph
"Doshi joined the J.J. School of Art in Bombay; unhappy with the course of studies, he",Paragraph
"quit the program in 1950 and decided to go to London, where he met Le Corbusier at",Paragraph
"CIAM (Congrés Internationaux d’ Architecture Moderne). Following that meeting, Doshi",Paragraph
"moved to Paris to work with Le Corbusier, who at that time was designing the city of",Paragraph

"dwellings of Guajart. Moreover, the refined proportions, fine workmanship, and elegant",Paragraph
finishes of the Indology Institute make it more delicate compared to Le Corbusier’s,Paragraph
style of Indian projects.,Paragraph
The second phase of Doshi’s practice was tempered by the work of the great American,Paragraph
architect Louis I.Kahn. Doshi invited Kahn to design the facilities for the Indian Institute,Paragraph
of Management (IIM) complex in Ahmedabad. From the beginning of 1960s until the,Paragraph
"sudden death of Kahn in 1974, Doshi and he remained close friends and associates. This",Paragraph
relationship touched Doshi’s work in several ways: his use and choice of materials,Paragraph
"became refined, the play of geometry in his buildings got richer, and buildings started to",Paragraph
"demonstrate great depth and concern for light and shade and spirituality, all hallmarks of",Paragraph
Kahn’s work. Some key buildings from this phase of Doshi’s work include the Township,Paragraph
"(1964) for Gujarat State Fertilizers in Baroda (Vadodra), the School of Architecture",Paragraph
"(1966, first phase) in Ahmedabad, the Township (1968) for the Electronics Corporation",Paragraph
"of India in Hyderabad, and the Parikh Residence (1974) in Ahmedabad. Kahn’s design",Paragraph
influence is evident in two township projects in which Doshi employed simple but,Paragraph
efficient load-bearing wall structures and clean geometry to organize unit plans and to,Paragraph
"control the entry of light into each dwelling. Doshi’s School of Architecture building,",Paragraph
"with its heavy load-bearing brick walls and industrial north lighting, also closely",Paragraph
"resembles Kahn’s IIM complex, its dormitory and classroom areas in particular.",Paragraph
Doshi’s active involvement in education coincides with his second phase of practice.,Paragraph
"In 1962, he and several colleagues established the Ahmedabad School of Architecture,",Paragraph
"which has become the Center of Environmental Planning and Technology, comprised of",Paragraph
"schools of planning, interior design, and building construction and a visual arts center.",Paragraph
"Doshi is also the founder and director of the Vastu-Shilpa Foundation, a nonprofit group",Paragraph
for studies and research in environmental design. Doshi has regularly served as a visiting,Paragraph
"professor at most leading American and European universities, inspiring a new",Paragraph
generation of designers and planers.,Paragraph
"The last 25 years of Doshi’s architectural work has been the most exuberant, and no",Paragraph
"doubt the richest, phase of his work. This architecture owes little to his mentors and more",Paragraph
to the cultural and building traditions of India. Projects from this time blend beautifully,Paragraph
"with their surroundings and, more important, convey a sense that they are somehow",Paragraph
Indian. Important projects from this phase are the Indian Institute of Management (1977),Paragraph
in Bangalore; the Administrative Complex (1979) for the Madhya Pradesh Electricity,Paragraph
"Board in Jabalpur; Sangath (1979), the architect’s own office, in Ahmedabad; the Gandhi",Paragraph
Labor Institute (1980) in Ahmedabad; Aranya low-cost housing (1983) in Indore; and the,Paragraph

Aranya is truly a model housing project for a developing nation such as India. A 6500-,Paragraph

and shedding of rainwater in the design of Sangath and the Gandhi Labor Institute and,Paragraph
the apparently irregular fanning of the towers to maximize natural lighting in the offices,Paragraph

"DUDOK, WILLEM MARINUS 1884-1974",Title
"Architect, the Netherlands",Title
"Willem Marinus Dudok, a city architect for Hilversum, the Netherlands, a",Paragraph
"small town southeast of Amsterdam, is well known for his distinctive",Paragraph
contribution to the modernism of the early 20th century. His architecture,Paragraph
provided a compositional strength and visual richness that transformed the,Paragraph
otherwise traditional and conservative community of Hilversum into the,Paragraph
modern age.,Paragraph
"Born in 1884 in Amsterdam to musician parents, Johannes Cornelis and Cornelia",Paragraph
"Bertha (née Holst), Dudok claimed that his architectural design was influenced more by",Paragraph
the great composers than by the great architects. Much to the disappointment of his,Paragraph
"parents, though, rather than pursue music, Dudok chose a career in the army. He attended",Paragraph
"Alkmaar Cadet School and later Breda Military Academy, where he was trained in",Paragraph
"military engineering, with a focus on fortification planning. Over time, he taught himself",Paragraph
"architecture, and when he was promoted to lieutenant-engineer in the Royal Engineering",Paragraph
"Corps, he joined a team that planned and built fortifications that were to surround",Paragraph
"Amsterdam, possibly his first experience with building. In 1913, he left the army and",Paragraph
"began work as the deputy director of Public Works for the town of Leiden, moving to",Paragraph
Hilversum two years later to become the Director of Public Works. He later became the,Paragraph
"city architect in 1928, a position he held until his retirement in 1954.",Paragraph
"Throughout Dudok’s long career in Hilversum, he is credited with building almost all",Paragraph
its public buildings and is thought to have been instrumental in producing a town,Paragraph
development plan that was based on the English Garden City movement promoted by,Paragraph
Briton Ebenezer Howard (1850-1928). Of Dudok’s 150 realized projects over his 50-year,Paragraph
"career, 80 percent were within Hilversum’s local government area, and only four were",Paragraph
"outside the Netherlands. Dudok was at his zenith between 1916 and 1930, when he",Paragraph
"designed 13 public housing estates, some of which contained up to 180 buildings. In",Paragraph
"addition, he designed 11 schools and extended two others. Other more utilitarian projects",Paragraph
"included a sports park, an abattoir, pumping stations, and public utilities. The building",Paragraph
"that became an icon and career acme, however, was the Hilversum Town Hall. Although",Paragraph
"his design influence pervades the town, no other structure is as much of a masterpiece.",Paragraph
The Marriage between art and geometry succeeded with the culmination of his modernist,Paragraph
philosophy into a premier object d’art.,Paragraph
Dudok claimed to have acquired his ideas of architectural truth from Karel,Paragraph
P.C. de Bazel (1869-1923) and Hendrik Petrus Berlage (1854-1934). De,Caption
Bazel was a Theosophist whose mysticism and architectural theory,Paragraph
permeated the planimetric and volumetric geometry of his designs.,Paragraph
Berlage was also widely published; his works included a collection of six,Paragraph
"essays titled (1911), thought to be one of his more important",Paragraph
"anthologies. It was Berlage, considered the “Father of modern",Paragraph
"architecture,” who first introduced the work of Frank Lloyd Wright",Paragraph
(1867-1959) to European architects. His interest and great admiration,Paragraph
caused him,Title
"Community Bath (1926) Hilversum, Netherlands, by Willem M.Dudok",Caption
© GreatBuildings.com,Title
"to pronounce that Wright was a master, “whose equal is yet to be found in Europe.” The",Paragraph
Wrightian philosophy of form and space definition was particularly espoused by the De,Paragraph
Stijl and the Amsterdam School movements.,Paragraph
Dudok also recognized Wright’s innovative design: “I saw his work for the first,Paragraph
time...and immediately recognized his greatness.” He was impressed by the “poetic,Paragraph
"spirit’ and “harmonious construction” of his spaces. As a result, Wright then heavily",Paragraph
"influenced Dudok’s subsequent work, but Dudok was also thought to have been affected",Paragraph
"by Amsterdam School Expressionism, De Stijl fimctionalism, Delft School",Caption
"traditionalism, Cubism, and Dutch vernacular. Dudok’s eclectic style was sometimes",Paragraph
mistakenly referred to as a “hybrid” of some or all of these elements. Dudok’s,Paragraph
independent approach to modernism made him one of the most influential architects,Paragraph
working in the Netherlands between the two world wars. This nonconformist unique style,Paragraph
is also sometimes attributed to his informal architectural training.,Paragraph
"Dudok’s lifelong passion for music was reflected in the rhythm, mood, and character",Paragraph
"of the proportions of his architecture, unifying it and enhancing its sculptural expression.",Paragraph
This response to modernism was restrained by the soft craftsmanship of the built form.,Paragraph
Dudok managed to express the ideals of modern architecture while still retaining the,Paragraph
"traditional values of composition, craftsmanship, and materials but most importantly,",Paragraph
monumentality. Dudok emphasized that “monumentality is the most pure expression of,Paragraph
the human sense of harmony and order.” The monumental building stressed not only the,Paragraph
essential material elements but also its spirituality. Its value transcended the human,Paragraph
experience and entered the spiritual realm. This architectural theology in the form of built,Paragraph
reality formed a model for many later architects throughout Europe and the United States.,Paragraph
"Unfortunately, as his “style” was repeatedly duplicated, his individuality and stylistic",Paragraph
"superiority diminished. By the 1950s, his architecture no longer contained the artistic and",Paragraph
spiritual qualities that were inherent in the earlier works.,Paragraph
Dudok was celebrated in worldwide publications of his work. By 1924 international,Paragraph
"books and journals showcased his projects, giving great attention to the town in which he",Paragraph
"did most of his work. Hilversum briefly became an architectural mecca, attracting",Paragraph
admirers to study and perhaps worship Dudok’s work.,Paragraph
"Dudok’s architecture earned several awards, including the gold medals of the Royal",Paragraph
"Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1935, the American Institute of Architects (AIA)",Paragraph
"in 1955, and the French Academy of Architecture in 1966. In his own country, he",Paragraph

"(1922), which is indebted to De Stijl, a movement that Duiker would later criticize for its",Paragraph

"Diisseldorf expanded rapidly in the last quarter of the 19th century, serving as the",Paragraph
banking and trading center for the heavily industrialized (Ruhr Valley) to the east.,Paragraph
Industrialization and continuous development as a trade-fair center shaped the city and its,Paragraph

"were built in the first half of the 20th century, but during World War II much of the city",Paragraph
was destroyed by Allied bombing raids. Although some prewar buildings were,Paragraph

Diisseldorf has long been a center for art and architectural study. Under the German,Paragraph
"Empire, the city had two art institutions: an Academy of Art (Kunstakademie) and a",Paragraph
School for Arts and Crafts (Kunstgewerbeschule). Both offered courses in architecture,Paragraph
"and design. The Kunstakademie continues to be a leading center for study. However, the",Paragraph
"Kunstgewerbeschule closed in 1918, torn between the reformist and conservative",Paragraph
tendencies of the 20th century. The Kunstgewerbeschule was an important center for,Paragraph
aesthetic reform under Peter Behrens’ directorship (1903-07). A number of innovative,Paragraph
"designers were attracted to the school, including Rudolf Bosselt, Fritz Helmuth Ehmcke,",Paragraph
"and J.L.M.Lauweriks. Behrens was followed by Wilhelm Kreis, an architect with much",Paragraph
more conservative views. Kreis purged the school of Behrens’ appointees and ultimately,Paragraph
"presided over the institution’s dissolution in 1918, an approach to the rivalry between art",Paragraph
academies and schools of applied arts mockingly referred to as the “Diisseldorf solution.”,Paragraph
"Kreis continued to teach architecture at the Kunstakademie, where he had held a joint",Paragraph
"appointment since 1913. Relatively unknown today, Kreis enjoyed fame and success in a",Paragraph
"career spanning four German regimes: the Second Empire, the Weimar Republic, the",Paragraph
"Third Reich, and West Germany. Through his teaching and commissions, Kreis strongly",Paragraph
affected Diisseldorf’s s architectural heritage.,Paragraph
Diisseldorf has a wealth of innovative buildings. German architecture between 1900,Paragraph
"and 1914 was typified by bourgeois monumentalism, a stylized architecture that melded",Paragraph
"Jugendstil (Art Nouveau) with historicism, serving as a bridge between 19th-century",Paragraph

"important Wilhelmine buildings is the Tietz Department Store (now Kauthof), built in",Paragraph
1907-09 to designs by J.M.Olbrich on a given floor plan. Together with Alfred Messel,Caption
"and Wilhelm Kreis, Olbrich was one of the most influential architects of German",Paragraph

"Despite teaching for years in Diisseldorf, Peter Behrens designed only one building",Paragraph
"there, the Mannesmann Building; it was built in 1911-12 after he left the city. Here,",Paragraph
Behrens sought to combine his interest in innovative design with the need for display,Paragraph
inherent in a corporate headquarters. Behrens’ building was inspired by Italian . On a,Paragraph
"steel frame, he used rusticated stone for the foundation, dressed stone for the upper",Paragraph
"levels, and a steeply pitched roof. The fenestration, geometric harmony, and horizontal",Paragraph
emphasis are typical of Behrens’ classical tendencies and were widely imitated. The,Paragraph
interior incorporated innovative engineering based on a system of pillars using a normal,Paragraph
module that allowed organizational flexibility. The module was a “normal office”: a six-,Paragraph
"person desk with heater and office furniture. Even in the executive offices, all office",Paragraph
walls were movable partitions. The free treatment of the interior and the exterior,Paragraph

Reich) at which Kreis excelled. Flat roofs and horizontal lines dominate the museum,Paragraph
"buildings, where stone foundations contrast with decorative use of brick and sculpture.",Paragraph
"The Planetarium is a striking, circular building with brick arcades and a low dome",Paragraph

Diisseldorf continues to be a center for arts innovation. Museum Insel Hombroich is,Paragraph

"Heinrich Miiller, a real estate tycoon, and has been open to the public since 1986. There",Paragraph
"is no single museum building. Instead, the island is conceived as a space for art in a",Paragraph
"landscape shaped by Bernhard Korte. An art collection is housed in pavilions, or “walk-in",Paragraph
"sculptures,” designed by Erwin Heerich. By 1997, there were 11 pavilions in a large park.",Paragraph
The concept behind the complex was to blend art and nature and to juxtapose ancient,Paragraph
"Chinese, Persian, and Khmer art with contemporary works, allowing their merits to speak",Paragraph
"to the viewer directly, without any signs or labels to identify the artworks. Heerich’s",Paragraph
pavilions also include ateliers and studios for artists in residence. The collection includes,Paragraph
work ranging from Rembrandt through Matisse to Alexander Calder.,Paragraph
The redevelopment of Diisseldorf’s s Rhinefront in the 1990s has also recently,Paragraph

Charles and Ray Eames believed that good design was a means to better living. With,Paragraph
"their architecture, furniture design, films, and exhibitions, the Eameses sought to change",Paragraph
"the way people thought about everyday objects and daily life. Using new, low-cost, pre-",Paragraph
"fabricated construction materials, they set out to make good design inexpensive and",Paragraph
accessible.,Paragraph
"Charles and Ray formed their professional partnership in 1941, the year they married",Paragraph
"and moved to Los Angeles. However, all the work was submitted solely under Charles’s",Paragraph
"name until 1947, at which time the design firm became known as the Eames Office. In",Paragraph
"recent studies, feminist historians have attempted to assert Ray’s importance in the",Paragraph
"partnership, claiming for her some of the recognition she did not receive during her",Paragraph
"lifetime. Ray, who studied under Hans Hofmann and at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in",Paragraph
"Michigan, contributed an abstract sculptural sense, an aesthetic refinement, and an eye",Paragraph
for detail to their design work. With two years of architectural training at Washington,Paragraph
"University in St. Louis, several years in architectural firms, and some experience with",Paragraph
"mechanics and manufacturing, Charles brought technical knowledge and engineering",Paragraph
skills to the professional partnership. The Arts and Crafts ideals of Cranbrook had a,Paragraph
lasting effect on the Eameses’ holistic approach to design.,Paragraph
The Eameses’ best-known and most influential architectural work is the house they,Paragraph
"designed for themselves: Case Study #8 (1949). The Case Study House Program,",Paragraph
"sponsored by the journal under John Entenza, was initiated in 1945 as a venue for",Paragraph
architects to produce innovative prototypes for postwar American living. Designed for,Paragraph
"specific clients who were mainly professionals or the artistic elite, the Case Study Houses",Paragraph
focused on aesthetic and technological innovation. Charles collaborated with Eero,Paragraph
"Saarinen on the initial plan for Case Study #8 in 1945; however, the design was",Paragraph
substantially revised by the Eameses before construction. Interested in the work of,Paragraph
"European modernists Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, and",Paragraph
"others, the Eameses adapted the spare, functional machine aesthetic to their interest in",Paragraph
individual expression. The Eames House was the first Case Study House to use a steel,Paragraph
"frame, and the innovative adaptation of prefabricated construction and industrial material",Paragraph
"to residential architecture proved very influential. To the Eameses, a house was an",Paragraph
exhibition space for the occupants. Because the designs were published in and the,Paragraph
finished buildings were open to the public for six to eight weeks their occupation by the,Paragraph
"clients, this architectural program was accessible to an extensive audience. Charles also",Paragraph
"collaborated with Saarinen on a house for John Entenza, Case Study #9 (1949), which",Paragraph
was built on a lot neighboring the Eames House at Pacific Palisades. The Case Study,Paragraph
"Houses came to define a new kind of Californian style, and the Eames House in particular",Paragraph

"in the postwar period, both within the United States and internationally.",Paragraph
Other notable architectural works include the showroom for the Herman Miller,Paragraph

EDGE CITY,Title
"“Edge city” is one of many terms used to describe the large, sprawling conglomerations",Paragraph
"of commercial, retail, and residential development that proliferated along the beltways of",Paragraph
United States metropolitan peripheries in the 1980s. Coincident with the advances in,Paragraph
"telecommunications, economic restructuring, and deregulation that began in the 1970s,",Paragraph
"edge cities exemplify the privatization, decentralization, and dispersion of development",Paragraph
that is characteristic of digital media and the global economy. Joel Garreau defined five,Paragraph
criteria that characterize a fullblown edge city: “five million square feet of leasable office,Paragraph
space or more; six hundred thousand square feet of retail space or more; a population that,Paragraph
"increases at 9 AM on workdays—marking the location as primarily a work center, not a",Paragraph
"residential suburb; a local perception as a single end destination for mixed use—jobs,",Paragraph
"shopping, and entertainment; and a history in which, thirty years ago, the site was by no",Paragraph
"means urban; it was overwhelmingly residential or rural in character” (1991, 425). As of",Paragraph
"1991, Garreau found 119 mature and 74 emerging edge cities in the United States.",Paragraph
"Largely low-rise, low-density landscapes, edge cities typically evolve around suburban",Paragraph
spoke-and-hub highway intersections. The automobile access provided by these,Paragraph
"intersections encourages the nearby development of office parks, regional shopping",Paragraph
"malls, retail strips, franchises, and apartment complexes. Each use is visually and",Paragraph
"functionally isolated from its neighbors by parking lots, united only by the heavily",Paragraph
trafficked arterial roads connecting them. Sylvan corporate campuses and gated,Paragraph
"residential communities also follow this pattern, typically locating on cul-de-sacs off the",Paragraph
main arterials.,Paragraph
"Suburbs initially used zoning to exclude industrial uses. New economies however,",Paragraph
replaced traditional manufacturing jobs with clerical jobs that posed less threat to health,Paragraph
"and property values. Electronic media, meanwhile, reduced the need for face-to-face",Paragraph
"communication. The information basis of much of the service economy, the expanding",Paragraph
"suburban middle class, and the rise in automobile ownership further allowed many",Paragraph
operations to be moved to cheaper land on the urban periphery. Corporate headquarters,Paragraph
also often moved out of the cities to lush suburban estates to be closer to the executives’,Paragraph
homes and country clubs. These moves were aided by the interstate beltway system.,Paragraph
"Initially constructed to allow through traffic to bypass major cities, beltways also",Paragraph
"provided easy access to cheap, minimally administered land and proximity to the many",Paragraph
"non-unionized and educated suburban women entering the labor force. In addition,",Paragraph
"market deregulation, federal insurance, and the demand for greater financial returns in the",Paragraph
"1980s encouraged lenders to speculate in real estate investment, much of it in the",Paragraph
booming edge cities.,Paragraph
The growth of edge cities reflects the general growth of U.S. suburbs. Between 1970,Paragraph
"and 2000, suburbs experienced growth rates double and triple that of cities, accounting",Paragraph
"for 60 to 85 percent of new construction, new investment, and new jobs. Suburban office",Paragraph
"stock, for example, increased 300 percent during the 1980s, and by 1993 the suburbs had",Paragraph
"half again as much office stock as that in cities. Similarly, declining urban populations in",Paragraph
the 1970s prompted large-scale retail stores to move to the booming suburbs. Although,Paragraph
"population grew 10 percent in the 1980s, retail floor space grew 80 percent, mostly",Paragraph
because of the feverish construction of suburban shopping malls in edge cities.,Paragraph
"Residential development has also migrated, as the declining real wages of the middle",Paragraph
class have encouraged the search for ever-cheaper housing at the periphery. In pursuit of,Paragraph
"cheaper land, less-congested highways, and new markets, new edge city growth has",Paragraph
manifested itself in urban-sprawl patterns of ever-lower overall densities and ever-,Paragraph
"escalating automobile use. In the 1990s, this prompted new urbanist efforts to reconfigure",Paragraph
"edge cities into more compact, transit-oriented development as well as the Environmental",Paragraph
Protection Agency’s Smart Growth policies.,Paragraph
Other names for edge cities emphasize their various characteristics. “Exurbs” or,Paragraph
“urban sprawl” are popular and also emphasize distance from the city center. Richard,Paragraph
Louv’s (1983) early writing on the subject and his use of the term emphasized not,Paragraph
simply the physical distance from the city but also the deliberate way in which new,Paragraph
"master-planned communities at Irvine, California, or outside Houston and Phoenix have",Paragraph
"turned their backs on the city. By the late 1980s, the agglomeration of such developments",Paragraph
"led to the coining of more terms. and Robert Fishman’s for example, emphasize these",Paragraph
"regions’ participation in the digital economy, exemplified by California’s Silicon Valley",Paragraph
and Boston’s high-tech corridor along Route 128. The U.S. Congress’s Office of,Paragraph
Technological Assessment reinforces this role by its use of the term . Jonathan,Paragraph
Barnett has focused on the unplanned and haphazard process of their maturation; he cites,Paragraph
"Tysons Corner, Virginia, as a prime example. A sleepy crossroads in the 1960s, by the",Paragraph
1990s Tysons Corner had two very large malls and as much office space as downtown,Paragraph
"Washington, D.C., but no sidewalks and notorious traffic jams.",Paragraph
"Edge city remains the most commonly used term, both for its simplicity and because",Paragraph
of the wealth of description and study given to it in Garreau’s definitive book as well as,Paragraph
"in critical discussion that followed. However, Garreau’s unwavering enthusiasm for the",Paragraph
developers of edge cities as cowboy pioneers and innovative entrepreneurs responding to,Paragraph
new needs and desires has not been shared by many other authors on the subject. The,Paragraph
"critics of edge cities find them banal, highly privatized, fragmented, and destructive to",Paragraph
"both environmental and communal sustainability. Garreau dismisses such critics as elite,",Paragraph
moralizing snobs and raises the question whether the market responds to and promotes,Paragraph
individual freedoms better than planners and designers. The discourse on edge cities is,Paragraph
continuing to grapple with this and related questions.,Paragraph

EDUCATION AND SCHOOLS,Title
Licensure of architects began around the turn of the 20th century as a means of enforcing,Paragraph
"higher professional standards. At the turn of the century, architects could prepare for the",Paragraph
licensing exam by a variety of different educational and training experi ences; a few,Paragraph
schools existed for students with the financial means necessary to pursue a full-time,Paragraph
education. Students lacking this economic freedom could learn by working in architecture,Paragraph
"firms, perhaps supplementing office training with evening studies. The traditional system",Paragraph
of apprenticeship decreased as formal education became recognized as an important,Paragraph
"characteristic of the profession, and by the end of the 20th century, the educational",Paragraph
requirement for licensure has become nearly universal.,Paragraph
"Professional regulation varies from country to country and, within the United States,",Paragraph
"from state to state. Elements of preparation for practice presently include education,",Paragraph
"internship, demonstration of competence by examination, and continuing education. In",Paragraph
"the United States, an accredited professional degree, along with internship and",Paragraph
"examination, is the gateway to both the title architect and the practice of architecture in",Paragraph
nearly all states.,Paragraph
There are some important differences in the various approaches to architectural,Paragraph
education around the world. An important issue for the architectural profession at the,Paragraph
beginning of the 21st century is the impact of globalization on preparation for,Paragraph
architectural practice. The countries of the European Community have recently,Paragraph
completed a survey of the national systems of higher architectural education in Europe.,Paragraph
The ability to practice throughout the European Community will require some greater,Paragraph
agreement on educational qualifications for architectural practice. The issue of,Paragraph
reciprocity between the United States and Canada is also under discussion. Within the,Paragraph
"United States, the ability to gain reciprocal registration for practice in multiple states is",Paragraph
facilitated by a national system of accreditation for schools of architecture. A,Paragraph
"professional body, the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), sets criteria for",Paragraph
education leading to a professional degree. The NAAB recognizes the variety of models,Paragraph
that exist for architectural education. Rather than regulating the type of school or,Paragraph
"dictating curricula, the NAAB criteria establish areas and levels of learning for students",Paragraph
"of accredited programs. In Canada, the Canadian Architectural Certification Board",Paragraph
(CACB) accredits schools of architecture.,Paragraph
According to data published by the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture,Paragraph
"in 1994, there are 118 schools offering professional degree programs in architecture in",Paragraph
"North America, with 108 of these schools in the United States and ten in Canada. There",Paragraph
"are 199 schools in Central and South American countries, 63 architecture schools in",Paragraph
"Africa and the Middle East, and 425 schools spread throughout Europe. There are 315",Paragraph
"schools in Asia, mainly concentrated in Japan, the People’s Republic of China, South",Paragraph
"Korea, the Philippines, and India. Australia has 19 schools of architecture and New",Paragraph
Zealand has two.,Paragraph
"Institutional settings for architectural education vary. Within the university,",Paragraph
architecture may exist as its own school or may be a department of a comprehensive,Paragraph
"college. Architecture departments may be organized under the umbrella of the arts, or",Paragraph
"may exist within colleges of engineering, as in many Asian universities.",Paragraph
"Architecture may also be taught within its own school independent of a university, for",Paragraph
example the Architectural Association School of Architecture in England or the Frank,Paragraph
Lloyd Wright School of Architecture in the United States. Architecture may be taught as,Paragraph
"a discipline within an art school or may exist as a department of a technical school, such",Paragraph
as the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule of Zurich (ETHZ) in Switzerland or the,Paragraph
Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago in the United States.,Paragraph
The variety of settings for architectural education stems from the historic development,Paragraph
of the profession in Europe ranging from the first guild-based school for architecture in,Paragraph
Prague (established in 1353 for the court architect’s apprentices) to the Royal Academy,Paragraph
"of Architecture founded in Paris in 1671, where a rational approach based upon the study",Paragraph
of classical architecture challenged the medieval traditions of the craft guilds. While,Paragraph
"formal education for architects was developing in France, the office apprenticeship",Paragraph
remained the traditional English system for educating architects. In the early eighteenth,Paragraph
"century, apprenticeship was replaced by the pupilage system in which students paid fees",Paragraph
"for office instruction. Another type of architecture school, the Ecole Polytechnique, was",Paragraph
founded in Paris in 1795. The technical school became a model for architectural,Paragraph
"education in German cities and in Prague, Vienna, and Zurich.",Paragraph
"While the Polytechnic, where architecture was taught in a scientific context, became",Paragraph
"the dominant model in the Germanic countries, French architectural education came to be",Paragraph
"dominated by the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, which grew out of the French Academy, where",Paragraph
architecture was taught in the context of the arts. There were two parts to the Ecole,Paragraph
"education, lectures on history and technical subjects at the school and design studies in",Paragraph
the or studio where a practicing architect served as patron to a group of students,Paragraph
working on design projects.,Paragraph
"In the United States, the earliest forms of architectural education were borrowed from",Paragraph
British apprenticeship and French academic systems. The Beaux-Arts Society of,Caption
"Architects, later the Society of Beaux-Arts Architects (SBAA), was founded in 1894 to",Paragraph
promote education. The SBAA issued programs for atelier students working under the,Paragraph
direction of patrons (practicing architects). The SBAA also provided the mechanism for,Paragraph
"exhibition, judging, and publication of student work. In 1904, the SBAA established the",Paragraph
"prestigious Paris Prize, modeled on the French Prix de Rome (Rome Prize).",Paragraph
American universities began to offer architectural education in the latter half of the,Paragraph
19th century; the first was the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in,Paragraph
"Cambridge in 1865. By the turn of the century, architectural education was offered in 13",Paragraph
"American universities including Columbia University, New York, Cornell University,",Paragraph
"Ithaca, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, George Washington University,",Caption
"Washington, D.C., and elsewhere. In Canada, the University of Toronto was the first, in",Paragraph
"1890, to offer architectural education, followed by McGill University in Montreal.",Paragraph
The Beaux-Arts Institute of Design (BAID) was established in 1916 and incorporated,Paragraph
under the Regents of the State of New York to take over the educational functions of the,Paragraph
SBAA. The programs of the BAID were followed in schools as well as in the,Paragraph
independent studios. Atelier activity peaked around 1929. As the number of students who,Paragraph
"worked by day and studied in the ateliers by night waned, the schools came to dominate",Paragraph
architectural education by the middle of the century.,Paragraph
New developments in Europe were transforming architectural education as well. The,Paragraph
"state Bauhaus was founded in 1919 in Weimar, Germany; its program (developed",Paragraph
primarily by German architect Walter Gropius) applied modern or new materials and,Paragraph
"industrial techniques to the problems of design, bringing together all of the arts and",Paragraph
"crafts. The avant-gardism of the Bauhaus, its ideology and teachers, came under attack by",Paragraph
"the Nazis; the faculty fled for France, the Netherlands, the United States and elsewhere,",Paragraph
eventually bringing Bauhaus modernism to American schools of architecture. In 1936,Paragraph
Gropius became chair of the department of architecture at Harvard University and his,Paragraph
"colleague Marcel Breuer joined the faculty. In 1938, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe assumed",Paragraph
the directorship of the Illinois Institute of Technology; Laszlo Moholy-Nagy went to,Paragraph
teach at the Institute of Design in Chicago in 1937 and Josef Albers to Black Mountain,Paragraph
"College, North Carolina in 1940. This influx of European architects came to dominate the",Paragraph
Beaux-Arts historicism of the American schools of architecture. The Beaux-Arts ateliers,Paragraph
withered as the university became recognized as the locus for the modern architectura,Paragraph
"education. Following World War II, the G.I.Bill helped to make a university education",Paragraph
affordable for many Americans.,Paragraph
"The entry of women into architectural education began with Julia Morgan, the first",Paragraph
American woman to attend the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. The first American schoo!,Paragraph
"to teach architecture to women, The Cambridge School, was begun by Henry Atherton",Paragraph
Frost in 1915 to tutor women denied admission to the male bastion of Harvard,Paragraph
"University. Although many American universities became co-educational, relatively few",Paragraph
women studied architecture until the 1970s. Women remain a minority in a number of,Paragraph
"schools and women are under-represented on architecture faculties. Moreover,",Paragraph
architecture programs developed in several historically black colleges and universities in,Paragraph
"America. Hampton University, then known as Hampton Institute, first offered course",Paragraph
"work in architecture in 1889; Tuskegee University, then known as the Tuskegee Normal",Paragraph
"and Industrial Institute, began offering Certificates in Architecture in 1893; architecture",Paragraph
"degree studies began at Howard University in 1911. Today, there are seven historically",Paragraph
black colleges and universities with accredited architecture programs. People of color,Paragraph
continue to be under-represented among students and faculty in most American schools,Paragraph
of architecture.,Paragraph
A system of educational degrees developed within the university system. In the United,Paragraph
"States, these include the (a bachelors degree awarded for an unaccredited education",Paragraph
focused on the study of architecture); and the (an accredited undergraduate Bachelor,Paragraph
of Architecture [B. Arch.] or an accredited graduate Master of Architecture degree [M.,Paragraph
Arch.]). Degree nomenclature and programs of study vary somewhat around the world. A,Paragraph
third type of degree is a offered to students who already hold a professional degree in,Paragraph
architecture. Post-professional education gives students the opportunity for specialization,Paragraph
"and in-depth study in design, history and theory, technology, environment and behavior,",Paragraph
"computer visualization, historic preservation, tropical architecture, or other fields of",Paragraph
"interest. The post-professional degree may be a Master’s degree, a doctorate, or a Ph.D.",Paragraph
There are three possible courses of study leading to a professional degree,Paragraph
"in architecture. 1) The student may complete a B. Arch program, generally",Paragraph
in five years. 2) The student may obtain a pre-professional undergraduate,Paragraph
"degree, then complete a two-year professional M. Arch, program. This",Paragraph
option is generally known as the four-plus-two program. 3) The student,Paragraph
"may obtain an undergraduate degree in any field, then complete a",Paragraph
"professional M. Arch, program of three to four years duration.",Paragraph
The five-year Bachelor of Architecture degree was introduced at Cornell University in,Paragraph
1922. The four plus two program was introduced in the 1960s along with the possibility,Paragraph
of studying architecture exclusively at the graduate level. The diversity of paths to a,Paragraph
professional degree offers a variety of advantages. General studies help architecture,Paragraph
students develop into well-educated professionals capable of understanding the needs of,Paragraph
"clients and the society. The B. Arch, program necessarily limits liberal arts courses",Paragraph
because of the many required professional courses. The four-plus-two program gives,Paragraph
"students an additional year of study, freeing more time for liberal studies. The graduate",Paragraph
"professional program gives students an opportunity to major in another subject in college,",Paragraph
then concentrate architectural studies into three to four years of graduate education.,Paragraph
"Art courses, particularly focusing on drawing, are excellent preparation for",Paragraph
"architectural education, which places a premium on visual communication. The ability to",Paragraph
draw expressively is considered to be more important to a beginning architecture student,Paragraph
than the mechanical skills taught in high school drafting courses. High school courses in,Paragraph
"mathematics, at least including trigonometry, and in the physical sciences, are important",Paragraph
preparations for technical coursework in architecture. Writing and speaking skills are also,Paragraph
crucial for success in architecture school. A broad academic preparation is important for,Paragraph
the architecture student because the study of architecture draws heavily upon a variety of,Paragraph
"disciplines. The basic components of the architecture curriculum are design, history and",Paragraph
"theory, technology, practice, and general education. The various programs have",Paragraph
"developed their own approaches, emphases, and strengths. Design studio integrates",Paragraph
material learned in the other courses.,Paragraph
The studio design education is an experience common to most architecture schools,Paragraph
and sets architectural education apart from other degree programs in the university.,Paragraph
Studio designates both a physical setting and a course of study. The studio is a second,Paragraph
"home to the architecture student, who claims territory with a drafting table and often",Paragraph
"personalizes the space with computers, partitions, cabinets, and domestic effects such as",Paragraph
"sofas, refrigerators, and stereo equipment. Studio is generally conducted three afternoons",Paragraph
a week. Students are expected to work independently in studio for many additional hours.,Paragraph
Studio education follows the project method developed in France. The instructor,Paragraph
assigns a design project by means of a project statement outlining the parameters of the,Paragraph
"project, carefully circumscribed to focus the students’ efforts on a particular set of",Paragraph
learning objectives. The project schedule helps students learn to manage their time to,Paragraph
complete work by the assigned deadline.,Paragraph
"During a typical studio afternoon, students work independently, sketching, drafting",Paragraph
"with manual equipment or on the computer, and building study models. The instructor",Paragraph
"circulates around the studio giving individual criticism, often sketching on tracing paper",Paragraph
to explain ideas and suggest new directions for development of each student’s project. As,Paragraph
"the deadline nears, students work around the clock to resolve designs, construct models,",Paragraph
and draft presentation drawings. This intense final effort is called the named after the,Paragraph
carts that were drawn through the streets of Paris carrying student projects to the Ecole,Paragraph
des Beaux-Arts.,Paragraph
The project culminates in a final review. Students present their projects individually to,Paragraph
"a jury of faculty, sometimes augmented by visiting faculty from other schools, practicing",Paragraph
"archi tects, and sometimes clients. The jury critiques the project for the benefit of the",Paragraph
"assembled students. In the best of circumstances, the review is an important educational",Paragraph
"experience, helping to prepare students for presentations to clients and review boards in",Paragraph
professional life.,Paragraph
History and theory are taught in lectures and seminars. A survey of architectural,Paragraph
history is common to architectural programs. Seminars tend to reflect the interests of,Paragraph
"faculty, and theory courses may draw upon art history, environmental psychology,",Paragraph
"phenomenology, sociology, and other disciplines.",Paragraph
"Architectural technology includes structures, environmental controls, construction",Paragraph
"materials and methods, and construction documentation. The emphasis on technology and",Paragraph
the extent to which technology is integrated into the design studio varies by program.,Paragraph
A course in professional practice generally occurs in the final year of study. Students,Paragraph
"are introduced to the privileges and responsibilities of professionals, the legal and ethical",Paragraph
"environment of practice, the myriad issues of managing practices, and project processes.",Paragraph
Architecture schools may offer opportunities to learn by working in architectural,Paragraph
"offices. A few schools, such as Kansas State University, offer an internship program in",Paragraph
"the fourth year of study. The University of Cincinnati, the Boston Architectural Center,",Caption
and Drexel University offer opportunities to pursue six years of concurrent academic and,Paragraph
work credits.,Paragraph
Architecture schools are staffed by full-time faculty who may concurrently practice,Paragraph
architecture and by adjunct faculty who teach part-time and maintain full-time practices.,Paragraph
Full-time architecture faculty generally have at minimum a Master of Architecture,Paragraph
"degree, which may be a first professional degree or a post-professional degree. Some",Paragraph
"subjects, for example history of architecture, tend to be taught by faculty with Ph.D.",Paragraph
degrees. Full-time faculty are subject to assessment by the same standards as other,Paragraph
"university faculty, that is, evaluation based upon teaching, scholarly work, and service.",Paragraph
There is a continuing need for architecture faculty is to press universities to recognize,Paragraph
creative and professional work as credentials for promotion and tenure.,Paragraph
"In the United States and Canada, architecture faculty are represented by the",Paragraph
Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA). ACSA sponsors conferences,Paragraph
"at the national and regional levels, providing venues for faculty to present scholarly and",Paragraph
"creative work. ACSA publishes a quarterly journal, the as well as a monthly news",Paragraph
magazine. European faculty are represented by the European Association of Architectural,Paragraph
"Education (EAAE). EAAE holds annual meetings, publishes a journal, and a newsletter.",Paragraph
"In the United States, mandatory continuing education was pioneered by the American",Paragraph
Institute of Architects (AIA) as a means to distinguish AIA members from other,Paragraph
architects. The AIA requires thirty-six learning units of continuing education per year for,Paragraph
maintenance of membership. Learning units may be earned by attending educational,Paragraph
programs and conferences or by self-reporting a variety of educational experiences in a,Paragraph
broad spectrum of subjects. The state boards soon began to take up the idea of mandatory,Paragraph
continuing education as a requirement for renewal of licensure. The thrust of continuing,Paragraph
"education for the states is keeping abreast of new knowledge in the area of health, safety,",Paragraph
and welfare.,Paragraph

EGYPTIAN REVIVAL,Title
This architectural and decorative arts style is among the most easily identifiable of all,Paragraph
"revivalist styles. Early Egyptian architecture has been studied, admired, and emulated",Paragraph
throughout time. The arch was used in ancient Egypt for what is believed to be the first,Paragraph
"time, and the ancient Greeks considered Egypt the source of all civilizations. During the",Paragraph
"Renaissance, Egyptian motifs were incorporated into the decorative arts, and many",Paragraph
architectural and decorative traditions to follow were influenced by Egyptian ornament.,Paragraph
"For centuries, Egypt was inaccessible to foreigners because of its relative isolation and",Paragraph
strict religious and political restrictions. Early examples of the style were fanciful and,Paragraph
"highly interpretive, with no effort made for accuracy until the 19th century, when",Paragraph
"archaeological discoveries in Egypt captured the popular imagination. In 1798, Napoleon",Paragraph
initiated a military campaign into Egypt and sent numerous scholars and researchers to,Paragraph
"excavate archaeological sites, resulting in a 22-volume treatise, (1829), a text that",Paragraph
"would later become a major source of inspiration for designers. In addition, in 1799, the",Paragraph
"Rosetta Stone, a basalt slab covered in hieroglyphics, was discovered by Napoleon’s",Paragraph
"troops. Rubbings of the stone were made and sent to several European scholars, foremost",Paragraph
"of whom was Jean Francois Champollion, who deciphered the hieroglyphics and",Paragraph
identified the Greek and demotic scripts inscribed on the stone. These events fueled a,Paragraph
"further fascination with the Egyptian style, but a pervasive romantic interpretation of",Paragraph
these findings diluted its historically accurate application.,Paragraph
The Egyptian Revival style is expressed primarily in two ways—as a specific massing,Paragraph
with corresponding structural elements that evoke the architecture of ancient Egypt and,Paragraph
as decorative ornament that is applied to a conventional building. In the case of,Paragraph
"architectural massing, each example of Egyptian Revival is configured with distinctive,",Paragraph
"exotic features. Frequently, buildings in this style suggest the architecture of dynastic",Paragraph
Egypt in multiple ways—with battered (slanted) walls; columns that resemble bundles of,Paragraph
"bound stalks with lotus, papyrus bud, or flowering blossom capitals; tall window frames",Caption
"that mimic the battered walls and; an overall massing effect with heavy, thick walls and",Paragraph
"strong, simple geometric volumes. In addition, an Egyptian Revival structure may include",Paragraph
"an Egyptian gorge or cavetto cornice—a partially rounded, outwardly concave molding at",Paragraph
"the roofline. Another common device is a pylon, a pair of towers with battered walls that",Paragraph
flank an entrance and is reminiscent of the monumental gateway into an ancient temple.,Paragraph
"In terms of applied ornament, the Egyptian designs are incised or affixed, usually to the",Paragraph
surface of a fairly conventional building. The affixed elements are often in the medium of,Paragraph
terra-cotta. One of the most commonly used symbols is the winged sun disk flanked by,Paragraph
"serpents, which represents the sun goddess joining the sun god Ra in his journey across",Paragraph
"the sky. The disk symbolizes eternity, the wings serve as the spirit, and the serpents",Paragraph
"represent wisdom. Another popular icon is the scarab beetle, which represents the sun",Paragraph
god and symbolizes life eternal.,Paragraph
"There are limited examples of the Egyptian Revival style in Europe, but it",Paragraph
"is a phenomenon found primarily in the United States, in cities both large",Paragraph
"and small. The style became popular during the 1830s, the 1850s, the end",Paragraph
"of the 19th century, and the 1930s, during the Art Deco era. During the",Paragraph
"19th century, architects in the United States, most of whom had received",Paragraph

EIGEN HAARD HOUSING ESTATE,Title
"Designed by Michel de Klerk, completed 1920 Amsterdam, the Netherlands",Caption
"The Eigen Haard Housing Estate in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, consists of three",Paragraph
blocks of housing in the a residential district for workers that occupies approximately,Paragraph
54 acres in the northwest part of Amsterdam. Designed by Michel de Klerk (1884-1923),Caption
"between 1914 and 1920, this complex has been recognized as his finest achievement in",Paragraph
"the field of housing, depicting his Expressionist style and ultimately becoming one of the",Paragraph
symbolic structures of the Amsterdam School.,Paragraph
Inspired by contemporary ideas that can be traced to the teachings of H.P.Berlage,Paragraph
"(1856-1934), de Klerk was committed to the basic Berlage credo of “truth in",Paragraph
architecture” as expressed through the unity of spatial organization and material use. In,Paragraph
"opposition to the abstract Cubism of the De Stijl movement, Berlage emphasized",Paragraph
experimentation with the artistic potential of practical solutions and the role of rhythmic,Paragraph
"architectural forms in the evocation of moods, thus preparing the way for the",Paragraph
Expressionism of the Amsterdam School.,Paragraph
"After the passing of the (Netherlands Housing Act of 1901), which encouraged the",Paragraph
"sponsorship of low-cost housing, and the National Housing Council, founded in 1913,",Paragraph
"which unified the large number of Dutch housing societies, the Amsterdam architectural",Paragraph
milieu between 1915 and 1930 involved extensive public housing. Although initially built,Paragraph
"as low-rise, one- or two-family houses, Amsterdam saw a rising popularity in three- and",Paragraph
four-story apartment buildings that were built around communal courts. These (garden,Paragraph
villages) were based on the English Garden City movement and the principles of Briton,Paragraph
Ebenezer Howard (1850-1928).,Paragraph
Because the post-World War I building commissions were almost solely public,Paragraph
housing and because of the presumption that good housing was a means of elevating the,Paragraph
"working class to a higher social level, architects of the Amsterdam School instinctively",Paragraph
became involved with the public housing projects. The first block of the complex was,Paragraph
"commissioned by contractors Hille and Kamphuys, not by the Eigen Haard (One’s Own",Paragraph
"Health) housing association, which commissioned the second and third building units. A",Paragraph
misprint in the Amsterdam School publication (Trends) in 1924 erroneously attributed,Paragraph
"all three structures to Eigen Haard, and it has been thus reported ever since.",Paragraph
"The four- and five-story first and second blocks, constructed in 1914 and 1915,",Paragraph
"respectively, flank the — the small communal park. The third building, designed in 1917,",Paragraph
"with its intimate (small public square) and characteristic spire, forms a triangular block",Paragraph
perpendicular to the earlier two buildings and across (East Zaan Street) and is similar in,Paragraph
concept to the first two but different enough to gain additional attention from his many,Paragraph
critics. The urban fabric is defined by the “urban block” consisting of the three-unit,Paragraph
cluster and their accompanying community square. The three blocks are articulated,Paragraph
"differently, each with structural and decorative qualities that establish a specific character",Paragraph
"that is enhanced by bold contrasts in shape, texture, and color. Examples of this",Paragraph
sculptural aesthetic can be seen through de Klerk’s eloquent use of brick and by the,Paragraph
apparent rigidity of the strong axial composition that is counterpoised by seemingly,Paragraph
"arbitrary apertures, cylinders, cones, cantilevered balconies, textured planes, curved wall",Caption
"masses, multi-paneled windows, and multi-angled roofs. The extraordinary range of",Paragraph
formal design variations elevated the buildings from simply housing construction to,Paragraph
works of art.,Paragraph
"Detailing, technique, and massing distinguished de Klerk’s work from that of his",Paragraph
"contemporaries. His creative and picturesque use of brick combinations, such as clinkers,",Paragraph
"corrugated bricks, and regular bricks laid in a double-stretcher Flemish bond pattern, may",Paragraph
have reflected Berlage’s distaste for smooth-faced brick and stucco but not his belief of,Paragraph
honesty in materials. De Klerk did not feel that the simulated was deceptive but instead,Paragraph
believed that traditional effects of materials had a more enduring value and therefore,Paragraph
"sometimes produced a hand-sculpted look with machine-made masonry units. Also, by",Paragraph
adroitly molding a diverse yet unified assemblage of housing units into these large-scale,Paragraph
"blocks, de Klerk was able to further contrast with the lack of rhythm and the monotony of",Paragraph
the existing housing stock.,Paragraph
Following Berlage’s philosophy of architectural truth in the definition and enrichment,Paragraph
"of the exterior spaces, de Klerk applied geometric emphasis on major spatial divisions.",Paragraph
"Parabolic, curvilinear, and hemicylindrical forms define entrances, stairs, and window",Paragraph
"separations, respectively, and decorative hoists indicate attic storage areas.",Paragraph
"De Klerk’s lack of pretension in his artistic treatment of all building types, regardless",Paragraph
"of their intended function or end users, gained him due respect by some of his colleagues",Paragraph
but especially with the residents of the Eigen Haard housing units. This,Paragraph
nondiscriminatory approach to design allowed those in the working class to also,Paragraph
experience the sculptural qualities of subsistence by enriching their perceptual,Paragraph
experiences.,Paragraph
"Others felt, however, that this method of design was indeed pretentious. The",Paragraph
"curvilinear forms were deemed illogical, the ornamentation embellishments were",Paragraph
"criticized as structurally dishonest, and the overall design was thought to have no",Paragraph
connection to traditional architecture. Critics complained that his projects were too,Paragraph
"opulent and wasteful, whereas others defended that the dignified dwellings were the work",Paragraph
of an “extraordinary artist” and showed a high degree of sophistication and therefore had,Paragraph
cultural significance and value.,Paragraph
"Eliciting feelings from euphoria to nausea, the | complex became such a subject of",Paragraph
criticism that one critic went so far as to accuse de Klerk of creating details that were,Paragraph
"“not only doubtful, but contrived, bizarre and unsound.” It was also said that the “total",Paragraph
"design leans toward the ridiculous or the overrefined, and then towards decadent” (see",Paragraph
"Gratama, 1915). Perhaps because of the publication of these comments in the widely",Paragraph
"circulated the words “bizarre,” “individual,” and “decadent” became inextricably",Paragraph
linked to de Klerk and ultimately to the Amsterdam School as a whole.,Paragraph
De Klerk’s engagingly provocative design of the Eigen Haard Housing Estate,Paragraph
reflected his desire to solve each building problem independently with an unpredictable,Paragraph
artistic composition. Although once thought to have little in common with the major,Paragraph
"monuments of the 20th century, this complex now stands as a monument itself for the",Paragraph
"masterful artistry and audacious individualism of its architect who, because of an",Paragraph
"untimely death, was not able to further develop these skills.",Paragraph

factories and observatories are remarkable for their abstract forms and stark play of light,Paragraph
and dark. Mendelsohn began creating images of an architecture without reference to,Paragraph
history or style. He indicated in his letters to his wife that these images came to him as,Paragraph
fleeting visions that he labored to jot down before they vanished.,Paragraph
"In 1918, Freundlich decided to build his own observatory in Potsdam where he could",Paragraph
explore and apply Einsteinian principles. He immediately sent detailed information to,Paragraph
Mendelsohn on the front. Early studies for the observatory for Freundlich are among,Caption
Mendelsohn’s sketches.,Paragraph
Mendelsohn began serious work on the Einstein Tower in May 1920. Construction,Paragraph
"began in the summer of 1920; the exterior was completed by October 1921, and the",Paragraph
"project was generally finished by 1924. The plan, in keeping with modernist reductivism,",Paragraph
was relatively simple; a vertical shaft was required down which light was reflected into a,Paragraph
horizontal underground observation chamber. The finished building consisted primarily,Paragraph
"of a three-story tower supporting an observatory cupola, a ground-floor workroom, a",Caption
"second-floor room, and the underground observation area.",Paragraph
"However, the appearance of the structure is less like a device for scientific experiment",Paragraph
"than like a ship, airplane, or vehicle of transport already in motion across the landscape.",Paragraph
The conceptual program was perhaps more complex than the functional one: Mendelsohn,Paragraph
"consciously strove to make a design devoid of right angles, that was molded rather than",Paragraph
"built, and that architecturally expressed the dynamic interchange of mass and energy",Paragraph
"inherent in Einstein’s theory of relativity. For this reason, he emphasized the interplay of",Paragraph
"mass and light, drawing on his impressionistic wartime sketches. The observatory was to",Paragraph
"be constructed of poured-in-place concrete, the only material Mendelsohn thought",Paragraph
"capable of expressing the dynamic possibilities of the new age. In the end, because of",Paragraph
"cost considerations and material wartime shortages, the underground portion was built in",Paragraph
"concrete, but the shaft of the tower was constructed of brick with a plaster finish.",Paragraph
The windswept form of the building reflects the conglomeration of a number of ideas,Paragraph
"and influences. In part, Mendelsohn’s thinking had been influenced by the German",Paragraph
"Expressionist writers and painters, such as Wassily Kandinsky, whose meetings he",Paragraph
attended. Kandinsky’s metaphysical exploration of a new German Zeitgeist shaped by,Paragraph
spiritual rather than rational forces proved particularly influential for Mendelsohn’s,Paragraph
architecture.,Paragraph
The organic vitality of Jugendstil interior design and architecture was equally,Paragraph
influential. Jugendstil (or German Art Nouveau) derived its sinuous and curvilinear,Paragraph
"motifs from nature, particularly from vines and trailing plants, which suggested fecundity",Paragraph
and irrationality in their sensuous curving stems. The first-floor plans of the Einstein,Paragraph
"Tower seem to be derived from Jugendstil organicism, as seen in the ovoid entry porch,",Paragraph
"chrysalis-like stair chamber, and the curvaceous walls of the workroom, all of which",Paragraph
evince references to germination and plantlike growth.,Paragraph
"Finally, Mendelsohn’s concern for energy, dynamism, and vitalism led him to the",Paragraph
"ideas of the Italian Futurists and their manifestos, particularly to the work of artist",Paragraph
"Umberto Boccioni. For example, Boccioni’s sculpture, of 1913—a virtual icon of",Paragraph
"Futurist ideals of power, movement, and violence—would seem to echo in the sense of",Paragraph
undulating movement that is evoked by the curving walls of Mendelsohn’s Einstein,Paragraph
"Tower. In particular, the swept forms of the legs in Boccioni’s soldierlike sculpture find",Paragraph
"their way into the surrounds of the Tower’s first-floor windows, suggesting a kind of",Paragraph
"protective cowling against movement through some medium, as if the building were",Paragraph
really a vehicle designed for travel.,Paragraph
"The Einstein Tower became the most famous, albeit often misunderstood and esoteric,",Paragraph
German building after World War I. Despite the fact that Einstein himself referred to the,Paragraph
"building in a private aside to Mendelsohn as organic, the architect’s intentions that the",Paragraph
building formally embody the physicist’s theories was not generally perceived. In his,Paragraph
"later work, Mendelsohn continued to explore formal dynamism, but the work was much",Paragraph
"more linear and rational, using steel and glass, brick, and concrete slab. He never built",Paragraph
anything like the Einstein Tower again.,Paragraph
"The building functioned successfully as an observatory, yet its formal influence on",Paragraph
"other architects seems to have been minimal. In this regard, it is a victim of its own",Paragraph
"originality and uniqueness. It was a vision, but perhaps not visionary.",Paragraph

"joined the faculty at the Academy, where he taught continuously for 48 years.",Paragraph
Eldem’s architectural training at the Academy coincided with the end of the Ottoman,Paragraph

ELEVATOR,Title
The invention of a safety device for the elevator made possible the construction of high-,Paragraph
"rise buildings, thus enabling the traditionally horizontal city to turn to the vertical. In the",Paragraph
mid-nineteenth century hotels and commercial stores were among the first building types,Paragraph
"to deploy elevators; with improvements in elevator technology, office buildings and",Paragraph
apartment buildings adopted them. As structural advances made possible taller buildings,Paragraph
new elevator technologies made possible easy and safe access to those floors.,Paragraph
"Hoisting and lifting devices were long a common feature in mines, on building sites,",Paragraph
and for the loading of ships. Rarely more complicated than a pulley with a winch turned,Paragraph
"by hand or animal, or later powered by steam, the particular danger of these early forms",Paragraph
of hoist was the absence of a safety device. Stretched or frayed ropes or cables might,Paragraph
break causing the platform to hurtle to the ground. The key invention that made the hoist,Paragraph
or lift safe for humans was a safety device that prevented free-fall disaster and its,Paragraph
inventor was Elisha Graves Otis (1811-1861).,Paragraph
"Born in Halifax, Vt., the son of a farmer and part-time inventor, Otis left high school",Paragraph
"and moved to Troy, New York in 1829 where he opened a sawmill and manufactured",Paragraph
"carriages and wagons. In 1851 he moved to Yonkers, New York where he worked for a",Paragraph
bedstead manufacturer and while installing machinery in a new factory he developed a,Paragraph
"hoist that incorporated a number of new features, including an automatic ratchet device to",Paragraph
hold the platform in place should the hoist rope break. He received a number of orders for,Paragraph
"the device and to publicize it, held a demonstration at the American Institute Fair at P.T.",Paragraph
Barnum’s Crystal Palace in New York in 1854. While standing on a platform that was,Paragraph
raised to a height of thirty or forty feet above the ground he cut the supporting rope. As,Paragraph
viewers gasped the platform remained in place and Otis announced to the assembled,Paragraph
"crowd, “All safe, gentlemen, all safe.” Though a relatively crude device—lugs were",Paragraph
driven into the platform when tension from the hoisting rope was broken—and the stop,Paragraph
"abrupt, the device was effective.",Paragraph
The first orders received by the company were for freight elevators which were able to,Paragraph
"exploit the steam power present elsewhere in the building to raise and lower the platform,",Paragraph
but on 23 March 1857 Otis installed an elevator in the new five-story china and glassware,Paragraph
shop of E.V.Haughwout and Company at 488 Broadway in New York. In addition to the,Caption
"safety device demonstrated at the Crystal Palace, Otis installed a freestanding two-",Paragraph
cylinder belt-driven steam engine that enabled elevators to be built in buildings without,Paragraph
their own extensive special power sources thus enabling elevators to be installed in,Paragraph
buildings other than factories. (The Otis Company remains one of the largest,Paragraph
manufacturers of elevators today.) The first steam-driven elevator in Chicago was,Paragraph
installed in 1864 in the Charles B.Farwell Store at 171 North Wabash Avenue.,Caption
"With the construction of tall buildings, notably in New York and Chicago, the need for",Paragraph
efficient elevators necessarily increased and engineers experimented with different types.,Paragraph
"In 1859, a Boston engineer Otis Tufts built a screw-type elevator was built in the Fifth",Paragraph
"Avenue Hotel in New York City. Tufts called his device a “vertical screw railway,”",Paragraph
"effectively a large central screw, ninety feet long and 12 inches in diameter, which raised",Paragraph
"and lowered the platform. Slow and relatively expensive, the screw-type of elevator also",Paragraph
had an unnervingly jerky movement. Another elevator type was developed by Cyrus,Paragraph
W.Baldwin for the Hale Elevator Company in Chicago. It employed a hydraulic system,Paragraph
that acted under water pressure and was first installed in the warehouse of Burley and,Paragraph
Company on West Lake Street in Chicago in 1870. The hydraulic elevator was,Paragraph
particularly effective in the highest of the new skyscrapers and was demonstrated at the,Paragraph
Eiffel Tower in Paris (1889).,Caption
Conversion to electric operation begun in the 1880s brought distinct advantages and,Paragraph
enabled the diffusion of the elevator to private apartment houses and smaller office,Paragraph
"buildings. Traditionally elevators required a special operator, skilled at meeting the floor",Paragraph
"levels, and opening and closing the gates. “Watch your step,” was the traditional elevator",Paragraph
operator’s call to passengers when he (or she) failed to meet the floor level exactly. But,Paragraph
"electric operation, using push-button controls introduced first in the 1890s meant that",Paragraph
apartment dwellers themselves could operate the elevators. Electric elevators had the,Paragraph
"advantage of clearing the basements of complex and noisy machinery. In New York, as",Paragraph
"Cromley has pointed out, the electric elevator also helped introduce a new double-lot",Paragraph
"sized flat building, typically of seven stories. Because of the elevator it was possible to",Paragraph
charge rents equably from floor to roof which not only compensated for the cost of the,Paragraph
elevator but made residents feel more secure: all fellow residents were of the same,Paragraph
income bracket.,Paragraph
Elevators were not only expensive to build but as building heights increased it became,Paragraph
ecessary to add more of them to expeditiously transport people to the upper floors. More,Paragraph
"evators, however, consumed more of the floor plate, cutting down on rental income. In",Paragraph
"rder to reduce this theft of space, experiments were also tried with double-height",Paragraph
evators stopping at even and odd floors. Staggered tubes with elevators running express,Caption
"to a point one-third or one half of the way up the building, and with passengers required",Paragraph
to change elevators for local service for the remainder of the journey are commonplace,Paragraph
today.,Paragraph
"In addition to its practical virtues, the elevator has also been a potent design symbol",Paragraph
"for 20th century architects. Among Antonio Sant’Elia’s drawings for his (1914), for",Paragraph
"example, was one project for an apartment house with the elevator projecting from the",Paragraph
slanted exterior of the building. This elevator served as a potent symbol of modernity. In,Paragraph
"William van Alen’s Chrysler Building, in New York City (1930) the elevator doors were",Paragraph
decorated with hardwood veneers forming stylized flower patterns and the interiors of the,Paragraph
elevator cars were decorated with elaborate marquetry. The effect of the lobby and its,Paragraph
decoration was like a lush underwater world from which the elevators would speed one to,Paragraph
"the light. Louis A.Kahn exposed the elevator shafts and covered them with brick, giving",Paragraph
"them the character of medieval towers on the Richards Medical Research Laboratories,",Paragraph

became part of the kinetic pleasures of the atria built by John Portman in hotels such as,Paragraph

nature in other than instrumental terms.,Paragraph
The term was first used by the German zoologist Ernst Haekel (1834-1919) in his,Paragraph
of 1866. Although Haekel did not fully develop the scientific concept as it is understood,Paragraph
"today, he did help popularize the notion that biological entities cannot be understood",Paragraph
outside their natural environment. He argued from a philosophically monist position that,Paragraph
"is opposed to the Cartesian dualist assumptions of Western science. It is not surprising,",Paragraph
"then, that the latter-day supporters of ecology, awakened by the 1962 publication of",Paragraph
Rachel Carson’s would reject a purely quantitative approach to the conservation of,Paragraph
"nature. In their holistic view, the reductive assumptions of modern science are understood",Paragraph
to be the source of resource depletion and environmental degradation—not their cure.,Paragraph
Many historians argue that emerged as a somewhat romantic idea at the beginning of,Paragraph
"the 20th century in Germany, England, and North America. Ecologism, however, did not",Paragraph
mature as a political idea until it merged with the concept of energy economics in the era,Paragraph
of the OPEC-induced energy crisis and the Vietnam War (1961-75). In that politically,Paragraph
"divisive climate, the proponents of ecologism and those of economic development",Paragraph
clashed with increasing intensity. A significant contribution to the tentative resolution of,Paragraph
"that conflict has been the concept of _ first used in “World Conservation Strategy,” a",Paragraph
1980 publication by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural,Caption
"Resources (IUCN). In that document, the seeming opposition of nature conservation and",Paragraph
economic development is subsumed in the synthesis of meaning “those paths of,Paragraph
"social, economic, and political progress that meet the needs of the present without",Paragraph
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” More developed,Paragraph
"definitions, such as that proposed by the planner Scott Campbell in 1996, understand the",Paragraph
concept of sustainability to be a set of related but competing discourses in which the,Paragraph
economic interests evident in the socially constructed concept of energy efficiency are,Paragraph
balanced with the interests of environmental protection and social equity.,Paragraph
"In Europe, the scientific—as opposed to the romantic—interpretation of sustainability",Paragraph
"has been appropriated by the practitioners of the high-tech aesthetic, such as Sir Norman",Paragraph
"Foster (1935—), Nicholas Grimshaw (1939-), Thomas Herzog (1941-), Renzo Piano",Paragraph
"(1937), and the engineering firm of Ove Arup. In the 1970s, these designers were",Paragraph
"concerned principally with the expressive potential of structure. At the end of the century,",Paragraph
"however, their interests turned equally to the energy engineering problems inherent in the",Paragraph
environmental control of large buildings. Foster’s Commerzbank project (1994) in,Paragraph

"Herzog’s exhibition hall (1995) for the Deutsche Messe in Hanover, and Piano’s office",Paragraph
building (1998) for Daimler-Benz at Potsdammerplatz in Berlin are significant works that,Paragraph
demonstrate the formal incorporation of energy engineering into architecture.,Paragraph
"In North America, the concepts of energy efficiency and sustainability have been",Paragraph
associated more with the environmental impact of material selection and the reduction of,Paragraph
embodied energy in buildings than with expressive technology. The Croxton,Paragraph

"for Maximum Potential Building Systems of Austin, Texas; and William McDonough’s",Paragraph
proposal for the Environmental Studies Center (1999) at Oberlin College are equally,Paragraph
significant examples of how the concept of energy efficiency has evolved into a more,Paragraph
complex approach to the conservation of both natural and social systems.,Paragraph
"In its most rigid form, energy-efficient design has been characterized as an attempt to",Paragraph
reconstitute the practice of architecture as a purely instrumental applied science. In its,Paragraph
"most expansive form, however, energy-efficient design challenges society to understand",Paragraph
buildings not as static objects of aesthetic value but rather as dynamic entities that,Paragraph
participate in a complex system of natural energy flows and political consequences.,Paragraph

ENGINEERED LUMBER,Title
The most influential engineered wood products of the 20th cen-tury may be classified,Paragraph
quite simply as wood composites—recombinations of wood and wood fibers that,Paragraph
"overcome many of wood’s natural limitations and extend its usefulness. Surpris-ingly,",Paragraph
"however, in this century of rapid scientific progress, most of the notable new lumber",Paragraph
products have been rather modest steps forward—chemical improvements on essentially,Paragraph
mechani-cal 19th-century inventions.,Paragraph
"Plywood, the trade name adopted by the Veneers Manufac-turers Association in 1919,",Paragraph
is a perfect example of a product that became truly viable only in the 20th century. The,Paragraph
industrial process of cutting thin layers of wood veneer by either peeling logs or slicing,Paragraph
"them, along with the concept of adhering layers of veneer together, was first introduced",Paragraph
in France around 1830. Furniture makers such as Thomas Sheraton and the Steinway,Paragraph
"company began using laminated wood veneers in the mid-19th century, and in 1884 a",Paragraph
"factory in Reval, Estonia, began manufac-turing three-ply birch seats for bentwood",Paragraph
"chairs. By 1870, a practical version of the rotary veneer lathe had been developed in the",Paragraph
"United States. However, the development of a structural wood veneer panel that could be",Paragraph
used in everything from air-plane fuselages to wall sheathing depended on the discovery,Paragraph
"of reliable, waterproof adhesives. That did not take place until after 1933, when German",Paragraph
"companies began manufacturing a new type of synthetic, heat-activated resin glue.",Paragraph
"Previous to the 1930s, plywood had been manufactured with a variety of other types of",Paragraph
"adhesives, such as blood albumin glue, casein glue (made from milk curd), and soybean",Paragraph
"glue, but its application was rather limited by its adhesives’ vulnerability to moisture and",Paragraph
"light. Once these limitations were removed, plywood quickly replaced dimensiona",Paragraph
"lumber as the most efficient material for flooring, wall sheathing, roofing, and concrete",Paragraph
forms.,Paragraph
"Like plywood, the origins of glue-laminated timber lie in the 19th century. First used",Paragraph
"in 1893 in Basel, Switzerland, glu-lam timbers are composed of many small, dry boards,",Paragraph
"laminated together with glue and/or metal fasteners, to form extremely deep, long, stable",Paragraph
"timbers. At first, glu-lam timbers could be used only indoors, where they would not be",Paragraph
"exposed to harmful moisture or radiation. After the 1930s, however, new adhesives made",Paragraph
it possible to use glu-lam timbers practically anywhere. Glu-lam timbers have severa.,Paragraph
"advantages over long single timbers cut from old-growth logs. First, they can be made",Paragraph
"from much smaller logs grown in rotation. Second, because they are made from smaller",Paragraph
"selected planks, their composition is highly predict-able. Third, they can be manufactured",Paragraph
"to practically any size or shape. Glu-lam timbers have many architectural applications,",Paragraph
but their one weakness is their reliance on the strength and longevity of the adhesive.,Paragraph
Numerous new products have been developed on the plywood and glu-lam themes,Paragraph
since the 1970s. One is a composite wood joist manufactured in an I-beam cross section.,Paragraph
"The web-bing is usually made from long sheets of plywood or oriented strand board, and",Paragraph
the flanges are made either from a parallellaminated plywood product called micro-lam,Paragraph
or from a material called Para-lam. The joists are much stronger and more stable than,Paragraph
"traditional wood joists and are perfectly uniform. Naturally, they rely completely on the",Paragraph
"strength of their glue bonds. Paralam is a type of glu-lam timber, but rather than being",Paragraph
"made up of 2-by lumber, it is made of thousands of long, thin strips of wood",Paragraph
approximately one-eighth by one-half inch in cross section and up to a few feet in length.,Paragraph
"In the manufacture of a Para-lam timber, a long bundle of spaghetti-like strands is coated",Paragraph
"in glue, compressed as it is squeezed through gigantic rollers, dried by microwave, and",Paragraph
chopped off to convenient lengths. It can be manufactured to virtually any length or cross,Paragraph
"section. In the United States, Para-lam is superseding traditional glu-lam beams in many",Paragraph
applications.,Paragraph
Not all engineered lumber requires chemical adhesives for its manufacture. One,Paragraph
"product in particular, which was an essential part of America’s war arsenal during World",Paragraph
"War II, was a com-pressed particle or fiber panel, often called Masonite or Hardbord. It",Paragraph
was manufactured throughout the 20th century out of many types of agricultural and,Paragraph
"lumber waste and by many differ-ent processes. Ordinarily, sawdust or wood chips were",Paragraph
"finely ground, boiled into a slurry, and then strained, pressed, and dried into hard sheets.",Paragraph
Fiberboard relied on the natural bonds between the wood fibers themselves for its,Paragraph
strength. Because it could be manufactured in practically limitless quantities out of,Paragraph
"extremely low cost materials, it became popular for housing projects of all types both",Paragraph
"before and after World War II. Partly for this reason, fiberboard has come to be",Paragraph
"synonymous with temporary, cheap construction. Its extremely limited insulating",Paragraph
"properties have also been far exceeded by fiberglass and rigidfoam insulation, and as an",Paragraph
interior finish it has been superseded in both cost and simplicity by gypsum wallboard.,Paragraph
Oriented strand board (OSB) is a recent variation on the fiberboard-panel theme and,Paragraph
"has been on the market since the 1980s. In OSB, small, flat chips of softwood",Paragraph
approximately one to four inches in size are gouged out of waste scraps from saw-mills,Paragraph
and low-quality logs. The chips are mixed into a gooey resin and then are laid and,Paragraph
pressed flat in a hard matrix of resin and wood chips. Sheets of OSB are ordinarily cut to,Paragraph
four- by eight-foot panels and come in a variety of thicknesses. Particle-board is,Paragraph
manufactured in a very similar way out of sawdust. Both of these products are finding,Paragraph
"wider use. Oriented strand board is an extremely inexpensive sheathing material,",Paragraph
"although it is weaker and more moisture sensitive than plywood, and painted",Paragraph
"particleboard takes an extremely hard, smooth finish for interior detailing and exterior",Paragraph
siding.,Paragraph
The engineered lumber products described here have been designed to decrease the,Paragraph
cost of housing and the use of scarce timber resources while increasing the reliability of,Paragraph
"structural designs and the palette of architectural options. Unfortunately, many",Paragraph
"“innovative” products, such as finger-jointed studs, cobble together pieces of poor-quality",Paragraph
lumber to create flimsy replacements for an already cheap existing product. Many,Paragraph
engineered wood products also require careful handling and can maximize their strength,Paragraph
and efficiency only if they are installed perfectly. Because the engineered timbers of the,Paragraph
"20th century are composites designed to combine small, cheap, plentiful strips, scraps,",Paragraph
"and planks into larger units, nearly all of them also rely on chemical adhesives, which can",Paragraph
"release toxic gases and deteriorate under certain conditions. Despite these drawbacks,",Paragraph
"there is no doubt that engineered lumber is the rational, ingenious, and optimal solution to",Paragraph
"many of the environmental, economic, and political dilemmas that Western nations faced",Paragraph
throughout the 20th century and will certainly face in the 21st.,Paragraph

primary organizational framework for various scattered buildings. Situated on the,Paragraph
"outskirts of Ahmedabad near the Bhat village, this institute is the outcome of an enterpris",Paragraph
"ing collaboration between its director, Dr. V.G.Patel, and the architect.",Paragraph
The institute is formally organized as fragmented buildings that are laid out in an L,Paragraph
shape and unified by a system of corridors. It is entered through a plaza that is shaded,Paragraph
"with trees. The entrance kiosk, with its green pyramidal roof, is the pivot from which two",Paragraph
axes extend. The first axis has the administrative offices and training and research centers,Paragraph
"and ends in the library. The second axis has two sets of residential quarters, a kitchen,",Paragraph
and a dining hall and ends at the water tower.,Paragraph
The first axis proceeds straight ahead as one enters the kiosk. It has a reception area,Paragraph
"off to one side and shows glimpses of the major courtyard, which sets off an austere yet",Paragraph
monumental looking residential building that has a gateway flanked by squat circular,Paragraph
towers at a distance. One is drawn through this axis that has alternating courtyards,Paragraph
extending from it on one side; these courtyards house the administrative part of the,Paragraph
"complex, with research and training areas on the opposite side. It ends with a poetic view",Paragraph
"of a plain exposed-brick wall that has a window set in it, framing the trees outside. The",Paragraph
"library sits adjacent to this space. Staircases off this axis lead to the upper level, which",Paragraph
has a low corridor that follows the lower one on one side and is connected across to offer,Paragraph
"views of the lower corridor and courtyards. The second axis, which leads to the",Paragraph
"residential quarters, is interspersed with circular areas that look like squat towers from the",Paragraph
"exterior and that are used for various activities, including indoor games such as table",Paragraph
"tennis, and as sitting areas.",Paragraph
The buildings are constructed of exposed load-bearing brick and have reinforced-,Paragraph
"concrete lintels and frames, with flat concrete and corrugated galvanized-steel roofs—all",Paragraph
materials that are associated with low-cost building. These materials have been,Paragraph
"meticulously detailed with great refinement. The buildings are low, two-story structures",Paragraph
"that are connected through corridors and walkways, which also surround the various",Paragraph
courtyards. The smaller courtyards are paved and have water bodies and trees that help,Paragraph
"create shade and enhance the natural ventilation system, and the large courtyard between",Paragraph
buildings is landscaped with grass and has trees surrounding it. This project has been,Paragraph
"extolled for its low maintenance, easy replicability, and concern for saving energy",Paragraph
through the use of courtyards for natural ventilation.,Paragraph
Although formally there is an aspect of monumentality that is emphasized by the,Paragraph
"circular tower-like forms, by the framed views, and by the uniformity of courtyards (as",Paragraph
"well as the materials used), this aspect is reversed in terms of the scale, as the buildings",Paragraph
"are quite low in comparison with the scale of the courtyards they surround. In addition,",Paragraph
stepping-down devices on the roof accentuate the low scale. The formal alignment and,Paragraph
deflections that frame particular vistas are geared toward underscoring special areas of,Paragraph
the institute. The corridors that unify the institute contribute to the visual delight by,Paragraph
"alternating between light and shade, with courtyards opening on the sides. In addition to",Paragraph
"these corridors are alternate views of flat and arched lintels spanning adjoining courts,",Paragraph
"staircases leading up to the walkways at the upper level, a variety of framed views at both",Paragraph

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES,Title
Environmental degradation became an issue in those locales where citizens suffered the,Paragraph
"unintended consequences of modern industrial development. In England, workers first",Paragraph
experienced the grim conditions associated with the Dickensian city in the mid-18th,Paragraph
"century. In the rest of Europe and North America, the degraded industrial landscape",Paragraph
"emerged by the mid-19th century, and globally such conditions emerged in the 20th",Paragraph
"century. By the end of that century, the condition of the environment had become an",Paragraph
issue not only for the world’s industrial workers but also for an increasingly diverse,Paragraph
"population who could no longer isolate themselves from the fouled water, polluted air,",Paragraph
and multiple health hazards that derive from industrial capitalism.,Paragraph
Historians and philosophers attribute the emergence of a degraded natural,Paragraph
"environment to various sources. The historian Lynn White, Jr. (1907-), for example,",Paragraph
argued that the anthropo-centric assumptions of mainstream Christianity are largely,Paragraph
responsible for the instrumental view of nature held in those Western societies where,Paragraph
"industrial capitalism first developed. It is that instrumental logic, according to White, that",Paragraph
has made nature appear to humans as available for exploitation and consumption.,Paragraph
"Postmodern philosophers of nature, such as Arne Naess (1912-), construct a slightly",Paragraph
different narrative. Naess and the deep ecologists who followed him have tended to see,Paragraph
the origins of the degraded natural world in the foundational assumptions of such early,Paragraph
modems as the French philosopher René Descartes (1596-1650) and the English natural,Paragraph
philosopher Francis Bacon (1561-1626). Most historians agree that the Cartesian and,Paragraph
Baconian creeds became popularly accepted in Western society by about 1850. Although,Paragraph
"this modern reconceptualization of nature became dominant by the mid-19th century, it",Paragraph
did not extinguish contrary views. The idealization of nature by the French philosopher,Paragraph
Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-78) and the counter-modernism of the German philosopher,Paragraph
Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) set the stage for the 20th-century reassessment of our,Paragraph
relationship to the natural world.,Paragraph
"In the view of the German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889-1976), the sum of",Paragraph
mainstream Christian and philosophically modern doctrines has been to institutionalize,Paragraph
what he describes as “modern technological thinking”—a form of consciousness in which,Paragraph
nature is understood as a static human resource or reserve. Heidegger’s influential,Paragraph
criticism of modern science and technology would resonate throughout the 20th century.,Paragraph
The reaction against modern environmental degradation predictably emerged in those,Paragraph
"locales that were most affected by industrial excess—England, Germany, and North",Paragraph
"America. In England, the Arts and Crafts movement, through the writings of John Ruskin",Paragraph
"(1819-1900) and the socialist Utopian projects of William Morris (1834-96), articulated",Paragraph
a particularly nostalgic critique of industrialization. Those who followed Ruskin and,Paragraph
Morris—principally the architect Raymond Unwin (1863-1940) and the planner,Paragraph
Ebenezar Howard (1850—1928)—constructed progressive visions of urban life that,Paragraph
attempted to both rationalize and beautify industrialization in the form of the garden city.,Paragraph
"In this tradition, English environmentalism has generally been associated with",Paragraph
"progressive politics. However, architects such as C.F.A.Voysey (1857-1941) and Baillie",Paragraph
"Scott (1865-1945), who enabled the retreat of industrialists to stylish houses in the as-",Paragraph
"yet-unpolluted countryside, can be associated with conservative politics.",Paragraph
"As with the English Arts and Crafts movement, the German and Austrian architects",Paragraph
saw a return to craft as the best defense against industrialization and environmental,Paragraph
degradation. The German Romantic attitude is exemplified by the self-consciously,Paragraph
picturesque Darmstadt artists’ colony designed principally by Joseph Maria Olbrich,Caption
(1867-1908). That village-like refuge from industrialization embodies the emergent,Paragraph
romantic environmentalism that became a powerful conservative force in the Wei-mar,Paragraph
era of Germany. Although there were Bauhaus- or Deutsche Werkbund-influenced,Paragraph
"environmentalists, such as the landscape architect Leberecht Migge (1881-1935), who",Paragraph
"affiliated themselves with progressive political causes, environmentalism in Germany",Paragraph
between the world wars was more commonly associated with the blood-and-soil rhetoric,Paragraph
"of anti-modern nationalists and National Socialists. Architects of the Bauhaus, Hannes",Caption
"Meyer (1889-1954) chief among them, did articulate various progressive positions",Paragraph
advocating the production of a hygienic environment for industrial workers.,Paragraph
"In North America, those agrarian pastoralists who descended from Thomas Jefferson",Paragraph
(1743-1826) and Henry David Thoreau (1817-62) developed a two-sided critique of,Paragraph
industrialization: those who favored environmental preservation and those who favored,Title
"environmental conservation. On the side of preservation were those romantics, such as",Paragraph
"John Muir (1838-1914), who advocated creating nature preserves that would remain",Paragraph
"forever untouched by development. On the side of conservation were those pragmatists,",Paragraph
"such as Gifford Pinchot (1865-1946), who advocated environmentally responsible",Paragraph
development. As these two camps matured under the New Deal administration (1933-45),Paragraph
"of President Franklin D.Roosevelt (1882-1945), social elites and technocrats came to",Paragraph
"dominate both. The principal environmental concern of social elites was aesthetic, while",Paragraph
the principal environmental concern of technocrats was natural resource sufficiency and,Paragraph
balancing the accounts of energy economics.,Paragraph
Frank Lloyd Wright’s (1867-1959) organic approach to architecture emerged within,Paragraph
these debates. In projects such as Fallingwater—the Edgar J.Kaufmann house (1936) at,Paragraph
"Bear Run, Pennsylvania—Wright’s careful attention to the integration of the building",Paragraph
"with the natural conditions of the site, as well as his attention to solar orientation and to",Paragraph
"the use of local materials, supports those who argue that Wright’s architecture is",Paragraph
"environmentally inspired. Other historians, however, argue that Wright’s architecture",Paragraph
"responded to the environmental consequences of industrialization in only a metaphoric,",Paragraph
"not a material, sense. For example, Wright’s proposal for Broadacre City (1935)",Paragraph
exemplifies rather than critiques the American suburban attitude toward nature. It is the,Paragraph
consumptive quality of suburban American land use practices that has produced the,Paragraph
"related environmental conditions of urban sprawl, universal dependence on the",Paragraph
"automobile, carbonization of the earth’s atmosphere, and global warming—a cause-and-",Paragraph
effect relation that gained increasing credibility among scientists at the century’s end.,Paragraph
"Following in the tradition of Wright, the organic architecture of Bruce Goff (1904—",Paragraph
"82), Paolo Soleri (1919-), Herb Green (1929-), and Bart Prince (1947—) can be",Paragraph
"characterized as profoundly anti-urban. Supporters of organic architecture argue that it is,",Paragraph
"at the very least, a proto-environmentalist position. Detractors, however, argue that",Paragraph
"organic architecture has achieved only the aestheticization of suburban life, thus masking",Paragraph
the environmental consequences of the American automobile culture. The growing,Paragraph
suburban population has tended to ignore the progressive environmental degradation in,Paragraph
"North America until the mid-1960s. In the absence of public consciousness,",Paragraph
environmental issues were the concern of the poor who lived in the shadow of industrial,Paragraph
"production, the technocrats who wished to manage it from above, and the social elites",Paragraph
who found it aesthetically unpleasant.,Paragraph
"In the 1960s, however, several conditions conspired to change the political",Paragraph
"complexion of environmentalism. First, the sanctity of science as an objective body of",Paragraph
knowledge came into question by such critical theorists as Herbert Marcuse (1898-1979).,Paragraph
If science could be understood as ideological and itself a source of environmental,Paragraph
"degradation, Marxists found it increasingly difficult to distinguish between science and",Paragraph
"the capitalist economy that commissioned it. Second, white middle-class citizens,",Paragraph
"especially the so-called Woodstock generation, increasingly criticized the technocratic",Paragraph
"capitalist economy because, like the poor, they too had begun to experience serious",Paragraph
environmental degradation. Following the 1962 publication of | by Rachel Carson,Paragraph
"(1907-64) and the political confrontation of the Vietnam War (1961-75),",Paragraph
"environmentalists of the Left, such as Barry Commoner (1917-), inspired a new",Paragraph
generation who embraced architecture as a medium of environmental and political action.,Paragraph
The critique of modern architecture that emerged in the late 1960s can be,Paragraph
"characterized as having two fronts, one aesthetic and one environmental. On the aesthetic",Paragraph
"front were those populists, such as Robert Venturi (1925—), who argued for a linguistic",Paragraph
"approach to architecture. Those who followed Venturi’s aes-thetic critique, Robert",Paragraph
"A.M.Stern (1939—) and Michael Graves (1934—) among them, became associated with a",Paragraph
popular historicism that was much appreciated by corporate clients such as Walt Disney,Paragraph
and the suburban developers of shopping malls. On the second front of the critique of,Paragraph
"modem architecture were those lesser-known environmentalists, such as Steve Baer",Paragraph
"(1938), who dropped out of conventional society to form alternative cooperatives, such as",Paragraph
"in northern New Mexico. For example, Baer’s Davis house (1976-77) at Corrales, New",Paragraph
"Mexico, employed a variety of passive solar techniques that enabled his client to live",Paragraph
independent of commercial power sources. Most of those activists who followed Baer’s,Paragraph
environmental critique of modern architecture rejoined conventional practice in the 1980s,Paragraph
and produced a body of architecture distinguished mostly by its energy efficiency. The,Paragraph
counterculture environmental architecture of the 1960s and 1970s was deeply influenced,Paragraph
by the “dymaxion” principles and geodesic constructions of R.Buckminster Fuller (1895—,Paragraph
) expressed through Utopian interpretations of both the future and the past.,Paragraph
"In the 1970s and 1980s, postmodern environmentalists in Europe and North America",Paragraph
routinely characterized modern architecture as both inhumane and inherently anti-nature.,Paragraph
"In this reactionary view, modern architecture, like the modern science and technology",Paragraph
"that enabled it, was understood to be the principal source of environmental degradation,",Paragraph
"not its cure. Under scrutiny, however, such claims appear to be ideological and reflect the",Paragraph
romantic assumptions of environmentalists in that era. More careful analysis suggests that,Paragraph
"within modern architecture there is a continuous, if not constant, tradition of concern for",Paragraph
"environmental issues, even among those major figures most often accused of abusing",Paragraph
"natural processes. The California projects of Richard Neutra (1892-1970), the works of",Paragraph
"Alvar Aalto (1898-1976), and even the later works of Le Corbusier (1887-1965) can be",Paragraph
understood as thoughtful attempts to design human environments in sympathy with the,Paragraph
natural energy flows of a particular site. Neutra’s Kaufmann Desert House (1946-47) at,Caption
Palm Springs and Le Corbusier’s experiments with natural ventilation at La Tourette,Paragraph
(1957-65) are particularly good examples that document the skill of modern architects in,Paragraph
addressing environmental issues.,Paragraph
It is such site-sensitive modern architecture that the historian Kenneth Frampton,Paragraph
(1930-) has described as “Critical Regionalism.” Frampton described a set of related,Paragraph
design attitudes that might provide resistance to both the globalizing tendencies of,Paragraph
modem technology and the repressive social codes associated with local building,Title
"traditions. To illustrate his hypothesis, Frampton pointed to the works of Mexican",Paragraph
"architect Luis Barragan (1902—), the early projects of Swiss architect Mario Botta (1943—",Paragraph
"), the houses of Australian architect Glenn Murcutt (1936—), as examples of sensitivity to",Paragraph
site and context. Frampton’s writings have generated a powerful proto-environmentalist,Paragraph
discourse that paved the way for the ecologically inspired architecture that appeared at,Paragraph
the end of the century.,Paragraph
Although the ecologically inspired architecture of the 1970s lost momentum when the,Paragraph
"energy crisis of 1973 waned, it enjoyed a significant resurgence at the end of the century.",Paragraph
"Under the rubric of green architecture and/or sustainable development, European and",Paragraph
North American architects produced a wide variety of projects that responded to the ever-,Paragraph
expanding list of environ mental concerns. The term “sustainability” was first used in a,Paragraph
"1980 publication by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN),",Caption
“World Conservation Strategy.” Although the definition of sustainable development is,Paragraph
"widely contested, the concept attracted a broad following in both developed and",Paragraph
developing nations by the early 1990s. In a 1987 publication by the UN World,Paragraph
"Commission on Environment and Development, —also known as The —the concept",Paragraph
"was defined as “development that does not destroy or undermine the ecological,",Paragraph
economic or social basis on which continued development depends.” Subsequent,Paragraph
international summit meetings on the environment—the first at Serrado Mar near Rio de,Paragraph
"Janiero, Brazil (1992), and the second at Kyoto, Japan (1997)—vigorously debated the",Paragraph
political implications of sustainable development as a concept. The charged nature of the,Paragraph
international debate reflected the environmental and social effects of economic,Paragraph
globalization at the end of the century.,Paragraph
Although sustainable architecture had gained considerable visibility and support at the,Paragraph
"century’s end, it would be a mistake to characterize it as a single, coherent ideology much",Paragraph
"less a style. Rather, selected environmental issues confronting the late century gained",Paragraph
resonance with a number of competing and frequently opposed traditions within,Paragraph
"architecture. Two British scholars, Simon Guy (1963—-) and Graham Farmer (1965-),",Paragraph
identified six distinct factors that characterize the concept of sustainability in terms that,Paragraph
"are alternately progressive and conservative, high tech and low tech, romantic and",Paragraph
pragmatic. Guy’s and Farmer’s six categories (or “logics”) are particularly helpful in,Paragraph
relating particular environmental issues to distinct constituencies and include the eco-,Paragraph
"technic, eco-centric, eco-aesthetic, eco-cultural, eco-medical and eco-social.",Paragraph
“Eco-technic” logic uses technologies to treat environmental problems. The term,Paragraph
"defines projects of those architects and engineers who work at a global scale, relying on",Paragraph
the language of technology and scientific research. This type of architecture often appears,Paragraph
"modem, commercial, and future-oriented; the architects employ “hi-tech,” and energy-",Paragraph
"efficient construction methods, such as the photovoltaic production of electrical energy.",Paragraph
"Projects by Norman Foster and Partners (Commerzbank Frankfurt, 1997), the Renzo",Caption
"Piano Workshop (_ Lyon, 1995), or by the engineering firm Ove Arup exemplify an eco-",Paragraph
technic logic in architecture.,Paragraph
“Eco-centric” logic in architecture is focused on reconstructing a spiritual relation,Paragraph
between humans and nature. These architects envision the world as fragile and therefore,Paragraph
rely on systemic ecology and other holistic approaches as a source of environmental,Paragraph
"knowledge. Eco-centric buildings are understood to be consumptive, but can be redeemed",Paragraph
through employing such renewable technologies as straw-bale construction. The natural,Paragraph
harmony envisioned by those who support eco-centric architecture is exemplified by the,Paragraph
projects of Brenda (1949-) and Robert Vale (1948—) in the United Kingdom (the,Paragraph
"Autonomous House, 1975) and by the “Earthships” (1983-90) of Mike Reynolds (1945-)",Paragraph
in New Mexico.,Paragraph
“Eco-aesthetic” logic in architecture is less concerned with energy efficiency and the,Paragraph
sanctity of nature than with metaphor and meaning. This group of architects prizes,Paragraph
"iconicity, organics, and a non-linear approach to design. In this characterization of",Paragraph
"sustainable architecture, human consciousness of nature is transformed as much by",Paragraph
organic expressionism as by new ecolog-ical knowledge. Eco-aesthetic architecture is,Paragraph
"exemplified by the dramatic concrete constructions of Santiago Calatrava (1951-), the",Paragraph
"fusion of landscape and architecture found in the works of SITE, and the complex",Paragraph
organic forms of Frank Gehry (1929-).,Paragraph
“Eco-cultural” logic involves the local cultural consequences of global technological,Paragraph
"change. Space, in this tradition, is understood as phenomenological and bioregionally",Paragraph
"unique. Typologically appropriate constructions are generally realized through “passive,”",Paragraph
"“low-tech,” or “vernacular” technologies, such as adobe construction, that focus cultural",Paragraph
"practices. Exemplars of eco-cultural logic, however, include the technologically inventive",Paragraph
"houses of Glenn Murcutt (1936—) in Australia, the works of Charles Correa (1930-) in",Paragraph
"India, and the midcentury works of Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy (1900-89).",Paragraph
“Eco-medical” logic is concerned principally with medical and health issues.,Paragraph
"According to the eco-medical, the modern built environment is characterized as polluted",Paragraph
and even hazardous—the consequence of “sick building syndrome” that results from the,Paragraph
use of volatile chemical compounds in tightly constructed buildings coupled with,Paragraph
inadequate natural ventilation. The technologies employed by the practitioners of eco-,Paragraph
"medical logic are “passive, nontoxic, natural, or tactile,” and are deployed to ensure",Paragraph
individual health and well-being. The (building biology) movement in Germany and the,Paragraph
Gaia group in Norway are practitioners of eco-medical logic.,Paragraph
"The final environmental logic identified by Guy and Farmer is the “eco-social,” which",Paragraph
concerns itself with social participation in reproducing those natural processes that,Paragraph
"enhance all life. In this tradition, ecological space can be interpreted only in the social",Paragraph
"context of power relations. One cannot consider the health of the forest, for example,",Paragraph
"without also considering the health of forest workers. Eco-social design, then, relies on",Paragraph
"sociology and social ecology in architecture construction that is democratic, participatory,",Paragraph
"and locally managed. In the United Kingdom, Ralph Erskine (1914—) has employed eco-",Paragraph
"social logic in most of his projects, as have Lucien Kroll (1927—) in Belgium and Peter",Paragraph
Hubner (1939-) in Germany.,Paragraph
Each of the environmental logics identified by Guy and Farmer concern themselves,Paragraph
with a different set of environmental issues and attract citizens with differing political,Paragraph
"and economic interests. There is, of course, considerable fluidity in the ideological",Paragraph
"boundaries described in these various logics, but it is less the exclusive quality of the",Paragraph
categories that is important than the diversity of those citizens who are attracted to them.,Paragraph
"Indeed, by the year 2000, the degraded condition of the environment had become a",Paragraph
significant issue not only to exploited workers but also to average citizens in every,Paragraph
"country. On this account, a new breed of environmental activists exemplified by the",Paragraph
"industrialist Paul Hawken (1946—) and the co-directors of the Rocky Mountain Institute,",Paragraph

ESCALATOR,Title
The term “escalator” was developed by the Otis Elevator Company to describe the,Paragraph
moving stairway systems they began producing at the turn of the twentieth century. Otis,Paragraph
Elevator main tained exclusive use of the term until the 1930’s when “escalator” was,Paragraph
declared to be in the public domain.,Paragraph
Elevators provide quick and easy access over long vertical distances and thus were,Paragraph
necessities in the high-rise building type that began to evolve at the end of the nineteenth,Paragraph
"century. The escalator provides both vertical and horizontal displacement, usually in an",Paragraph
"open environment, making it more appropriate in buildings where only a few floors need",Paragraph
"to be connected. The funicular, or inclined elevator, was the predecessor of both the",Paragraph
vertical elevator and the escalator. It evolved into use where the vertical distances were,Paragraph
"great and intermediate landings were usually not required such as a ski lifts. Pittsburgh,",Paragraph
PA once boasted fourteen funiculars to move people around the hilly city and they remain,Paragraph
"an integral part of the transportation system in Naples, Italy and other parts of Europe.",Paragraph
The predecessor to the modern escalator was the flat stepped “Seeberger” escalator,Paragraph
introduced to the public at the Paris Exposition in 1900. The design necessitated,Paragraph
passengers step off or on the upper landing at an angle to the direction of travel creating a,Paragraph
"safety hazard. The “Reno” type, patented about the same time as an “endless conveyor or",Paragraph
"elevator,” consisted of a series of slightly inclined flat platforms on a conveyor. A Reno",Paragraph
type escalator installed in the 59th Street Station of the New York subway system at the,Caption
turn of the century remained in use until 1955. Both the “Reno” and “Seeberger”,Paragraph
escalators included continuous rotating handrails and were manufactured by the Otis,Paragraph
Elevator Company.,Paragraph
"A much earlier moving stairway system, patented in 1859, was the Ames revolving",Paragraph
stair. Its demise was the equilateral treads that forced passengers to awkwardly jump off,Paragraph
and on at right angles to the direction of travel as the tread rotated around the gear.,Paragraph
Other early 20th century improvements to the design of escalators included flat steps,Paragraph
"with cleats or combs, and boarding areas parallel to the direction of travel. Developments",Paragraph
"during the mid-century include metal treads (instead of wood), glass balustrades, sleeker",Paragraph
"lines, and safety enhancements. A late 20th century innovation was the development of",Paragraph
the radial configuration.,Paragraph
"Related to escalators are moving walks, both horizontal and inclined designed to speed",Paragraph
"the movement of passengers over long distances. Early types, such as the one introduced",Paragraph
"at the 1893 Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition, were refined conveyor belts.",Paragraph
"Modern moving walkways, incorporating much of the technology used in escalator",Paragraph
"design, are familiar sights in airport terminals. Inclined moving walkways are often found",Paragraph
in retail establishments to enable shoppers to move shopping carts from level to level.,Paragraph
"Elevators were a key design feature in department stores, museums, concert halls, and",Paragraph
other early 20th century building types built to satiate the need of the burgeoning middle,Paragraph
classes to spend and to be seen. Escalators continue to be used to create opportunities for,Paragraph
enticing shoppers in department stores and shopping malls to view enticing merchandise,Paragraph
displays.,Paragraph
The construction of extensive underground and elevated commuter rail systems in,Paragraph
"British, European and American cites contributed to the need for experimentation in the",Paragraph
development of machines to facilitate the transport of large groups of people over,Paragraph
relatively short distances. Escalators enable the management of people in transportation,Paragraph
centers by dispersing surges of users into a uniform flow and quantity. Moscow boasts,Paragraph
"the fastest speeds, about 200 feet per minute for escalators traveling into the deepest",Paragraph
subway tunnels. Speed is limited to 100 feet per minute in most other countries for safety,Paragraph
reasons.,Paragraph
"During the first half of the 20th century, banking halls were often located on the",Paragraph
second floor in new high-rise buildings. Escalators provided easy access to the banking,Paragraph
"hall from the street allowing patrons to observe who was going in and out, whom they",Paragraph
"were with, and, what they were wearing. Today lobbies of grand hotels and convention",Paragraph
centers perform the same function; they allow guests to see and be seen during their,Paragraph
leisurely ascents or descents while adorned in their finest garments and jewelry. The,Paragraph
escalators in the lobby of the PSFS (Philadelphia Saving Fund Society) Building,Caption
"(Philadelphia, PA) originally transported patrons to a banking hall that was recently",Paragraph
converted to the ballroom of a luxury hotel.,Caption
Escalators also provide excellent opportunities for viewing monumental architectural,Paragraph
"spaces such as those in the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C.)",Caption
or panoramic views of the natural environment. Architects often use escalators as design,Paragraph
features within large open spaces. They can be arranged in crisscross or parallel,Paragraph
configurations creating bold aesthetic statements.,Paragraph
The process of designing spaces for escalators includes extensive analysis of a,Paragraph
"building’s function, the number of occupants, peak periods of use, and knowledge of how",Paragraph
people traverse through space as individuals and in groups. Adequate queuing distances,Paragraph
must be provided at both the top and bottom of landings to allow for large numbers of,Paragraph
people to embark and disembark in an orderly fashion. This is particularly important in,Paragraph
rail facilities when the platform edges may be located near the escalators. Subway,Paragraph
"stations feel grossly oversized during much of the day, except at rush hour when they",Paragraph
seem barely adequate to safely contain the passengers in the space.,Paragraph
"Escalator configurations (tread width, angle of travel, speed, and design features) are",Paragraph
standardized by code to ensure passerby safety and to make the process of incorporating,Paragraph
escalators into a design less difficult for architects and engineers. Safety requirements,Paragraph
minimize opportunities for innovative aesthetic modifications to escalator systems.,Paragraph
"Balustrades, the most prominent feature, may have tempered glass (clear or tinted),",Paragraph
"bronze, or, stainless steel safety panels. Panels may be etched with designs to enhance",Paragraph
their appearance or to tie the escalator to the building’s design theme. Handrails may be,Paragraph
colored or lights may be mounted under them to emphasize this feature. Trusses (the,Paragraph
structural support) may be exposed such as at the Zurich Trade Fair in Switzerland or,Paragraph
"clad in mirrors, ornamental metals or decorative stone.",Paragraph

EXHIBITION BUILDING,Title
The development of exhibition buildings is inseparable from international world,Paragraph
expositions. Historian Nikolaus Pevsner demonstrated that the 20th-century exhibition,Paragraph
"building has 19th-century origins, with stylistic and programmatic links to the",Paragraph
conservatory and market hall.,Paragraph
"Expositions are brief events usually lasting only one season, although they may",Paragraph
consume up to ten years of planning effort. The buildings serve to display the innovative,Paragraph
"technological, industrial, economic, scientific, and cultural ideas of the participating",Paragraph
"nations. The Bureau International des Expositions (BIE), which administers these events,",Paragraph
selects a timely theme that serves as a catalyst for each event. Themes provide an,Paragraph
informational and organizing principle that guides much of what is designed and,Paragraph
"constructed. Themes have been celebratory, such as “The Age of Discovery” for Expo",Paragraph
"“92 in Seville, marked by the 500-year anniversary of the sailing of Columbus to the New",Caption
"World, or more frequently address a global concern, such as “Progress and Harmony for",Paragraph
Mankind” at Expo ’70 in Osaka. Although most buildings must be erected in a short,Paragraph
"period of time and are subsequently destroyed, those that come to symbolize the event are",Paragraph
often saved and serve as powerful symbols for the city and issues they commemorate.,Paragraph
The great exposition of London in 1851 had the Crystal Palace by George Paxton and,Paragraph
"that of Paris in 1889 the 300-meter-high Eiffel Tower by Gustave Eiffel, and in Chicago",Paragraph
in 1893 the collective works surrounding the grand canal came to be known as “The,Paragraph
White City.’ These landmark exhibitions and their symbolic buildings remain,Paragraph
extraordinarily potent and have influenced most exposition efforts throughout the 20th,Paragraph
century.,Paragraph
The first period of 20th-century exhibition buildings occurred through the late 1920s.,Paragraph
These buildings are generally characterized as being retrospective both stylistically and,Paragraph
"historically, in correspondence with the imperialistic tendencies of the dominant Western",Paragraph
nations. Although innovative structural and material applications led to the increasing,Paragraph
"scale of construction, these armatures were often surrounded in wooden lath and plaster",Paragraph
"known as “staff,” molded into classical elements. The formal results were often awkward,",Paragraph
as the proportion of classical encasements conflicted with large-scale steel structures.,Paragraph
"Despite some occasional structural inventions, most exhibition buildings served as",Paragraph

Designed by Pier Luigi Nervi; completed 1950,Caption
The Exhibition Hall of Turin (1949-50) represents a significant achievement in the,Paragraph
building arts of the 20th century. Built in the city of Turin among the vestiges of war-torn,Paragraph
"Italy, it was designed, engineered, and built by Italian engineer Pier Luigi Nervi. Widely",Paragraph
"known for its innovative adoption of new building materials and construction techniques,",Paragraph
the Exhibition Hall is an eloquent example of the use of reinforced concrete and ferro-,Paragraph
"cement. The large, unobstructed spans of the main hall and the exuberant elegance of its",Paragraph
articulated roof structure were made possible by the pioneering efforts and structural,Paragraph
ingenuity of its builder. A building commissioned to showcase the promise of Italy’s,Paragraph
"postwar industrial production called for display areas of vast dimensions, and the",Paragraph
undulating concrete canopy of the Turin Exhibition Hall achieved just this.,Paragraph
Its construction epitomized modern architecture’s postwar fascination with structural,Paragraph
engineering. The building’s appearance was derived from its structural logic and process,Paragraph
"of assembly. The elasticity and plasticity of poured-in-place concrete, the flexibility of",Paragraph
"prefabricated ferro-cement shells, and the ability to calculate and thus control the",Paragraph
building’s static forces were significant factors in determining its final shape. In building,Paragraph
"the Exhibition Hall, no boundary separated the architectural search for form from the",Paragraph
engineering imperative to quantify structure.,Paragraph
"Programmatically, the Exhibition Hall was a quintessentially modern building. Along",Paragraph
"with factories, warehouses, bridges, and power plants, exhibition halls were utilitarian",Paragraph
"structures born of the industrial revolution. From turbine engines to plumbing fixtures,",Paragraph
exhibition halls collected and displayed the products of mechanization. A progenitor of,Paragraph
"the Turin Hall was the Crystal Palace, designed by Sir Joseph Paxton for London’s Great",Paragraph
"Exhibition of 1851; like the later Exhibition Hall, it too was built of prefabricated",Paragraph
"components. However, unlike the Turin Hall, the Crystal Palace was built of iron and",Paragraph
"glass and achieved interior spans of only 100 feet. Only 100 years later, the use of",Paragraph
reinforced concrete and ferro-cement would result in clear spans of nearly 300 feet.,Paragraph
An invited competition was launched for the construction of a new Exhibition Hall to be,Paragraph
located on the site of the former Palace of Fashion. A general urgency to rebuild existed,Paragraph
"throughout Europe, and as the Exhibition Hall was essential in helping to generate future",Paragraph
"economic growth for Italy, its building schedule was but a mere eight months. The lack",Paragraph
"of building materials, particularly wood for the erection of formwork, further exacerbated",Paragraph
the difficult conditions under which the participants were asked to devise an architectural,Paragraph
"solution. The existing palace, destroyed during World War II, was rebuilt by engineer",Paragraph
Biscaretti di Ruffia. The design commission and building tender for the new Exhibition,Caption
"Hall, however, was entrusted to the engineer ing team of Nervi and Bartoli. The",Paragraph
"economical nature of their proposal, with its inexpensive use of materials, managed use",Paragraph
"of labor, speed of erection, and avoidance of wooden formwork, made it the favored",Paragraph
solution. The mastery that Nervi and Bartoli had previously achieved in the construction,Paragraph
"of large-span structures, such as the Florence Stadium (1929-32) and the airplane",Paragraph
"hangers of Orvieto and Orbetello (1937-43), bore confidently on the future success of",Paragraph
their daring proposal.,Paragraph
"The complex was built in two stages, the first structure being completed in 1949 and",Paragraph
"the second a year later. The initial building, Salone B (Agnelli), was spatially, materially,",Paragraph
"and structurally the more extravagant of the two. It comprised two interconnected spaces,",Paragraph

The project’s success can be attributed to its inventive construction process. To build,Paragraph
"during the harsh winter months and reduce the total time required for construction, Nervi",Paragraph
devised a three-part process wherein the first two parts proceeded simultaneously. On,Paragraph
"site, the main structural supports of Salone B were built using poured-in-place reinforced",Paragraph
"concrete, whereas off-site, the prefabricated sections of the vaulted roof were cast",Paragraph
independently using ferro-cement. Once the main structural piers and floors were in,Paragraph
"place, the installation of the roofing members proceeded without the need for additional!",Paragraph
"formwork. The individual roof sections, measuring 8 by 13 feet and folded in the profile",Paragraph
"of a sinusoidal wave, were aligned and arched into the desired profile of the vault and",Paragraph
"bound to each other using poured-in-place concrete, the whole made possible by the use",Paragraph
of movable metal scaffolding. The final phase of construction required bonding the roof,Paragraph
shells to the poured-in-place piers. This was achieved via the on-site pouring of,Paragraph
reinforeed-concrete rib beams. They spanned from pier to pier and were poured within,Paragraph
the upper and lower extremities of the roof section. It was this system of in situ concrete,Paragraph
beams that ensured that the prefabricated roof shells and the structural piers worked,Paragraph
together monolithically.,Paragraph
"Still, the most significant characteristic of the Exhibition Hall was its extensive use of",Paragraph
precast ferro-cement. This new material was used here for the first time in the,Paragraph
"construction of a large-span building, and the best person disposed to do so was its",Paragraph
"inventor, Nervi. In 1943, Nervi registered two patents for ferro-cement and built four",Paragraph
"boats using the material. Its ability to be light in weight, thin in section, and difficult to",Paragraph
"pierce, yet structurally sound, made it a viable alternative to wood for the construction of",Paragraph
navigational vessels. Ferro-cement represented an entirely new way of conceiving roof,Paragraph
structures and exterior building skins. It inverted the traditional manner in which concrete,Paragraph
and steel were combined. Whereas reinforced concrete involved the insertion of steel,Paragraph
"rods within the body of concrete, ferro-cement involved a concrete coating over a body of",Paragraph
steel. Layers of small-diameter steel mesh were intertwined and coated with a mixture of,Paragraph
cement mortar (cement and sand) and folded into a range of contours intrinsic to its,Paragraph
process of construction. The ability to bend the mesh into various shapes rendered,Paragraph
possible the construction of very thin yet structurally sound slabs. The roof section of the,Paragraph
Exhibition Hall was of an undulating corrugated profile whose strength was contained in,Paragraph
only an inch and a half of ferro-cement.,Paragraph
The Exhibition Hall is an architectural and structural marvel of the postwar era. Its,Paragraph
means of construction bear witness to the power of invention in the act of building and to,Paragraph
the hidden potential in uniting the search for form with the measure of materials.,Paragraph

(1900),Title
The Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900 was meant by its sponsors to be both a,Paragraph
retrospective summation of the material progress of the 19th century and a hopeful,Paragraph
harbinger for the 20th. The 1900 event was the fifth Paris Exposition of the 19th century.,Paragraph
"Paris had hosted ever-larger events every 11 years since 1856, and expectations ran high",Paragraph
"for the greatest exposition ever in 1900. The 1889 Exposition Universelle, which had",Paragraph
"celebrated the centennial of the French Revolution, was France’s first truly international",Paragraph
"fair and had been an unqualified success, both intellectually and economically, despite a",Paragraph
shaky start. The 1900 Fair also had its share of initial uncertainties. The Dreyfus Affair,Paragraph
"threatened the Exposition with an international boycott, and the bitter of the winter of",Paragraph
"1889-1900 and heavy spring rains further complicated the project, so although the",Paragraph
"Exposition officially opened with great ceremony on 14 April, paying customers were not",Paragraph
admitted to the grounds for several more weeks.,Paragraph
The Exposition was laid out on several large precincts within Paris and in the Bois de,Paragraph
Vincennes east of the city (the latter being the site of the Games of the Second,Paragraph
"Olympiad). Despite the fact that the Commissioner General of the Exposition, Alfred",Paragraph
"Picard, had graduated from the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées in the 1860, the 1900",Paragraph
"Exposition did not have the large, showstopping engineering feats of 1889; French",Paragraph
"engineers concentrated their efforts in the construction of the Metro, notable for architect",Paragraph
"Hector Guimard’s Art Nouveau stations and Victor Laloux’s Gare d’Orsay, which carried",Paragraph
fair visitors from the provinces to the Exposition gates. The buildings and landscape,Paragraph
features of the Exposition were awarded to architects and engineers within the closed,Paragraph
circle of the French academies in the hope that the aesthetic presentation of the Fair,Paragraph
would be in uniform good taste. The result was less than hoped for. Although there was,Paragraph
"no single spectacular building, and there were several important permanent constructions",Paragraph
"that were very well received, the grounds were more noteworthy for the wide assortment",Paragraph
of temporary constructions that were aesthetically adventurous and even controversial.,Paragraph
"The permanent monuments for the capital city were the Pont Alexandre III, which",Paragraph
"leapt across the Seine in one graceful arch, and the Grand and Petit Palais. The bridge",Paragraph
continued the line of the newly established Esplanade des Invalides across the river past,Paragraph
"the two Palais to the Champs Elysées to the north. The Grand Palais, home to the",Paragraph
contemporary art exhibitions (whose content was completely controlled by the Academie,Paragraph
"des BeauxArts), was designed by the team of Henri Deglane, Albert Louvet, and",Paragraph
A.E.T.Thomas. The building hid behind Deglane’s imposing Neoclassical central,Paragraph
"pavilion and sweeping colonnades an enormous steel-and-glass atrium, which spanned",Paragraph
"the length of the building. Charles Girault’s Petit Palais, perhaps the architectural success",Paragraph

difficult transitions at the odd corners necessitated by the building’s trapezoidal plan and,Paragraph
yet reveled in the free-Baroque classicism then fashionable among the faculty at the,Paragraph
"Ecole des Beaux-Arts. The building’s primary motif, a high arched entry that cut into a",Paragraph
"low steel dome, was adopted by French-trained architects around the globe in the years",Paragraph
after the Exposition.,Paragraph
The temporary structures of the Exposition did not feature the restraint found in those,Paragraph
structures that were intended to be permanent. Although some of them were interesting in,Paragraph
"their adoption of past architectures to modern purposes, others were simply novel. The",Paragraph
"Palace of Electricity, the home of the Exposition’s dynamos and generators, terminated",Paragraph
the Champs-de-Mars to the south and presented the viewer with a riot of baroque,Paragraph
"architectural elements, none of which were particularly related to one another. The whole",Paragraph
"was crowned by an allegorical extravaganza that set Electra in ecstasy atop a chariot,",Paragraph
behind which rose a spiky steel-and-glass sunburst that if scaled down would be at home,Paragraph
"in any early-1960s rumpus room. The whole Palace, however, was nothing but a",Paragraph
"backdrop to the real feature of the site, the Chateau d’Eau, an immense waterfall 100 feet",Paragraph
wide that gushed water over its terraces at the rate of 1.5 million gallons an hour. The,Paragraph
"whole was lit at night with colored light, the fountains bubbling and water jets dancing in",Paragraph
a spectacle that was said to rival the fountains at Versailles.,Paragraph
The most controversial structure at the Exposition was probably René Binet’s Porte de,Paragraph
"Concorde. This strange, oversized gateway sheltered the ticket booths and check stations",Paragraph
"under a steel dome, which was supported by three yawning arches encrusted with floral",Paragraph
ornament. Two soaring minarets flanked the structure to further punctuate the work. The,Caption
"whole was studded with electric lights, so that the building shimmered with colored light",Paragraph
"at night. Although the architecture was not lauded for its novelty, true vitriol was",Paragraph
"reserved for crowning sculptural ornament, a 20-foot high statue of “The City of Paris,”",Paragraph
represented by a woman in revealing evening dress. Many Parisians were scandalized by,Paragraph
the statue’s lifelike flesh tones and immodest vestments and claimed that the statue more,Paragraph
truly represented the city’s prostitutes than the genteel women of Paris. Whatever the,Paragraph
"claims of her sartorial miscalculation, “La Parisienne” was a functional success—her",Paragraph
"ample gates welcomed as many as 60,000 guests an hour on the high féte days.",Paragraph
The 1900 Fair is perhaps most important architecturally for its national pavilions and,Paragraph
cultural presentations. Nations of the first rank were given large lots on the Quai des,Paragraph
"Nations, where an impressive, if riotous, melange of national styles were presented.",Paragraph
"Twenty-three nations constructed their own edifices, and all but one of these were",Paragraph
"evocations of particular nation’s architecture. Britain, for example, constructed a Tudor-",Paragraph
"style house, whereas Germany built a very large baroque city hall, and Italy fused the",Paragraph
Duomo at Siena with St. Mark’s at Venice to create a rather unnatural hybrid palazzo.,Paragraph
The one pavilion that did not denote its nation’s architectural traditions was that of the,Paragraph
"United States, where American architects designed a Beaux-Arts pavilion. Boasting a",Paragraph
"triumphal arch entry-porch and a high steel-andcopper-clad dome, the building resembled",Paragraph
a diluted version of Richard Morris Hunt’s Administration Building at the World’s,Paragraph
"Columbian Exposition of 1893. Of all the national pavilions, perhaps that with the most",Paragraph
"lasting importance to the history of architecture was Gesellius, Lindgren and Saarinen’s",Paragraph
"Finnish Pavilion. This work, located in the second rank of national pavilions behind the",Paragraph
"Quai des Nations, juxtaposed the fortresslike character of its exterior stone walls and high",Paragraph
"tower with the softer, more introspective feel of its great hall, which was trimmed and",Paragraph
roofed in native Finnish woods and ornamented with representations of the country’s,Paragraph
"native flowers and woodland creatures. A landmark in the National Romantic style, the",Paragraph
pavilion cemented Eliel Saarinen’s international reputation as an architect capable of,Paragraph
powerful yet sensitive work.,Paragraph
The colonial exhibitions at the grounds of the Palais du Trocadero were less culturally,Paragraph
"sensitive. Building on the ethnographic displays of the 1889 Exposition, the European",Paragraph
powers were encouraged to celebrate their colonial holdings with simulations of these,Paragraph
exotic locales. Natives of each land were brought to Paris to demonstrate folkways and,Paragraph
perform religious and dance ceremonies for the public within well-crafted evocations of,Paragraph
"their homes in what can only be described as a human zoo. Across the river, the grounds",Paragraph
in and around the Champs de Mars again hosted scientific and industrial exhibits. The,Paragraph
"Palais des Machines was again pressed into service for the Exhibition, but it was hardly",Paragraph
noticed among the sea of similar iron-and-glass structures in the precinct. The decorative,Paragraph
arts and light manufactures were displayed in pavilions along the Esplanade des,Paragraph
"Invalides. This implied a clear separation from the fine arts, located across the Pont",Paragraph
"Alexandre III, and the crafts. As a result, the works of masters such as Emile Gallé, Louis",Paragraph
"Comfort Tiffany, and René Lalique were not viewed either in the Grand Palais or in the",Paragraph
"national pavilions, but in their own small storefronts. In fact, despite the fact that the Fair",Paragraph
"would later be remembered as the event that popularized the Art Nouveau, only the",Paragraph
Austrians and Germans exhibited the new forms in their national presentations.,Paragraph
The twin objectives of the Exposition—the reflection on the past and the,Paragraph
foreshadowing of the future—were fulfilled admirably. The environmental design and art,Paragraph
designed and collected for the event summed up decades of 19th-century academic,Paragraph
"eclecticism as practiced in official French art institutions. At the same time, the industrial",Paragraph

believe that the ideals of universal brotherhood and economic prosperity were not only,Paragraph

respite from the that would lead Europe into the chaos of the First World War. Within a,Paragraph

EXPRESSIONISM,Title
The postimpressionist revolution in late 19th-century painting eventually brought the,Paragraph
"opposite of figurative representation, namely, Expressionism. If representation was no",Paragraph
"longer the main goal of art, the expression of one’s inner spiritual self offered itself as an",Paragraph
"alternative. In the first decade of the 20th century, this direction was taken primarily by",Paragraph
"German artists, most successfully by the two movements Der Blaue Reiter and Die",Paragraph
Briicke. Painters such as Wassily Kandinsky and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner used art to,Paragraph
express the soul and their emotional reactions to the modern era. Their paintings,Paragraph
"introduced a cryptic, abbreviated style to art. The origin of a design in the creator’s self",Paragraph
and a drawing technique that was not concerned with exact figural representation were,Paragraph
among the main impulses for Expressionist architecture.,Paragraph
"Centered primarily in Germany and the Netherlands, Expressionist architects, just like",Paragraph
"their mainstream International Style colleagues, tried above all to cope with the industrial",Paragraph
"age. However, like their namesakes in painting, they attempted to express this age instead",Paragraph
"of representing it. Apart from this artistic goal, Expressionist architecture also dealt with",Paragraph
"communal concepts. Immediately after World War I, the massive physical and human",Paragraph
destruction that had been caused by the first large-scale mechanical warfare engendered,Paragraph
an anti-industrial feeling. Industry had excelled in manufacturing death machines that,Paragraph
resulted in utter destruction. Such a common enemy brought forth thoughts about,Paragraph
"fraternization, community, and democracy. Especially in Germany, the postwar reality",Paragraph
was difficult to bear. The shock of having lost the war brought with it the feeling that an,Paragraph
era had passed and that it was time to orchestrate the rebirth of communal life and the,Paragraph
"arts. With its propagation of exactly such goals, Expressionism offered a feasible way to",Paragraph
cope with the problems of the early 1920s in Europe. Expressionism rejected the machine,Paragraph
"age as the foundation of artistic creation. In architecture, this came out as the opposition",Paragraph
"to design as conditioned only by utility, materials, construction, and economics. Instead,",Paragraph
Expressionism advocated that political and artistic revolution were the same by,Paragraph
transposing the social uprising into artistic activity.,Paragraph
"Apart from the origin in painting, immediate stylistic sources of Expressionism in",Paragraph
"architecture are found in Art Nouveau and other late 19th-century attempts at renewal,",Paragraph
"especially in the work of Hendrik Petrus Berlage, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Otto Wagner.",Paragraph
Art Nouveau (Jugendstil) was particularly favored because it had rejected industria,Paragraph
construction methods and displayed a rather romantic longing in its naturalistic,Paragraph
"decorative structures. However, Expressionist architects had quite an open attitude",Paragraph
toward the past. The styles in which all the arts had combined to produce decorated forms,Paragraph
were preferred sources for inspiration. From Egypt came the concepts of cave and tower.,Paragraph
Gothic architecture provided examples for the social and communal purposes of,Paragraph
architecture and showed the triumph of expression over function. Far Eastern architecture,Paragraph
was an important source because it combined architectural and sculptural forms and,Paragraph
because of the mystical doctrines that informed this architecture.,Paragraph
The particular mind-set of Expressionist architects was also influenced by literary and,Paragraph
"philosophical sources, found primarily in Nietzsche and Kierkegaard. From Nietzsche",Paragraph
"came the admonition to let primitive instincts, not conscious self-control, determine",Paragraph
"artistic creations, whereas Kierkegaard emphasized the psychological background for this",Paragraph
style in the spiritual searching and feeling of despair that were produced through the,Paragraph
material instability.,Paragraph
The most significant heritage of Expressionism is that it attempted to solve the,Paragraph
problems of the world through mainly symbolic architecture. Architects felt that they had,Paragraph
to act on behalf of society and believed that they had to force people to realize their,Paragraph
"happiness through building. In those years, the spiritual realm was very far removed from",Paragraph
reality. Expressionist architecture had a strong Utopian urge. It was the search for a new,Paragraph
"reality, a new sense of life, and a new ethics of humanity. Many of the projects are indeed",Paragraph
on a cosmic scale. This stemmed primarily from architects aiming to create their designs,Paragraph
directly from their own visions. They let their hands draw the designs automatically and,Paragraph
tried to exclude the mind from participating in the sketching. Their designs came out of,Paragraph
an uncontrollable inner necessity and an inner spiritual life. The architects felt themselves,Paragraph
"to be the instruments of an absolute, metaphysical will and saw their task as transforming",Paragraph
this spirit into reality. They wanted to achieve the direct transformation of consciousness,Paragraph
into pure activity and did not pay much consideration to the objects that resulted from,Paragraph
this. Theirs was an architecture that appealed to the intellect through feeling. With such,Paragraph
"practices, Expressionist architects found their modernity independently, unlike the",Paragraph
"International Style, which found its modernity through representation. Like the",Paragraph
"International Style, Expressionism avoided the literal imitation of traditional styles, but it",Paragraph
also focused on expressing ideas. The Expressionist conception of the building was that,Paragraph
of a total work of art that would present an aesthetic unity and thus become communal,Paragraph
"art. In this sense, architecture was spiritual.",Paragraph
"In terms of form, Expressionist architects had a preference for cavelike interiors and",Paragraph
"towerlike exteriors. Inside their buildings, one felt enveloped not by walls and ceiling but",Paragraph
"by an encompassing membrane. Interiors felt physically oppressing on the inhabitant,",Paragraph
"who had to use sight, touch, and other synesthetic senses to understand his or her",Paragraph
whereabouts. The theme of the cave was articulated in the exterior through a tectonic,Paragraph
treatment of the building surfaces. The tower shape was articulated mostly by fashioning,Paragraph
"buildings as crowns, be they in the city or on the top of mountains.",Paragraph
"In Germany, Paul Scheerbart instigated the preference for glass and crystals among",Paragraph
Expressionist architects. Scheerbart can best be described as one of the fathers of science,Paragraph
"fiction in Germany. Apart from providing technical information in his book (1914),",Paragraph
Scheerbart also promoted glass building for its generation of a new morality. Glass stood,Paragraph
"for brighter awareness, clearer determination, and utter gentleness. It represented the",Paragraph
search for light and higher truth—the clarification of the soul—and can generally serve as,Paragraph
a social catalyst. Glass buildings can function as shelter as well as extend garden,Paragraph
architecture. This transparent material forces the users to continually relate to their,Paragraph
"environment, both the natural and the cosmic one. Glass buildings resemble states of",Paragraph
"emotion and suggest infinite space. In its mineral form, as crystal, glass became a symbol",Paragraph
"for the new life. Thus, glass and crystal forms presented the milieu that would give birth",Paragraph
to the new culture.,Paragraph
"Many Expressionist architects gave glass a special role in their designs. Bruno Taut,",Paragraph
"the organizer and indefatigable theoretician of Expressionism, was particularly taken with",Paragraph
Scheerbart’s ideas. He accepted the purifying potential of glass and crystal in his designs.,Paragraph
These were especially notable in the Glass Pavilion he designed in 1914 for the glass,Paragraph
"industry at the Cologne Werkbund exhibition. There, Taut added a cosmological",Paragraph
component. Glass was used as the material that enabled the reconciliation of mind and,Paragraph
matter. The Glass Pavilion created primarily an experience for the user in the form of a,Paragraph
purification ritual. It was intended to introduce a lighter building method and high-light,Paragraph
the effects of glass to architecture. It is assembled from a centralized building with an,Paragraph
addition at the back. The pavilion consists of a geodesic dome on a concrete base. Prism,Caption
glass in reinforced-concrete frames was used for both the walls and the stair treads,Paragraph
leading up to the glass hall. This is covered by a crystal-shaped dome assembled from,Paragraph
reinforced-concrete ribs and colored-glass panels resting on prism glass. Visitors took a,Paragraph
predetermined path that ultimately led them to the cascade room on the lower level.,Paragraph
Water flowed down glass steps and terminated in a recess in which pictures from a,Paragraph
kaleidoscope were projected. The procession through this pavilion was characterized by,Paragraph
seductive anticipation and an increasingly intense experience of space. In Taut’s later,Paragraph
"(1919), glass was used on an increased scale by designing glass pavilions on",Paragraph
mountaintops.,Paragraph
"As such endeavors suggest, Expressionism was a romantic movement. It can rightfully",Paragraph
be criticized for not having been able to resist the seduction from formal aspects of,Paragraph
architecture at the expense of all other concerns. Many Expressionist designs look like,Paragraph
they are ready to depart. This notion of mobile architecture was aimed to symbolize,Paragraph
metamorphosis and transcendence. Taut’s early apartment buildings of the 1910s,Paragraph
"xemplify these goals. In these large structures, he attempted to engender a communal",Paragraph
"mpression through color and facade articulation. Similarly, Erich Mendelsohn’s early",Paragraph
etches express a dynamic feeling. These designs show forms that are derived from,Paragraph
tructure and the expression of the purpose of the building. They are rather abstract,Paragraph
"enderings of these intentions. The essence of the projects is artistic, not architectural, as",Paragraph
hey are not primarily meant to be realized. Mendelsohn wanted to formulate a new style,Paragraph
ased on industrial forms and materials. The gesture of drawing coincides with,Paragraph
"erodynamic lines, producing a formal expression of “industrial” energy. Following the",Paragraph
ontour of a form with one’s eyes is the only thing needed to understand the design. In,Paragraph
"is Einstem Tower (1924) in Potsdam, Germany he attempted to represent energy",Paragraph
hrough mass. The form of the tower wants to show the movement that is immanent in,Paragraph
"he building mass. Thus, there is a melding of technical function and monumentality. The",Paragraph
"building implies the potential to leap forward, as if it contained energy.",Paragraph
Concerns with materials and meaning produced other variations. Fritz Héger’s Chile,Paragraph
"House (1923) in Hamburg, for example, was a speculative office building in the tradition",Paragraph
of the Hamburg Kontorhaus (commercial office building). The structure is a frame built,Paragraph
"entirely of brick. Thus, it became a counterpart to the other Expressionist material: glass.",Paragraph
Brick alluded to a craft tradition and was better suited to Hamburg’s damp climate. The,Paragraph
"bricks were vitrified. In its form, the Chile House evokes the image of a ship. Its sharp",Paragraph
"corners parallel the crystalline forms of other Expressionist architects. In general, the",Paragraph
"form alludes to many images, such as a fish or a flag.",Paragraph
A group of younger architects formed the Crystal Chain under Taut’s leadership. This,Paragraph
was mostly a group of solitary criers in the wilderness of the industrial world who formed,Paragraph
a magic circle of mystery among themselves. Most of the members shared the wish for,Paragraph
large-scale buildings that would bring all the arts together. The letters they wrote to one,Paragraph
"another document their attempts to go back to the roots, the origins, of creative",Paragraph
"architectural activity. Among the most charismatic members was Hermann Finsterlin,",Paragraph
who had studied natural sciences and considered himself to be the Darwin of architecture.,Paragraph
"His conception of architecture was almost biological, dealing primarily with form and",Paragraph
"showing an evolution that dealt with biological urges and species, not with style.",Paragraph
"Similarly, he considered his visionary designs to be natural living organisms assembled",Paragraph
from basic shapes. His sketches show strong anthropomorphic similarities.,Paragraph
"In Dutch Expressionism, designing was seen primarily as an individual struggle of the",Paragraph
architect’s vision against materials and the construction reality. Unlike the ideological,Paragraph
oa ae o,Title
roege,Title
"emphasis of German Expressionism, the Dutch School’s buildings are characterized by a",Paragraph
tendency toward composition and construction. Their architecture is distinguished by an,Paragraph
emphasis on the plastic force of the building form. Buildings were designed and,Paragraph
constructed according to the principles of organic growth found in nature. This was an,Paragraph
"architecture that looked like sculpture, in which materials were molded to enclose space.",Paragraph
"The architects used hand-formed bricks and tiles in various colors and shaped chimneys,",Paragraph
"balconies, towers, and ornamentation as sculptural additions to the building form. In this",Paragraph
"manner, purely functional parts were transfigured into symbolic aspects expressing the",Paragraph
joy of everyday life. This merger between architecture and sculpture successfully,Paragraph
expressed the imner aspirations of the architect and his clients. Building outlines are,Paragraph
simple and firm and articulated in sinuous rhythms. This allowed architects to display,Paragraph
emotion in their designs by endowing the building materials with their spirit and gave,Paragraph
their buildings a unique character that allowed the inhabitants to identify with their,Paragraph
homes. Architecture as art could be created only through an inward struggle. Through all,Paragraph
"of this, the architects expressed the essential character of society as a communal whole.",Paragraph
"In their buildings, architects tried to anticipate a better future, which also reflected a",Paragraph
nostalgic longing for the social fabric symbolized in medieval architecture.,Paragraph
"Consequently, most Dutch Expressionist work is found in the area of communal, low-",Paragraph
income workers’ housing. Michel de Klerk and Piet Kramer attempted to renew the,Paragraph
existing Dutch communal housing traditions rather than inventing something completely,Paragraph
novel. They generally used traditional materials and construction systems rather than the,Paragraph
new industrial materials and structures. De Klerk’s buildings excel at making,Paragraph
"conventional forms more piquant, primarily by presenting truncated shapes. He linked the",Paragraph
individual elements and units of his forms in a dynamic manner. Masses rise and fall,Paragraph
"rhythmically, and large wall expanses are broken by terraces. His Eigen Haard Housing",Paragraph
Estate (1913-21) in Amsterdam is a masterpiece in sculptural modeling. De Klerk,Paragraph
"wanted to make people happy through forms. Here, he created a fantastic environment.",Paragraph
"The overall forms follow closely the requirements of urban architecture—namely, those",Paragraph
of articulating the traffic flow of the street—whereas individual details and facade,Paragraph
articulations are Expressionist. There are many references to the sea and the nautical,Paragraph
world in the forms and facades. Tile work and polychromatic brickwork are used to,Paragraph
provide these impressions. Cylindrical forms further emphasize the corners of the,Paragraph
buildings and are used to articulate communal entrances. Tower forms are also meant to,Paragraph
express the village nature of this estate. The entire building complex and its details allude,Paragraph
"hypothetically to remnants from past, medieval cultures.",Paragraph
Rudolf Steiner represents the theosophical wing of Expressionism. His work may also,Paragraph
serve as an example for the innovative use of new materials of this movement. In his,Paragraph
"Goetheanum (1927) in Dornach, he exploited reinforced concrete to achieve an",Paragraph
imaginative shape. This produced a unique design that has no sources or progeny. Its,Paragraph
form and details repeat a basic motif that Steiner had determined at the outset of the,Paragraph
design. Nothing in the building exists in isolation: every part and detail strives toward the,Paragraph
next one. Steiner’s purpose was simply to find the way to the spirit through architecture.,Paragraph
"In this, he also showcases the mood of ideological and religious awakening of",Paragraph
Expressionism. He was above all interested in alluding to the spiritual states that loom,Paragraph
"behind physical reality. For him, architecture was the medium that stimulates forms of",Paragraph
thought that lead to spiritual rejuvenation.,Paragraph
"With the German economic recovery of 1923, Expressionism ceded to a more sober,",Paragraph
pragmatic approach to architecture. Constructing cheaply and abundantly became more,Paragraph
"pressing needs than spiritual rejuvenation. In Amsterdam, for example, architects were",Paragraph
forced to use prefabricated building elements to reduce construction costs. A craft-,Paragraph
"oriented look was replaced by industrial forms, and individualistic designs lost out",Paragraph
"against the representation of a sober objectivity. Ultimately, the International Style",Paragraph
mainstream prevailed. Expressionist architecture was given a bad reputation as the,Paragraph
scapegoat for the adverse political reality in Germany after 1933. Siegfried Giedion,Caption
"denigrated its designs as “Faustian outbursts against an inimical world,” “fairy castles to",Paragraph
"stand on the peak of Monte Rosa,” or “concrete towers as flaccid as jellyfish.” The early",Paragraph
chroniclers of the International Style accused it of having reversed the push for a new,Paragraph
architecture that the signs of the year 1914 announced. These evaluations continued the,Paragraph
"denunciation of Expressionism at the 1937 “Degenerate Art” exhibition in Munich,",Paragraph
organized by the National Socialists. It was this event that prompted Marxist critics to,Paragraph
proclaim that the same forces that had led to Expressionism also had led to Fascism.,Paragraph
Expressionism was not even accepted as a style; it was accorded value only as the,Paragraph
manifestation of the revolutionary fervor that existed in Germany after World War I.,Paragraph
Although the movement was credited with tearing down the cultural heritage of the 19th,Paragraph
"century, it was accepted only as a synonym for opposition and lost out against the",Paragraph
International Style.,Paragraph
The view of Expressionism as simply a revolt has in the meantime ceded to one that,Paragraph
appreciates it as a style favoring personal creative liberty over the scientific rationality of,Paragraph
"the International Style. Beginning in the 1950s with the Englishman Reyner Banham,",Paragraph
"architectural critics began to reevaluate functionalism. Ultimately, this development",Paragraph
resulted in the postmodern dismissal of the International Style. It was also felt that,Paragraph
"Expressionism could not satisfactorily be dealt with from only a purely formal, stylistic",Paragraph
perspective. Expressionism is instead seen as a broad cultural phenomenon that,Paragraph
encompassed a variety of artistic methods. Concurrent with this scholarly reevaluation,Paragraph
came a resurgence of typically Expressionist forms in architecture. Acclaimed,Paragraph
"modernists, such as Le Corbusier and Alvar Aalto, created designs in which human",Paragraph
activity and existence were seen as the central architectural metaphors. Architects such as,Paragraph
Eero Saarinen and Jorn Utzon spearheaded the neo-Expressionist movement. The,Paragraph
material innovations that were produced in the American war industry finally allowed,Paragraph
architects to build expressive formal fantasies. Eero Saarinen’s TWA Terminal (1962) at,Paragraph
Kennedy Airport in New York and Utzon’s Opera House (1973) in Sydney testify to this,Paragraph
"situation. Original Expressionists, such as Hans Scharoun and Mendelsohn, realized their",Paragraph
earlier visions in such designs as the Philharmonic Hall (1963) in Berlin and Park,Paragraph
Synagogue (1953) in Cleveland. Another significant part of neo-Expressionism is,Paragraph
"centered around the Waldorf Schools, which had been founded by Rudolf Steiner and",Paragraph
"which continue to imbue its school buildings, especially in England, with values identical",Paragraph
to those that informed Steiner’s Goetheanum.,Paragraph

"Delaware, and Michigan, leading him to establish a second office in New York City.",Paragraph
In 1912 he joined the firm of Gilbert McIlvaine (1880-1939) as a principal designer.,Paragraph

FACTORY,Title
The history of the factory as a building type in the 20th century parallels that of,Paragraph
"architecture in general. However, as a new typology, it has had a fluctuating status in the",Paragraph
profession between that of “building” and that of “architecture.” For early modern,Paragraph
"architects, the factory became the epitome of modernism both as a building type that",Paragraph
signified the modern era and in the technological innovations that were necessary to,Paragraph
create these buildings for the production of goods. This was the building type in which,Paragraph
form truly necessitated following function because the buildings are directed by the,Paragraph
"manufacturing processes inside, from automobiles to wartime machinery and computers.",Paragraph
The increasing dominance and changes in methodologies for mass production influenced,Paragraph
the spatial and structural needs of the factories. These developments were translated into,Paragraph
"innovations in building technologies with new uses for reinforced concrete, steel, large",Paragraph
"glass and metal curtain walls, open floor space, lightweight suspension systems, tent",Caption
"structures, and prefabricated kits of parts.",Paragraph
"In terms of form, early 20th-century factories sustained the look of the previous",Paragraph
century’s multistory buildings as a result of the high cost of land that was often near the,Paragraph
"water’s edge for easy shipping of products. In addition, before the advent of the conveyor",Paragraph
"belt, moving goods vertically by cranes and gravity was still easier than pulling them",Paragraph
horizontally. This is seen in the multistory factory that Albert Kahn designed for Henry,Paragraph
"Ford in Highland Park near Detroit in 1909, a factory that then influenced Giaccomo",Paragraph
"Matte-Trucco’s design of the Lingotto Fiat Factory in Turin, Italy, in 1913.",Paragraph
"Advances in the strength of concrete influenced factory design, such as in the Larkin",Paragraph
"Plant (1907) in Buffalo, New York, built over 10 years by R.J.Reidpath & Son. This",Paragraph
factory could withstand larger window spans to increase natural light in the building,Paragraph
compared with 19th-century brick-pier construction with small windows. Concrete,Paragraph
"improved fireproofing and allowed for faster construction, especially when it could be",Paragraph
prefabricated in pieces. Engineers played extremely important roles in the development,Paragraph
"of new building systems for factories, such as Ernest Ransome’s reinforced-concrete",Paragraph
"system, the Ransome Bar. Ransome simplified the systems of the French engineer",Paragraph
Francois Hennebique so that the floor slab continued to the face of the building and,Paragraph
"became a stringcourse, with vertical pieces forming lintels and sills. Precast structural",Paragraph
wall units could be set in place and then cast as the floor in an early prefabricated system,Paragraph
"with in-fill in brick. Later, prefabricated systems were developed in concrete, metals, and",Paragraph
"glass curtain wall systems, emphasizing the use of the factory building as a testing",Paragraph
ground for new technologies.,Paragraph
In Berlin Peter Behrens designed the AEG Turbine Factory (1908-09) with Mies van,Paragraph
der Rohe and developed a new curtain wall system of glass and steel that allowed light,Paragraph
"into the vast open space. Unusual at the time, the steel pier is exposed and the skeleton",Paragraph
"revealed, creating a monumentality and a heroic metaphor for industry. The recessed",Paragraph
glass facade influenced the later curtain wall systems.,Paragraph
Factories were experimental not only in terms of structure and form but also in terms,Paragraph
"of the management of the workers inside. Ford, who adopted the ideas of Frederick",Paragraph
"Taylor on employee performance, believed that by providing a decent workplace,",Paragraph
"workers would be more productive. Paternalistic in his attitude, Ford desired light and air",Paragraph
"in the factories, encouraging Albert Kahn to use skylight monitors for daylighting.",Paragraph
"Throughout the Great Depression, Ford influenced other factory owners to consider the",Paragraph
well-being of the workers because it affected their morale. Ford eventually paid workers,Paragraph
"well enough for them to be able to afford his own product, which gave rise to a working",Paragraph
class with expendable income.,Paragraph
These American industrial buildings and the work of Behrens influenced the designs,Paragraph
"of numerous European modern architects of the early 1920s and 1930s, such as Le",Paragraph
"Corbusier, Gropius, and Mendelsohn. Walter Gropius, with Hannes Meyer, designed a",Caption
"new building in 1913 for the Fagus Shoe Last company in Alfeld an-der-Liene, Germany.",Caption
"The primary feature, the glazed workshop block, was a departure from the heavier, piered",Paragraph
structures and was based on the Bauhaus ideology in its lightness and transparency.,Paragraph
"During World War II, Kahn and others designed primarily factories with one story,",Paragraph
"which had many advantages. They were faster to build, distributed power horizontally,",Paragraph
and allowed more light into the building. The one-story shed-type building allowed for,Paragraph
larger machines and more flexible and open floor plans for the new horizontal assembly-,Paragraph
"line production, which could then be shifted easily to the truck- and train-based",Paragraph
"transportation systems, with train lines running close to or even through a manufacturing",Paragraph
plant.,Paragraph
The placement of the administration buildings was also a focus in the layout of a,Paragraph

"The 20th century witnessed the sublevation of industrial town planning, the culmination",Paragraph

"the industrial revolution that propelled modern planning and development, creating a",Paragraph

"Before Parker and Unwin planned the garden city of Letchworth, England, for",Paragraph

"town owed its existence to the business enterprise, whether extractive or manufacturing,",Paragraph
"and was subordinate to the mine, mill, or factory, which could occupy a prominent site—",Paragraph
"sometimes the center of town. The garden city, on the other hand, put community first",Paragraph
"and then hoped to attract industry, and that industry was usually relegated to a peripheral",Paragraph
site. True garden cities were tenant associations of joint stockholders who were,Paragraph
"prohibited from engaging in property speculation. In the factory town, the business",Paragraph
"enterprise was the landlord, and where housing was sold it usually was financed by the",Paragraph
"enterprise or one of its subsidiaries. In most instances, however, the housing was",Paragraph

FAGUS WERK,Title
"Designed by Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer; completed 1911, with subsequent",Paragraph
"expansions Alfeld-an-der-Leine, Germany",Caption
"In 1910 spurred on by a dare from his former employer, Behrens Hannoverian Carl",Paragraph
Benscheidt had visions of opening a competing shoe factory. After he secured a site just,Paragraph
"across the road from his former workplace in Alfeld, Germany (but with better rail access",Paragraph
"and three hectares to build on), Benscheidt founded Fagus GmbH in March 1911 and",Paragraph
approached the Hannover architect Eduard Werner (1847-1923) to design his new,Paragraph
factory. Not only had Werner designed the plans for the Behrens factory in 1897 (which,Paragraph
"was three times larger than Fagus would be), but he had the invaluable experience of",Paragraph
knowing the calculations and work involved in building a shoe last factory. In Werner’s,Paragraph
"plan, the Fagus complex would amount to a row of brick buildings (or half timbered in",Paragraph
"the case of the warehouses), all with different functions along the production line. With",Paragraph
"the exception of the administrative rooms, the production houses were fairly utilitarian in",Paragraph
nature. Benscheidt had already expressed his dissatisfaction with this aspect of Werner’s,Paragraph
"slightly Gothic design, and in 1911, he commissioned Walter Gropius (1883-1969) and",Paragraph
Adolf Meyer (1881-1929) to redesign the facades of the entire complex. Gropius had,Paragraph
done some exemplary work for the AEG Motor Company years before in Berlin while,Paragraph
"under the tutelage of architect Peter Behrens, and the buildings there had not only set new",Paragraph
"standards in factory design—practically making them works of art—but, in keeping with",Paragraph
"the time, had also created architecture as advertisement. It was decided that Werner",Paragraph
would remain in charge of the project as a whole and in charge of the interior spaces and,Paragraph
"“outfitting of the buildings.” However, it is the influence of Gropius and Meyer that gives",Paragraph
meaning to a contemporary understanding of the Fagus Werk. Gropius viewed this,Paragraph
opportunity in Alfeld as the perfect collaboration between industry and the arts—the,Paragraph
primary aim of the Deutscher Werkbund—and it would turn into a long-term project that,Paragraph
would occupy Gropius and Meyer until the end of their partnership in 1925. Because of,Paragraph
"Gropius’s media presence during the building of Fagus, his adopted leadership of the",Paragraph
"building program, and his frequent writings within the Werkbund on the Fagus Werk, he",Paragraph
"is often credited solely with the design of the factory; indeed, it has been difficult to trace",Paragraph
"exactly what Meyer’s contributions were. However, Meyer considered the",Paragraph
conceptualization of the factory a truly collaborative effort and kept a personal archive of,Paragraph
drawings throughout the life of the project.,Paragraph
"In the spring of 1911, Gropius and Meyer submitted their plans for the complex; these",Paragraph
"deviated from Werner’s in the positioning of the different buildings, creating courtyard",Paragraph
space rather than the static row of structures proposed in the Werner plan. Their plan,Paragraph
"gave the building a much broader exposure toward Hannover and, thus, to the trains that",Paragraph
"frequently passed the factory’s property. Benscheidt never agreed to this plan, and the",Paragraph
"building was executed with its facade in a competitive stance toward Behrens’s, as",Paragraph
originally conceived. The pair ended up making few changes to the original Werner plan,Paragraph
and retained the overall layout of the factory complex.,Paragraph
"However, they succeeded in carrying out a more unified scheme through their use of",Paragraph
"materials and color. All Fagus buildings, for example, have a 40-centimeter-high purple-",Paragraph
black brick base that projects from the facade by four centimeters and seems to allow the,Paragraph
yellow-bricked rising walls of the building to float; windows in all the buildings appear to,Paragraph
"be cutouts from the cubical structures that contain them, although the window shapes and",Paragraph
sizes differ from building to building. Perhaps the most daring design feature of the,Paragraph
Fagus Werk—and the one that makes the building so significant and recognizable—is the,Paragraph
"vertical bands of windows that wrap around the main building, creating the illusion of a",Paragraph
"floating curtain wall. It was presumed that to accomplish this, the architects would have",Paragraph
"to employ some new construction technology, when in fact the frame construction was",Paragraph
based entirely on Werner’s original projections of a brickwork building with an iron,Paragraph
ceiling beam. A staircase on the clear-span side of the building acts like a stabilizing,Paragraph
column to the glass-clad structure. Buildings in the Fagus complex—other than the,Paragraph
"famous, often photographed main office building—included the production hall, sawmill,",Paragraph
"warehouse, and punch-knife department. All these buildings were visually unified with",Paragraph
"their yellow brick, terra-cotta roof tiles, gray-slate roofs and glazing, and black bases.",Paragraph
The interiors of the public spaces of the office structure and the production hall were,Paragraph
planned by Gropius and Meyer down to the smallest details. The waiting room exuded,Paragraph
"order, lightness, and success; glass panes offered views of the main offices from the",Paragraph
"waiting rooms, which were friendly and informal. The architects designed dust-free work",Paragraph
conditions and placed the machines in sequence with the production process in a light-,Paragraph
"filled work environment. The design offered employees a commissary, washrooms,",Paragraph
"lockers, and later, housing.",Paragraph
"An expansion to the Fagus Werk, led by Gropius and Meyer, began in 1913. Additions",Paragraph
"were attached to existing structures, and the main building and production hall were",Paragraph
"enlarged, the latter to three times its original size. Although hardly a challenging job for",Paragraph
"the architects, the expansion allowed them to suggest the application of a glazed facade to",Paragraph
the production hall and the punch-knife department. This permitted them to provide a,Paragraph
"unified appearance to the entire complex. During World War I, the work progressed",Paragraph
"slowly as Gropius enlisted and Meyer took a job with a steel company. However,",Paragraph
"Benscheidt continued to make plans for the expansion, and drawings continued to be",Paragraph
"made. In 1915 some construction was allowed to commence, and the dominant",Paragraph
characteristic of all Fagus buildings emerged: the floor-to-ceiling glazed and enclosed,Paragraph

months passed without any drawings or other evidence that Wright was working on the,Paragraph

up the design in the two hours that it took Kaufmann to drive from Milwaukee to Spring,Paragraph
Green on a Sunday morning in September 1935.,Paragraph
Wright’s design is first and foremost a brilliant piece of site planning. Kaufmann had,Paragraph
"expected the house to be built to the south of the stream, looking north to the waterfall.",Paragraph
"However, Wright sited the house to the north of the stream, above the waterfall, so that",Paragraph
"the house opens to the south sun. As a result, it is the sound of the waterfall, not the view",Paragraph
"of it, that permeates the experience of Fallingwater. Fallingwater is also the greatest",Paragraph
example of Wright’s capacity to draw the spaces and forms of his architecture out of the,Paragraph
very ground on which it is built. The house is anchored to the earth by vertical piers of,Paragraph
"sandstone quarried 500 feet from the waterfall, the stones set to resemble the natural",Paragraph
strata of the rock exposed along the streambed. The floors of the house are constructed of,Paragraph
broad horizontal cantilevered reinforced concrete slabs that appear to float effortlessly,Paragraph
"over the stream, for the structural beams are hidden between the flagstone floors and",Paragraph
"plastered ceilings. As a result of these two complementary systems of construction,",Paragraph
Fallingwater is anchored to the ground by the stone piers even as its spaces float along,Paragraph
with the motion of the stream.,Paragraph
"The spaces within Fallingwater are at once surprisingly small, with only 2,885 square",Paragraph
"feet of enclosed space, and incredibly generous, opening in three directions to the east,",Paragraph
"south, and west onto large exterior terraces that almost double the floor area of the house.",Paragraph
"Glazing, set in red-painted steel frames, runs in continuous bands around three sides of",Paragraph
"the main living and dining room, opening at the corners in celebration of the spatial",Paragraph
freedom given by the cantilevered structure. Wright detailed the house so as to reinforce,Paragraph
"the integration of interior and exterior space, creating delightful moments such as the",Paragraph
glass that runs right into the stone wall without any vertical framing at the kitchen and,Paragraph
small bedrooms and the flagstones that are set into the floor of the living room so that,Paragraph
they appear to continue unbroken beneath the glass doors and out onto the terrace,Paragraph
overlooking the waterfall.,Paragraph
Perhaps the most poetic moment in this most natural house is the “hatch” that Wright,Paragraph
"designed at the east side of the living room, whose glass doors may be opened to give",Caption
access to a suspended concrete stair leading down to the stream below. Descending these,Paragraph
"stairs, we pass through the stone floor to find light stairs floating over water, in which is",Paragraph
"reflected the sky, the roar of the waterfall behind us reverberating off the enormous",Paragraph
"concrete slab overhead. In the living room, the dark gray color of the bedrock ledge under",Paragraph
the shallow water and the way in which the light is reflected from the rippling surface of,Paragraph
the stream are matched exactly by the waxed gray flagstone floor on which we stand. The,Paragraph
"fireplace in the opposite corner, a half-cylinder stone cavity running from floor to ceiling,",Caption
"built directly into the sandstone wall, has as its hearth the original boulder of the site, on",Paragraph
"which the Kaufmann family formerly took picnic meals. This boulder, left unwaxed, rises",Paragraph
above the waxed flagstone floor like the dry top of a stone emerging above the water of,Paragraph
the stream.,Paragraph
"In Fallingwater, Wright captured the perfect essence of our desire to commune with",Paragraph
"nature, to dwell in a forested place, and to be at home in the natural world. Fallingwater is",Paragraph
"often considered Wright’s greatest work, for he was first and foremost an architect of the",Paragraph
American house. In its startling integration of ancient stone walls anchored to the bedrock,Paragraph

FALLOUT SHELTER,Title
The fallout shelter was a highly specialized building type developed in the 1950s in,Paragraph
response to the escalating Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet,Paragraph
Union. Faced with the realization that conventional structures would provide little or no,Paragraph
"protection from an atomic blast, civil defense officials in the United States undertook a",Paragraph
concerted campaign to convince the American public of the necessity of building fallout,Paragraph
shelters in their houses and backyards. In addition to these personal shelters constructed,Paragraph
"of brick, concrete block, or corrugated metal, efforts were undertaken to identify",Paragraph
sufficiently reinforced and structurally sound areas of existing buildings to designate as,Paragraph
larger-scale public fallout shelters. Construction of personal fallout shelters peaked,Paragraph
"between 1958 and 1962, when a series of international crises pushed the world ever",Paragraph
closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation. During this period the fallout shelter became,Paragraph
an integral part of U.S. nuclear policy and was extensively promoted in the popular media,Paragraph
as a viable solution to surviving and even winning a nuclear war. Although relatively few,Paragraph
"people actually built the structure, the fallout shelter was emblematic of the way",Paragraph
Americans chose to confront the atomic bomb and nuclear policy.,Paragraph
The first attempts to develop reinforced structures to protect inhabitants from an,Paragraph
atomic blast grew out of air raid shelter design from the World War II era. Although,Paragraph
"these shelters offered a degree of security against conventional weaponry, the atomic",Paragraph
detonations over Hiroshima and Nagasaki underscored their futility in an age of atomic,Paragraph
"weaponry. In the early 1950s, the knowledge that the USSR possessed atomic weapons,",Paragraph
"combined with the American intervention in Korea, led many architects, engineers, and",Paragraph
civil defense officials to contemplate the design of atomic bomb-resistant structures.,Paragraph
These early studies concentrated primarily on the obvious physical effects of an atomic,Paragraph
"explosion, which could extend several miles from ground zero, and underscored the",Paragraph
"expense of designing sufficiently reinforced structures. However, it was the discovery of",Paragraph
radioactive fallout in the mid-1950s that provided the impetus for effective shelter design.,Paragraph
"Far more lethal than the physical destruction accompanying a blast, fallout consisted of",Paragraph
irradiated particles of dust and debris carried aloft by the explosion and dispersed,Paragraph
hundreds and even thousands of miles downwind. With the realization that vast areas of,Paragraph
"the country could be covered under a blanket of radioactive particles, civil defense",Paragraph
"officials acknowledged that although those nearest a blast would be vaporized,",Paragraph
sufficiently prepared citizens could safely wait out the decay of fallout in cozy backyard,Paragraph
shelters.,Paragraph

USSR’s launch of in 1957 Americans were increasingly ready to accept the idea of a,Paragraph
"fallout shelter. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, a number of companies offered a",Paragraph
variety of prefabricated shelter designs. With the publication of by the Office of Civil,Paragraph
"Defense and Mobilization (OCDM) in 1959, the U.S. government articulated a",Paragraph
comprehensive plan for civil defense based on the construction of small-scale single-,Paragraph
family fallout shelters. The plans presented in the brochure were frequently republished,Paragraph
"in the popular media, outlining the essential components of a successful shelter design",Paragraph
while providing relatively inexpensive plans for shelter construction.,Paragraph
The fallout shelter plans provided by the OCDM fell into two main categories: those,Paragraph
that could be constructed within an existing basement and those separate from the main,Paragraph
house. Suitable shelter materials ranged from brick and concrete block to large sections,Paragraph
"of corrugated metal buried under several feet of earth. Regardless of its intended location,",Paragraph
a shelter had to be designed to fulfill the following three criteria: it had to be constructed,Paragraph
of dense enough materials or buried deep enough to block out as much radiation as,Paragraph
possible; it had to provide some means of filtered ventilation to avoid the intake of,Paragraph
radioactive particles; and it had to be comfortable and well stocked enough for a family,Paragraph
"to remain inside for several days or weeks. Architecturally, these criteria were met by",Paragraph
"solid materials, airtight construction, a baffle entrance with a tight-sealing door, and",Paragraph
"multiuse interior space that was comfortable enough for a family to eat, sleep, and",Paragraph
entertain one another.,Paragraph
"Beyond the accommodation of these basic concerns, the actual design of fallout",Paragraph
shelters was relatively unremarkable. Besides the telltale hump in the otherwise flat,Paragraph
"Bermuda grass of suburbia, most shelters did not have a distinct exterior presence. The",Paragraph
interior of the shelter focused on fulfilling its unique functional considerations as,Paragraph
efficiently as possible. Several popular magazines did present images of shelters,Paragraph
converted into clubhouses and playrooms or painted with imaginative scenes in an,Paragraph
attempt to make the idea of building a shelter more palatable to the general public.,Paragraph
Although the single-family fallout shelter remained the most visible part of the civil,Paragraph
"defense initiatives of the 1950s and 1960s, some policymakers argued unsuccessfully for",Paragraph
"the construction of massive community-based shelters. However, more successful was",Paragraph
the program initiated in the early 1960s that was designed to identify and designate,Paragraph
sufficiently protected spaces as public fallout shelters. Despite persistent attempts by civil,Paragraph
defense officials to convince large segments of the population to construct their own,Paragraph
"fallout shelters, scarcely 200,000 shelters were built or purchased by 1963. Even as the",Paragraph
"interest in shelter building peaked during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, a public",Paragraph
debate began to rage over the efficacy and moral implications of shelter building. New,Paragraph
discoveries suggested that people would have to remain in shelters for years before,Paragraph
"radioactivity would drop to safe levels, and many debated the morality of what they saw",Paragraph
as the vigilante mentality of shelter builders. The final blow to fallout shelter design came,Paragraph
"with the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963, which effectively pushed nuclear testing",Paragraph
underground and out of sight.,Paragraph
"Although most family fallout shelters now lie neglected in suburban backyards, others",Paragraph
"have found life as storm shelters, storage rooms, and even wine cellars. The late 1990s",Paragraph
saw a limited resurgence of interest in fallout shelter design as some attempted to prepare,Paragraph
for the possibility of civil unrest accompanying the year-2000 computer bug.,Paragraph

FARNSWORTH HOUSE,Title
"Designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, completed 1951",Caption
"Piano, Illinois",Caption
"Commissioned in 1945 and finished in 1951, the Farnsworth House is generally",Paragraph
regarded as one of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s most elegantly conceived and precisely,Paragraph
"constructed buildings, easily the finest residence he put up in his later, American career.",Paragraph
"Among his completed house designs, only the Tugendhat House (1930) in Brno, which",Paragraph
"dates from his years in Germany, is considered comparable in quality.",Paragraph
The most striking feature of the Farnsworth House is its outer aspect. The walls,Paragraph
consist of floor-to-ceiling glass mounted behind a simple frame made up of eight steel,Paragraph
"wide-flange piers, four to a side, that support a roof slab and a floor slab, the latter raised",Paragraph
"some five feet above the ground. The plan is rectangular, with the axis running east and",Paragraph
west and the interior giving on to a deck on the west. Symmetry is qualified by a terrace,Paragraph
"located next to the main structure along the western edge of the south, or front, elevation.",Paragraph
The house surveys a lawn that extends 50 yards to the north bank of the Fox River. A,Paragraph
"short flight of cantilevered steps provides access from the ground to the terrace, whereon",Paragraph
"a second flight, parallel to the first, rises to the deck. At that point, the visitor turns right",Paragraph
to enter the double-door portal. All steel components of the house have been sandblasted,Paragraph
and painted white.,Paragraph
Much of this description seems a reasonable confirmation of Mies’ reputation as a,Paragraph
"classicist, although his inclination to deviate from that classification is apparent in the",Paragraph
asymmetrical position of the terrace and in the subtlety—which has escaped the attention,Paragraph
of many—of locating the portal closer to the south wall than to the north.,Paragraph
Mies’ reason for the latter device stems from his layout of the unpartitioned interior.,Paragraph
"The single volumetric element is a core that contains two bathrooms, the kitchen",Paragraph
"facilities, and a tightly packed space through which all utilities descend via a cylindrical",Paragraph
"tube to the ground. Since the core has been deflected slightly to the northeast, the",Paragraph
"surrounding space is implicitly divided by varying sizes: the largest, a parlorlike area,",Paragraph
"with a fireplace, to the south (overlooking the river); a smaller, dining area to the west; a",Paragraph
"long, narrow kitchen to the north; and a sleeping area to the east. By placing the portal",Caption
"slightly closer to the south, the visitor on entry is likely to concentrate his attention on the",Paragraph
"living area, while the dining area appears to gain more space for itself. The principal",Paragraph
"articles of furniture now in place were designed by Mies, although with the exception of a",Paragraph
"large teak storage cabinet done specifically for the house, they are reproductions dating",Paragraph
from his German years. The floor is heated by radiation facilitated by a small forced-air,Paragraph
"furnace in the utility space. The house is now air conditioned, although originally the",Paragraph
only ventilation was provided by opening the entry door and/ or a pair of hopper,Paragraph
"windows on the opposite, or east, elevation.",Caption
Such a summary should suffice to suggest the reductivist simplicity of the design.,Paragraph
"Words, however, do not convey the certainty of the proportions and the excellence of the",Paragraph
"materials, most notably the travertine floors and the prima-vera wood cladding the core.",Paragraph
One of Mies’ most impressive effects is gained by his decision to raise the structure,Paragraph
above the ground. While the functional purpose of that move was to protect the house,Paragraph
"from the floods that occur regularly along the river, the elevated height simultaneously",Paragraph
"and indivisibly accomplishes an aesthetic end, leaving the house—especially in view of",Paragraph
the transparency of its window walls and the whiteness of its framing members—in a,Paragraph
seeming state of levitation.,Paragraph
"The house exerted an impact on Mies’ later work and on the larger,",Paragraph

"other, preoccupied Mies throughout his post-World War II career. In addition, it attracted",Paragraph
"a huge amount of attention from critics and designers alike, some of it negative—",Paragraph
especially from observers who found the very idea of a steel-framed glass house a,Paragraph
grievous departure from traditional concepts of domesticity—but most of it,Paragraph
"enthusiastically affirmative. Philip Johnson, long an admirer of Mies, offered up the",Paragraph
ultimate compliment by fashioning his own house in a manner perceptibly indebted to the,Paragraph
Farnsworth House. The Johnson design diverged from Mies’ in several respects: it was,Paragraph
"built on a symmetrical plan, with neither a terrace nor a deck nor even a substantial core,",Paragraph
but its very form (not to mention its excellence) rested in large part on Johnson’s,Paragraph
imitation of the Farnsworth model.,Paragraph
The Farnsworth House cannot be fairly discussed without some consideration given its,Paragraph
"client and its subsequent owner. In requesting Mies to design the house in 1945, Dr. Edith",Paragraph
"Farnsworth, a distinguished Chicago nephrologist with a substantial knowledge of the",Paragraph
"arts, knew full well the merits of the architect whom she had chosen to produce a",Paragraph
"weekend retreat for herself just south of the town of Piano, about 60 miles from Chicago.",Paragraph
"Mies in turn appreciated the fact that Farnsworth, as a single woman using the house only",Paragraph
"intermittently, would impose relatively few complicated domestic requirements on him.",Paragraph
Client and designer worked easily and cordially together in the early stages of the project.,Paragraph
"It was Farnsworth, in fact, who voted to employ travertine, one of Mies’ favorite stones,",Paragraph
"for the floor surfaces, and the quality of the house profited further from her willingness to",Paragraph
"increase the budget, thus enabling Mies to use not only finer materials but also more",Paragraph
expensive construction devices than had been anticipated in his first sketches (piers,Paragraph
"welded rather than bolted to the floor and roof slabs, among other things).",Paragraph
"Nonetheless, a relationship that began on a warm footing grew chilly as the 1940s",Paragraph
"wore on, and eventually a degree of hostility was reached that ended in a legal battle. The",Paragraph
"reasons have never been made completely clear, but to all appearances Farnsworth at one",Paragraph
point decided that Mies not only had gone too far in overspending the means she,Paragraph
"provided him with but, in her view, also had disregarded some of her more pressing",Paragraph
"requests in the process. Mies had his own opinion about both charges, and when he sued",Paragraph
"her for underpayment, she countersued him for professional incompetence, and the matter",Paragraph
ended only when the court ruled in his favor.,Paragraph

"sale. He approached her directly, and by 1972 he had taken full command of the property.",Paragraph
He made all the changes necessary to put the house in premium condition and to keep it,Paragraph
"that way. It was he who elected to outfit it with Mies’ furniture, to install air",Paragraph

"Fascist architecture denotes the spectrum of architectural projects that were built,",Paragraph

"whose absolute power abolished all forms of political opposition. Public utilities,",Paragraph
"commercial exchanges, processes of industrialization, as well as the production of art and",Paragraph
architecture were controlled and regulated by the state; and it was in Italy and Germany,Paragraph
that architecture played a seminal role in the advancement of Fascist ideologies.,Paragraph
The very term (or in Italian) was derived from the Latin word denoting an,Paragraph
ornamental object of political and military authority carried by ancient Roman lictors,Paragraph
"during public ceremonies. As early as 1919, Mussolini adopted the fasces as the emblem",Paragraph
"of the Fascist Party, intent as he was on associating the glories of ancient Rome with the",Paragraph
future triumphs of his Fascist state.,Paragraph
Throughout the Fascist era in Italy architecture was used as a rhetorical device; it,Paragraph
became the preferred vehicle for launching Fascist propaganda. It most forcefully,Paragraph
"portrayed, in the solidity of its materials and the vastness of its measures, the sublimity of",Paragraph
"imperial power. Buildings, piazzas, and ruins were privileged backdrops for public",Paragraph
"demonstrations, ritual reenactments, and oratorical theatrics; spectacles aimed at",Paragraph
"cultivating a Fascist body politic. Italian architects Giuseppe Terragni, Marcello",Caption
"Piacentini, Adalberto Libera, Giovanni Michelucci, and Giuseppe Pagano participated in",Paragraph
"the design of new building types, the inauguration of new colonies, the restoration of",Paragraph
"ancient monuments, the staging of political rallies, the mounting of exhibits, and the",Paragraph
publication of polemical journals; activities that contributed to the construction of the,Paragraph
new Roman Empire.,Paragraph
"From the outset, Mussolini launched a massive building campaign. The modernization",Paragraph
and nationalization of transportation and communication networks necessitated the,Paragraph
design and construction of building types new to Italian soil. Modern and efficient,Paragraph
railway stations and post offices were built throughout Italy. Florence’s Santa Maria,Paragraph
"Novella train station (1932-34), designed by Gruppo Toscano (a six-member group of",Paragraph
"Florentine rationalists), and Rome’s Palace of Postal and Telegraphic Services, designed",Paragraph
"by BBPR (Banfi, Belgiojoso, Peresutti, and Rogers), were only two of the many building",Paragraph
projects sponsored by the state. It was the invention of the Casa del Fascio (House of the,Paragraph
"Fascist Party), however, that most captivated the Italian imagination. Used primarily as",Paragraph
"the local headquarters of the Fascist Party, versions of this new building type were",Paragraph
"erected throughout the Italian peninsula. Typically sited in the center of town, the",Paragraph
structure rivaled the church’s dominance and evidenced the ceaseless presence of II,Paragraph
Duce. The most celebrated Casa del Fascio was built in Como (1932-36) and designed,Paragraph
"by Giuseppe Terragni. Its monumental austerity, abstract formalism, and frontal",Paragraph
transparency made it the building most representative of both Italian Fascism and,Paragraph
modernism.,Paragraph
Mussolini also commissioned the construction of entirely new towns in the southern,Paragraph
"regions of the Roman Campania, in Sardinia, in the Greek Dodecanese, and in the",Paragraph
"colonies of northern Africa. The towns of Littoria, Carbonia, and Guidonia were built on",Paragraph
"reclaimed swampland, whereas the occupied cities of Tripoli, Bengazi, Kos, and Rhodes",Paragraph
"were resettled with Italian farmers. Predappio (1925), Mussolini’s hometown, was the",Paragraph
"first to be built with wide avenues, monumental civic buildings, and a vast civic piazza.",Paragraph
"Littoria (1932), named after the lictor who had carried the ceremonial fasces during",Paragraph
"antiquity, was built with the knowledge of ancient Roman foundation rites.",Paragraph
Antiquity was equally of issue in the Fascist policy of “isolamento”: the valorization,Paragraph
and preservation of rhetorically significant buildings. In an attempt to make visible select,Paragraph
"architectural masterpieces from imperial Rome, monuments from the first century BC",Paragraph
were liberated from thousands of years of historical and material growth. With the,Paragraph
"demolition of entire city blocks, the Mausoleum of Caesar Augustus (63-14 BC) became",Paragraph
"one such site. Symbolic of the burial ground of Rome’s founding emperor, the unearthing",Paragraph
"of its sublime circular structure was completed in 1937, the 2,000th anniversary of his",Paragraph
"birth. With a similar intent, Mussolini effected vast transformations to the via dell’Impero",Paragraph
(present-day via dei Fori Imperial!) by physically connecting the ruins of the Colosseum,Paragraph
with the administrative center of Fascist Rome—Piazza Venezia. In an effort to valorize,Paragraph
"the Roman Forum and the Forum of Augustus, the via dell’ Impero was designed as a",Paragraph
monumental avenue for ceremonial and military parades.,Paragraph
"Alongside the building of large-scale architectural interventions, architects also",Paragraph
"participated in the design and construction of exhibits. Throughout the Fascist era, the",Paragraph
mounting of statesponsored public exhibitions was a significant vehicle for the promotion,Paragraph
"of both architectural ideas and Fascist polemics. In March 1931, the International",Paragraph
Movement for Rational Architecture (MIAR) opened its second exhibition with a critique,Paragraph
"of contemporary Italian architecture. The likes of Pietro Maria Bardi, Edoardo Persico,",Paragraph
and Alberto Sartoris called for the radical alliance of Fascist doctrine with modern,Paragraph
"architecture, for only in this way could a true renewal of the country take place. In 1932,",Paragraph
"to mark the tenth anniversary of the Fascist takeover of power, the (Exhibit of the",Paragraph
"Fascist Revolution) featured the work of architects Libera, Mario Renzi, and Terragni, its",Paragraph
"pavilions manifesting the allegiance of modernism to Fascist doctrine. However, it was",Paragraph
the Universal Exposition of 1942 (EUR’42) that placed the Italian Fascist state on display,Paragraph
"through its vast complex of monumental pavilions, designed under the leadership of",Paragraph
"Piacentini. Although the events of the war halted its completion, the polemics",Paragraph
surrounding the construction of EUR’42 forcefully pitted the modern rationalists against,Paragraph
the more conservative neoclassicists.,Paragraph
"Journals, periodicals, and newspapers were also significant venues for the",Paragraph
dissemination of both architectural theory and Fascist propaganda. The printed word and,Paragraph
"image had become highly effective means of communication, and as a former journalist",Paragraph
Mussolini was well aware of this truth. Marcello Piacentini served as editor for and,Paragraph

"state, the magazine was ordered to cease production. As a result, architects Pagano and",Paragraph
Banfi were deported to German death camps.,Paragraph
"In Germany, the totalitarian regime of National Socialism, led by the Fuhrer Adolf",Paragraph

"Hitler Inspector General of Buildings (GBI, Generalbauinspektor). The title attributed to",Paragraph
Speer expansive decision-making powers and the mandate to make of Berlin a capital,Title
"embodying the tenets of National Socialism. Guided by Hitler’s own artistic imagination,",Paragraph
Speer embarked on the conceptualization and design of the largest building project,Paragraph
"initiated by any totalitarian regime, the construction of a new urban plan for the city of",Paragraph
Berlin. The enormous project envisioned the rezoning of a vast territory of the city,Paragraph
through which the destruction of tens of thousands of homes would have been assured.,Paragraph
"If actualized, the plan would have forcibly introduced a monumental north/south axis",Paragraph
"five kilometers long, originating at the southern limit of the Tempelhof and Schoeneberg",Paragraph
"districts and terminating at the city’s northern limit, the Spree. Lined with granite-clad",Paragraph
"buildings, the axis would have housed the most politically significant buildings",Paragraph
representative of the III Reich’s major ministries and centers of power. At its northern,Paragraph
"end, the axis was designed to incorporate the colossal Pantheonlike shaped building",Paragraph
"called the Great Hall, conceived to gather nearly 200,000 spectators in mass celebrations",Paragraph
"of National Socialism. But steps from the Brandenburg gate, the Great Square",Paragraph
immediately to the south of the Great Hall would have been surrounded by Hitler’s,Paragraph
"Palace, the High Command of the Armed Forces, the New Chancellery, and the Old",Paragraph
"Reichstag. And although the New Chancellery was inaugurated in January 1937, Speer",Paragraph
would have designed all of the square’s new buildings.,Paragraph
"Completed as planned, the monumental scale of the north/ south axis would have",Paragraph
engendered a sense of domination never before achieved by human artifice. And,Paragraph
"notwithstanding Hitler’s defeat that ensured the demise of the Berlin project, Speer",Paragraph
incorporated many of its architectural strategies in earlier projects for another German,Paragraph
"city, Nuremberg. In 1936, Speer completed the redesign and extension of its Zeppelin",Paragraph
"Field, a parade ground for the mass gathering of 100,000 citizens. In the austerity of its",Paragraph
"neoclassical colonnade and in the massive extension of its 1,000-foot reviewing stand",Paragraph
was achieved a rhetorical and ideological backdrop for the orchestration of party rallies,Paragraph
and for gatherings of the Hitler Youth movement.,Paragraph
"Thus, in both Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, architecture was used as a highly",Paragraph
articulated tool of political propaganda. That architects were directly involved in the,Paragraph
production and communication of such beliefs should not be overlooked but rather the,Paragraph
source of continued study.,Paragraph

through readdressing the urban deficit.,Paragraph

includes the following key actions: (1) completing or constructing main urban,Paragraph

"The free and vigorous forms of Oscar Niemeyer’s works, such as Pampulha (1943)",Paragraph
"and Canoas House (1954), were already internationally recognized when he visited",Paragraph
Europe in 1954. Niemeyer was impressed by classical buildings he saw there—their,Paragraph
monumentality and their sense of permanence. This led him to introduce new concepts in,Paragraph
his architecture. Niemeyer started to emphasize pure and concise forms as well as single,Paragraph
volumes die-tated by structure in order to achieve monumentality. The opportunity for,Paragraph
Niemeyer to concretize this new vision came when he was commissioned to design the,Paragraph
"buildings of Brasilia, the new planned capital of Brazil, built between 1957 and 1960.",Caption
"Adopting the main principles of modern urbanism, Lucio Costa’s plan for Brasilia",Paragraph
achieved an appropriate expression of a capital with two axes crossing each other in right,Paragraph
"angles. The composition, resembling a plane, is very simple, unified, clear, and elegant.",Paragraph
"In the curved wings of the north-south axis (road axis), Costa placed the residential areas.",Paragraph
The east-west axis (monumental axis) is a sort of dorsal spine that organizes the entire,Paragraph
"plan. At the east end of the monumental axis, Costa located the governmental center,",Paragraph
"Three Powers Square, as a focus of the composition.",Paragraph
The Three Powers Square is a great esplanade for public ceremonies and provides an,Paragraph
"aesthetic and symbolic space for all the city houses. Following Costa’s triangular scheme,",Paragraph
Niemeyer placed in each vertex a building representing the three main powers: Planalto,Paragraph
"Palace (executive), National Congress (legislative), and Supreme Court (judiciary).",Paragraph
Niemeyer concentrated his major efforts on the creation of this ensemble.,Paragraph
"Niemeyer conceived these palaces as an entity, conferring formal unity and a general",Paragraph
classical monumentality on them. He created three poles of visual attraction with many,Paragraph
"perspectives. The buildings are self-contained objects in the vast landscape, separated by",Paragraph
large surfaces of stone paving that provides a free space to admire them and creates a,Paragraph
scenic civic place. The ensemble of the Three Powers is a unique architectural complex,Paragraph
in which classicism is joined with lightness.,Paragraph
"From far away, the powerful National Congress (1958-60) appears,",Paragraph
announcing the termination of the axis. Niemeyer placed two domes on a,Paragraph
vast platform that emphasizes the horizontality of the complex. Based on a,Paragraph
"play of volumes, the complex was intended to express formally the duality",Paragraph
"of the two assemblies. According to Bruand, the inverted dome, the",Paragraph
"Chamber of Deputies, symbolizes the more democratic facet of this",Paragraph
"assembly, whereas the smaller dome, the Senate, appears to be more",Paragraph
"reclusive (see Bruand, 1971). Between the domes, two high thin slabs are",Paragraph

its symbolical importance.,Paragraph
In the other vertices of the triangle are the Planalto Palace and the Supreme Court,Paragraph
(1960). Both buildings are rectangular glass boxes encased in a peristyle with,Paragraph
"magnificent colonnades. Niemeyer, in order to enhance the whole, reduced the number of",Paragraph
formal elements and emphasized the single motif of the curving colonnade as the,Paragraph
"strongest facet of the composition. The delicate and curving colonnades, barely touching",Paragraph
"the ground, endow the buildings with lightness and grace. The widely projecting roof",Paragraph
slabs supported by thin columns create many opportunities to frame the vast landscape.,Paragraph
"As they are inscribed in a larger composition, they have similar features, differentiated by",Paragraph
disposition and size that confer unity upon the esplanade as imagined by Costa. Whereas,Paragraph
"the Planalto Palace is taller and more delicate, the Supreme Court is closer to the ground,",Paragraph
"communicating stolidity and stability. Whereas Planalto’s long side is facing the square,",Paragraph
the Court has its narrow side facing it. This arrangement creates different perspectives but,Paragraph
"maintains axiality and unity, which provide the classical character required by",Paragraph
institutions.,Paragraph
"The innovative motif of colonnades is a variation of that of Alvorada Palace (1958),",Paragraph
"the official residency of the president, located near the ensemble although not part of it.",Paragraph
"One of his most acclaimed works, Alvorada Palace had its image widely diffused and",Paragraph
"became a symbol of the country. The curving and slender columns, delicately touching",Paragraph
"the ground, graciously support the shaded veranda. As David Underwood noted, the airy",Paragraph
"structure “synthesizes Brazilian charm with European decorum, classical nobility with",Paragraph
baroque plasticity.” Niemeyer’s ethereal and fluid suspended palaces are meaningful,Paragraph
freestanding objects in the vastness of the square.,Paragraph
The mall also includes two rows of ministry buildings. These discrete and anonymous,Paragraph
"blocks are aligned consecutively in order to create a sort of scenic and ceremonial space,",Paragraph
directing the attention to the Three Powers Square. Closer to this square are the,Paragraph
"Ministries of Justice (1960) and Foreign Affairs (1965-67), designed differently from the",Paragraph
"others. In these buildings, Niemeyer adopted a Brutalist aesthetic; at same time, however,",Paragraph
"they are refined and sophisticated. Instead of delicate colonnades, Niemeyer opted for",Paragraph
heavy concrete porticoes as expressive ele-ments. At the end of the mall is located the,Paragraph
"Metropolitan Cathedral (1958-70), one of Niemeyer’s masterpieces. The volume is",Paragraph
"formed by a structure of 16 boomerang-like ribs, expressing the essence of the cathedral.",Paragraph
The entrance through an underground passage leads the spectator to experience a,Paragraph
dramatic contrast from the shadows to an intensely illuminated and mystical space. The,Paragraph
"most recent contribution by Niemeyer is the Pantheon of Democracy (1985), a poetic,",Paragraph
"fluid, and dynamic structure that closes the open side of the Three Powers Square.",Paragraph
"As soon as Brasilia was completed, it was both praised and criticized. In the",Paragraph
"architectural field, it was celebrated by many critics. However, others pointed out the",Paragraph
failure of the climatic adaptation of the buildings and its rupture with traditional Brazilian,Paragraph
"living. Siegfried Giedion criticized the lack of coherence of the monumental axis, as it",Paragraph
fails to reproduce a theatrical perspective. Although the capital was conceived as a,Paragraph
"coherent whole, it is not felt by the pedestrian, who feels powerless in such a vastness.",Paragraph
Sybil Mohdély-Nagy pointed out the autoritarianism and the monumentalism of the new,Paragraph
"city. James Holston shows how Brasilia failed regarding its social purposes (Holston,",Paragraph
"1989). In a moment in which the principles of modern urbanism were under fire, Brasilia",Paragraph
seems to have been born already old.,Paragraph
"Nevertheless, the attacks on modern urbanism and the fact that Brasilia was a social",Paragraph
failure eclipsed some positive aspects of its architecture. First was Brasilia’s role in the,Paragraph
discussion of modern architecture and monumentality. Niemeyer’s delicate and lighter,Paragraph
classicism proved that modern architecture could also be monumental and symbolic,Paragraph
without regressing to the massive authoritarianess of 1930s government buildings.,Paragraph
Second was Brasilia’s unique image. Niemeyer sucessfully created an image for the city,Paragraph
"based on a repetition of some patterns, fostering formal unity although admitting",Paragraph
variations in textures and materials that contributed to the city’s inclusion in the World,Paragraph
Heritage List of UNESCO. Third was Brasilia’s role as a symbol for the country. Brasilia,Paragraph
"was planned to foster a new Brazilian man, a proof of the capacity of a country to build",Paragraph
"its future. Much more than housing institutions, the main achievement of Niemeyer was",Paragraph
"the creation of a cultural image for a modern state, providing poetic and symbolic forms.",Paragraph

"FEHN, SVERRE 1924-",Title
"Architect, Norway",Title
Sverre Fehn began his career after graduating from the Oslo School of Architecture in,Paragraph
1949. He is one of a number of post-World War II Norwegian architects who believed in,Paragraph
"bestowing universal modernism with both regional and site-specific values, espousing an",Paragraph
"architecture that, while always rational, recognized local crafts and culture, mythology,",Paragraph
"and folklore. His concerns with the topography of the site, climate, local identity, and",Paragraph
tectonics are central to issues of both regionalism and phenomenology in architecture.,Paragraph
"In 1950, Fehn joined the Progressive Architect’s Group of Oslo, Norway (PAGON), a",Paragraph
"division of the Congrés Internationaux d’ Architecture Moderne (CIAM), along with his",Paragraph
"former teacher Arne Korsmo, architectural theorist Christian NorbergSchulz, and design",Paragraph
"collaborators Grung and Ostbye, among others. CIAM was a network concerned with",Paragraph
how ideas of modern architecture and town planning were communicated internationally.,Paragraph
"Although CIAM had no direct influence on his own work, he would have been",Paragraph
acquainted with many leading contemporary architects and artists through his association,Paragraph
with the Congress.,Paragraph
"Between 1952 and 1953, on the advice of Jorn Utzon, Fehn made a journey to study",Paragraph
the so-called primitive architecture of Morocco. This journey was seminal to his,Paragraph
"recognition of eternal themes in architecture, values that existed long before being",Paragraph
embraced by the functionalist doctrine of modernist theory. Fehn remarked on the mutual,Paragraph
harmony between the structure of natural and man-made place and the relationship,Paragraph
"between the ground and constructed form, as well as the clarity, simplicity, and common",Paragraph
"sense of regional architecture regarding systems of environmental control, planning, and",Paragraph
construction and how these systems characterized rituals of habitation. It was a journey of,Paragraph
recognition rather than discovery that helped Fehn see clearly the character of his native,Paragraph
"Norway as well as the qualities in the works of earlier modernist masters, such as Le",Paragraph
"Corbusier, Louis Kahn, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Frank Lloyd Wright.",Paragraph
The poetic modernism of Fehn’s architecture derives from a unified and formal,Paragraph
relationship between the site and the physical and psychological dimensions of the,Paragraph
program and of the people who inhabit his buildings—reduced to a conceptual clarity and,Paragraph
expressed through material construction. He describes architecture as a necessary,Paragraph
"interference with nature, in opposition to it yet also revealing the character of the",Paragraph
"landscape. His buildings articulate a relationship between earth, sky, and horizon, a",Paragraph
recurring theme that is developed through his writings and drawings.,Paragraph
Fehn’s buildings are generally constructed of concrete or brick and wood used in a,Paragraph
modern rather than traditional way: mass construction to anchor the building to the,Paragraph
ground and timber construction to articulate openings in walls or the connection between,Paragraph
roof and wall. His timber detailing is reminiscent of the traditions of Nordic boat building,Paragraph
and of Japanese architecture. Modular repetition and geometric configuration of structure,Paragraph
give spatial definition to both interior volume and exterior surface. The ground plane of,Paragraph
his interiors often relates to the natural topography of the site and to external views.,Paragraph
"The works of Fehn date back to 1949, when he, with G. Grung, won an international",Paragraph
competition for the design of the Craft Museum at Lillehammer. The winning project was,Paragraph
never built. Subsequent works and projects typically have been for houses and museums,Paragraph
"but also include designs for religious, community, education, and recreational buildings.",Paragraph
During the late 1950s and early 1960s Fehn’s designs for the Norwegian Pavilion at,Paragraph
"the Universal Exposition in Brussels (1958), now demolished, and his Pavilion of the",Paragraph
"Nordic Nations in the Gardens of the Biennale (1962) in Venice, Italy, garnered",Paragraph
recognition. Both buildings employed Miesian qualities of a regular grid with a free plan,Paragraph
and featured roofs that masterfully controlled the natural light within the exhibition,Paragraph
"spaces. The Schreiner House (1963) in Oslo, named “Hommage au Japon” by Fehn for its",Paragraph
"references to spatial relationships and construction in Japanese architecture, consisted of",Paragraph
a structural timber fame around a brick central service core—a device developed from his,Paragraph
"time in the 1950s with Jean Prouvé, an architect noted for his industrialized fabrication",Paragraph
and servicing systems. Planning and volumetric geometry developed with the designs of,Paragraph
"the houses for Arne Bodtker (1965) and his brother Carl (1967, extension 1985).",Paragraph
"The masterpiece of his work in the late 1960s and 1970s, however, is the",Paragraph
Archbishopric Museum (1979) in Hamar. The site is a ruined medieval,Paragraph
"fort over which a 19th-century U-shaped barn was built. Space, light, time,",Paragraph
and the programmatic requirements of the museum are brought together,Paragraph
by a series of concrete ramps and walkways that pass through the barn,Paragraph

"ability to develop a clear dialogue among client, site, structure, and form is further",Paragraph
exemplified by the Villa Busk (1990) in Bamble. A rocky outcrop chosen by Fehn,Paragraph
"dictates the physical dimensions and orientation of the house, the linear form of which is",Paragraph
broken by a cross axis from the entrance of the main house to a timber tower that in turn,Paragraph
"provides visual and physical links to the fjord. As with the Hamar museum, a modulated",Paragraph

FEMINIST THEORY,Title
Feminist theory in 20th-century architecture encompasses identification of gendered,Paragraph
"power relations in architectural and urban form and discourse, critique of masculine",Paragraph
"dominance in the design professions, and creation of “feminist” and “feminine”",Paragraph
"architectural practices. Influenced by feminism in philosophy, literature, cultural studies,",Paragraph
"and the social sciences, feminist architectural theory has embraced histories of women in",Paragraph
"architecture, new types of architectural practice, and the reconceptualization of the",Paragraph
"“feminine” itself. In architecture, feminist theory has three main tendencies, all of which",Paragraph
address gendered power relations and the injustice of masculine domination in,Paragraph
architecture. Some theorists celebrate the differences between men and women and take,Paragraph
an overtly feminist approach to the critique and reconstruction of architectural practice,Paragraph
and history. Others emphasize the struggle for equal access to training and jobs in,Paragraph
architecture and for recognition of women’s competence in the profession. Another group,Paragraph
"focuses on theories of gender difference and representation in the built environment,",Paragraph
"architectural discourse, and cultural value systems.",Paragraph
Feminist architectural theory has its sources in 19th-century feminist thought and the,Paragraph
revival of feminism in the 1960s. Betty Friedan’s book (1963) marked the emergence,Paragraph
"of a second wave feminism in the United States and, later, around the world. This",Paragraph
feminism emerged from the civil rights and anti- Vietnam War movements of the 1950s,Paragraph
"and 1960s, just as 19th-century feminism developed from abolitionism. “Women’s",Paragraph
liberation” focused on the pursuit of civil rights and equality. During the 1960s and,Paragraph
"1970s, this strategy evolved into the analysis and challenge of gendered power relations.",Paragraph
"Feminists recognized that while the struggle for equality is ongoing, it left intact the",Paragraph
epistemological and representational sources of inequality. They turned their critique to,Paragraph
"language, social relations, spatial hierarchies, education, history, art, and other means for",Paragraph
preserving gender-based relations of power.,Paragraph
"In light of the new emphasis on representation and language among feminists, the",Paragraph
work of Simone de Beauvoir became central to feminist theory; her book is considered,Paragraph
"one of the greatest works of 20th-century feminist theory (published in France in 1949,",Paragraph
translated into English in 1952). Its importance lies in the clarity with which Beauvoir,Paragraph
summarized women’s condition; in she traced the history of women’s reduction to,Paragraph
"objects for men, their status as man’s Other without control over their actions or",Paragraph
"subjectivity. Beauvoir demonstrated that this assumption dominates social, political, and",Paragraph
"cultural life. Further, she noted that women internalize this objectified vision as normal",Paragraph
and enact their prescribed roles within patriarchy.,Paragraph
Feminist theorists and architects have created alternative practices and histories of,Paragraph

"natural, irrationality, and the Other, whereas the male connotes activity, power, life, the",Paragraph
"cultural, rationality, and the Self. This hierarchical value system is imbedded with",Paragraph
oppositions relating to sexual difference. It generates meaning by placing terms such as,Paragraph

"occupies space as an object, and is coupled with technology and logic. The",Paragraph
"womb/interior, in this account, protects, creates space, shelters humans, and is affiliated",Paragraph
with sensuality and materialism. The problem with such a theory is that it reduces,Paragraph
architecture to a series of biologically-based metaphors without interrogating the social,Paragraph
"and cultural constitution of the linked terms. That is, it attributes fundamentally",Paragraph
"“feminine” or “masculine,” universal essences to female and male biology (their sex),",Paragraph
which are represented in cultural and social phenomena such as buildings.,Paragraph
"In the 1970s, feminists made a crucial distinction between biological (their sexual",Paragraph
organs and their biological functions as women) and (their social identity and the,Paragraph
"cultural associations of the feminine). The term “sex” seemed, to many feminists, to",Paragraph
"consign men and women to fixed roles, and they seized on “gender” as a more fluid,",Paragraph
"socially constituted category. Beauvoir’s famous assertion “One is not born a woman,",Paragraph
"but, rather, becomes one” summarizes the split between sex and gender. Sex implied that",Paragraph
"being a woman was an innate, biological state, whereas gender connoted the process by",Paragraph
which female humans became “women.” Beauvoir noted that “the individuals that,Paragraph
compose society are never abandoned to the dictates of their nature; they are subject,Paragraph
"rather to that second nature which is custom.... It is not merely as a body, but rather as a",Paragraph
"body subject to taboos, to laws, that the subject is conscious of him-self.” Gender is,",Paragraph
"therefore, a culturally and socially constructed category of difference, not fixed or stable;",Paragraph
"according to feminist theorists, it has no “natural” basis.",Paragraph
The idea that there is an “essential” women’s nature or experience was further,Paragraph
challenged during the 1980s; feminist theorists rejected “essentialism” because it reduced,Paragraph
women to a homogeneous image based on their bodies (their biology) and a universal,Paragraph
"“woman’s experience” that was the same for all women regardless of their age, race, or",Paragraph
"class. Women of color criticized white feminists for creating an exclusively white,",Paragraph
"middle-class image of women. Informed by critiques of essentialism, feminists have",Paragraph
"scrutinized dominant, stereotypical images of women and assumptions about gender",Paragraph
"roles, often through a parody of the pervasive mechanisms of the media. Writers and",Paragraph
critics such as bell hooks and Adrian Piper have investigated the ways racial difference is,Paragraph
interconnected with sexual difference in dominant regimes of power.,Paragraph
Recent feminist theory has challenged the sex/gender dichotomy itself as an,Paragraph
ideological construct. Judith Butler has defined gender as more than the imposition of,Paragraph
meaning on “sex”; gender is the very cultural and discursive processes by which the,Paragraph
"sexes are established, according to Butler. Lesbian critics, such as Monique Wittig, have",Paragraph
challenged the heterosexual bias of straight feminism and the inadequacy of the,Paragraph
"male/female binary, positing a transgressive character of lesbian identity, neither",Paragraph
stereotypically “feminine” nor “masculine.” The essays collected by Joel Sanders in,Paragraph
"explore such reconceptualizations of gender, sexuality, and identity in architectural",Paragraph
discourse and design.,Paragraph
Feminist theorists in architecture have turned to a critique of the masculinist,Paragraph
"underpinnings of architectural discourse, both written and formal. A central concern of",Paragraph
"feminist theory has been the definition of the architect as a masterful, socially isolated",Paragraph
individual whose gentus and vision are imprinted on his designs. The conflation of the,Paragraph
"male body, illustrated by Vitruvius’s famous diagram of a male circumscribed by a circle",Paragraph
"and a square, exemplifies the dominance of a masculine norm in architecture. It is",Paragraph
"precisely this model that feminist theorists reject, seeking new models of identity and",Paragraph
practice. The interrogation of the architect’s position in society informs feminist practices,Paragraph
"such as Matrix and Liquid Incorporated founded on collaboration rather than individual,",Paragraph
competitive action. Diana Agrest has critiqued the history the Vitruvian model and,Paragraph
"provided an alternative based on the theory of (feminine writing). According to Agrest,",Paragraph
women can place themselves outside the system of architecture by reconfiguring their,Paragraph
"marginal position and creating an architecture of the repressed, denied, excluded, and",Paragraph
hidden.,Paragraph
"More recently, feminist theory in architecture has returned to the themes of the body",Paragraph
"and the everyday experience of women. Feminists have used fashion, the home, and",Paragraph
"domesticity as a central theme in their work and have produced commentaries, parodies,",Paragraph
"historical critiques, performances, and alternative practices to critique architecture",Title
"culture. Jennifer Bloomer’s work, for example, plays with language to create new forms",Paragraph
of thought and expression in both writing and design. Her essay and project “Abodes of,Paragraph

The simultaneous appearance in 1996 of three major anthologies of feminist writing,Paragraph

FENG SHUI,Title
"Feng Shui dates from before the earliest dynasty in China, when its principles were first",Paragraph
used to locate family graves to ensure good luck for all future descendants. Loosely,Paragraph
"translated as “wind and water,” the term refers to the practice of discerning the",Paragraph
"harmonic arrangements of natural elements so as to enhance the flow of the life force, or",Paragraph
"Chi; for Western audiences, the term is most directly defined as “geomancy” or",Paragraph
"“divination.” In the context of design, Feng Shui encourages a healthy and ecological",Paragraph
"pproach to the built environment, such that humans and nature live together in the best",Paragraph
"possible relationship. In creating a sensitive environment, Feng Shui not only balances",Paragraph
the natural forces of the universe but also cares for the psychic well-being of humankind.,Paragraph
"Feng Shui does not deny the cyclical forces of nature, which ultimately ensure that good",Paragraph
"and bad luck ebb and flow at different times; rather, its primary goal is to achieve the",Paragraph
optimum balance between contrasting opposites to the benefit of human existence.,Paragraph
Feng Shui’s principles center on the idea that the Chi must flow freely in and around,Paragraph
the human environment. A positive flow of Chi will have a positive influence on,Paragraph
"humankind, allowing one’s labors to reach their highest level of success. According to",Paragraph
"Feng Shui masters, the Chi can radiate with lesser and greater force up from the earth.",Paragraph
The strength of the Chi can be read from the natural elements and the physical,Paragraph
"appearance of a location. For example, mountains and volcanoes show where the Chi has",Paragraph
"risen above the earth, whereas arid deserts demonstrate a lack of Chi. Feng Shui masters",Paragraph
can measure the quantity of Chi present in an area by observing the soil and vegetation,Paragraph
"and noting the position of natural elements, such as mountains and waterways, relative to",Paragraph
a particular site. Humankind is also an element in determining the relationship between,Paragraph
"the earth and the Chi, and the human body can, like the earth, demonstrate a good or bad",Paragraph
"flow of Chi. Healthy bodies are seen as a reflection of a good and positive flow of Chi,",Paragraph
whereas sickness indicates an unhealthy element. Because there is no end and no,Paragraph
"beginning to Chi, humans can be both the cause and the solution to the negative flow,",Paragraph
such that the person influences the flow of the Chi in the environment or the environment,Paragraph
"affects the level of Chi in the person. In either case, the problem can usually be corrected",Paragraph
by following the guidance of a Feng Shui master.,Paragraph
"In observing the flow of the Chi, Feng Shui requires that the contrasting forces of",Paragraph
nature be balanced in harmonic arrangements. This principle is explained through the,Paragraph
"concepts of Yin and Yang, which are identified by a half-white, half-black circle. Yin and",Paragraph
"Yang represent dualities, or opposites, within the Chi, such that together they balance into",Paragraph
"a whole. For example, Yin is dark, passive, and female, whereas Yang is light, active, and",Paragraph
"male. Generally, these primordial forces are seen as complementary, and they symbolize",Paragraph
"the harmony of the universe, for without the one, there cannot be the other. Feng Shui",Paragraph
seeks to balance the two by matching the Yin elements with the Yang. In terms of,Paragraph
"landscape, an area that is rich in Yin might lack Yang and thus will not bring good",Paragraph
"fortune to the owner. In many cases, however, a deficiency of either Yin or Yang can be",Paragraph
"corrected by the placement of certain objects—mirrors, fishbowls, or plants—to reflect",Paragraph
and enhance the flow of the missing element.,Paragraph
Feng Shui masters can further discern the flow of Chi through the use of trigrams.,Paragraph
"Like coins, trigrams have two outcomes, whole or broken, which are represented by one",Paragraph
"long straight line or two short ones, respectively. Trigrams usually come in sets of three,",Paragraph
thus making eight individual arrangements of long and short lines. Each of these patterns,Paragraph
"represents a quality (nature, heaven, earth, thunder, mountain, fire, wind, lake, and",Paragraph
"water), and they may also represent family relationships, directions, time, and change.",Paragraph
"When properly aligned with a compass, trigrams can ensure that the proper placement of",Paragraph
"furniture, doorways, windows, and rooms occurs under the most favorable conditions.",Paragraph
2,Title
"Trigrams can been seen as types of omens, but they also ensure that the cycles of humans",Paragraph
and nature are respected and remind humanity that the universe is never static.,Paragraph
"The principles of Feng Shui encourage buildings to be placed, designed, and arranged",Paragraph
with reference to particularly lucky attributes within the landscape. Feng Shui masters,Paragraph
recommend that houses and offices be sheltered on their north side by a mountain or hill,Paragraph
and that a source of water be placed to the south. Houses should always face south to,Paragraph
"appreciate the sun and the fresh winds from that direction, and they should be set up on",Paragraph
"the land rather than down in a hollow. In plan, houses should not have windows or doors",Paragraph
opposite each other and should not have sharp angles or tight proportions. Particular,Paragraph
"rooms should be located farther from others; for example, the kitchen should not open",Paragraph
"directly onto the living room, and the stove should be in the southeast corner. For interior",Caption
"decor, beds should be elevated from the ground and should not face the west, unless the",Paragraph
resident’s astrology says otherwise. Beds should also not be positioned opposite open,Paragraph
"doors or too near the windows, as this will affect sleeping patterns. Other furniture may",Paragraph
be placed according to a Feng Shui compass that directs which sections of the room will,Paragraph
"be lucky, thus encouraging the prosperity of the family.",Paragraph
"Feng Shui is still practiced today not only the East but in the West as well. In China,",Paragraph
Feng Shui masters are routinely consulted for readings on projects that range from houses,Paragraph
"to skyscrapers. Most recently, I.M.Pei’s Hong Kong Bank was positioned according to",Paragraph
"Feng Shui principles, with a hill behind it and a gentle slope leading to the harbor in",Paragraph
"front. Once completed, the Hong Kong Bank was regarded as having favorably respected",Paragraph
"the principles of Feng Shui, unlike its neighbor, the Bank of China, whose sharp corners,",Paragraph
"domineering scale, and shiny facade negatively affected the surrounding neighborhood.",Paragraph
Residents complained that the Bank of China’s mirrorlike facade reflected bad elements,Paragraph
back to the neighborhood and that the sharp angles cut into the local businesses like,Paragraph
"knives. Since its completion, the Bank of China has not been well regarded by the",Paragraph
"population and has had some trouble finding tenants. In the West, Feng Shui has become",Paragraph
"popular among designers who respect the principles of harmony and balance with nature,",Paragraph
and Feng Shui experts are routinely consulted for interior decorating and even for,Paragraph

"FERRISS, HUGH 1889-1962",Title
"Urban designer, United States",Title
"Best known for his dramatic depictions of the monumental architecture of a futuristic,",Paragraph
"urban utopia, Hugh Ferriss contributed significantly in the 1920s and 1930s to an",Paragraph
"appreciation for urban design within academic and professional circles, but more so",Paragraph
"among a lay audience. Although he was a licensed architect, he chose not to build. He",Paragraph
"dedicated his career to drawing, writing, and urban planning, becoming the preferred",Paragraph
renderer and consultant to some of the most notable practitioners of his day. Although,Paragraph
Ferriss shared with his modernist peers a belief in architecture’s agency in improving,Paragraph
"urban society, he rejected the industrial references assumed in many of their proposals.",Paragraph
He sought to invest his designs with a spirituality that he felt absent both in international,Paragraph
style modernism and in an America dominated by corporate activity; the skyscraper—the,Paragraph
new icon of that activity—became his fundamental subject. His writings remained less,Paragraph
"polemical and ultimately less influential than those of his modernist contemporaries,",Paragraph
whereas his widely circulated images became more influential. Although the last decades,Paragraph
"of Ferriss’s career paled in comparison to his earlier notoriety, in the 1940s he could stil",Paragraph
be lauded by such populist magazines as as “U.S. architecture’s most grandiose seer.”,Paragraph
Ferriss’s fame as an urban-design visionary proceeded from a pragmatic issue. After,Paragraph
"New York City passed its zoning ordinance in 1916, which was intended to improve the",Paragraph
"access of light and air into cavernous streets, new buildings were required to reduce their",Paragraph
"massing as they rose in height. Ferriss’s “four stages” zoning envelope studies, published",Paragraph
"in 1922 in collaboration with the architect Harvey Wiley Corbett, show the gradua",Paragraph
"erosion of a tall block into a series of variously sized, adjacent, parallel slabs and were",Paragraph
the first studies to make architectural sense of this zoning legislation. He championed his,Paragraph
"zoning solution, stating that the “efficiency and health of city life must be accepted as",Paragraph
"mandatory requirements,” and he reinforced his brand of modernistic architectura.",Paragraph
"moralism and determinism, saying, “We are not contemplating the new architecture of a",Paragraph
"city...we are contemplating the new architecture of a civilization.” In 1930, the historian",Paragraph
"and critic Sheldon Cheney wrote, “More than any other architect... Ferriss influenced the",Paragraph
"imagination of designers, students, and public. Many a building of 1928—29 looks like a",Paragraph
"fulfillment of a Ferriss idealistic sketch of four or five years earlier.” Indeed, his zoning",Paragraph
study became a model for tall structures throughout the United States.,Paragraph
Most of Ferriss’s renderings stemmed from commercial commissions for clients who,Paragraph
"wished to join, for their benefit, 1920s economic optimism with the progressive spirit that",Paragraph
his drawings invoked. He also collaborated frequently with architects of the caliber of,Paragraph
Raymond Hood and Wallace Harrison and became the public-image-giver to projects,Paragraph
"such as Rockefeller Center, the United Nations, Lincoln Center, and the New York",Paragraph
World’s Fair. Despite the fact that Ferriss had an aesthetic penchant for the architecture,Paragraph
"of modern capitalism, he recognized the skyscraper as “a symbol of an age in which there",Paragraph
is no spiritual-ity.” Yet he believed that capitalism’s power might be used to reform the,Paragraph
city. His commercial work became intellectual and formal fodder for his theoretical,Paragraph
"explorations, which strove to reinvest architecture with humanistic dimension. Unlike",Paragraph
"most of his modernist peers, who may also be called “visionary,” Ferriss maintained that",Paragraph
modem technology was stifling the human spirit and chose to regard the city as an,Paragraph
"extension of nature rather than the machine. He emphasized organic, geological, and",Paragraph
metaphysical analogies in reference to the “crystalline” properties of his architecture.,Paragraph
"Ultimately, Ferriss’s intentions rarely transcended symbolic gesture.",Paragraph
"Ferriss’s best-known publication, (1929), was a testament to his rendering talents,",Paragraph
"his idealism, and his commitment to fashioning structures whose effect would restore",Paragraph
architecture’s lost emotional content. The book was divided into three parts. The first,Paragraph
"part, “The City of Today,” features many of the tower renderings that established his",Paragraph
"career. The second part, “Projected Trends,” depicts work ranging from his realistic",Paragraph
zoning studies to such fantastic proposals as multitiered streets clinging to the 20th story,Paragraph
"of a building facade. Ferriss recognized the far-fetched nature of his proposals, yet he",Paragraph
"surmised that they were nonetheless inevitable. The final part of the book, “An Imaginary",Paragraph
"Metropolis,” summarizes his design theories for a Utopian city. In his Metropolis, vast",Paragraph
boulevards slide through a midrise urban fabric and link mile-high towers with gardens,Paragraph
"arranged on the ledges of their stepped-back massings. For all its visionary appearance, it",Paragraph
was formally little more than a City Beautiful scheme; with no provision for industrial,Paragraph
"sectors or housing, it addressed only a bourg",Paragraph
"a triangulated business, art, and science",Title
"philosophy,” underscored Ferriss’s desires",Paragraph
"eois citizenry. The city’s core, comprised of",Paragraph
zone punctuated by a soaring “tower of,Paragraph
for a humanistic city yet proffered no,Paragraph
"plausible social, political, or economic theory by which to implement the new society.",Paragraph
"Ironically, the publication of his urban scheme coincided exactly with the financial",Paragraph
"collapse of 1929, sobering his faith in architecture’s reach.",Paragraph
"Ferriss’s second book, (1953), was far less ambitious in scope. Produced",Paragraph
"following a journey across the country, the book portrays what he considered to be",Paragraph
"America’s most inspirational structures, ranging from recently completed hydroelectric",Paragraph
"dams to pre-Columbian pyramids. Almost embarrassed by his earlier naiveté, he began to",Paragraph
dedicate his drawing skills to built and pending designs rather than imaginary,Paragraph
architecture; his rejection of capitalism’s ability to work for social change is signaled by,Paragraph
the book’s near absence of high-rise towers.,Paragraph
Although Ferriss was alternately considered an architectural theorist and a delineator,Paragraph
"of remarkable talent, history has established him only as the latter. Ferriss rejected the",Paragraph
Beaux-Arts representational tenets that he was taught at Washington University in St.,Paragraph
"Louis; he felt that emphasis on two-dimensional drawing—plans, sections, and",Paragraph
"elevation—was foreign to human experience. Likewise, he rejected the isometric",Paragraph
"representations used by his staunchly modernist peers, stating that such techniques",Paragraph
"yielded passionless images and, by extension, passionless architecture. Ferriss conveyed",Paragraph
his ideas nearly exclusively through perspective. The drawings for which he ultimately,Paragraph
became renowned were noteworthy not for their accuracy (he took technical liberties in,Paragraph
order to show multiple vantage points in one view) but for their emotive capacity.,Paragraph
"Ferriss-conceived architecture revealed through a subtractive process, leaving ultimately",Paragraph
finely chiseled masses where historical ornament was subjugated to smoothly massed,Paragraph
"surfaces. After building up layers of carbon, he would begin to reveal the form of his",Paragraph
"subject through erasure, yielding scenes whereby his architecture would appear as a",Paragraph
brilliant beacon. If the purpose of the setback ordinance was to suffuse the city of,Paragraph
"darkness with light, then his system of erasure and the dark-to-light techniques of his",Paragraph
drawings were an appropriate parallel to this transformation. Although Ferriss’s work,Paragraph
"continued to be well received by the general public, professional and academic",Paragraph
"communities tended to be less generous. In 1954, six years before Ferriss’s death in New",Paragraph
"York City, the architectural historian Vincent Scully dismissed Ferriss as “the last in a",Paragraph
line of romantic-classic architectural artists which began with Piranesi and Boullee.”,Paragraph

completed in 1921. The design of the management offices was more traditional than the,Paragraph
"plant itself, with a doric portico at its entrance. The main production building was often",Paragraph
compared to a skyscraper lying on its side and was without cellars or basements. It,Paragraph
comprises two long workshops that run parallel for a third of a mile and connected at the,Paragraph
"ends, creating an elongated ring. At regular intervals, the long sides are linked by",Paragraph
towers—two inside and one at each end—to create the four interior courtyards. At the,Paragraph
"south end is a square press-shop; on the north, a five-story building is part of the",Paragraph
assembly workshop.,Paragraph
The building composition exemplified efficient auto production of the time: Assembly,Paragraph
"was begun on the ground floor, then cars were then taken up spiral ramps to consecutive",Paragraph
"upper floors for further assembly and, finally, to the roof for a test drive on the track. This",Paragraph
"was actually opposite to the Ford system, where the auto parts were taken up to the top",Paragraph
floor and then the car was assembled as it descended to lower floors and finally out to the,Paragraph
"street. However, by the time Fiat Works was built, it was out-of-date, as Ford had begun",Paragraph
his single-volume one-story factories.,Paragraph
Fiat Works is significant as one of the first modular concrete buildings in Europe.,Paragraph
"Matté Trucco was influenced by the work of the French engineer Francois Hennébique,",Paragraph
whose structures Matté Trucco had seen with his engineer father. Matté Trucco repeated,Paragraph
"a square reinforced concrete module, 19 feet 8 inches by 19 feet 8 inches by 16 feet 5",Caption
"inches high, to construct a 1664-foot-long (1/3 mile) by 264-foot-wide and 88-foot-high",Paragraph
building with four interior courtyards.,Caption
Within the modular concrete grid there are over 2000 steel sash-awning multiple-,Paragraph
paned windows that admit plenty of daylight to the interior spaces. Square concrete,Paragraph
"columns with chamfered edges that, architectural critic and historian Reyner Banham",Paragraph
"noted, were like those in the factories in the United States, are spaced six meters apart to",Paragraph
create as open an interior as possible. More innovative were the perforated horizontal,Paragraph
beams with regular rectangular holes for pipes and conduits.,Paragraph
The two major engineering accomplishments include the one-kilometer-long rooftop,Paragraph
test track and the two poured-inplace spiral ramps at the north and south ends of the,Paragraph
factory. The truck-size ramps are outstanding sculptural constructions that move cars to,Paragraph
the roof track for testing without eliminating valued manufacturing space. The ramps,Paragraph
were also used for hand trucks and for pulling car parts floor to floor. The ovular rooftop,Paragraph
test track with banked curves at each end allowed cars to be tested at speeds up to 60,Paragraph
"miles an hour, exceeding normal highway speeds at the time.",Paragraph
Renowned architects praised Fiat Works when it was completed. Le,Paragraph
Corbusier described the factory after his visit there in the 1920s as where,Paragraph

"Twentieth-century Finnish architecture, with few exceptions, has moved within the flow",Paragraph

"Toward the end of the 19th century, a growth in national self-awareness occurred in",Paragraph
Finland as well as in other European countries. Although this nationalism was partially,Paragraph
"based on an interest in seeking national cultural origins, it was also fostered by the",Paragraph

development. In response to the repression of the regime of Czar Nicholas II during the,Paragraph
"1890s, Finland sought political independence through national self-assertion. Within the",Paragraph
"Finnish arts, the search for a national cultural identity resulted in a movement known as",Paragraph
National Romanticism.,Paragraph
"With the 1849 edition of the the Finnish national folk epic, the arts were provided",Paragraph
with powerful poetic imagery that led to the development of a national form of artistic,Paragraph
expression that moved from painting to music and eventually to architecture. The music,Paragraph
of Jan Sibelius and the paintings of Akseli Gallén-Kallela express this urge toward,Paragraph
"national identity. For architects, the question of the period was, What qualities were",Paragraph
"required for a national architecture? The Finnish Pavilion for the 1900 Paris World’s Fair,",Paragraph
"by the firm Gesellius Lindgren and Saarinen, was the first occasion for a public",Paragraph
expression of National Romanticism. The work contained many of the formal features,Paragraph
that would characterize National Romantic architecture: picturesque compositions with,Paragraph
irregular asymmetrical plans and masses employing tactile and rough materials. Ragged,Paragraph
and irregular building volumes and profiles are complemented through the use of heavily,Paragraph
"rusticated masonry surfaces, protruding log ends, and numerous textural variations in",Paragraph
"materials. Often, the ornamentation featured motifs derived from Finnish nature and",Paragraph
"folklore: bears, squirrels, and other animals, along with pinecones, tree boughs, and the",Paragraph
occasional character from folklore were sculpted decorative motifs.,Paragraph
"The work of Gesellius, Lindgren and Saarinen and of individuals such as Lars Sonck,",Paragraph
"Selim Lindqvist, Usko Nystrém, and the architect Vivi Lénn exemplified the very best of",Paragraph
"Finnish National Romanticism. Hvittrask (1902), the home and studio of Gesellius,",Caption
"Lindgren, and Saarinen, combines the organizational pattern of a Finnish vernacular farm",Paragraph
complex with massing elements from medieval stone churches. The interiors continue,Paragraph
these direct references and include an interlocking log living space and a sitting room,Paragraph
decorated like medieval church vaults. The Pohja Insurance Building (1901) and several,Caption
apartment complexes in Helsinki are of rough masonry construction that references the,Paragraph
work of American architect Henry Hobson Richardson. Among the most powerful works,Paragraph
"of the period was the firm’s National Museum (designed 1901, completed 1915), which",Paragraph
incorporates direct references to Finnish medieval churches and fortresses. Lars Sonck’s,Paragraph
"best work of the period includes the Eira Hospital (1905), a bank interior (1904), and the",Paragraph
"Richardson-influenced Telephone Building (1905), all located in Helsinki. However, his",Paragraph
Tampere Cathedral (1907) is a true masterpiece: it is a fully integrated work of art and,Paragraph
"architecture, assimilating a variety of references into a bold, assertive building. Other",Paragraph
important works of the period include Usko Nystrém’s evocative Valtion Hotel in Imatra,Paragraph
(1903) and Onni Tarjanne’s National Theater (1902). Many of the works of this period,Paragraph
were important cultural buildings symbolizing Finland as an emerging nation with a,Paragraph
sophisticated population.,Paragraph
"Finland had several women architects practicing during this period, all of whom",Paragraph
attended the Polytechnic Institute in Helsinki. Although Signe Hornborg and Signe,Paragraph
"Lagerborg-Stenius engaged in major commissions during the National Romantic period,",Paragraph
it was Vivi L6nn who was a major force during the first two decades of the 20th century.,Paragraph
"Her best National Romantic work, all located in Tampere, included the Finnish Girl’s",Paragraph
"School (1902), the Alexander School (1904), and the Central Fire Station (1908), along",Paragraph
with other educational and domestic projects.,Paragraph
"Two buildings, although appearing National Romantic, signal the movement toward a",Paragraph
more classical approach to design among Finland’s architectural leaders: Eliel Saarinen’s,Paragraph
(the partnership was dissolved by 1907) Helsinki Railroad Station (1914) and Lars,Paragraph
Sonck’s Helsinki Stock Exchange (1911). Both works have a classical restraint and,Paragraph
control and eschew the compositional excesses of National Romanticism. Although,Paragraph
"National Romanticism had provided Finland with an international reputation, the style",Paragraph
seemed regressive and heavy. The younger architects desired to generate a purer and,Paragraph
more rational form of expression. The exaggerations of National Romanticism gave way,Paragraph
to a classicizing tendency emergent throughout Scandinavia before World War I.,Paragraph
Finnish classicism of the 1920s is exemplified by the use of simply proportioned,Paragraph
"geometric volumes with sparsely decorated stucco surfaces. The flat, stuccoed surfaces",Paragraph
with crisply modeled classical appointments recall the neoclassicism of early 18th-,Paragraph
century Finnish architects Carl Ludwig Engel and Carlo Bassi and the simple classically,Paragraph
inspired architecture found in the towns and villages throughout Italy. Despite their,Paragraph
"classical uniforms, the buildings of the 1920s contain a number of nonclassical",Paragraph
"characteristics. The plan orders are often distorted, making use of asymmetrical",Paragraph
compositions rather than axial or symmetrical ones. A freer disposition of plan elements,Paragraph
occurs to accommodate both functional necessities and the exigencies of context. The,Paragraph
"work of Hilding Ekelund, J.S.Siren, Erik Bryggman, Sigurd Frosterus, and Alvar and",Paragraph
Aino Aalto embrace this direction.,Paragraph
"Two major works, J.S.Siren’s Finnish Parliament House (1931) and Sigurd Frosterus’s",Paragraph
"Stockmann’s department store (1930), both in Helsinki, are serious realizations of Nordic",Paragraph
"classicism. The Parliament House, with its columned front surmounting a monumental",Paragraph
"flight of stairs, is an essay in restraint and repose. The interiors are well resolved and",Paragraph
"expertly detailed, creating an integrated work of form, space, and decoration. The",Paragraph
Stockmann’s department store is more muscular in bearing because of its use of masonry.,Paragraph
"The massive vertical brick facade, clear profiles, and culminating copper roof are",Paragraph
"balanced by the large, skylit interior central space.",Paragraph
Four women architects made major contributions during this period: Eva Kuhlefet-,Paragraph

Commercial buildings in addition to housing complexes were executed in,Paragraph

Finnish Functionalism,Title
Finnish awareness of the new ideas emerging from continental Europe began in the,Paragraph
"1920s, as Scandinavian journals began publishing the work of the French, German,",Paragraph
"Dutch, and Russian avant-garde. At this time, Finnish architects were especially open to",Paragraph
currents from the outside and willing to participate in theoretical and polemical,Paragraph
"discussions. Architects such as Alvar and Aalto and Erik Bryggman, among others,",Paragraph
traveled throughout Europe to visit the seminal works of the new architecture and to,Paragraph
attend meetings of CIAM (Congrés Internationaux d’Architecture Moderne). In,Paragraph
"particular, Aalto’s firsthand knowledge of avant-garde developments not only was",Paragraph
instrumental in the promulgation of Finnish functionalism but quickly established him as,Paragraph
among its leaders.,Paragraph
"Accepting both the formal canons and the social programs of modernism, Finnish",Paragraph
functionalism was characterized by use of the “free” plan; the separation of structure,Paragraph
"from building envelope, with the structure (usually of concrete) being detached from the",Paragraph
"“free” facade; and a machine imagery created by tautskinned, white cubic volumes with",Paragraph
minimalistic industrial detailing. The architects further accepted the modern bias for,Paragraph
"buildings sited in open, park-like settings. In built works as well as in proposals, portions",Paragraph
of extant urban fabric were opened to automobile access and the perceived health-giving,Paragraph
"qualities of sun, air, and greenery.",Paragraph
Although a number of Finns directly experienced the major new works on the,Paragraph
Continent—which led to extremely sophisti-cated buildings being executed in this small,Paragraph
country—Aalto’s knowledge of his peers’ work and his quick assimilation of,Paragraph
modernism’s industrial detailing techniques were wryly commented on by Hilding,Paragraph
Ekelund in 1930: “With the same enthusiasm as the academics of the 1880s drew Roman,Paragraph
"baroque portals, Gothic pinnacles, etc. in their sketchbooks for use in their architectural",Paragraph

"Hotel (1936) in Rovaniemi, one of the most important works of the period. The “Glass",Paragraph

examples of the acceptance of functionalism in Finland.,Paragraph
"Although many architects continued to actively embrace functionalism, criticism of its",Paragraph
propositions began to emerge during the mid- to late 1930s. This criticism initially,Paragraph
concerned tectonics and materiality. As modernist works appeared in Finland and the,Paragraph
"forces of nature and the effect of climate began to act on them, architects questioned the",Paragraph
advisability of using Mediterranean-inspired building forms in the harsh northern,Paragraph

production (Aino Aalto died of cancer in 1949). Erik Bryggman’s elegant,Paragraph
Resurrection Chapel (1940) in Turku is another example of this movement,Paragraph
toward a more experiential and tactile architecture. In both the Villa,Paragraph

"reinforced his international standing and independent direction. However, Finland during",Paragraph
the 1950s and 1960s was more than Aalto.,Paragraph
"Whereas Aalto went his own way, the majority of Finnish architects continued to",Paragraph
practice an evolved form of modernism influenced by Mies van der Rohe and others.,Paragraph
Their buildings are characterized by their direct approach in the use of reinforced,Paragraph
"concrete and steel along with brick and wood, coupled with rational planning and",Paragraph
"organizational techniques. Examples include Viljo Revell’s Palace Hotel (1952, with",Paragraph
Keijo Petaja) in Helsinki and Vatiala Cemetery Chapel (1962); the numerous housing,Paragraph

Ruusuvuori’s Hyvinkaa Church (1961) and Huutoniemi Church (1964). Less Romantic in,Paragraph
"conception than Aalto’s contemporaneous works, these buildings expanded the rationalist",Paragraph
aspect of modernism while incorporating more expressive spatial exploration with a,Paragraph
richer material vocabulary.,Paragraph
"Often, this period in Finnish architectural development is viewed as the quiet, golden",Paragraph
"age of the century, a result of Aalto’s code of not discussing his architecture, coupled",Paragraph
"with the general preference of a material palette relying on brick and wood. However,",Paragraph
"this was not necessarily the norm, and in fact much influence should be accorded the",Paragraph
work and theoretical writings of Aulis Blomstedt. Blomstedt aimed to develop an,Paragraph
"objective theory of architecture that was verified through practice, with simplicity,",Paragraph
"austerity, and abstraction becoming essentials in his designs. His terrace housing complex",Paragraph
(1954) in Tapiola and Worker’s Institute (1959) in Helsinki are essays in his rigorous,Paragraph
"process of thinking and doing, as are a series of abstract graphic and installation pieces",Paragraph

"students—Kristian Gullichsen, Juhani Pallasmaa, Erkki Kairamo, and Kirmo Mikkola,",Paragraph
among others—executed during the 1970s and 1980s.,Paragraph
"New towns were also a feature of Finnish postwar development, especially around",Paragraph
"Helsinki. Because of the city’s growth in the 1950s, a series of planned garden suburban",Paragraph
"developments was created. The most famous was Tapiola Garden City, begun in 1952,",Paragraph
which embraced the Finn’s particular enthusiasm for living close to nature. The plan for,Paragraph
Tapiola comprised three neighborhoods grouped around a city center and separated by,Paragraph
green zones. The shopping and administrative center (1961) was designed by Aarne Ervi.,Paragraph
The housing complexes were done by the best of Finland’s architects: Aulis Blomstedt,Paragraph
"designed flats (1961), terrace houses (1964), and studio housing (1965); Viljo Revell",Paragraph
executed flats (1958) and a complex of tower blocks (1960); Aarno Ruusuvuori designed,Paragraph
the Weilin and Géés print-ing works (1964) and the parish church (1965); and H. and K.,Paragraph
Siren contributed a complex of terrace houses (1959).,Paragraph
"By the late 1960s, Finnish architects were either exploring a more expressive",Paragraph
"modernist language or working toward a more rationalist, abstract form of expression.",Paragraph
The first can be seen in the Helsinki City Theater (1967) by Tima Penttila; the Taivallahti,Paragraph

Sibelius Museum in Turku (1968) by Woldemar Baeckman; and the Kouvola City Hall,Caption

bridge the two: Reima Pietilé and his architect wife Raili Paatelainen.,Paragraph

"Tampere, the “Dipoli” student union (1964) at Otaniemi, and the",Paragraph
Suvikumpu housing (1969) in Tapiola—is both distinctive and,Paragraph
Expressionistic yet rational. Although their work often seems to emerge,Paragraph
"from the site, somewhat akin to Aalto’s, there is still a controlled abstract",Paragraph
"quality to their architectural conceptions, as Pietilé learned much from",Paragraph
Blomstedt and was influenced by his writings and thinking. After the,Paragraph
"critical success of these projects, Pietila had a decade-long hiatus in his",Paragraph
work and did not receive a significant building project in Finland until the,Paragraph
commission for the Hervanta Community Complex in suburban Tampere,Caption

The Past Quarter-Century,Title
Contemporary Finnish architects carry forward both the rational and the expressive,Paragraph
threads present in the past half-century of architectural production. The best work,Paragraph

the wall as the primary organizing element in his architecture.,Paragraph
Juhani Pallasmaa took a breather from architecture for about a decade. He was director,Paragraph
of the Museum of Finnish Architecture for five years and spent much time writing on the,Paragraph
theory and philosophy of architecture and doing graphic design and artistic projects.,Paragraph
"When he returned to architecture, his work, as best witnessed in his Rovaniemi Art",Paragraph

"The work of Arkkitehdit Ky runs a range of expressive techniques, depending on",Paragraph
"which of the design principals—Kristian Gullichsen, Erikki Kairamo, or Timo",Paragraph
"Vormala—is in charge of the project. Gullichsen’s work, best seen in his Parish Center",Paragraph

"Kairamo’s work is more “Constructivist” in expression, as demonstrated in his",Paragraph
semidetached houses (1990) in Espoo and the much celebrated Itakeskus Tower and,Paragraph
Commercial Center (1987) in Helsinki. Vormala’s architecture is more vernacular and,Paragraph
"traditional in expression, yet it is grounded in modernism, as seen in the apartment",Paragraph
"complex (1980) in Varisto, Ventaa, and the block of flats (1984) in the Nakinpuisto",Paragraph

"FISKER, KAY 1893-1965",Title
"Architect, Denmark",Title
Kay Fisker was one of the early proponents of functionalism in Danish architecture.,Paragraph
Taking his point of departure from the early 20th-century Danish Neoclassicism so,Paragraph
"prevalent in the 1910s and 1920s, he developed a type of functional building design",Paragraph
"specific to the Danish language of materials. In this way, Fisker took his inspiration first",Paragraph
from functional theorist and practitioner Louis Sullivan and only later from his,Paragraph
"contemporaries among the European architects, such as Mies van der Rohe, Walter",Paragraph
"Gropius, and Le Corbusier. Fisker’s successful bridging of these two styles in his practice",Paragraph
"(with partner C.F.Moller from 1930 to 1941), along with his steadfast promotion of",Paragraph
functionalist ideals in his teaching at the Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen and,Paragraph
"abroad and as a writer for architectural publications (including the Danish journal ),",Paragraph
proves his place as one of the most influential figures in modern architecture in Denmark,Paragraph
is justified.,Paragraph
Fisker first melded regional expression with functionalist principles in a student,Paragraph
"project, with Aage Rafn, for a small railroad station (1915) on the island of Bornholm. A",Paragraph
"study in form, the end-gabled station, with little architectural detail other than patterning",Paragraph
"of the brick exterior, set the stage for Fisker’s drawing on traditional Danish building",Paragraph
types for his simplified structures. Fisker was able to expand on his application of,Paragraph
"functionalist principles to large-scale architecture beginning in the 1920s, specifically, on",Paragraph
new forms of housing called for after the world wars. It is for his work in this area that,Paragraph
Fisker is best known today.,Paragraph
"The housing shortage in Denmark, particularly in Copenhagen, after World War I led",Paragraph
to substantial government funds allotted to large-scale housing projects. Fisker’s early,Paragraph
housing block Hornbzekhus (1922) helped define a new type of structure meeting the,Paragraph
"needs of modern Danes. The architect conceived of this rectangular apartment block,",Paragraph
"which enclosed a large central garden, as a series of identical apartment modules, both",Paragraph
"modern ideas at the time. This early solution, however, expressed functionalism through",Paragraph
the lingering vocabulary of Neoclassicism. The symmetrical brick exterior is broken only,Paragraph
by marching rows of uniform windows running across the entire facade of the building.,Paragraph
"Fisker’s early publication with F.R.Yerbury, (1927), championed the neoclassical as",Paragraph
"the most appropriate style of the day. It is this sense of regularity, of preoccupation with",Paragraph
"massing and form, that remained the hallmark of Fisker’s architecture even after he",Paragraph
abandoned the neoclassical style in the 1930s.,Paragraph
"The introduction of international functionalism, introduced through exhibitions in",Paragraph
"Berlin and Stockholm in 1930, provided Denmark with a break from Neoclassicism. This",Paragraph
new practical vocabulary had a decisive effect on the direction of Fisker’s later apartment,Paragraph
"houses and other structures. After some experimentation, Fisker applied a more attractive",Paragraph
and humanistic solution to the blocks of flats while still retaining their regional qualities.,Paragraph
"His Vestersohus housing project (1935, 1938) features brick facades broken up with",Paragraph
"rectangular projecting balconies paired with windows, giving the structure a pleasing",Paragraph
proportion and appearance. This was no mean task with such an inherently long and,Paragraph
"monotonous building type, although by this time the enclosed street block, seen in",Paragraph
"Hornbzekhus, had been abandoned. Fisker, in his 1948 article “The History of Domestic",Paragraph
"Architecture in Denmark,” described this new functional aspect of balconies as helping to",Paragraph
"“accentuate facades in the rhythm of the new architectural style, facades which...were to",Paragraph
"give honest expression to the plan behind them” (Fisker, 1948). This break from",Paragraph
classicism also led to siting becoming a more important aspect of Danish modern,Paragraph
"architecture, especially on the newly developed outskirts of Copenhagen. Vestersohus, by",Paragraph
"example, is picturesquely placed with its main facade facing a Copenhagen lake. In",Paragraph
"addition, the state’s involvement with these residential estates meant that it exercised",Paragraph
"aesthetic control, employing the same architects for later additions to ensure visual unity.",Paragraph
"In the period following World War II, Fisker made significant contributions to the new",Paragraph
trend of terraced apartment houses of smaller separate units set about in a parklike area.,Paragraph
The grouping of several smaller housing blocks together throughout such massive estates,Paragraph
became a typical way of breaking up the monotony of large-scale residential projects,Paragraph
while providing more light and a neighborhood feel. Buildings in these complex,Paragraph
developments related to the natural site and to one another in a way that the long housing,Paragraph
"blocks could not. Fisker’s Voldparken estate (Husum, 1949-51) is a celebrated example",Paragraph
of this type of housing block evolution in which the previously mentioned solutions are,Paragraph
"applied. Fisker again concentrated on overall form and massing, keeping in mind native",Paragraph
"qualities. Each house, for example, is constructed of warm indigenous brick with a hip",Paragraph
roof. The long facades are again relieved through Fisker’s use of balconies that,Paragraph
ingeniously project from the building at an angle. Fisker also designed a school (1951-,Paragraph
57) at Voldparken.,Caption
Many of the qualities of Fisker’s large-scale housing projects were appropriate for his,Paragraph
"most well known project. In 1931, Fisker, along with partner C.F.Maller and Povl",Paragraph
"Stegmann, won the competition for the new Arhus University campus (1932-68) in",Paragraph
"Arhus, Denmark. It was only the country’s second university, and the state broke with the",Paragraph
"classical, formal situation of an urban campus in favor of a modern one. The setting was",Paragraph
"undeveloped land marked by rolling hills, existing groves of trees, and glacial streams",Paragraph
that were dammed to create two small lakes. The university buildings were to be,Paragraph
informally nestled into this park setting while respecting the natural terrain. The,Paragraph
"architects strove for uniformity in the architectural vocabulary of the structures, and this",Paragraph
program was adhered to in later additions (Stegmann left the project in 1937 and Fisker,Paragraph
"in 1945, after which C.F.Maller was the sole architect). Fisker’s university buildings",Paragraph
"again recall traditional Danish structures, with their cubist forms, pitched roofs of yellow",Paragraph
"tiles, and unbroken yellow-brick exteriors, but on a much larger scale. Therefore, the",Paragraph
"buildings, beginning with the strong, unornamented Institute for Chemistry, Physics, and",Paragraph
"Anatomy (1932-33), although clearly expressing the new functionalism, still project the",Paragraph
monumental qualities typical of Fisker’s work.,Paragraph
The transition between Neoclassicism and Danish functionalism in Fisker’s,Paragraph
"architecture can also be traced in his silver designs for A.Michelsen in the 1920s, whereas",Paragraph
his domestic and ship interiors display a more modern progressivism. This influence can,Paragraph
"be seen in the work of his students, such as Jorn Utzon, who went on to international",Paragraph

FLATIRON BUILDING,Title
Designed by D.H. Burnham and Company; completed 1903,Caption
"New York, New York",Caption
"With its striking shape, prominent location, and exceptional height, the Flatiron",Paragraph
Building was one of New York’s most discussed and distinctive skyscrapers at the,Paragraph
beginning of the 20th century. It was originally named the Fuller Building after the,Paragraph
"George A.Fuller Company, which had served as the building’s developer and builder and",Paragraph
was one of its original occupants until moving to a new building in 1929. From its lofty,Paragraph
"quarters, the New York office of the Fuller Company oversaw as general contractors the",Paragraph
"construction of several of the city’s most prominent buildings. However, few called this",Paragraph
skyscraper the Fuller Building; the triangular lot from which this tower rises quickly led,Paragraph
"to the building’s popular moniker, the Flatiron.",Paragraph
The architect of the building was D.H.Burnham and Company of Chicago. Daniel,Paragraph
H.Burnham (1846-1912) had established himself as one of America’s most prominent,Paragraph
"architects and planners. By the time the Flatiron was being designed and built (1901-03),",Paragraph
"Burnham was devoting much of his time to big plans. Among other things, he played an",Paragraph
important role in the development of the Senate Park Commission Plan (1901-02) for,Paragraph
"Washington, D.C. Concurrently, his large architectural office was designing numerous",Paragraph
buildings across the country. Burnham oversaw the operation but left much of the,Paragraph
"creative work to several talented designers in the firm, including Frederick P.Dinkelberg,",Paragraph
who appears to have had an important hand in the architectural design of the Flatiron.,Paragraph
"At 21 stories or 307 feet tall, the Flatiron Building was one of the taller skyscrapers in",Paragraph

"York, after the pioneering efforts of the Chicago School (in which Burnham and his",Paragraph
former partner John W. Root had played a key role). The limestone and terra cotta that,Paragraph
cover the building are of the same light monochrome. The rustication and heavily,Paragraph
"ornamented patterns of these walls, as well as the conservatively sized windows, give the",Paragraph
"facades a heavy appearance, even though these are not load-bearing walls. The multistory",Paragraph
"oriels in the midsection, which are prominent in many of Burnham’s Chicago buildings,",Paragraph
"are just barely perceptible on the busy, more enclosed skin of the Flatiron. This greater",Paragraph
visual weight becomes especially evident in comparison with Burnham’s earlier and even,Paragraph
his contemporary work in Chicago. It is as if this Midwest-bred approach to skyscraper,Paragraph
design became more formal when it came east to New York.,Paragraph
"Stylistically, the design of the Flatiron draws from the classical tradition, with French",Paragraph
Renaissance motifs. Ever since Burnham played a pivotal role in the staging of the 1893,Paragraph
"World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, he became increasingly enamored with",Paragraph
"Beaux-Arts classicism, an attraction that found its broadest expression in his involvement",Paragraph
in the City Beautiful movement. The Flatiron is a vertical extension of a Renaissance,Paragraph
"palazzo: the tripartition of the overall design into a distinct base, a repetitive midsection,",Paragraph
"and a crowning cornice is now extended over 20 stories, making the whole appear",Paragraph
"column-like. If the Flatiron had been a building of a more traditional height, it could have",Paragraph
fit comfortably in a contemporary City Beautiful plan with radial avenues carving,Paragraph
triangular lots in a Parisian manner. But the Flatiron is not of a traditional scale. Its,Paragraph
enormous height stretches its classical garb uneasily. It is not a part of a larger,Paragraph
"choreographed urban ensemble; in fact, it stands isolated as a freestanding tower on its",Paragraph
"own small urban island bound by 22nd Street, Broadway, and Fifth Avenue. The diagonal",Paragraph
slice that Broadway makes through Manhattan’s grid as it skirts past Madison Square,Paragraph
"creates the site’s right triangle. The long, thin triangular footprint of the Flatiron extrudes",Paragraph
"up through all its stories. With all three fagades facing streets, this tall, thin building was",Paragraph
designed to always have very well-lit office spaces.,Paragraph
The most acute angle of the Flatiron points north. Early 20th-century commentators,Paragraph
often likened this sharply curved corner of the building to a ship’s prow. When seen at an,Paragraph
"angle from Madison Square, the building can appear to have little depth, like a wall",Paragraph
leaned precariously against the sky. The gravity-defying illusion of the building is further,Paragraph
"enhanced by the enormous cornice projecting aggressively from the top of the building,",Paragraph
giving the whole affair a top-heavy appearance. Although the building is in the flat-,Paragraph
"topped tradition of the Chicago School, its arrow-like north angle can make the Flatiron",Paragraph
appear as if its horizontal cornice is pointing skyward in photographs. The striking visual,Paragraph
presence of this uncommon vertical mass is what made the building instantly famous,Paragraph
both with tourists and those in the arts grappling with the nature of New York’s,Paragraph
modernity. Did D.H. Burnham and Company intend all of this drama in the Flatiron?,Paragraph
Perhaps not; the elements of the design fit in comfortably with the general development,Paragraph
"of the firm. It was the unconventional triangular lot, coupled with exceptional height, that",Paragraph
transformed architectural conventions into something unique.,Paragraph
"In the first years after completion, the Flatiron Building received",Paragraph
considerable attention from various sources. In 1903 the,Paragraph

Flatiron. Photographs by Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen taken soon after the,Caption

"In 1903 the Flatiron stood in relative isolation near Madison Square, since the city’s",Paragraph

"FRANK, JOSEF 1885-1967",Title
"Architect, Austria",Title
Josef Frank was among the leading Austrian representatives of the Modern movement.,Paragraph
He was a founding member of the Congrés Internationaux d’Architecture Moderne,Paragraph
"(CIAM), and, as vice president of the Austrian Werkbund, he oversaw the planning and",Paragraph
"construction of the 1932 Vienna Werkbundsiedlung. In the early 1930s, however, Frank",Paragraph
emerged as one of the most important and vocal critics of what he saw as the totalitarian,Paragraph
"orthodoxy within the various strands of modernism. For the remainder of his life, until he",Paragraph
"stopped practicing in the early 1960s, he sought alternatives to what he perceived as the",Paragraph
banality and uniformity of much of the building of his time.,Paragraph
"Frank studied architecture with Carl Kénig, Max Fabiani, and others at the Vienna",Paragraph
"Technische Hochschule, graduating in 1910 with a dissertation on the churches of Leon",Paragraph
"Battista Alberti. While still a student, he flirted briefly with the Art Nouveau (Jugendstil),",Paragraph
but he soon abandoned the style in favor of the renewed historical eclecticism that,Paragraph
dominated much of Central European design in the period after 1905. Around 1909 Frank,Paragraph
"formed a partnership with two of his former classmates from the Technische Hochschule,",Paragraph
"Oskar Strnad and Oskar Wlach. Together, the three young architects specialized in",Paragraph
"houses and interiors for the city’s In the period just prior to 1914, Frank realized",Paragraph
"several houses, mostly notably the Scholl House (1913-14), which, despite its lingering",Paragraph
"neoclassicism, showed marked parallels with Adolf Loos’s stark pre war villas. Frank,",Paragraph
"however, was much more radical in the composition of his facades and furnishings,",Paragraph
which often relied on complex and asymmetrical arrangements.,Paragraph
"After World War I, Frank devoted himself to finding solutions to Vienna’s severe",Paragraph
housing shortage. In the early 1920s he designed a series of housing projects in and,Paragraph
around Vienna that were based on the ideas of reduction and repetition. Frank’s early,Paragraph
"postwar works continued to draw on historical precedents, but by 1921 he began to",Paragraph
"develop a simplified form language, one that reflected the growing development of",Paragraph
(objective) architecture throughout Central Europe. This was especially evident in,Paragraph
"Frank’s designs for several apartment buildings for the Vienna municipality, including",Paragraph
"the Wiedenhofer-Hof (1924—25) and the Winarsky-Hof (1924-26). The housing blocks,",Paragraph
which were published in many of the leading international architectural journals of the,Paragraph
"time, brought Frank increasing notoriety and led to an invitation from Ludwig Mies van",Paragraph
der Rohe to participate in the 1927 Weissenhofsiedlung in Stuttgart.,Paragraph
"Frank’s contribution to the Weissenhof exhibition, a double house, was widely lauded",Paragraph
for its straightforward appearance and innovative constructional ideas. Frank’s colorful,Paragraph
"and florid interiors, however, which included furnishings and textiles from his shop Haus",Paragraph
"and Garten (House and Garden; founded in 1925 with Wlach), drew strong criticism from",Paragraph
many of the other participants and observers who condemned them for being,Paragraph
"“conservative,” “feminine,” “obtrusive,” and “middle class.” Frank responded to the",Paragraph
charges in an article titled “Der Gschnas fiirs G’mut und der Gschnas als Problem”,Paragraph
"(“Frippery for the Soul and Frippery as a Problem”), in which he argued that the stripped-",Paragraph
"down, functionalist style of the radical modernists simply did not respond to most",Paragraph
people’s psychological needs. He repeated these criticisms in his book (1931;,Paragraph
[Architecture as Symbol: Elements of German Modern Architecture]). Many of Frank’s,Paragraph
subsequent designs similarly constituted immanent responses to the modernist vanguard.,Paragraph
"Because of the poor state of the Austrian economy in the postwar period, Frank was",Paragraph
"able to realize only a handful of residences for private clients, the most import of which",Paragraph
was the Villa Beer (1928-30) in Vienna. Like Loos’s famed (space plan) houses of the,Paragraph
"1920s and early 1930s, the three-and-a half-story residence consisted of intricate",Paragraph
"arrangement of inter-locking volumes on different levels, and it stands, along with Loos’s",Paragraph
"Miiller House and Mies’ Tugendhat House, as one of the most significant modernist",Paragraph
explorations of the possibilities of a new spatial ordering.,Paragraph
"In 1933, in response to the Nazi seizure of power in Germany and the growth of anti-",Paragraph
"Semitism in Austria, Frank immigrated to Sweden and settled in Stockholm, where he",Paragraph
became the chief designer for the interior design firm Svenskt Tenn. He continued to,Paragraph
"produce designs for houses into the early 1960s, but increasingly after 1937 he devoted",Paragraph
"himself to furniture design, churning out hundreds of ideas for chairs, tables, and cabinets",Paragraph
"as well as textiles, rugs, and other objects for the home. The softened, cozy eclecticism",Paragraph
that Frank developed in his designs for Svenskt Tenn was widely admired and imitated,Paragraph
throughout Scandinavia and contributed to the rise of what later became known as,Paragraph
Swedish or Scandinavian modern design.,Paragraph
"From 1941 to 1946, Frank lived in New York City, but he was unable to establish",Paragraph
"himself in the United States, and he returned to Sweden and resumed his work for",Paragraph
"Svenskt Tenn. Frank continued to reflect on the problems of modern architecture,",Paragraph
"however, and in the late 1940s and early 1950s he produced a series of designs for houses",Paragraph
based on the principles of nonorthogonal geometry and chance ordering. He spelled out,Paragraph
"these ideas in a manifesto titled “Accidentism,” which was published in the Swedish",Paragraph
"design review in 1958. By that time, Frank was largely a forgotten figure, and his bold",Paragraph
proposals attracted little attention. Many of his ideas for an architecture of complexity,Paragraph
"and contradiction, however, presaged the rise of Postmodernism in the 1960s.",Paragraph

"an architect, Fuller has been accepted within the architectural profession, receiving",Paragraph
numerous awards and honorary degrees. He thought of himself as a comprehensive,Paragraph
"human in the universe, implementing research for the good of humanity. Born in Milton,",Paragraph
"Massachusetts, on 12 July 1895, he was the son of Richard Buckminster Fuller, Sr., and",Paragraph
"Caroline Wolcott (Andrews) Fuller. His father, who worked as a leather and tea merchant",Paragraph
"with offices in Boston, died when Fuller was 15 years of age. Fuller’s first design",Paragraph
"revelation came to him when, in kindergarten in 1899, he built his first flat-space frame,",Paragraph
"an octet truss constructed of dried peas and toothpicks. As a boy, vacationing at his",Paragraph
"family’s summerhouse on Bear Island, Maine, he became an adequate seaman and",Paragraph
developed an appreciation of nature’s provision of principles of efficient design. He,Paragraph
"followed the philosophy of Pythagoras and Newton, that the universe comprises signs, or",Paragraph
"patterns of energy relationships, that have an order to them. Fuller used the term",Paragraph
"“valving” for the transformation of these patterns into usable forms. According to Fuller,",Paragraph
these patterns in nature were comprehensive and universal. “Syn-ergy” was the name that,Paragraph
Fuller gave to the integrated behavior patterns discovered in nature.,Paragraph
Fuller attended the Milton Academy (1904—06) and Harvard University (1913-15) and,Paragraph
was expelled twice while at Harvard. He worked in a few industries and then enlisted for,Paragraph
two years of service in the U.S. Navy (1917-19). This experience in industry and with the,Paragraph
"Navy helped him gain knowledge of technical engineering processes, materials, and",Paragraph
"methods of manufacturing, which he would apply this knowledge to future inventions.",Paragraph
"When one of his two daughters, Alexandra, died of influenza at age four (1922), Fuller",Paragraph
"became obsessed with her death. Five years later, on the brink of suicide, he decided",Paragraph
instead to devote the rest of his life to helping humanity by converting ideas and,Paragraph
"technology designed for weaponry into ideas for “livingry.” At the age of 32, he started",Paragraph
"an experiment, Guinea Pig B (the “B” stood for “Bucky,” his nickname), to discover how",Paragraph
an individual with a moral commitment and limited financial means could apply his,Paragraph
knowledge to improve humanity’s living conditions by technological determinism. This,Paragraph
"experiment continued until his death at age 88. Thus, his technological and economica.",Paragraph
resources belonged to society. He believed in the same moralistic drive to develop better,Paragraph
housing for the masses through mass production that many of the European modernists,Paragraph
"did, but Fuller’s forms and design principles were quite different.",Paragraph
"Among the proliferation of books that Fuller published during his life, the",Paragraph
"first, (1928), propagated his lifetime philosophy. The term “4D” meant",Paragraph
"“fourth-dimensional” thinking, adding time to the dimensions of space to",Paragraph
ensure gains for humanity instead of personal gains only. The first patent,Paragraph
"of the 4D designs was a mass-production house, first known as 4D and",Paragraph
later as the Dymaxion House (1927 model; 1928 patent). A hexagonal,Paragraph
"structure supported on a mast, the house was to be air deliverable and",Paragraph
"based on his strategy of “design science,” which sought to obtain",Paragraph

Vehicles (1937) and the Dymaxion Bathroom (1940). Later he developed,Paragraph
"the Dymaxion Deployment Unit (1944), a lightweight corrugated-steel",Paragraph
shelter made from modified grain bins. Thousands of these units were,Paragraph

FUTURISM,Title
"Italian in origin and concept, futurism was first theorized by Filippo Tomaso Marinetti in",Paragraph
a manifesto published on 20 February 1909 in the French daily . Futurism soon became,Paragraph
a movement central to the process of radical artistic renovation carried out by the,Paragraph
European avant-garde. It dealt both with cultural debates specific to Italian art of the first,Paragraph
two decades of the 20th century and with crucial discourses of the European artistic,Paragraph
revival in general. While affecting primarily the arts in the more restrictive sense of the,Paragraph
"term—under the influence of Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carra, Gino Severini, and Mario",Paragraph
Chiattone—its most notable representatives in Italian architecture were Giacomo Balla,Paragraph
"and Antonio Sant’Elia but also, in various degrees, such architects as Adalberto Libera",Paragraph
"and Angiolo Mazzoni, among others. The close collaboration between futurist artists and",Paragraph
architects is evidenced by the fact that the first and only exhibition of futurist architecture,Paragraph
"held in Italy of the period was curated by a painter, Fillia, who also edited journals on",Paragraph
"topics such as “The Futurist City’ and in 1932 wrote a book, in which he gave a",Paragraph
comprehensive view of the significance of the movement.,Paragraph
Most sensitive to the challenges of the new “machinist society” (Le Corbusier) among,Paragraph
"the avant-garde artists and architects, the promoters of futurism were concerned primarily",Paragraph
"with expressing movement and mechanical speed, which they saw as _ essential",Paragraph
determinants of modernity. The futurists extended their artistic vision to the study of the,Paragraph
latest conquest of modern science with an undivided enthusiasm for all of what they,Paragraph
perceived to be radical facts of the contemporary civilization. They rejected emphatically,Paragraph
the old canons of static prespectival representation and invoked instead the redemptive,Paragraph
"force of the universal dynamism brought about by the machine, itself central to the new",Paragraph
forms of visualization.,Paragraph
Such a proposition was translated in architecture first through visionary,Paragraph
representations of cities shaped by speedy automotive vehicles and later through the,Paragraph
redefinition of the Modern movement’s functionalist themes in terms of extreme,Paragraph
"flexibility and mobility (Libera’s imaginary villas, Mazzoni’s control tower for the",Paragraph
"Florentine train station, and Le Corbusier’s inhabited high-ways).",Paragraph
The best-known early projects of futurist architecture are Sant’Elia’s and Mario,Paragraph
Chiatone’s urban experiments exhibited in Milan in 1914. The spatial relationships of the,Paragraph
city fabric were determined in the first place by an elaborate system of monumental,Paragraph
arteries distributed hierarchically through and underneath huge “streamlined”,Paragraph
"skyscrapers, anticipating the post-Art Deco aesthetics of the 1930s, including Libera’s",Paragraph
entrance to the commemorative (1932) or his analogous Italian Pavilion of the 1933,Paragraph
"Century of Progress Exposition, Chicago. Sant’Elia’s pre-World War I “citta nuova”",Caption
"projects informed significantly Marinetti himself, who published commonly regarded",Paragraph
as one of the most important documents of modern Italian architecture.,Paragraph
The thrust that futurism put on solving problems of motorized transportation and its,Paragraph
diversification according to speed and purpose—including strict segregation of pedestrian,Paragraph
circulation—had a significant influence on Le Corbusier’s 1922 speculative,Paragraph
"Contemporary City for Three Million Inhabitants, the touchstone of pre-Chandigarh Le",Paragraph
Corbusian urbanism. This influence can be seen as well in the Amsterdam Rokin project,Paragraph
"by Mart Stam and that of other European architects, Le Corbusier’s Plan Obus in",Paragraph
particular. Whereas at the eve of World War II the early Russian artistic and literary,Paragraph
avant-garde evolved a genre with a similar name—the Cubo-Futurism of Kasimir,Paragraph
"Malevich, Khruchenikh, and Khlebnikov—with little significant connection with the",Paragraph
"Italian movement proper, the postrevolutionary Soviet Constructivism (Chernikhov’s",Paragraph
"mechanical architecture, Melnikov’s dynamic garages and exploded _ theaters,",Paragraph
"Mayakovsky’s “urban poetry,” or Dziga Vertov’s cinematic constructions) played a",Paragraph
significant role in the development of futurism in Italy (Libera’s and Giuseppe Terragni’s,Paragraph
rooms at the 1932 ).,Paragraph
"After Dusseldorf, where he designed the interior of the Lowenstein house, Balla",Paragraph
"conceived the interior of the via Milano Bal-Tic-Tac ballroom (1921) in Rome, often",Paragraph
seen as the first experiment in avant-garde architectural aesthetic in Rome. Vit-torio,Paragraph
"Marchi, who wrote two books on futurist architecture in 1924 and 1928, designed the",Paragraph
Pirandello Theater in Rome.,Caption
"In Italy, where modern and experimental architecture was never banished under",Paragraph
Fascism—and indeed was favored by Mussolini—the futurists emphatically tied their fate,Paragraph
"to the new regime and imploded with it in time. Still, the extraordinary mass development",Paragraph
of automobile circulation after the country recovered from the disasters of both war and,Paragraph
"Fascism and the increased need, under the circumstances, for pedestrian segregation",Paragraph
along with the desire to emphasize the particular urban character of mechanized,Paragraph
transportation have led urban planners since the early 1960s in Italy to search back for the,Paragraph
