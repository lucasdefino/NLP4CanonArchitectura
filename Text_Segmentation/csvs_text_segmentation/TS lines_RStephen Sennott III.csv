PAIMIO SANATORIUM,Title
Designed by Alvar Aalto and Aino Aalto; completed 1933,Caption
"Paimio, Finland",Title
"The Tuberculosis Sanatorium in Paimio, Finland, the contract won in competition by",Paragraph
"Finnish architects Alvar and Aino Aalto in 1929, completed in 1933, synthesized two",Paragraph
"potent modernist agendas. First, the design embraces modernism’s utopian social",Paragraph
"commitment and its deep confidence in rational design processes. Second, the building",Paragraph
expresses explicitly the elemental organizational tactics of functionalist architecture and,Paragraph
"its concomitant machine imagery. Metaphorically, if Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye was a",Paragraph
"machine for living in, the Aaltos’ Paimio Sanatorium was a machine for becoming",Paragraph
healthier in.,Paragraph
"Following World War L, avant-garde architects proclaimed the emergence of a spirited",Paragraph
"and vital new, modern age. This was to be a more orderly and healthy age, brought forth",Paragraph
by applying the lessons of modern industrial technique and rational thinking to the,Paragraph
outlived historicism of prewar architecture as well as to the disorder and squalor of,Paragraph
existing urban environments. Rooted in a strong sense of social commitment and relying,Paragraph
"on the effectiveness of serial production and rational processes as design strategies,",Paragraph
"modern architects sought a better, healthier world. The Aaltos’ Tuberculosis Sanatorium",Paragraph
at Paimio was both a symbol of the social role of the new architecture and a potent visual,Paragraph
paradigm of the new world that modern architecture intended to bring into being.,Paragraph
Sun. Light. Fresh air. The physical presence of these natural elements informed the,Paragraph
basis of building design and engendered the qualities of good health associated with,Paragraph
"modernist social thinking. Moreover, as a polemic, sun, light, and fresh air were vital",Paragraph
"images of the modern, healthier world. Few other building types were as convincing a",Paragraph
symbol of modern architecture as was the sanatorium. The actual medical treatment for,Paragraph
"tuberculosis at the time—lots of sun, light, and fresh air—provided a strong image base",Paragraph
for the design of the building and coincided with the metaphor of “health” central to,Paragraph
modernist thought.,Paragraph
The completion of the Paimio Sanatorium acknowledged Alvar Aalto’s prominent,Paragraph
place among the modem architects of the day because it bore witness to his,Paragraph
understanding and mastery of modernism’s social as well as compositional tenets.,Paragraph
"However, the sanatorium was not the Aaltos’ first modernist work. Having fostered",Paragraph
"connections to the international avant-garde in the mid-1920s, they moved their office to",Paragraph
the city of Turku in 1927 and completed two important “functionalist” works.,Paragraph
"“Functionalism” was the term used by Finnish architects to label the new, modern",Paragraph
architecture. The first important work was the Standard Apartment Building in Turku,Paragraph
"(1929), and the second was the Turun Sanomat Newspaper Building (1927), which was",Paragraph
the first work in Finland to incorporate Le Corbusier’s “Five Points of a New,Paragraph
"Architecture,” setting the Aaltos apart from their contemporaries. During this period, the",Paragraph
Aaltos were active advocates and propagandists for Finnish functionalism.,Paragraph
"Conceptually, the Paimio Sanatorium is a straightforward modernist composition: an",Paragraph
articulated but linked set of relatively discrete functional elements expressed in both plan,Paragraph
"and volumes. The building complex is functionally zoned, with each element placed in",Paragraph
the landscape according to its requirement for sun and view. The primary functional,Paragraph
"elements include the patient’s wing, comprised of an elongated suite of rooms with an",Paragraph
"open-air terrace extension, and the communal dining and assembly areas. These two",Paragraph
"pieces are linked by a seven-story volume, the entry, and control area, which houses the",Paragraph
vertical circulation. A circulation passage connects through these elements to the service,Paragraph
"area—with its expressed water tank, smokestack, and staircase—which in turn joins the",Paragraph
garage. The housing units for both the doctors and the staff are separated from the main,Paragraph
"building, being located in the surrounding forest. We have, then, the rational and orderly",Paragraph
composition of differimg human activities rendered into a highly visible and expressed set,Paragraph
of spaces and forms.,Paragraph
The Aaltos employed the material vocabulary that came to be associated with the,Paragraph
"modernist machine aesthetic: concrete, white stucco, steel, and glass. The overall image",Paragraph
of the building comes from its concrete frame rendered in white stucco. The whiteness,Paragraph
not only stands in contrast to the fir forest setting in which it is located but also provides,Paragraph
an image of cleanliness and healthiness. Each activity volume incorporates a different,Paragraph
"glazing pattern to articulate its particular function, further reinforcing the elemental",Paragraph
"nature of the organization. The industrial glazing, with its steel sash and serially produced",Paragraph
"image, complements the pipe-rail balustrades painted in primary colors; the bright,",Paragraph
colorful awnings; and other machined elements that give the building a somewhat,Paragraph
nautical quality.,Paragraph
"Despite its mechanistic appearance, Paimio went beyond the conventions of modernist",Paragraph
"elemental composition. Volumetrically and in plan, its discrete elements are not unified",Paragraph
"geometrically or orthogonally, as in Gropius’s more regularized Bauhaus building (1926),",Paragraph
but form a more haptic pattern: a chain of architectural pieces in the landscape.,Paragraph
Eschewing the modernist tendency to place buildings as isolated elements on the,Paragraph
"landscape, Paimio appears as a dialogue between the internal world of space and activity",Paragraph
"and the exterior concerns of context and form. For example, the patient wing and",Paragraph
"communal areas splay away from each other to form a cour de hounor, allowing the entry",Paragraph
"court with its undulating canopy to gain more spatial prominence. Although the white,",Paragraph
"rational image stands in contrast to the deep green forest, the sanatorium is actually a sun",Paragraph
"trap. The patient wing, facing southeast, provides each patient with morning sunlight. The",Paragraph
open-air terraces at the east end of the wing have been rotated further south to catch more,Paragraph
"sun. The dining and lounge area is oriented, with equal care, to receive the sun at",Paragraph
different times during the day.,Paragraph
"Paimio is not without precedent, for the Aaltos were traveling throughout Europe,",Paragraph
meeting with the avant-garde architects and artists during the period of its design.,Paragraph
Influences from the Dutch architect Jan Duiker and his Zonnestraal Sanatorium (1926—,Paragraph
"28), the French architects Andre Lurcat and Le Corbusier, and Russian constructivism are",Paragraph
evident in the work. Yet it was the Aaltos’ ability to meld these influences into an,Paragraph
"independent synthesis that is extraordinary. Moreover, their entry for the earlier",Paragraph
"Kinkomaa Sanatorium competition (1927) used a similar elemental composition strategy,",Paragraph
whereas their later competition entries for the Kalvid Sanatorium (1929) and the Zagrev,Paragraph
Central Hospital (1931) demonstrate further refinement of the ideas seen in Paimio. The,Paragraph
sanatorium stands as witness to the Aaltos’ mastery of modernist design canons and,Paragraph
"social programs, and its functionalist expression placed their name with those of Gropius,",Paragraph
"Mies van der Rohe, and Le Corbusier, among others, in the international scene of the day.",Paragraph
The development of detail in Paimio is extraordinary. Attention was paid to the venting,Paragraph
"of the windows, panel heating elements, nonsplash washbasins, and light fixtures that did",Paragraph
not cast light into a bedridden patient’s eyes. The suite of furnishings developed for,Paragraph
"Paimio—chairs and tables incorporating continuously curved, bentwood frames and",Paragraph
"backs and made of laminated, molded birch—represent the culmination of a series of",Paragraph
"furniture studies and wood experiments that began in 1927. In the Paimio furniture, the",Paragraph
Aaltos combined serial production with Finnish laminated plywood technology. The free-,Paragraph
form quality of these pieces informed his buildings immediately following the sanatorium,Paragraph
and signaled their movement away from functionalist tenets toward the more personal,Paragraph
style that emerged in the late 1930s.,Paragraph

PALACE OF THE SOVIETS,Title
COMPETITION (1931),Title
The 1931 competition for the Palace of the Soviets in Moscow represents a turning point,Paragraph
in Soviet architecture. The competition prefaced the gradual demise of the Soviet avant-,Paragraph
garde movement known as Constructivism and the rise of a more historically attuned,Paragraph
approach to architecture that dominated in the Soviet Union up to and beyond the Cold,Paragraph
"War. More specifically, the competition rejected the modernist aesthetic in favor of a new",Paragraph
"architectural language, which was officially endorsed in 1937 at the First Conference of",Paragraph
Soviet Architects and was known as “socialist realism.”,Paragraph
"Ostensibly, the Palace of the Soviets was intended to celebrate the anticipated",Paragraph
completion of the first Five Year Plan (to occur in 1933). The Palace of the Soviets,Paragraph
competition was also a deliberate Soviet response to the international competition for the,Paragraph
"headquarters of the League of Nations, held in Geneva four years earlier. The project was",Paragraph
influenced heavily by the government and implemented by the Palace Construction,Paragraph
"Council, a subsidiary of the Party Central Committee. The competition brief for the",Paragraph
"building, which was developed by the Construction Council, called for a range of cultural",Paragraph
and political spaces. The primary function of the Palace was to house the nation’s highest,Paragraph
"governing body, the elected assembly of the Supreme Soviet. In addition, it was also",Paragraph
"intended to support Revolutionary festivals, conferences and musical and theatrical",Paragraph
"productions. The building included two large halls (one seating 15000 people, the other",Paragraph
"6000), two smaller halls each seating 500 people, and two more seating 200 people. The",Paragraph
brief called for a new relationship between form and content that was capable of,Paragraph
"representing socialist doctrine, class struggle, and the dominance of the proletariat. The",Paragraph
"site chosen for the competition was on the Moskva River in Moscow, and it was decided",Paragraph
that the Cathedral of the Christ-Savior (built between 1838 and 1880 to celebrate the,Paragraph
Russian defeat of Napoleon) would be demolished to create a new site southwest of the,Paragraph
Kremlin for the Palace.,Caption
"Initially, in February 1931, 12 Soviet architects were invited to submit proposals for a",Paragraph
preliminary closed round of the competition. The prominent Soviet modernist and,Paragraph
"Constructivist schools of SASS (formally OSA), ASNOVA, and ARU as well as the rival",Paragraph
school of VOPRA all submitted team proposals (at the request of the Construction,Paragraph
"Council). Individual entries from Alexei Shchusev, Nikolai Ladovsky, Alexander",Caption
"Nikolsky, Boris lofan, Genrikh Liudvig, and Daniil Fridman were also submitted.",Paragraph
"On 18 July 1931, the competition was extended into a more open event and the already",Paragraph
commissioned designs (exhibited in August 1931) were included in this later stage.,Paragraph
"Further to this, 12 architects were invited to submit proposals for this round, including",Paragraph
"nine international architects such as Le Corbusier, Auguste Perret, Walter Gropius, Erich",Paragraph
"Mendelsohn, and Hans Poelzig. The three Soviet architects invited, Zholtovski, lofan,",Paragraph
"and Krasin, were all experienced professional architects. In total, this revised competition",Paragraph
"drew 160 entries, with 24 from foreign architects. A further 112 “noncompetitive” entries",Paragraph
"were received from ordinary Soviet citizens, which, although not being considered for the",Paragraph
"competition, received considerable attention in the press. Among the individual soviet",Paragraph
"entries were schemes by leading figures at the time such as Konstantin Melnikov, Ivan",Paragraph
"Leonidov, Moisei Ginzburg, and the Vesnin brothers.",Paragraph
"Of the first-round entries, the majority belonged to the modernist or Constructivist",Paragraph
"school of thinking. Many of the schemes, both local and international, borrowed heavily",Paragraph
"from machine forms and industrial imagery. Of the international entrants, Le Corbusier’s",Paragraph
"generated the most interest because of its dynamic exposed roof structure. However, it",Paragraph
"was his functional and symbolic representation of each of the elements of the brief, and",Paragraph
"the manipulation of traffic to emphasize entry points, that most characterized his project.",Paragraph
"In the context of architectural history, Le Corbusier’s scheme remains the most",Paragraph
"influential of the entrants. In contrast, Mendelsohn’s scheme used the natural fall of the",Paragraph
"site to arrange a compact but less expressive arrangement, and Gropius adopted a circular",Paragraph
"configuration, connecting the two halls through a central circulation core. Of the Soviet",Paragraph
"schemes, the project submitted by Ginzberg included a large sphere that anchored an",Paragraph
otherwise rectilinear composition. The scheme proposed by the Vesnins was composed of,Paragraph
"a circular and rectilinear form, with a statue of Lenin situated above a tower. Among the",Paragraph
"more original entries was that of Melnikov, who rejected both the classical and modernist",Paragraph
"approaches, attempting instead to provide an architectural representation of the",Paragraph
achievements of the Revolution. The eventual form he proposed evoked the proletariat,Paragraph
symbol of an inverted cone that had been split apart by the forces of revolution.,Paragraph
"At the end of this stage, the jury members (including Maxim Gorky among others)",Paragraph
awarded two first prizes to the strongly historical designs of the Soviet architects lofan,Paragraph
"and Zholtovsky. An additional first prize was awarded to an American architect, Hector",Paragraph
"Hamilton, with the majority of the remaining prizes being awarded to Soviet architects.",Paragraph
"Even before awarding the prizes, the Construction Council announced that “the",Paragraph
"monumentality, simplicity, integrity and elegance of architectural conception of the",Paragraph
Palace of Soviets was not found in totally acceptable form” in any of the entries. The jury,Paragraph
demonstrated particular dissatisfaction with the modernist proposals that it maintained,Paragraph
were too industrial. Le Corbusier’s scheme was cited as representing “a complicated,Paragraph
"machine,” which, in its over emphasis on function, was seen as detrimental to the",Paragraph
symbolism required by the brief.,Paragraph
"On 5 May 1933, following two more stages in the competition that contained only",Paragraph
"invited Soviet architects (and mostly with a bias toward Russian Revivalism), the",Paragraph
ultimate prize was awarded to the neoclassical design of Boris lofan. lofan’s scheme was,Paragraph
over 220 meters in height and consisted of a series of colonnaded tiers stacked on each,Paragraph
other and finally culminating in a statue of “the liberated proletariat.” A few days after,Paragraph
"the winning entry was announced, Stalin proposed that the statue should be enlarged four",Paragraph
times in size to a height of 75 meters and made in the image of Lenin. This was the,Paragraph
beginning of what Kruschev would later denounce as Stalin’s “Cult of Personality.” The,Paragraph
"intervention of the war in 1941 prevented lofan’s building ever being realized, despite the",Paragraph
completion of documentation by lofan in collaboration with the academics Shchuko and,Paragraph
"Gelifreikh. In spite of this, the legacy of the project in not only Soviet but also",Paragraph
"international architectural circles is immense. Most notably, it announced the end of the",Paragraph
energetic architectural avant-garde in the Soviet Union and ushered in a new age of,Paragraph
"architecture, dominated by political personalities, rather than architectural creativity.",Paragraph

"PALAIS STOCLET, BRUSSELS",Caption
"Designed by Josef Hoffmann; completed 1911 Brussels, Belgium",Caption
The Palais Stoclet is a villa designed by Josef Hoffmann in Brussels and built between,Paragraph
1905 and 1911 for the Belgian millionaire Adolphe Stoclet and his wife. Although built,Paragraph
"in Belgium, the Palais is one of the finest examples of Viennese Art Nouveau, or",Paragraph
"Jugendstil, and is the most comprehensive realization of the design goals of the Vienna",Paragraph
"workshops. The building represents an elaborate example of the synthesis of architecture,",Paragraph
"interior design, and garden design that the Viennese movement accomplished. The Palais",Paragraph
"is a design Gesamtkunstwerk, or total work of art—an important aesthetic goal of Central",Paragraph
"European art that had, in addition to architectural design, important influences in opera",Paragraph
(Wilhelm Wagner) and painting (Wassily Kandinsky). Gesamtkunstwerk design sought to,Paragraph
"create an aesthetic union of all components of a building. To achieve this, a single artist",Paragraph
"would design all aspects of the building and its furnishings, as in work by Peter Behrens",Paragraph
"and Henry van de Velde. The Palais, however, represented a collaborative effort",Paragraph
involving the full resources of the Vienna workshops. Led by Hoffmann as architect and,Paragraph
"project coordinator, some 50 craftsmen contributed to the design, execution, and",Paragraph
"decoration of the entire villa, including its furniture, artwork, light fixtures, wall",Paragraph
"coverings, bathroom tiles, and cutlery. All aspects of Viennese modernism came together",Paragraph
in the Palais Stoclet.,Caption
"Stylistically, the building represents the Viennese version of Art Nouveau, or what is",Paragraph
"sometimes referred to as “secession-style,” because the forms are geometrical rather than",Paragraph
vegetative curves. Brussels had already been the home of Art Nouveau buildings by,Paragraph
Victor Horta and Henri van de Velde. The addition of the Palais Stoclet made Brussels,Paragraph
one of the few cities where organic and geometrical forms of Art Nouveau were,Paragraph
successfully combined.,Paragraph
"The son of a wealthy Belgian banker, Stoclet lived in Vienna for about 18 months in",Paragraph
1903-04 and was planning to build a home in the city. Impressed by the proportions of a,Paragraph
"villa in Vienna’s suburbs built for the painter Carl Moll, the Stoclets learned that Josef",Paragraph
Hoffmann was the architect and approached him about building a villa. The Stoclets,Paragraph
"originally intended to build in Vienna, but following the death of Stoclet’s father, they",Paragraph
returned to Brussels. The Stoclets gave Hoffmann carte blanche with the design and,Paragraph
"building costs, which used only the finest and costiest materials. Construction took six",Paragraph
"years, and each time something failed to please either Stoclet or the designers, it was",Paragraph
"disassembled, redesigned, and rebuilt without regard to the mounting expense. The Palais",Caption
"was to be a perfectly realized artistic dwelling, and its final cost never has been revealed.",Paragraph
The Palais stands in a suburb of Brussels at Avenue de Tervueren 279-281. The,Paragraph
"building consists of two parts: a large residential block, and a service wing with a garage",Paragraph
"and workshop for Stoclet, who was an auto enthusiast. The residential block has three",Paragraph
"floors, plus a basement and an attic. The service wing had only a single floor. The strong",Paragraph
"horizontal movement of the main structure balances the tall, vertical lines of the stairwell",Paragraph
tower. Four human figures sculpted by Franz Metzner crown the tower; they surround a,Caption
"dome of gilded vegetation, similar to Olbrich’s Secession building. Figures of Hercules,",Caption
"Apollo, Athena, and the Hindu god Ganesha also adorn the building.",Caption
"Despite the use of rich materials, the building’s effect is serene rather than pompous.",Paragraph
The Palais was built of reinforced concrete and brick that was faced with plates of white,Paragraph
Norwegian marble. The exterior has a monumental quality created by the elegant use of,Paragraph
geometric forms and white surfaces punctuated by regular fenestration. Gilded bronze,Caption
bands unify the various elements and provide a counterpart to the generally white exterior,Paragraph
of the building.,Paragraph
The combination of volumes projecting from a basic rectangular prism was admired,Paragraph
"widely in art circles, leading to comparison with baroque use of volumes; it created",Paragraph
formal drama and the illusion of even greater use of space. The gradual ascension of,Paragraph
formal elements was an attempt to blend the building into the countryside. Gardens,Paragraph
complement the house.,Paragraph
The interior of the Palais Stoclet was intended for an affluent lifestyle. Most rooms,Paragraph
"have lavish proportions: the main bedroom is 30 by 18 feet, and Mme Stoclet’s dressing",Paragraph
room is 20 by 20 feet. Designers and patrons chose luxurious treatments for the public,Paragraph
"rooms, featuring polychrome marble, rosewood, and parquet floors. The main dining",Caption
"room is especially opulent, with an inlaid mosaic frieze designed by Gustav Klimt that is",Paragraph
artistically significant in its own right. The frieze’s themes are expectation and,Paragraph
"fulfillment, amusing choices for a dining room. They were Klimt’s only opportunity to",Paragraph
actualize his painted mosaics.,Paragraph
The entire household was designed and created as a unit. In an extravagant,Paragraph
"prefabrication, each room was completely assembled in Vienna for approval before being",Paragraph
"dismounted and shipped to Brussels for installation. The utensils, furnishings, and",Paragraph
"architecture were intended to complement one another in total harmony, like an organic",Paragraph
"system. Subtle relationships reflected the Gesamtkunstwerk concept; for example, chairs",Paragraph
in the public rooms had backs that were exactly as high as the bronze bands on the,Paragraph
exterior of the building. The rooms and,Paragraph

"arrangement also were intended to showcase the Stoclets’ art collection, but other than",Paragraph
"the art collection, no preexisting furnishings or decorations were used.",Paragraph
Virtually every figure associated with the Vienna Workshops became involved in the,Paragraph
project. Klimt’s cartoons for the dining room mosaic were executed by the Vienna,Caption
"workshops using inlay of white marble, gold, silver, enamel, coral, and other",Paragraph
"semiprecious stones. The painters and designers Koloman Moser, Carl Otto Czeschka,",Caption
and Leopold Forstner contributed to the furniture and other design elements. Bertold,Paragraph
Léfler and Michael Powolny designed the ceramic decorations. Franz Metzner created,Paragraph
the exterior sculpture as well as an animal frieze for the nursery. From the wallpaper and,Caption
"draperies to the garden terraces, trellises, and garden furniture, the Palais Stoclet is the",Paragraph
supreme achievement of the collaborative ideals of Hoffmann and the Vienna workshops.,Paragraph

"PALLASMAA, JUHANI 1936—",Title
"Architect, Finland",Title
"Juhani Pallasmaa (born 1936 in Hameenlinna, Finland) is a Helsinki-based architect,",Paragraph
"exhibition designer, and town planner. Pallasmaa is also a prolific essayist and the former",Paragraph
director of both the Finnish Museum of Architecture and the architecture program at,Paragraph
"Helsinki University of Technology, where he graduated in 1966.",Paragraph
Pallasmaa’s modest oeuvre of built work belies his substantial influence in Finland and,Paragraph
"abroad. His first project was characteristically intellectual and architectural: Moduli 225,",Paragraph
developed in 1969 with Kristian Gullichsen. The stick-built system of prefabricated,Paragraph
building components is based on a 75-by-225-cm module and sought a practical outlet for,Paragraph
"the 1960s interest in proportional systems, as standardization offered not only economies",Paragraph
of scale but also the possibility of relating a module of construction directly to a module,Paragraph
of proportion. Roughly 50 houses were built. The domestic scope of Moduli 225,Paragraph
characterizes it as both a reinterpretation of traditional Japanese construction as well as a,Paragraph
reworking of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto’s postwar inquiry into standardized dwellings.,Paragraph
"However, Pallasmaa’s subsequent teaching and research persuaded him that modern",Paragraph
cities suffered more from standardization than they gained. Writing in 1983 that,Paragraph
“probably the greatest shortcoming of the Modern Movement is that it has not been able,Paragraph
"to transform itself into a positive vernacular tradition,” Pallasmaa set out to diagnose the",Paragraph
causes of this failure as well as to attempt to explain what a “positive vernacular” might,Paragraph
"be. This ongoing inquiry has involved stitching together psychological,",Paragraph
"phenomenological, and architectural observations into broad themes while maintaining",Paragraph
concern for the social milieu or individual experience. These broad themes—already in,Paragraph
play with Moduli 225—center on two poles: a concern for the ordinary (the role of,Paragraph
traditional and quotidian in architecture) and the question of architectural and cultural,Paragraph
modernism.,Paragraph
"Pallasmaa’s interest in mute, harmonious proportions is paired with the ideal of an",Paragraph
"unprepossessing, modest, even anonymous architecture, characterized by unheroic forms",Paragraph
and materials. A limited material and formal palette is typically deployed in contrasts:,Paragraph
"open versus closed, hand-made versus machine-made, edge versus surface. In his",Paragraph
"buildings and installations, the juxtaposition of disparate materials constitute Pallasmaa’s",Paragraph
efforts to appeal to the multiple senses—his built work is “experiential” rather than,Paragraph
"cerebral. Also, the deployment of ordinary materials represents Pallasmaa’s own interest",Paragraph
"in vernacular traditions, albeit as reimvented for a modern age.",Paragraph
Adopting poet Joseph Brodsky’s dictum that beauty can only be achieved by working,Paragraph
"with the every day, Pallasmaa’s first important building, the Rovaniemi Art Museum",Paragraph
(1986) recycles a former postal depot into a gallery. The long masonry building was,Paragraph
originally reconstructed with bricks salvaged from war-destroyed Lapland; Pallasmaa’s,Paragraph
"retrofit exposes these reclaimed bricks throughout the interior, providing a quiet,",Paragraph
"poignant backdrop to the art mounted therein. On the exterior, Pallasmaa’s interventions",Paragraph
are subtle and deliberate: A new entrance threshold of glass and steel projects from the,Paragraph
"facade, fronted by five columns of different granites, marking the entrance and",Paragraph
contrasting with the delicate entry pavilion behind.,Paragraph
Pallasmaa has also reworked the idea of the granite column entrance for the installation,Paragraph
"“Driveway Square” at the Cranbook Academy (1994), where the columns play a role as",Paragraph
"part of a cosmic marker. Another project in Lapland, the Sami Museum and Northern",Paragraph
"Lapland Visitors Center (1998), inserts a minimalist building of modest scale into an",Paragraph
"arctic fells landscape, with a sympathetic installation of Sami cultural artifacts inside.",Paragraph
Anonymity and harmony are hallmarks against which Pallasmaa measures,Paragraph
contemporary society and its architectures. Pallasmaa’s critical output in the 1980s,Paragraph

Roman classical motifs. Bakewell and Brown’s Palace of Horticulture was reminiscent of,Paragraph
"the Blue Mosque in Constantinople with its enormous glass dome, spiky minarets, and",Paragraph
cascading semidomes (although it sported French baroque ornament).,Paragraph
Color was a distinguishing hallmark of the exposition. Unlike the use of white at the,Paragraph
"Chicago, Buffalo, and St. Louis expositions, color was deemed to be an important actor",Paragraph
in setting the exotic mood of the exposition grounds. The architectural renderer Jules,Paragraph
Guerin was commissioned as the chief of decoration. He established a palette dominated,Paragraph
"by a warm faux travertine, a russet red, a burnt orange, and sea-foam green. Whereas",Paragraph
some critics were concerned that the wide use of color obscured the detailed ornament of,Paragraph
"the architecture, most observers were enchanted by nightly illuminations and the",Paragraph
shimmering fields of color encountered when viewing the site from one of San,Paragraph
Francisco’s many hills.,Paragraph
The exposition’s most acclaimed building was Bernard Maybeck’s Palace of Fine Arts.,Paragraph
"As chairman of the architectural commission, Polk had been given the assignment to",Paragraph
"design the Palace of Fine Arts, which stood at one end of the primary axis. Because Polk",Paragraph
"was busy with his other duties, he held an in-house competition to make a preliminary",Paragraph
design deadline. Maybeck made a quick charcoal sketch of a Roman ruin that met with,Paragraph
immediate acclaim and won him the role as architect of the building. Maybeck chose the,Paragraph
"forms of ruined antiquity for his palace, but he freely mixed different periods and styles",Paragraph
"of classical architecture. Unfortunately, contemporary writers and critics could not take it",Paragraph
"for what it was and insisted on classifying every column, frieze, and architrave. Yet",Paragraph
anyone who analyzed the palace from a historical perspective was missing the entire,Paragraph
point of the building. Maybeck did not sketch a building as much as an emotion. As,Paragraph
"Maybeck explained in a pamphlet issued at the exposition, the proper attitude with which",Paragraph
one should view art was “that of sadness modified by the feeling that beauty has a,Paragraph
soothing influence...to make a Fine Arts composition that will fit this modified,Paragraph
"melancholy, we must use those forms in architecture and gardening that will affect the",Paragraph
"emotions in such a way as to produce this modified sadness.” For Maybeck, Roman",Paragraph
"ruins, French picturesque parks, and the engravings of Piranesi all evoked the desired",Paragraph
"emotion. Although he does not use the term, he might well have been referring to notions",Paragraph
of the sublime.,Paragraph
The lagoon and all the other landscape elements were an integral part of the scheme.,Paragraph
Maybeck and John McLaren worked closely together to ensure this synthesis. The lagoon,Paragraph
"reflected the palace in the water and forced the viewer to move around it, observing the",Paragraph
rotunda from many different angles and in many different lights. On reaching the,Paragraph
"colonnades, the viewer was then swept along their lengths, appreciating the sculpture",Paragraph
placed in the intercolumnations and above on the capitals and looking out again toward,Paragraph
"the rotunda, where the iconographic sculptural program of the palace was best revealed.",Paragraph
"On reaching the rotunda, one paused and was drawn toward the lagoon into its space,",Paragraph
where the murals in the distended coffers of the dome were best appreciated. At the,Paragraph
"water’s edge, Maybeck designed an alter to art, adorned with Ralph Stackpole’s Venus,",Paragraph
which was framed by great hedges planted by McLaren.,Paragraph
"The landscape, colonnades, and rotunda were simply window dressing for the",Paragraph
"exposition hall, which was simply a decorated shed of steel three-hinged arches lashed",Paragraph
together inside hollow tile walls and fitted out with frame partitions and numerous,Paragraph
"skylights. Like the other buildings at the exposition, the colonnades and rotunda were",Paragraph
constructed out of timber and staff. Maybeck seriously proposed allowing the building to,Paragraph
rot so that children of the future might find bits of ornament and sculpture or a wondrous,Paragraph
"ruin of a previous generation. Unique among the structures of the exposition, the Palace",Paragraph
"of Fine Arts was spared the wrecker’s ball, but by the 1950s the structure was",Paragraph
"decomposing. By the end of the decade, a movement to rebuild the structure in concrete",Paragraph
"was begun, and in 1960 a sponsor was found. Today, the rebuilt palace is the backdrop",Paragraph
"for numerous community activities, television commercials, and weddings.",Paragraph
The exposition included more than just the walled city. Numerous state and,Paragraph
international pavilions accompanied the thematic exposition halls. The international,Paragraph
pavilions were usually designed in a National Romantic mode or in a traditional national,Paragraph
"style, whereas the state pavilions took on Beaux-Arts classical forms or replicated a",Paragraph
"historic structure associated with the state, such as Massachusetts’s replica of Bulfinch’s",Paragraph
statehouse or Virginia’s faux Mount Vernon. Perhaps the most memorable state pavilion,Paragraph
"was Oregon’s redwood-log temple, “reminiscent of the Parthenon in Athens.” The",Paragraph
"entertainment midway, known as The Zone, contained the usual array of rides,",Paragraph
"sideshows, and ethnographic exhibits but also featured replicas of the Grand Canyon and",Paragraph
"Yellowstone Park, sponsored by the Santa Fe and Union Pacific Railroads, respectively.",Paragraph
"The most visited attraction, however, was L.E.Myers’s five-acre scale model of the",Paragraph
"Panama Canal, which visitors toured from a 1200-seat moving platform.",Paragraph
"Although the celebratory mood of the exposition was dampened by World War I, the",Paragraph
"directors and exhibitors at the exposition did their best to present an optimistic,",Paragraph
progressive view of human social and political development. Perhaps San Francisco itself,Paragraph
was the best object lesson in the tenacious desire of the human spirit to overcome natural,Paragraph

the ashes of the 1906 earthquake and fire but also constructed on the rubble of the old,Paragraph

PARKING GARAGE,Title
The development of the parking garage in the 20th century was a direct consequence of,Paragraph
the automobile’s unprecedented disruption of the 19th-century city. Whereas traditional,Paragraph
urban areas had been constrained by pedestrian speed and the centralizing logic of the,Paragraph
"railroad station, the automobile’s omni-directional movement, its mass availability, its",Paragraph
"high speeds, and its sheer physical size all demanded greater decentralization and",Paragraph
"dispersal. In the friction between these two paradigms of city organization, the parking",Paragraph
"garage emerged in the middle part of the century as a form of suture. Inside it, the",Paragraph
enormously scaled automobile-oriented urbanism of the strip and the freeway would,Paragraph
"brush against that of the shopping arcade, the village green, and the office building. In",Paragraph
"one side came a driver and his heavy cloak, and out the other emerged a pedestrian.",Paragraph
The roots of the parking garage typology begin in the closing years of the 19th century,Paragraph
"with the invention of the motorcar. From the very beginning, it was understood that these",Paragraph
new machines were not fit to be left outdoors. Besides simply being expensive and,Paragraph
"vulnerable to theft, most were too mechanically temperamental to be left to the vagaries",Paragraph
of the climate. The majority of their wealthy owners simply adapted their existing coach,Paragraph
houses to accommodate these new “horseless carriages.” Those without the room and,Paragraph
presumably without more reputable choices found space for rent in existing livery,Paragraph
"stables. Such makeshift accommodation continued into the early 1920s, by which time",Paragraph
some underutilized warehouse facilities were also being pressed into service for,Paragraph
automobile storage. In the relatively rare cases in which these buildings made use of their,Paragraph
"upper floors, vertical transport of the automobiles was easily handled by the preexisting",Paragraph
freight elevators.,Paragraph
"Unfortunately, all these patchwork adaptations and accommodations were soon",Paragraph
overwhelmed by the enormity of the automobile’s crescendoing effect. Whereas at the,Paragraph
"beginning of the century the total number of passenger cars was less than 10,000, by",Paragraph
"1920 there were eight million autos in use. By 1930, that number had tripled to 23",Paragraph
"million. By 1950, despite the Great Depression and the rationing of World War II, the",Paragraph
"number had nearly doubled again to 40 million. Between 1950 and 1960, two million",Paragraph
additional cars were added each year.,Paragraph
"Compounding the congestion generated by the sheer number of these vehicles, all",Paragraph
"requiring roadways on which to drive and spaces in which to park, was an irrefutable",Paragraph
geometric dilemma. Whereas a person at a baseball game sat comfortably in about five,Paragraph
"square feet and an office worker was comfortable in about 50, a parked Cadillac required",Paragraph
almost 200 square feet. This meant that in densely used areas where crowds gathered in,Paragraph
"large numbers—places such as office buildings, shopping malls, hotels, airports, or",Paragraph
downtown department stores—there was simply no room to store all their cars. Making,Paragraph
matters worse was the commonplace observation that no person arriving by car was,Paragraph
willing to walk more than a few hundred yards to get where he needed to go. The only,Paragraph
way to store that many cars that close to their final destinations was to stack them on top,Paragraph
"of one another, thereby formalizing the notion of the multitiered automobile warehouse.",Paragraph
"These new buildings, totally subservient to the spatial needs and mechanical capacities of",Paragraph
"the automobile, were nevertheless named with an exotic word of French origin: garages.",Paragraph
Given a consensus by the late 1920s on the need for some sort of formalized structure,Paragraph
in which to store all these new cars but without strong typological or historical precedents,Paragraph
"from which to work, the early parking garages were amazingly varied, with solutions",Paragraph
ranging from the prosaic to the utterly fantastic.,Paragraph

"ramps that the automobile would navigate under its own power. The simplest schemes,",Paragraph
such as Victor Gruen and Krummeck Associates’ Milliron’s Department Store in Los,Paragraph
"Angeles (1949), continued an existing surface lot up a ramp onto the roof of a building.",Paragraph
Slightly more complex and certainly more elegant was Paul Schneider-Esleben’s use of a,Paragraph
"ramp in his freestanding Haniel Parking Garage in Diisseldorf (1953), which externally",Paragraph
suspended two straight ramps alongside four enclosed floors of parking. In Miami,Caption
architect Robert Law Weed’s unnamed garage (1948) opted for an unenclosed “split-,Paragraph
level” plan that incorporated small and discontinuous half-level ramps within it.,Paragraph
Other designers preferred to use curved ramps. Venice’s famous Autorimessa (late,Paragraph
"1930s) designed by Eugeio Miozzi, often called Europe’s first major parking garage,",Paragraph
could store 2500 cars arriving from the mainland on seven rectangular floor plates,Paragraph
connected by two one-way helical (corkscrew) ramps. Toulouse’s Victor Hugo Parking,Caption
Garage designed by Cabinet Genard Architects (1959) also had two cylindrical ramp,Paragraph
"towers, but each of these was composed of two intertwining ramps in a double helix",Paragraph
arrangement. Architects Albert C.Martin and Associates did away with all ramps for the,Paragraph
"May Company Department Store on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles (1953),",Paragraph
elegantly folding three parking levels so that each touched the existing grade,Paragraph
independently. Other designers developed what is now considered the most efficient,Paragraph
solution to the ramp-deck dichotomy and designed parking garages like the Rupert Street,Paragraph
"Multi-Story Car Park in Bristol (R.Jelinek-Karl, 1960) in which one continuously coiled",Paragraph
floor plate is used for both ascent and parking simultaneously.,Paragraph
"For locations in which ramped garages were not feasible, more fantastic solutions were",Paragraph
"tried. For example, in densely developed downtown cores, where aesthetic discomfort",Paragraph
"about unfamiliar parking garages dovetailed with the high value of real estate, the",Paragraph
difficulties of subterranean parking seemed worth contemplating. San Francisco was the,Paragraph
"first city to donate the land under its Union Square Park for a privately run garage (1941),",Paragraph
"but it was copied in Los Angeles (1951), Chicago (1954), Bern (1957), and Dresden",Paragraph
(1961) to name just a few places.,Paragraph
"For other valued locations where even underground parking was not possible,",Paragraph
enormous building-scaled hoisting machines were built to store automobiles in giant,Paragraph
"three-dimensional cubbyholes. By mechanizing the means of ascent and storage, these",Paragraph
"structures minimized non-parking areas, such as ramps, lanes, and even door-opening",Paragraph
"stall widths, thereby squeezing the absolute maximum storage capacity out of a parcel of",Paragraph
"land. In Chicago, for example, Thielbar and Fugard’s Jewelers Building (1926)",Paragraph
"incorporated a mechanical car parking system inside the skyscraper’s core, reaching 40",Paragraph
stories high. Two popular proprietary technologies were the “Bowser” overhead crane,Paragraph
"system (Parking Facility #1, 1955, Chicago, by Shaw, Metz, and Dolio Architects) and",Paragraph
"the totally automated, push-button “Pigeon-Hole” system (Park-O-Mat, 1951,",Caption
"Washington, DC). Even more fantastic schemes were studied as prototypes, including the",Paragraph
"extremely narrow “Speed-Park” forklift system (20 feet of street frontage required), a",Paragraph
"revolving “ferris-wheel garage,” and the “Point-Lift System,” in which a central elevator",Paragraph
tower was surrounded by rotating floor plates.,Paragraph
Given that the form of the parking garage was so fluid during this midcentury period of,Paragraph
"invention, it should be no surprise that the functional program was equally in flux. Many",Paragraph
early garages billed themselves as complete auto-service facilities and included refueling,Paragraph
"pumps, service stations, valet parking attendants, and car-washing equipment. Others",Paragraph
incorporated restaurants and lounges. The most foresighted designers began to reconceive,Paragraph
"the links between the parking garage and its surrounding contexts. In the simplest cases,",Paragraph
this meant a bridge or covered walkway that joined two adjacent structures (Ford,Paragraph
"Administrative Building Garage, Dearborn, Michigan, by Skidmore, Owings and",Caption
Merrill). More developed schemes include Bertrand Goldberg’s 1962 Marina City in,Paragraph
Chicago. Goldberg rejected a stand-alone garage in favor of a design that integrated the,Paragraph
necessary parking structure within the massing of the tower’s adjacent planta. Taken to,Caption
"extremes, this tendency to combine the parking garage into a larger architectural program",Paragraph
gave rise to a fantastic collection of hybrid buildings—a walk-up/ drive-through/parking,Paragraph
"garage bank (American National Bank, mid-1950s, Austin, Texas, by Kuehne, Brooks,",Caption
"and Barr, Architects), a department store in which conveyor belts linked parking spaces",Paragraph

"By the end of century, most of these radical experiments in form and organization had",Paragraph
"ended, and the parking garage began to be seen as a commonplace, utilitarian, and",Paragraph
predictable sort of building without great aesthetic or architectural significance. Probably,Paragraph
this was in part the result of a lingering memory of the parking garage’s utilitarian origins,Paragraph
"in the warehouse and livery stable. Furthermore, the maturation of the typology",Paragraph
necessarily dimmed the exoticism and inventive wonder that had infused so many of the,Paragraph
"earlier experiments. Finally, and most significant, the parking garage remained hostage to",Paragraph
the continuing friction between a traditional notion of the city and the rise of the,Paragraph

PARKWAYS,Title
Parkways played an important role in the development of the modern landscape. As the,Paragraph
"first comprehensively designed limited-access public motorways, parkways paved the",Paragraph
way for the expressways and interstate highways that transformed the American,Paragraph
"landscape in the second half of the 20th century. As symbols of progress and modernity,",Paragraph
"parkways embodied con-temporary conceptions of modern design, efficiency, and",Paragraph
"technological progress. At the same time, their naturalistic landscaping and historical",Paragraph
allusions suggested that modern technologies and modernist principles could be,Paragraph
harmonized with traditional values and aesthetics.,Paragraph
Parkways long predated the automobile. Frederick Law Olmsted and his partner,Paragraph
Calvert Vaux introduced the term “park-way” to describe the attractive approaches they,Paragraph
proposed for Brooklyn’s Prospect Park in 1868. The idea of connecting suburban parks,Paragraph
with urban centers and elite residential developments by means of attractively landscaped,Paragraph
parkways soon became a key element of American city planning. Parkways were seen as,Paragraph
"means of spreading the benefits of parks throughout the urban area, as verdant corridors",Paragraph
that enabled pleasure seekers to escape the dangers and disruptions of ordinary city,Paragraph
"streets, and as powerful economic stimulants that enhanced property values and",Paragraph
encouraged high-class residential development. As the connecting fabric of metropolitan,Paragraph
"park systems, parkways helped transform the focus of American city planning from",Paragraph
isolated developments to large-scale comprehensive improvements. Olmsted and other,Paragraph
"planners, such as Horace Cleveland, Harland Bartholomew, John Nolen, George Kessler,",Paragraph
"John C.Olmsted, and Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., went on to design notable parkway and",Paragraph
"boulevard systems for cities such as Buffalo, Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis,",Paragraph
"Seattle, St. Louis, and Washington, DC.",Caption
The first parkways resembled contemporary boulevards. Brooklyn’s formally,Paragraph
andscaped Eastern Parkway consisted of a central pleasure drive bordered by tree-lined,Paragraph
park strips that were flanked by additional roadways for commercial vehicles and access,Paragraph
to abutting properties. The series of drives and bordering parkland that Olmsted planned,Paragraph
"for Boston’s Muddy River in the 1880s, now known collectively as “The Emerald",Paragraph
"Necklace,” redefined the basic parkway concept from an attractively landscaped but",Paragraph
"essentially urban avenue to a winding roadway ensconced in an elongated, informal park.",Paragraph
The project represented a middle stage in the evolution from traditional boulevard to,Paragraph
modern limited-access parkway in circulation terms as well. Park development,Paragraph
"constrained access on the stream side of the main roadway, but turning and entering",Paragraph
traffic from the urban side of the parkway remained a source of danger and disruption.,Paragraph
The proliferation of private automobiles in the first quarter of the 20th century,Paragraph
"rendered 19th-century parkway and boulevard systems obsolete, creating a demand for a",Paragraph
"new type of parkway geared toward the social, spatial, and technological demands of the",Paragraph
automobile age.,Paragraph
The first public parkway designed solely for automobile use was the Bronx River,Paragraph
"Parkway, which was completed in 1925 and stretched for 15 miles from the Bronx Zoo to",Paragraph
the Kensico Reservoir in central Westchester County. The design team of engineer Jay,Paragraph
Downer and landscape architects Herman Merkel and Gilmore Clarke employed all the,Paragraph
features that would come to identify the classic mid-20th-century motor parkway. These,Paragraph
"elements included the segregation of the main parkway drive in a broad, landscaped",Paragraph
corridor that provided ample room for broadly curving roadway alignments and aesthetic,Paragraph
enhancements while screening out incompatible development; the elimination of access,Paragraph
"from abutting properties; a significant reduction in the number of intersecting roadways,",Paragraph
most of which were carried over the main parkway drive on attractively designed grade,Paragraph
separations; construction through largely undeveloped locations to minimize costs and,Paragraph
"maximize design flexibility; and a prohibition on slow, dangerous, and unsightly",Paragraph
"commercial traffic. The Bronx River Parkway included several short landscaped medians,",Paragraph
but fully divided motorways did not make their appearance until the mid-1930s. The,Paragraph
"driveways were laid out with gentle grades, ample sight lines, and broad, sweeping,",Paragraph
subtly banked curves. Careful attention was paid to harmonizing the roadway with the,Paragraph
surrounding terrain to enhance the impression of gliding effortlessly through the,Paragraph
"landscape, where traditional picturesque compositions were simplified for easy",Paragraph
appreciation at modern speeds.,Paragraph
The Bronx River Parkway proved tremendously successful as a scenic pleasure drive,Paragraph
"and commuter thoroughfare. Motorists, landscape architects, and planners quickly",Paragraph
recognized that this new style of parkway was not only more attractive than conventional,Paragraph
"roadways but also safer, faster, and more efficient. The Bronx River Parkway’s",Paragraph
"popularity spurred a parkway building boom that lasted through the 1930s, as planners",Paragraph
"sought to answer pressing demands for recreational amenities, transportation",Paragraph
"improvements, and suburban recreational development. Westchester County constructed",Paragraph
"numerous additional parkways, including the Saw Mill River, Hutchinson River, and",Paragraph
Cross County. New York public works czar Robert Moses oversaw construction of the,Paragraph
Northern and Southern State Parkways and their various offshoots to provide access to,Paragraph
suburban homes and new state parks on Long Island. The nation’s capital also embarked,Paragraph
on an ambitious parkway-building program. Although the general outlines of the,Paragraph
"Washington parkway system antedated the Bronx River Parkway, Rock Creek and",Paragraph
"Potomac Parkway, Mount Vernon Memorial Highway, and George Washington",Title
Memorial Parkway employed similar design strategies.,Paragraph
"By the late 1930s, rising speeds and traffic volumes made it increasingly difficult to",Paragraph
combine efficient highway design with traditional park values. Connecticut’s 1938,Paragraph
Merritt Parkway was popular with commuters but lacked the aesthetic sophistication and,Paragraph
recreational amenities of earlier parkways. New York’s Belt and Henry Hudson,Paragraph
"Parkways were also devoted more toward traffic movement than scenic appreciation, as",Paragraph
"was Los Angeles’s Pasadena Freeway, which was conceived originally as the Arroyo",Paragraph
Seco Parkway but was renamed before its completion in 1940. Highway engineers soon,Paragraph
realized that they could appropriate the basic circulation features that made parkways safe,Paragraph
and efficient without incurring the expense of elaborate landscaping and recreational,Paragraph
"development. This recognition led to the proliferation of minimally landscaped freeways,",Paragraph
"expressways, and interstate highways that came to dominate the post-World War IL",Paragraph
American landscape.,Paragraph
Attractive parkways continued to be constructed during the expressway era. The,Paragraph
National Park Service (NPS) pressed on with the development of long-distance,Paragraph
recreational parkways initiated as public works projects during the Depression. The Blue,Paragraph
"Ridge Parkway, stretching for 469 miles between Shenandoah and Great Smoky",Paragraph
"Mountains National Parks, was completed in 1987 and stands as the paragon of the",Paragraph
parkway builder’s art. The 1954 Baltimore-Washington Parkway and postwar sections of,Paragraph
the George Washington Memorial Parkway demonstrated the appeal of independently,Paragraph
"aligned roadways separated by broad, landscaped medians. New Jersey’s 1956 Garden",Caption
"State Parkway posed a striking contrast to the neighboring Turnpike, and New York’s",Paragraph
Taconic State Parkway (1931-63) received widespread praise as the ultimate,Paragraph
"manifestation of the modern, multiuse motor parkway. Although largely completed by",Paragraph
"the 1960s, the Natchez Trace Parkway through Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi",Paragraph
remains unfinished and will extend classic parkway development into the 21st century.,Paragraph
The sylvan surroundings and dynamic streamlined ribbons of mid-20th-century motor,Paragraph
"parkways captured the imagination of contemporary designers, critics, and everyday",Paragraph
motorists. Sigfried Giedion hailed parkways as supreme embodiments of the space-time,Paragraph
ethos of modern design. Lewis Mumford proclaimed the Taconic State Parkway on par,Paragraph
with any artistic creation of the modern age. The “magic motorways” of Norman Bel,Paragraph
Geddes’s popular Futurama exhibit at the 1939 World’s Fair were predicated on parkway,Paragraph
"design principles, and Nazi engineers studied the Westchester and Washington-area",Paragraph
"parkways before designing the Autobahns, which eventually supplanted the slower-speed",Paragraph
"parkways as paradigms for modern motorway design. By the 1960s, however, the",Paragraph
excesses of postwar expressway development prompted calls for a return to parkway-,Paragraph

"Following the partition of the new state of Pakistan from India in 1947, the province of",Paragraph
Punjab was effectively split into two parts. With the primary Punjab city of Lahore now,Paragraph

Indian Punjab in the Ambala district north of New Delhi. This new city was to be sited,Paragraph
between two rivers on a vast plateau at the base of the Himalayas and was to be known as,Paragraph
"Chandigarh. In 1950 a team of four architects—Le Corbusier, Maxwell Fry, Jane Drew,",Paragraph
and Pierre Jeanneret—was commissioned to undertake the design of the city and its,Paragraph
major public buildings. In February 1951 the team proposed that Chandigarh be founded,Paragraph
on a modernist street grid with the commercial district at its center and with its political,Paragraph
"structures clustered together at its top (the northeast). It was these political structures,",Paragraph
"collectively known as the “Capitol,” that were to occupy much of Le Corbusier’s",Paragraph
attentions until his death in 1965.,Paragraph
"The Capitol is an almost classical composition of buildings, monuments, artificial",Paragraph
"landforms, and vast geometric piazzas, all viewed against the backdrop of the Himalayas.",Paragraph
"To the top, or the northeastern extent, of the Capitol, Le Corbusier designed the",Paragraph
Governor’s Palace (unbuilt) as a “crown” for the central public square. To the right of,Caption
"this square (southeast) is the High Court (1956), or Palace of Justice, and to its left,",Paragraph
"directly facing the High Court across the central square, is the Parliament, or Assembly,",Paragraph
"building. Farther to the left, beyond the Parliament, is Le Corbusier’s Secretariat (1956),",Paragraph
which houses the ministries of the government in a single nine-story building that echoes,Paragraph
his earlier Unité d’ Habitation (1953) in Marseilles.,Paragraph
"The Parliament, which was not only the last completed building in the Capitol complex",Paragraph
"but also the cheapest, was conceived by Le Corbusier as possessing a distinctive profile.",Paragraph
The silhouette of the Parliament is a direct result of the ingenious composition of four,Paragraph
"discrete volumes. The largest of these volumes is three stories high at the piazza level, is",Paragraph
"roughly square in plan, and in elevation is presented as a horizontal, rectilinear form.",Paragraph
Three of the sides of this volume are lined with the blades of Le Corbusier’s brises-soleil,Paragraph
"(sunscreens for the offices inside), whereas the fourth facade, which faces the High Court",Paragraph
"and the central piazza, is shielded by a large freestanding portico. Prominently positioned",Paragraph
in this facade is a centrally pivoted ceremonial door. This door is covered in a brightly,Paragraph
colored enamel collage by Le Corbusier that depicts a range of iconic signs (including,Paragraph
"traces of Le Corbusier’s Modulor and solar path diagrams). The portico, which shelters",Caption
"both this door and the entire facade, is covered with a heavy scooped roof and is",Paragraph
"supported on eight concrete walls that are perforated with rounded holes, as if to belie",Paragraph
their structural function. The ceremonial entrance through this portico is flanked by twin,Paragraph
pools of water that provide reflections of the Parliament’s distinctive hyperbolic and,Paragraph
"pyramid roof forms. The larger of these roof forms, a hyperbolic shell with a truncated",Paragraph
"apex, was inspired by the industrial cooling towers of Ahmedabad. The base of this form",Paragraph
"is situated within the main square volume, from which it rises through the latter’s roof.",Paragraph
The hyperbolic shell houses the assembly chamber for the Parliament at its base and a,Paragraph
variety of special-purpose viewing galleries at upper levels. The fourth and final form is,Paragraph
"the council chamber, which is similarly located within the greater square volume and is",Paragraph
designated with a lopsided pyramid that also protrudes above the main roof. Adjacent to,Caption

assembly chamber. Both the pyramid and the truncated hyperbolic shell contain,Paragraph
elaborately sculptured skylights to partially illuminate the spaces below and to celebrate,Paragraph

"Forum, is lit by clerestory windows and possesses a weight and majesty that few 20th-",Paragraph
century buildings have been able to emulate. Both internal and external surfaces are,Paragraph
finished in rough concrete (a necessity of construction in India at that time} and openly,Paragraph
display a dense patina of age. Enigmatic bas-reliefs in the concrete walls serve only to,Paragraph
amplify the curiously spiritual character of the building.,Paragraph
"Paradoxically, it is this character of spiritual otherness that has attracted the majority of",Paragraph
the criticisms leveled at the building. The Parliament is unashamedly overpowering in its,Paragraph
"scale, finish, and appearance. Much of this is the result of Le Corbusier’s fascination with",Paragraph
"global issues: the passage of the sun, the weathering of materials, and what it means to",Paragraph
live so closely with the environment. All these preoccupations have produced a building,Paragraph

"PATKAU, PATRICIA AND JOHN",Title
"Architects, Canada",Title
The work of Patricia and John Patkau can be characterized by a very particular,Paragraph
reference to site and by its discretely tectonic character. In developing their approach to,Paragraph
"design, this young Canadian practice has sought to search out the particular and, in doing",Paragraph
"so, avoid the generalized solutions that are so pervasive in modern architecture and",Paragraph
especially so in North America. Patricia and John Patkau founded their practice in 1978,Paragraph
"in Edmonton, Alberta. Their early work consisted of houses and educational buildings on",Paragraph
"the prairies. Six years later, they relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia, and during",Paragraph
"the last 16 years, working from a studio in a loft in the heart of the city, they have",Paragraph
designed a series of private houses and public buildings for sites not only on the west,Paragraph
coast but across Canada as well.,Paragraph
Their winning competition design for the Canadian Clay and Glass Gallery (1986) in,Paragraph
Ontario marked a significant point in the development of their work. The construction of,Paragraph
"this project was delayed by a lack of funding, but when it was eventually completed in",Paragraph
"1992, the Gallery also established an important landmark in contemporary Canadian",Paragraph
architecture.,Paragraph
John Patkau studied at the University of Manitoba and graduated with a Master of,Paragraph
"Architecture degree in 1972, whereas Patricia Patkau (b. 1950} graduated from Yale",Paragraph
University after completing her undergraduate studies at the University of Manitoba.,Paragraph
"Working together and with their colleague Michael Cunningham, they have developed",Paragraph
one of the most significant architectural practices in Canada. The Patkaus scrutinize the,Paragraph
"site, construction, and materials in the settings in which they work so as to reveal the",Paragraph
"special characteristics of the place. This concern for the nature of place, which they have",Paragraph
"characterized as “investigations into the particular,’ has significantly shaped their",Paragraph
approach to design. In 1988 they designed a new school for the Seabird Island Band—a,Paragraph
Salish community at Agassiz in the Pacific Northwest. Organized to consider alternatives,Paragraph
to the institutional and prefabricated school building that were customarily provided by,Paragraph
"government for remote First Nation communities, this project was developed by the",Paragraph
"Patkaus, who worked in close collaboration with the Salish people to design a new",Paragraph
"school, built by the community. The zoomorphic form of the building created some",Paragraph
"construction problems, but despite this, the new school was well constructed by its",Paragraph
community builders in a government-sponsored scheme.,Paragraph
The Patkaus continue to receive private commissions; many of these have been within,Paragraph
areas of outstanding natural beauty. In sharp contrast to the long-established and densely,Paragraph
"built landscapes of Europe, these buildings have frequently represented the first acts of",Paragraph
settlement on a site. This first settlement on a site has fundamentally influenced the,Paragraph
"development of the residential architecture of the Patkaus. The Barnes House, for",Caption
"example, which was completed in 1994, is located at the edge of rocky outcrop",Paragraph
overlooking the Straits of Georgia in British Columbia and sited in a depression in the,Paragraph
"rock, but with the main living room on the upper floor turned to focus the long view to",Paragraph
the ocean. The house not only is embedded in the site but also serves to focus a view onto,Paragraph
the landscape. Their designs are derived from the topography and detail of the landscape.,Paragraph
"However, they also relish the constructional detail and explore a heterogeneity in ways",Paragraph
that are reminiscent of Alvar Aalto’s work.,Paragraph
"The design of new public buildings—a library at Newton, Strawberry Vale School on",Paragraph
"the outskirts of Victoria, new facilities for the Emily Carr College of Art and Design in",Caption
"Vancouver, as well as a new community school on the waterfront in Toronto—has",Paragraph
ensured that the architecture of Patricia and John Patkau has not been isolated within,Paragraph
private worlds or remote sites. These public buildings have been significant not only,Paragraph
because of their complexity and public presence but also because they embody elusive,Paragraph
"and original qualities that make reference to the culture of Canada. In this respect, the",Paragraph
"work can again be viewed alongside that of Aalto, an architect whose work became an",Paragraph
important part of the construction of a new nation. Canada can be viewed as a social,Paragraph
democratic nation that emerged from the British Commonwealth anxious to define itself,Paragraph
"and to seek out differences that distinguish it from its expansive neighbor, the United",Paragraph
"States. In the last few years, the architecture of the Patkaus has played a role in this",Paragraph
process.,Paragraph
"Increasingly, the work of Patkau Architects has been seen on the international stage.",Paragraph
"Since 1994 their work has been shown extensively in Europe and North America, and in",Paragraph
1999 they were selected to represent Canada in the Venice Biennale. This notice has also,Paragraph
brought their work to the attention of the promoters of major national and international,Paragraph
architectural competitions. Invitations to compete for several significant design projects,Paragraph
"have resulted in successful submissions for new buildings in the United States, and at",Paragraph
present they are designing new student residences for the University of Pennsylvania in,Paragraph
Philadelphia as well as for the Grande Bibliotheque du Québec in Montreal.,Paragraph
These young Canadian architects have stated that they see their work as “only at the,Paragraph
"beginning of the issues of heterogeneity that we are interested in—the variety, the",Paragraph
"difference and differentiation, the irregularity juxtaposed to regularity.” As they move",Paragraph
"into the design of large civic buildings set within different urban contexts, it will be",Paragraph
revealing to see how their declared desires for the buildings that they design—to,Paragraph
"“become more differentiated, more irregular, more various”—are made manifest.",Paragraph

"In 1894 Paul moved to Munich, the artistic capital of Wilhelmine Germany. He",Paragraph
"enrolled at the Munich Academy as a student of the painter Paul Hocker, one of the",Paragraph

staff of the satirical journal Simplicissimus. Paul’s weekly contributions to Simplicissimus,Paragraph
between 1897 and 1906 won him international acclaim.,Paragraph
In 1898 Paul began working as an applied artist. He was a leading figure in the,Paragraph
development of Jugendstil and quickly established himself as the premier designer for the,Paragraph
"Vereinigte Werkstdtten fiir Kunst im Handwerk, a maker of artistic housewares in",Paragraph
Munich. The Jugendstil Hunter’s Room he designed for the Vereinigte Werkstdtten in,Caption
1900 received a gold medal at the Paris International Exposition and was the first of a,Paragraph
series of prestigious commissions that won widespread professional admiration. In 1906,Paragraph
"Paul designed a festival decoration for a barracks in Munich, his first commission on an",Paragraph
architectural scale. His design impressed Kaiser Wilhelm II and facilitated his,Paragraph
appointment to the vacant directorship of the School of Applied Arts in Berlin.,Paragraph
Paul’s appointment in Berlin was integral to the program of educational reforms,Paragraph
"promoted by Hermann Muthesius and Wilhelm von Bode. Paul, who was a member of",Paragraph
the Munich Secession and the Berlin Secession as well as being one of the 12 artists who,Paragraph
"founded the German Werkbund, proved a committed reformer. He revised the curriculum",Paragraph
of the School of Applied Arts to promote practical craftsmanship as the basis of artistic,Paragraph
education. He emphasized the training of designers for the applied arts industries. Only,Paragraph
"the most dedicated and talented students progressed to classes in architecture, painting, or",Paragraph
"sculpture. Paul implemented the full scope of his program of reforms in 1924, when the",Paragraph
School of Applied Arts was merged with the Art School of the Prussian Academy. The,Paragraph
"new institution, the United State Schools for Fine and Applied Arts, provided a coherent",Paragraph
educational program that encompassed every technical and creative aspect of artistic,Paragraph
endeavor. Until Paul was removed from the directorship of the combined schools in 1933,Paragraph
"for his perceived antipathy to the Nazi government, he led an institution regarded by",Paragraph
Nikolaus Pevsner as one of the two most important in Germany—an honor shared with,Paragraph
"the Bauhaus (Pevsner, 1936). In terms of the scope of its curriculum and the number of",Paragraph
"its students, Paul’s school in Berlin far surpassed its contemporary in Dessau.",Paragraph
"As a designer, Paul provided more than 2000 furniture patterns to the Vereinigte",Paragraph
Werkstdtten. He also designed furniture for the Deutsche Werkstdtten in Dresden as well,Paragraph
"as designing ship interiors for the Nerddeutscher Lloyd, pianos for fbach, and streetcars",Paragraph
"for the city of Berlin. Paul’s most significant design was the Typenmdbel of 1908, the",Paragraph
"first example of modern, unit furniture conceived to allow an unlimited number of",Paragraph
"combinations of standardized, machine-made elements. Like much of his work, the",Paragraph
Typenmébel was widely published in contemporary professional journals.,Paragraph
Paul’s architecture was closely related to his designs for furnishings and interiors.,Paragraph
"Before World War I, he was best known as a residential architect whose houses were",Paragraph
"simple and elegant, efficiently planned, and devoid of superfluous ornament. His favored",Paragraph
"vocabulary, an abstracted classicism, had a profound influence on the work of his",Paragraph
"students and apprentices, who included Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Paul Thiersch,",Paragraph
"Edwin Redslob, and Adolf Meyer. In 1914 Paul designed a model house and two",Paragraph
restaurants for the Werkbund exhibition in Cologne. His buildings reflected the,Paragraph
prevailing tone of the exhibition and underscored the extent to which his prewar work,Paragraph
reflected the harmonious culture advocated by the Werkbund.,Paragraph
After 1918 Paul’s architecture reflected the changing economic and social conditions,Paragraph
of the Weimar Republic. In 1924 he designed the Plattenhaus Typ 1018 for the Deutsche,Paragraph
"Werkstdtten, a prefabricated-concrete dwelling developed in response to the pressing",Paragraph
"need for affordable housing. Although the stark, prismatic volumes of the Plattenhaus",Paragraph

PEACE MEMORIAL AND MUSEUM,Title
"Designed by Kenzo Tange; completed 1955 Hiroshima, Japan",Caption
The Hiroshima Peace Memorial and Museum not only marked the grisly ending of,Paragraph
World War LI but also skillfully expressed the challenges that Japan’s architects faced in,Paragraph
the new era.,Paragraph
"In 1949, when Kenzo Tange’s proposal took first place in a competition for the design",Paragraph
"of the Peace Park, he was already widely known for successful entries in two wartime",Paragraph
competitions: a commemorative building (1942) for the Greater East Asia Coprosperity,Title
"Sphere and the Japan-Thai Culture Center (1943). Today, most texts on Tange ignore",Paragraph
"these projects, but they demonstrate the evolution of generating ideas ultimately",Paragraph
"consummated in Hiroshima. In each, Tange’s solutions subsumed individual buildings to",Paragraph
a sweeping axial gesture that extended symbolically into the landscape. A central plaza,Paragraph
served to unite these compositions at the scale of the site; Tange had spent much of the,Paragraph
"war researching urban design, and he embraced several models not found in Japan,",Paragraph
"including the Greek agora, the Roman forum, and Capitoline Hill by Michelangelo.",Paragraph
These precedents also served to make the postwar design of Peace Park particularly,Paragraph
fitting; in an era when the American occupation forces were actively promoting,Paragraph
"democracy and public assembly, the design called for a remarkable plaza, able to",Paragraph
"accommodate 50,000 people.",Paragraph
"In the case of Tange’s Peace Park, the axis extended through the ruins of the 1914",Paragraph
"Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, now generally referred to as the Atomic Dome—",Paragraph
"the only competition proposal to incorporate this building, which is now a World",Paragraph
"Heritage site. In the postwar master plan for the reconstruction of Hiroshima, also by",Caption
"Tange, this axis continued, linking the Peace Park with zones devoted to children, sports,",Paragraph
"and culture. Although he was commissioned to design a children’s library, ultimately",Paragraph
these areas were completed without reference to Tange’s master plan and without any,Paragraph
linkage to the Peace Park.,Paragraph
"The earlier competitions also established a direction for Tange’s stylistic approach,",Paragraph
responding to fascist ideology by explicitly welding Japan’s architectural traditions to,Paragraph
"modern expression and material use. In particular, Tange referred to Ise Shrine in these",Paragraph
"projects; by the time of the Peace Park, he also drew on Katsura Imperial Villa for",Paragraph
inspiration. When postwar propaganda efforts concentrated on shifting the perception of,Paragraph
"Japan from its bushido roots to the arts, Tange’s work was widely acclaimed for its",Paragraph
"“Japanese” character. However, Tange was equivocal on this point. In his presentation of",Paragraph
"the Peace Park to CLAM (Congrés Internationaux d’ Architecture Moderne) in 1951, he",Paragraph
"noted, “The role of tradition is that of a catalyst, which furthers a chemical reaction but is",Paragraph
"no longer detectable in the end result.... We Japanese architects, in our endeavors to",Paragraph
"resolve the problems facing modern Japan, have devoted a great deal of attention to the",Paragraph
"Japanese tradition, and have, in the end, arrived at the point which I have sought to",Paragraph
"elucidate for you. If, however, there can be detected a trace of tradition in my works or in",Paragraph
"those of my generation, then our creative powers have not been at their best, then we are",Paragraph
still in the throes of evolving our creativity.”,Paragraph
Tange later described the imprint of history in the Peace Park as twofold: Yayoi,Paragraph
"traditions were elegant and intellectual, and the Jomon was vigorous and creative. The",Paragraph
delicate treatment of the louvered facade on the central Memorial Museum might be said,Paragraph
"to reveal Yayoi influences, whereas the primitive strength of the buildings and the",Paragraph
plasticity found in the pilotis reflected Jomon influences. By embracing these “Jomon”,Paragraph
"characteristics, he made a virtue of one of the challenges of postwar construction:",Paragraph
"because wartime demands for steel had brought domestic building to a standstill, the",Paragraph
"labor and experience needed for refined construction were unavailable, even in the case",Paragraph
"of reinforced concrete, which was suddenly widely employed. Furthermore, despite the",Paragraph
"maturity of the design, Tange had little experience in construction supervision, as this",Paragraph
was his first built work. Critics praised the “correct degree of roughness” found in the,Paragraph
execution of the Peace Park’s buildings.,Paragraph
Tange did not have complete control of the Peace Park’s execution. He was ultimately,Paragraph
responsible for only two of the three main buildings in the complex: the Memorial,Paragraph
"Museum (1952) and the Community Center (1955) to the east. A third building, an",Paragraph
"international conference center located to the west of the museum, was constructed using",Paragraph
"donations from the people of Hiroshima, and it was felt that a local architect would be",Paragraph
more suitable. Although the building generally conformed to the master plan in both,Paragraph
"massing and the use of a module, Tange made a point of repudiating it.",Paragraph
At the heart of the Peace Park is a centograph that stands as a memorial to victims of,Paragraph
"the atomic bomb. In the competition proposal, it was to have been the largest structure on",Paragraph
"the site, an arch (inspired by Le Corbusier’s 1931 proposal for the Palace of the Soviets)",Paragraph
"visible from the Inland Sea. Later, Tange came to the conclusion that this piece should in",Paragraph
"fact be much smaller, more a sculptural piece than an architectural one, and he invited the",Paragraph
Japanese-American sculptor Isamu Noguchi to propose a solution. Because government,Paragraph
"officials felt that having an American involved in the project was unacceptable, in the end",Paragraph
Noguchi was commissioned to design two bridges flanking the park to the north and,Paragraph
"south. Tange’s centograph, a concrete saddle vault, was built instead; in 1985 this was",Paragraph
"replaced with a granite version as part of a complete refurbishment, begun in 1983 and",Paragraph
supervised by Tange’s office.,Paragraph
The results of the remodeling are unfortunate; both buildings flanking the Memorial,Paragraph
Museum were replaced. The new buildings conform superficially to the original massing,Paragraph
"and column/ beam organization of the earlier facades, but the detailing and use of",Paragraph
"materials are contemporary and lack the power of the originals. Furthermore, the three",Paragraph
"buildings have been physically linked with a second-floor passageway, and granite",Paragraph
cladding was added to some areas of the facade of the Memorial Museum. Tange’s office,Caption
"is also supervising construction of a new building, the “National Hall Dedicated to",Paragraph
"Mourning Hiroshima’s Atomic Bomb Fatalities,” to be located east of the centograph,",Paragraph
further altering the park.,Paragraph
Although it remains possible to have some sense of the original character of the,Paragraph
"complex, much has been lost. The Peace Park continues to hold symbolic importance as",Paragraph
"ground zero of the bombing of Hiroshima. In its current state, however, it can no longer",Paragraph
be said to hold the importance that it once commanded in architectural circles.,Paragraph

"Design. (The best known of the others are Edward Larrabee Barnes, Philip Johnson, and",Paragraph

"award of any significance in his profession, from the Gold Medal of the American",Paragraph
"Institute of Architects to the Pritzker Prize. The durability of his prominence, however,",Paragraph
has much to do with his ability to grow as an artist as well as his skills in creating one of,Paragraph
the most respected firms in American architectural history.,Paragraph
Pei’s achievement is the more remarkable in light of his background. He was born in,Paragraph
"1917 in Canton, China, the son of a prominent banker, and received his early schooling in",Paragraph
"Shanghai. He came to the United States in 1935 to study, first at the University of",Paragraph

"After completing his degree, Pei went on to Harvard in 1940 to pursue architecture",Paragraph
"during the heady days of Gropius and Breuer, who had brought with them the avant-",Paragraph
garde theories and practices they had developed at the Bauhaus in Germany. Pei received,Paragraph
his Master’s degree in 1946 and briefly served on the Harvard faculty.,Paragraph
"Despite his training under European émigrés, Pei has always retained a recognizably",Paragraph
"Chinese sensitivity to nature, art, and time. (Pei’s thesis under Gropius was a design for",Paragraph
an art museum in China.) This sensitivity was developed during childhood visits to his,Paragraph

"exposed to the culture of “rock farming,” the traditional practice of selecting rocks in",Paragraph
nature and setting them aside to be eroded in lakes and rivers into ornamental elements,Paragraph
for the gardens of scholars and the wealthy.,Paragraph

Zeckendorf as head of the New York real estate magnate’s in-house architectural team.,Paragraph

"With the financial decline of the Zeckendorf firm, Pei set out on his own in 1955. He",Paragraph
"took with him several colleagues and went on with them to create 1.M.Pei and Partners,",Paragraph
which was to become one of the most respected architectural teams in the nation. Many,Paragraph
"of the buildings that the partners were to design were mundane, however well engineered",Paragraph
"and detailed, but many were of extremely high quality, and each partner was allowed to",Paragraph
pursue projects in a semiautonomous fashion. The shared affinity in the office for abstract,Paragraph
forms in concrete and glass often made it difficult to identify the lead designer for a,Paragraph
"particular project, but Pei, who has been responsible for roughly one-third of the firm’s",Paragraph
"nearly 200 buildings and urban design projects, can claim most of the best.",Paragraph
Pei’s first major achievement was the National Center for Atmospheric Research,Paragraph
"(NCAR), finished in 1967, outside Boulder, Colorado. NCAR was a boldly sculptural",Paragraph
composition that sought to integrate the scientific needs of scientists with a form that was,Paragraph
visually sympathetic to the Rocky Mountains that rose behind it.,Paragraph
The success of the Colorado building contributed heavily to Pei’s selection in 1964 by,Paragraph
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as architect for the John F.Kennedy Memorial Library.,Caption
"Originally intended for a site in Cambridge, Massachusetts, adjacent to Harvard",Paragraph
"University, the project fell prey to local politics and was eventually transferred to a site",Paragraph
"on Boston Harbor. Although the combination of crisp, abstract geometry with a large",Paragraph
glassed-in atrium overlooking the water was characteristic of the developing Pei,Paragraph
"aesthetic, in the end the extended delays and design changes that were imposed on the",Paragraph
"original made the building a disappointment, as the architect himself has conceded",Paragraph
publicly.,Paragraph
"Nevertheless, the momentum created for the firm by the Kennedy commission raised",Paragraph
"I.M.Pei and Partners to national prominence. That momentum nearly stalled, however,",Paragraph
"when the windows of the John Hancock Building, a sleek office tower completed by the",Paragraph
"firm in 1976 in Boston, began to break and fall out. The designer of the building was",Paragraph
"Pei’s partner, Henry Cobb, but the crisis affected the entire firm, and although the cause",Paragraph
"of the failure was eventually attributed to the manufacturer of the glass, the negative",Paragraph
publicity slowed new commissions to a trickle.,Paragraph
The firm began its slow return to health largely on the strength of Pei’s work in art,Paragraph
"museums, most notably the Everson Museum of Art (1968) in Syracuse, New York, and",Paragraph
"the Johnson Museum (1973) at Cornell University. These were hard-edged, late",Paragraph
modernist geometric compositions in concrete but with interiors that were both dramatic,Paragraph
and sensitive and judged to be superior settings for their collections.,Paragraph
The enthusiastic reception of these buildings led to Pei’s selection as architect of the,Paragraph
"East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, completed in 1978. Key",Caption
"to the success of the building was the client, Paul Mellon, whose father had paid for the",Paragraph
"original National Gallery (1941), designed by John Russell Pope. The East Building was",Paragraph
"a full-fledged expression of Pei’s enduring affection for abstract form, yet it was inflected",Paragraph
"on the interior with a skill at manipulating light to soften the effect of the hard materials,",Paragraph
"primarily marble and glass, and organizing the movement of visitors to create added",Paragraph
visual interest.,Paragraph
"In 1979, following the reopening of relations between the United States and China, Pei",Paragraph
accepted an invitation to design a hotel on the outskirts of Beijing. Pei hoped to develop a,Paragraph
"modern architectural form for his native country, which had sunk into grim utilitarianism,",Paragraph
while maintaining traditional Chinese architectural themes. Although the building,Paragraph
"enjoyed considerable critical success, it was neglected by its government owners and",Paragraph
failed to spark the stylistic progress that Pei had contemplated.,Paragraph
"However, the pains of Fragrant Hill, completed in 1982, were minimal compared to",Paragraph
"those of the Louvre museum in Paris, the first phase of which was completed in 1989.",Paragraph
French President Francois Mitterrand asked Pei to undertake a fundamental renovation,Paragraph
"and reorganization of the museum, and Pei responded with a proposal that was as much",Paragraph
"urban planning as architecture, redistributing the collection by emptying portions of the",Paragraph
palace formerly occupied by government agencies and creating a system of underground,Paragraph
"access. However, the attention of the public was concentrated on the glass pyramid that",Paragraph
Pei inserted at the center of the composition. The initial reaction was outrage that a,Paragraph
nonFrench architect would have the temerity to tamper with what is arguably the most,Paragraph
"sacred site of French culture. However, on completion of the pyramid itself, the reception",Paragraph
changed dramatically. Pei had hoped to minimize the effect of a new structure on the,Paragraph
existing historic architecture but ended up creating a landmark that rapidly began to,Paragraph
compete with the Eiffel Tower as a symbol of Paris itself.,Paragraph
"The year 1989 saw a host of other openings in addition to the Louvre Pyramid,",Paragraph
including the Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas and several smaller commissions.,Paragraph
All were distinguished by a softening of Pei’s austere modernist palette. The Meyerson in,Paragraph
particular displayed an almost Romantic use of curves that modulated the architect’s,Paragraph
familiar formal rigor to powerful effect. Even the 70-story Bank of China tower in Hong,Paragraph
"Kong (his only true skyscraper design), with its irregular stepped shaft, displayed a",Paragraph
compositional delicacy that had been absent from many of Pei’s earlier works.,Paragraph
By no means were all of Pei’s commissions of this period uniformly good. The Rock,Paragraph
"’n’ Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, recalled the lifelessness of the Kennedy",Paragraph
Library and for some of the same reasons. Pei’s best work has always resulted from a,Paragraph
"close personal relationship with a wealthy and powerful client, such as Paul Mellon or",Paragraph
"Francois Mitterrand, and in the case of Rock ’n’ Roll, the instability of the funding and",Paragraph
disagreements among the backers aggravated Pei’s understandably limited familiarity,Paragraph
with the musical history that the building was meant to celebrate.,Paragraph
"In 1989 Pei had already begun a gradual separation from his firm, by then named Pei,",Paragraph
"Cobb, Freed, and Partners (in recognition of his longtime collaborators Henry Cobb and",Paragraph
"James Freed), and while maintaining an office in the same building and still calling on",Paragraph

type: the technical construction and visual expression of the building’s skin.,Paragraph
The development of this interest in the building envelope can be charted through the,Paragraph

Pennsylvania Station (1902-11) was a landmark New York City railroad station,Paragraph

"advances, such as the introduction of electric traction railways at the new Gare d’Orsay",Paragraph
(1897-1900) in Paris and the availability of stronger electric locomotives and heavier,Paragraph
"tunneling equipment, had revived possibilities for the Hudson crossing. Pennsylvania",Paragraph
Railroad president Alexander Cassatt visited Paris to see the new system and returned,Paragraph
"home ready to proceed, hiring the prominent firm of McKim, Mead and White.",Paragraph
The new Pennsylvania Railroad extension would run east over the Hackensack,Paragraph
"Meadows, tunnel beneath the Hudson, and then continue underground to a majestic new",Paragraph
terminal at Eighth Avenue and Thirty-third Street. A newly acquired interest in the Long,Paragraph
Island Railroad meant that the tunnels would then cross Manhattan and the East River to,Paragraph
connect to Long Island.,Paragraph
"Of the firm’s three namesake partners, Charles Follen McKim (1847-1909) was most",Paragraph
"responsible for Pennsylvania Station’s design. His work, inspired by classical and",Paragraph
"Renaissance Roman architecture, was noted for its monumentality and elegant restraint.",Paragraph
He worked closely with Pennsylvania Railroad chief executive officer Samuel Rea and,Paragraph
"chief engineer William H.Brown. He was also assisted by two associates, William",Paragraph
"Symmes Richardson and Tenunis Van der Bent. As McKim’s health gradually failed, his",Paragraph
"associates took over primary responsibility for the work, and both he and Cassatt died",Paragraph
before the project was completed.,Paragraph
Design work began in 1902. Cassatt had proposed a “grand portal” that included a,Paragraph
"high-rise European-style hotel, but McKim rejected that idea. Historian Leland Roth",Paragraph
"speculates that this decision doomed the station years later, as a multipurpose structure",Paragraph
"would have been more adaptable to changing times. Construction began in 1904, and",Paragraph
"although the station opened in the fall of 1910, it was not completed until a year later.",Paragraph
"Occupying two full city blocks, the finished Pennsylvania Station was a functional and",Paragraph
critical success; this New York landmark was widely published and admired in the,Paragraph
"United States, England, and Europe. With its neighbor, Grand Central, Pennsylvania",Paragraph
Station did much to establish the classical form as the standard for large train stations of,Paragraph

"Pennsylvania Station, as having “that sublime quality which makes great buildings akin",Paragraph
to the permanent works of nature.”,Paragraph
"The pink granite exterior was a restrained classical composition, with Doric-columned",Paragraph
porticoes and pilasters delineating each of its facades. It departed from traditional train,Paragraph
"station architecture in its low primary roofline, as its trains were entirely underground and",Paragraph
did not need the height of a train shed. The interior reflected McKim’s deep admiration of,Paragraph
"Roman architecture, but its superstructure was modern steel, and the soaring spaces",Paragraph
within were made possible by this latest engineering element. From the Seventh Avenue,Paragraph
"main entrance, one proceeded through a portico and an arcade of shops and then",Paragraph
"descended a staircase into the majestic groin-vaulted main waiting room, lined in warm",Paragraph
"buff travertine. This room, with an elaborate coffered ceiling supported by Corinthian",Caption
"columns and lit by thermal windows, was the centerpiece of the design, a direct reference",Paragraph

latticed columns supporting a groin-vaulted glass roof that echoed the great European,Caption
"train sheds. With its staircases cascading down to the underground platforms, the",Paragraph
concourse provided what Richardson called a transition “from the monumental side of the,Paragraph
station to the utilitarian.”,Paragraph
Traffic flow within the building was carefully planned. The station covered a fan of 21,Paragraph
parallel tracks 45 feet underground,Title

and a network of service tunnels at multiple levels. A special concourse with direct street,Paragraph
"access served commuters, whose trains ran on the three northernmost tracks, and was",Paragraph
connected to nearby subway lines. The station’s concourses could be entered at numerous,Paragraph
"points from surrounding streets, and two ramped driveways, entered from Seventh",Paragraph
"Avenue on both sides of the arcade, allowed a sheltered and efficient means to drop off",Paragraph
and pick up both passengers and baggage by automobile or taxicab.,Paragraph
"As time went on, the taste for monumental classicism dissipated, rail travel declined,",Paragraph
"and Pennsylvania Station aged poorly. Increasing neglect, grime, and insensitive",Paragraph
"architectural intrusions, most notably a glaring plastic shell covering a modern ticket",Paragraph
"counter, diminished the station’s worth in its owners’ eyes. In the early 1960s,",Paragraph
Pennsylvania Railroad announced plans to demolish Pennsylvania Station and replace it,Paragraph
with an entirely subterranean modern terminal above which would be a new Madison,Paragraph
"Square Garden arena and an office skyscraper. Outraged architects, historians, and critics,",Paragraph

PERKINS AND WILL,Title
"Architecture firm, United States",Title
"Perkins and Will was formed in 1935 by two Cornell University classmates, Lawrence",Paragraph
"Bradford Perkins (1907-97) and Philip Will, Jr. (1906-85). Part of a new generation of",Paragraph
"young architects innovating in the years between the world wars, these men brought new",Paragraph
"ideas and idealism to post-World War II building needs, particularly in the area of school",Paragraph
design. Their work is marked by the study of the program that the proposed structure,Paragraph
intends to solve by looking at the way in which people use buildings. This humanistic,Paragraph
approach was influenced to some extent by their collaboration with Eliel and Eero,Paragraph
"Saarinen. According to Lawrence Perkins, it is one of the qualities that has set their",Paragraph
firm’s brand of modernism apart from that of the more severe International Style,Paragraph
"modernists, such as Mies van der Rohe, which was attractive to many young firms after",Paragraph
World War II.,Paragraph
"Specifically, Perkins and Will’s practice and promotion of progressive, functional",Paragraph
school design in the 1940s and 1950s had a tremendous influence on American,Paragraph
architecture in the last half of the 20th century. It was natural for Lawrence Perkins to,Paragraph
"participate in the design of schools; his father, the well-known Chicago architect Dwight",Paragraph
"Perkins, designed nearly 40 schools in the early part of the 20th century and served as the",Paragraph
"Chicago Board of Education architect. After moving to Chicago in 1933, Philip Will, Jr.,",Paragraph
"was responsible for the necessarily simplified, modern design of prefabricated houses for",Paragraph
"Howard Fisher’s firm General Houses, Inc. He worked directly on the company’s Steel",Paragraph
House for the 1933 Chicago Century of Progress Exposition.,Caption
"Soon after forming their firm in 1935, the two architects were joined by E.Todd",Paragraph
"Wheeler, and the firm was known as Perkins, Wheeler, and Will until 1946. The first",Paragraph
significant commission that the architects received was the Crow Island School (1940) in,Paragraph
"Winnetka, Illinois. The eager young architecture firm combined with an enlightened",Paragraph
"school superintendent, Carleton Washburne, and the respected modern visionaries Eliel",Paragraph
"and Eero Saarinen, making for a highly successful and influential new school building",Paragraph
that provided major direction to the new firm.,Paragraph
Perkins thoroughly researched and rethought the school’s uses with an eye to providing,Paragraph
"a new kind of educational facility. He interviewed grade-school children, teachers, and",Paragraph
"administrators in the planning stages. As Perkins explains, “The program...said that that",Paragraph
classroom was to be a place for a fully rounded learning and living experience at each age,Paragraph
"group; that each room was to be a colorful, flexible, child-scaled work space where the",Paragraph
"learning activity of childhood could be channeled effectively and pleasantly...color,",Paragraph
"warmth, and a place in which to work and act vigorously—these were keynotes of the",Paragraph
"earliest program” (Perkins and Cocking, 1949).",Paragraph
"As a result, Perkins and Will, along with the Saarinens, produced a very sensitively",Paragraph
designed school. One of the more striking aspects is the auditorium with progressively,Paragraph
smaller moldedplywood seating toward the front so that the children would be in seats,Paragraph
proportionate to their own sizes. The architects designed a new type of L-shaped,Paragraph
"classroom with large window walls on two sides, allowing for more and better natural",Paragraph
"light. Other innovations include individual bathrooms in each classroom, a separate",Paragraph
"activity area, and round tables instead of marching desks. In addition, the trend was",Paragraph
"toward a more healthful environment, and each class had a private courtyard, expanding",Paragraph
the possibilities for classroom activity.,Paragraph
Perkins published many of the revolutionary ideas employed in Crow Island School in,Paragraph
"his book Schools (1949), written with school superintendent Walter Cocking. This",Paragraph
"publication served a similar function in promoting progressive design for schools, as",Paragraph
George Nelson and Henry Wright’s Tomorrow’s House (1945) did for promoting the,Paragraph
"postwar homes. For example, Perkins and Cocking pointed out that Greek and Roman",Paragraph
architecture were modern in their own time yet inappropriate for today’s American needs.,Paragraph
"Changing philosophies regarding education, they held, meant rethinking school’s",Paragraph
functions. They argued for the functional reasons for the existence of features such as,Paragraph
"continuous banks of windows, trying to relieve the stigma associated at the time with the",Paragraph
widespread acceptance of modern architecture. They illustrated Schools with,Paragraph
"contemporary schools by famous architects, such as Richard Neutra and William",Paragraph
"Lescaze, to prove the benefits of such well-considered schemes. In 1957 Perkins followed",Paragraph
"up with Workplace for Learning, which featured many of the success stories of the ten",Paragraph
years since Schools was published. This included Perkins and Will’s Heathcote School,Paragraph
"(1954) in Scarsdale, New York, which Perkins considered more successful than Crow",Paragraph
"Island because of its complete interaction with nature on the site, aided by its numerous",Paragraph
glass corridors punctuated with lively colored panes.,Paragraph
"Perkins and Will provided notable solutions to corporate building types, also conceived",Paragraph
"around the people who were to use them. The Scott, Foresman, and Company",Paragraph
"Headquarters (1965) in Glenview, Illinois, a campus planned for a publisher of",Paragraph
"educational materials, was undoubtedly informed by the firm’s many educational",Paragraph
buildings. Here a series of interlinked glass and concrete pavilions housing different,Paragraph
aspects of the company were designed to give a sense of community on a 44-acre site.,Paragraph
Trees and fountains mix with walkways between the buildings to create a flow while,Paragraph
simultaneously reinforcing a sense of repose.,Paragraph
Another example of the firm’s well-considered design solutions influenced later,Paragraph
generations of architectural form givers in the urban setting. The First National Bank of,Paragraph
"Chicago (1966) was an anomaly on the Chicago skyline when it was constructed, as it",Paragraph
"eclipsed most of the Loop buildings, helping to set a precedent for the new, taller",Paragraph
skyscrapers that became ubiquitous in American cities in the decades to follow. This,Paragraph
"building, too, was a specific and inspired design solution to a complex program. The",Paragraph
"bank had to enclose all its various activities in one building, as the State of Llinois at that",Paragraph
"time forbade branch banking. Therefore, the 60-story-tall structure flares at the base to",Paragraph
"accommodate the numerous public banking facilities, and the building",Paragraph

"Architect, France",Title
Auguste Perret occupied a pivotal position in the development of the use of reinforced,Paragraph
"concrete in modern architecture, a tradition extending from Hennebique to de Baudot.",Paragraph
"Contemporary French concerns—on the one hand, an intense interest in new",Paragraph
"constructional methods, and on the other, a desire for traditional, formalist systems of",Paragraph
proportioning and ordering—find eloquent and convincing confluence in Perret’s work.,Paragraph
"Born in Brussels, Perret attended the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, where he was influenced by",Paragraph
"rationalist theorists Gaudet and Choisy, who belonged to a tradition stemming from",Paragraph
Viollet-le-Duc and Laugier. Perret combined Gaudet’s classical compositional principles,Paragraph
and Choisy’s simple and direct structural solutions with the basics of building,Paragraph
construction acquired with his brother Gustave in their father’s firm.,Paragraph
The apartments in the Rue Franklin (1904) were the first to exploit the constructional,Paragraph
"possibilities of reinforced concrete to gain a greater openness of plan, which was later to",Paragraph
"influence Le Corbusier’s plan libre (free plan), and larger windows on a restricted site.",Paragraph
"The external framework is emphasized and covered, partly for practical reasons, by",Paragraph
omamental tiles that follow the structural contours. The angular effect contrasts with,Paragraph
contemporary Parisian Art Nouveau apartments.,Paragraph
"Decorative elements are eschewed in the Garage Ponthieu (1905), which Perret called",Paragraph
“the world’s first experiment in aesthetic reinforced concrete.” The concrete frame of the,Paragraph
"interior, with its large spans and thin supports, allowed considerable flexibility in",Paragraph
accordance with the function of the building. The formal aspects include the strongly,Paragraph
"geometric facade with classical resonances in its arrangement, the upper attic story, and",Paragraph
"the two cylindrical, nonconstructional pillar supports of the main entrance. The Thédatre",Caption
"des Champs-Elysées (1913) in Paris, originally planned by Henri van de Velde but",Paragraph
"carried out to Perret’s designs, shows a contrast between the ingeniously delicate",Paragraph
"framework of the building designed to allow uninterrupted views and the heavy walls,",Paragraph
"pilasters, and cornices of the facade that betray Perret’s classical sympathies.",Caption
"The church of Notre Dame at Le Raincy (1923) near Paris marks a departure from, and",Paragraph
"yet a logical culmination of, Perret’s pre-World War | work. A building of high technical",Paragraph
"innovation, this memorial church established him as the leading exponent of this",Paragraph
architectural system. The structure demonstrates the way in which a modern material,Paragraph
such as reinforced concrete could be used to reinterpret traditional ecclesiastical,Paragraph
typologies while maintaining a visual connection with established forms. The outer walls,Paragraph
constructed from prefabricated components create perforated concrete screens that allow,Paragraph
"the light to filter into the interior. These combine with the nave, aisles, and slim columns",Paragraph
"carrying low-arching vaults to create a light and graceful interior. Traditional principles,",Paragraph
"both classical and Gothic, are invoked, and yet the building denies adherence to either.",Paragraph
"After the war, Perret further pursued the neoclassical elements of simplicity and clarity",Paragraph
exhibited so clearly in the Théatre des Champs-Elysées. His command of the essentials of,Paragraph
classicism is well represented in designs for the competitions for the Palace of the League,Paragraph
of Nations (1927) in Geneva and the Palace of the Soviets (1931) in Moscow. Perhaps the,Paragraph
"best expression of Perret’s doctrine was the Hotel du Mobilier National (1934) in Paris,",Paragraph
which addressed the problem of combining diverse practical requirements in one building,Paragraph
and the problem of a sloping site. The Musée des Travaux Publics (1932) in Paris served,Paragraph
"as a museum for large engineering models, and so the internal columns were minimal.",Paragraph
The tide of opinion among the international avant-garde was indifferent to the classical,Paragraph
affinities of these buildings despite their structural novelty and ingenuity.,Paragraph
Special interest attaches to the apartment building (1932) built speculatively at 51-55,Paragraph
"rue Raynouard in Paris. Perret occupied an apartment at the top, and a spiral staircase",Paragraph
gave access to the firm’s offices on the lower level. Perret accommodated the challenges,Paragraph
of the comer triangular site by building nine stories above the level of the rue Raynouard,Caption
and 12 above the level of the rue Berton. The structure introduced a radical approach in,Paragraph
that all the posts and beams were poured in place and the in-fills precast in bare concrete.,Paragraph
Perret’s most important postwar commission was the reconstruction of Le Havre,Paragraph
"(1956), destroyed during the war. With a group of disciples, he developed a master plan",Paragraph
that serves as a model of 20th-century neoclassical town planning. Perret designed the,Paragraph
plaza that housed the new city hall as well as the church of St. Joseph (1957). He was the,Paragraph

"Charlotte Perriand, typically remembered as Le Corbusier’s privileged assistant,",Paragraph
remains not only one of the most significant figures of French modernism but also one of,Paragraph
the most influential French interior designers. Her artistic activity spans over three,Paragraph
quarters of the 20th century. Trained between 1920 and 1925 at the Ecole Centrale des,Paragraph
Arts Décoratifs under traditional French décorateurs committed to an Art Deco concept,Paragraph
"of modernity, her first exhibition as an independent professional took place at the 1926",Paragraph
"Salon d’Automne, where she presented a coin de salon in a conventional French art",Paragraph
"décoratif manner. Her radical turn toward machine-derived furniture, however, occurred",Paragraph
"at the 1927 Salon d’Automne with a bar sous le toit, which brought her instant notoriety.",Paragraph
She was almost immediately invited to join Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret’s office,Paragraph
"and was soon to become, at age 25, their main furniture and interior designer. In",Paragraph
"association with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret, she furnished the villa Laroche in",Paragraph
"1928, the villa Church at Villed’Avray in 1929, the Swiss pavilion at the Cité",Paragraph
"Universitaire in 1932, and the Cité Refuge of the Salvation Army in 1932.",Paragraph
"Her early modernist work, oriented primarily to demonstrating the viability of",Paragraph
"industrial materials and forms for elite purposes, was characterized by lightweight",Paragraph
furniture made of bicycle tubes enhanced with leather seats and a wealth of highly,Paragraph
"reflective, chrome-plated and glazed surfaces evoking the glittery automobile wheels,",Paragraph
"windshields, fenders, and hoods that were taking over the metropolitan landscape. Early",Paragraph
"on, Perriand’s interest in mechanical metaphors broadened to include movement and",Paragraph
"transformability, as her dining chairs began to rotate on ball bearings, similar to those she",Paragraph
"wore around her neck; her tables expanded or shrank along rolling, rubber surfaces.",Paragraph
"Although adopting Le Corbusier’s concept of furniture as “home equipment,”",Paragraph
Perriand’s contribution both to the Le Corbusier-Jeanneret office repertoire and to Le,Paragraph
Corbusier’s own development in respect to interior design was considerable. She brought,Paragraph
"to the office a distinctly new orientation, associated with a novel sense of the art de vivre.",Paragraph
"Through a more personal and expressive rendition of modernism, Perriand introduced",Paragraph
an understanding for “total design” enhanced with lavish comfort and whimsical,Paragraph
"sophistication. Perriand’s radical, comprehensive aesthetic approach to modern interiors",Paragraph
was complemented by Le Corbusier’s programmatic concept of équipement as opposed,Paragraph
to decoration. This self-proclaimed functionalist approach to interior design dominated,Paragraph
the first common exhibition of the Perriand-Le Corbusier-Jeanneret trio at the 1929 Salon,Paragraph
d’Automne. The exhibits presented under Thonet’s sponsorship were dedicated to the,Paragraph
"Equipement de I’habitation: des casiers, des siéges, des tables—all characterized by",Paragraph
"standardization and modular deployment, resulting in what became known as the Le",Paragraph
Corbusian concept of objet type. A characteristic example of such type-object in,Paragraph
Perriand’s production was her 1928 rotating dining chair—erroneously attributed to Le,Paragraph
Corbusier—that she re-used over the years in different contexts.,Paragraph
"Passionately involved with radical leftist groups among artists, Perriand joined in 1932",Paragraph
"the Association des Ecrivains et Artistes Révolutionaires (AEAR), sponsored by the",Paragraph
"Communist Party, and participated in the activities of the Maison de la Culture led by",Paragraph
Louis Aragon. She viewed this activity as a logical extension of her role in the 1930,Paragraph
creation of the Union des Artistes Modernes (UAM).,Paragraph
"Informed by her social and political commitments, which included two trips to the",Paragraph
"Soviet Union and projects for the Front Populaire government, in 1936 Perriand",Paragraph
"presented at the Third Housing Exhibition of the Salon des Arts Ménagers inexpensive,",Paragraph
"mass-produced home fittings, such as her innovative chaise pliable et empilable. She",Paragraph
combined with her own furniture standard Flambo metal shelving that could meet the,Paragraph
"needs of a small worker’s apartment necessarily oriented toward multifunctional,",Paragraph
"transformable spaces. Along with her new interest in affordable, industrially produced",Paragraph
"house equipment, she increasingly turned to an art brut in which wood and natural forms",Paragraph
"replaced metal, and artisanal objects took over designs emblematic of the machine.",Paragraph
"Consistent with a newfound essentialism, Perriand explored further through",Paragraph
"photography the aesthetic potential of “accidental” forms, whether natural or industrial.",Paragraph
"Her first, 1938 tables en forme, replaced furniture boasting mechanical motion with static",Paragraph
"objects shaped to fit the movement of the human body, thus providing metaphors for her",Paragraph
new organicism.,Paragraph
"In 1940, three months before the Nazi invasion of France, Perriand accepted Japan’s",Paragraph
invitation to assume the position formerly held by Bruno Taut as industrial design adviser,Paragraph
to the government. Japan’s efforts at modernization without jeopardizing its intricate,Paragraph
cultural heritage met successfully with Perriand’s own efforts to achieve a seamless,Paragraph
"symbiosis between the industrial and the artisanal, the fabricated and the natural. She",Paragraph
found in the everyday life of the Japanese house some principles that she had tried to,Paragraph
apply in her work with Le Corbusier: the influence of the environment on modes of,Paragraph
inhabitation and the liberation of the interior space through the absorption of household,Title
equipment into the walls of the dwelling. This concept emulated the Zen Buddhist,Paragraph
understanding of the Void as “stimulating emptiness” rather than sterile absence. Perriand,Paragraph
reinvented for Western needs the relationship between space and motion by adapting to,Paragraph
modern life the Japanese view that harmonious human movement is possible only within,Paragraph
emptiness. Her exhibitions for the Takashimaya department stores played a significant,Paragraph
role in adapting Western modern techniques to fit the Japanese traditional spirit and were,Paragraph
just the beginning of a series of similar exhibitions held simultaneously in France and,Paragraph
Japan after the war.,Paragraph
"Ultimately, Perriand’s contact with Japan and its distinctive classicism—recognized as",Paragraph
germane to Western modernism at least since Frank Lloyd Wright and French,Paragraph
"Japonisme—helped purify her own art brut into a postwar sophistication reminiscent, in",Paragraph

Steel was the dominant structural material for tall buildings for most of the 20th,Paragraph

Nikolaus Pevsner transformed the discipline of architectural history in Britain. More,Paragraph
"than any other single individual, architect, or critic, he molded the taste of English",Paragraph
architects throughout the 1940s and 1950s and developed public awareness and,Paragraph

"Britain as a refugee from Nazi Germany in 1933, architectural history and criticism in",Paragraph
Britain was very largely a dilettante activity taken up by gentleman architects and,Paragraph

"academic circles. However, among architects, architectural students, and the general",Paragraph
"public in Britain, Pevsner’s achievements and influence stand head and shoulders above",Paragraph

"PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA",Title
"Philadelphia began the 20th century as the third-largest city in the United States, after",Paragraph
New York and Chicago. It was an economically prosperous manufacturing center and a,Paragraph
"significant port that attracted many immigrants from the poorer areas of Eastern Europe,",Paragraph
"southern Italy, and the southern United States. Although it had lost its position as",Paragraph
"America’s political, financial, and cultural capital to Washington, DC, and New York,",Paragraph
Philadelphia was a thriving industrial metropolis at the turn of the 20th century.,Paragraph
The epitome of Philadelphia’s confidence at this time can be seen in its City Hall,Paragraph
"(1871-1901), designed by John McArthur, Jr., and Thomas Ustick Walter in an ornately",Paragraph
decorative Second Empire style with sculptures by Alexander Calder. This imposing and,Paragraph
monumental structure fills a massive square block broken only by pedestrian passages,Paragraph
that continue Philadelphia’s axes of Broad and Market Streets into its center courtyard. In,Paragraph
"addition, City Hall’s tower, with clock and sculpture of founder William Penn,",Caption
prominently stands out from all parts of the city. This was especially so before Helmut,Paragraph
"Jahn’s Liberty Place (1987), when there was an unwritten “gentleman’s agreement” not",Paragraph
to build higher than City Hall’s tower.,Paragraph
"During the 20th century, Philadelphia gradually moved away from its 19th-century",Paragraph
manufacturing history and developed into a service economy with the building of office,Paragraph
"buildings, hotels, department stores, apartment buildings, banks, and cultural buildings.",Paragraph
Daniel Burnham’s Land Title Buildings (1897 and 1902) introduced to Philadelphia,Paragraph
the practice of downsizing the presence of a building’s steel frame behind external,Paragraph
omament and a curtain wall. (City Hall is constructed with load-bearing stone,Paragraph
"approximately 22 feet thick at its base.) This practice continued into the 20th century,",Paragraph
most notably with the Art Deco-style East Penn Square (1930) by Ritter and Shay. The,Paragraph
first Philadelphia building to break away from this tradition was George Howe and,Paragraph
"William Lescaze’s Philadelphia Savings Fund Society (PSFS) Building (1932), one of the",Caption
first International Style skyscrapers in the United States and a daring architectural,Paragraph
statement by a conservative institution such as a bank.,Paragraph
The convention of expressing a tall building’s steel frame continued as modernism,Paragraph
"flourished in the decades after World War Il. The Penn Center development (1953-82),",Paragraph
"proposed by Edmund Bacon and Vincent Kling, was made possible by the construction of",Paragraph
"Suburban Station (1924-29) and 30th Street Station (1927-34), both by Graham,",Paragraph
"Anderson, Probst and White, and the 1953 demolition of Broad Street Station (1892-93)",Caption
and its elevated railroad tracks. Penn Center is worthy of mention if only because of its,Paragraph
"integration of transportation, retail, and office facilities. Other notable buildings in this",Paragraph
area west of City Hall include the pyramid-topped Mellon Bank Center (1990) by Kohn,Caption
Pederson Fox and the electric-razor-like Bell Atlantic Tower (1991) by the Kling-,Caption
Lindquist Partnership.,Paragraph
"Befitting a city with money to spend, Philadelphia produced a considerable amount of",Paragraph

"inside, was purposely built to be a self-contained shopping experience.",Paragraph
Philadelphia’s last big foray into retail in the 20th century came between 1974 and,Paragraph
1983 with the development known as “The Gallery” by Bower and Fradley (phase 1) and,Paragraph

"Gallery cannot be commended, however, for its typical and banal shopping mall",Paragraph
"appearance and for the way it stole the street life away from nearby Chestnut Street,",Paragraph
which had been pedestrianized in 1973.,Paragraph
Prominent bank buildings in 20th-century Philadelphia include the Girard Trust,Paragraph
"Company (1905-08), a brilliantly white lonic temple by McKim, Mead and White. The",Paragraph
Federal Reserve Bank (1931-35) by Paul Phillipe Cret is a bit more stripped down in its,Paragraph
classicism. The previously mentioned PSFS Building was internally innovative in the,Paragraph
"way its banking hall was located on an upper floor of its sleek polished-granite base, with",Paragraph
street level given over to retail.,Paragraph
The major cultural project of the early 20th century was the creation of the Benjamin,Paragraph
"Franklin Parkway (1907-41), a spacious boulevard modeled after Paris’s Champs-",Paragraph
"Elysées, which cuts through Philadelphia’s street grid to connect City Hall with",Paragraph
Fairmount Park. The idea for the Parkway was first inspired by the World’s Columbian,Paragraph
"Exhibition of 1893 in Chicago, which promoted broad avenues with gleamingly white",Paragraph
neoclassical buildings under the guise of the City Beautiful Movement.,Paragraph
The Parkway itself was officially designed and planned by Jacques Grabér and Paul,Paragraph
"Philippe Cret, but its crowning glory is the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1916-28) by",Paragraph
"Horace Trumbauer, especially in the way it mediates Fairmount Park and the city. Along",Paragraph

The second half of the 20th century produced two stars of the international,Paragraph
architectural scene from Philadelphia: Louis Kahn and Robert Venturi. Kahn’s,Paragraph
"Philadelphia masterpieces include the Margaret Esherick House (1960) in Chestnut Hill,",Paragraph
"a private residence that beautifully makes use of natural light to enhance the interior, and",Paragraph
the University of Pennsylvania’s Richards Medical Research Laboratory (1957-61),Caption
whose “served” and “service” spaces influenced a generation of architects. Venturi was,Paragraph
born in Philadelphia and briefly worked for Kahn before establishing his own practice,Paragraph

"include the Vanna Venturi House (1962), a private residence for his mother, and the",Paragraph
"Guild House (1960-63), an apartment house for the elderly both of which have been",Paragraph
mistakenly credited as the foundation of Postmodernist architecture.,Paragraph
"After World War II, the character of Philadelphia began to change. Beginning in 1948,",Paragraph
under the good intentions of creating space around Independence Hall (the location of the,Paragraph
"signing of the Declaration of Independence and the writing of the Constitution), many",Paragraph
buildings were cleared to form empty strips of land called Independence Mall and,Paragraph

PHOENIX CENTRAL LIBRARY,Title
Designed by Will Bruder (bruderD WLarchitects); completed 1995,Caption
"Phoenix, Arizona",Title
"The Phoenix Central Library was the first major commission for Will Bruder (1946-),",Paragraph
"an artist and self-trained architect who lives and works in New River, Arizona, in the",Paragraph
"desert north of Phoenix. Opened in 1995, the building has earned critical acclaim from",Paragraph
the architectural profession for its poetic and economical integration of everyday,Paragraph
"materials, natural lighting, and environmental technologies as well as for its local and",Paragraph
"regional specificity, achieved without recourse to historical pastiche. Planned in close",Paragraph
"collaboration with the library’s professional staff, the building also received in 1997 an",Paragraph
Award of Excellence in a library building award program cosponsored by the American,Paragraph
Institute of Architects and the American Library Association.,Caption
"The campaign for a new central library in Phoenix began in the early 1980s, but the",Paragraph
"project began in earnest only in 1988, when the city passed a $1.2 billion bond issue to",Paragraph
"finance the construction of several new cultural institutions. In the summer of 1989, the",Paragraph
"city issued a request for proposals for the library, and by the end of the year a selection",Paragraph
committee had picked Bruder’s firm (known as bruderDWLarchitects) from a pool of,Paragraph
five finalists that also included Antoine Predock and Ricardo Legorreta. In the first half,Paragraph
"of 1990, the design team (led by Bruder and Wendell Burnette) refined the building",Paragraph
program by conducting interviews with the entire library staff (including city librarian,Paragraph
"Ralph Edwards, central library director Rosemary Nelson, and president of the library",Title
board of trustees Elinor Green Hunter) and by holding 28 citizen meetings. The basic,Paragraph
design concepts were in place by November 1990. Despite some resistance to the initial,Paragraph
design (fueled in part by Bruder’s description of the building as a “kinetically energized,Paragraph
"arrival pavilion”), the city council approved the plan in early January 1991.",Paragraph
"As a library, the Phoenix building owes a great deal to postwar developments of the",Paragraph
building type and particularly to the concept of the modular library. Using a planning,Paragraph
"module based on the standard dimensions and spacing of bookshelves, this system",Paragraph
allowed bookshelves to be placed anywhere in the library and facilitated the integration,Paragraph
"of reading and book storage areas. Such buildings typically had large, square (or nearly",Paragraph
square) footprints; uniform ceiling heights; and flat ceilings to conceal the requisite air-,Paragraph
"handling equipment and artificial lighting. At the Phoenix Central Library, a skeleton of",Caption
"concrete columns in the main body of the building rises from a planning module 32 feet,",Paragraph
"8 inches square, creating a nearly square footprint approximately an acre in area at the",Paragraph
"upper floors. On the first four floors, these columns carry a precast T ceiling system that",Paragraph
"houses the east-west chases for lighting fixtures, air ducts, and power and data lines;",Paragraph
"concealed behind slightly concave aluminum panels, these chases are in turn served by",Paragraph
"aluminum-covered soffits, called “power bellies,” which run north-south just inside the",Paragraph
main body of the building. Flexibility—the watchword of postwar library planning—is,Paragraph
here enhanced by housing ancillary and service functions in “saddlebags” (the architects’,Paragraph
"term for the curved, copper-clad elements that flank the main body of the building along",Paragraph
its east and west sides) and extended to computer terminals that can be located anywhere,Paragraph
in the library.,Paragraph
"Phoenix Central Library (1995), grand staircase leading to Reading Room",Caption

"While the Phoenix Central Library updates the technology of the modular library, it also",Paragraph
moves beyond the monotonous interiors that characterized libraries in the postwar period.,Paragraph
"In part, this is achieved by glazing the north and south walls and providing natural",Paragraph
lighting and dramatic views of the city and surrounding mountains. Computer-controlled,Paragraph
mechanical louvers on the building’s south side adjust continuously to block the strong,Paragraph
"desert sun, and on the north side Teflon-covered sails prevent glare. Natural lighting is",Paragraph
"also brought into the core of the building through the “crystal canyon,” a five-story skylit",Paragraph
atrium surrounded on three sides by glass and on the fourth by glass-encased elevators.,Paragraph
The Phoenix Central Library also updates the postwar type with the reintroduction of a,Paragraph
"monumental public reading room. In this case, the room is on the fifth floor, where it can",Paragraph
take advantage of substantially taller ceiling heights and dramatic views; mechanical,Paragraph
systems at this level are laid beneath a raised floor deck. Dominated by 30-foot-tall,Paragraph
"columns that taper from two feet at the base to ten inches at the top, this room has been",Paragraph
compared to the great reading room in Henri Labrouste’s Bibliothéque Nationale (1858—,Caption
68) in Paris and to hypostyle halls of ancient Egyptian temples. Above each column is a,Caption
"skylight of laminated glass seven feet in diameter; in each, a hole in the blue interlayer",Paragraph
"provides clear glass opening four inches in diameter, calculated to allow the sunlight of",Paragraph
the summer solstice to “light” the candlestick columns. (The library sponsors,Paragraph
"Phoenix Central Library (1995), South elevation",Caption
© Bill Timmerman. Photo courtesy William P.Bruder Architects,Caption
"a solstice event each year, which has brought as many as 1500 people to witness the",Paragraph
effect.),Paragraph
"These skylights also call attention to the fact that the columns stop short of the ceiling,",Paragraph
"which seems to float overhead. The ceiling is, in fact, supported by a “tensegrity”",Paragraph
"structure developed by Michael Ishler, an engineer with Ove Arup and Partners.",Paragraph
"Anchored to the steel caps bolted to the top of the columns, steel cables support vertical",Paragraph
struts that in turn support the north-south purlins of the galvanized-steel roof deck. The,Paragraph
"roof deck also stops short of the walls on the east and west sides of the room, allowing",Paragraph
daylight to wash down their concrete surfaces.,Paragraph
"The Phoenix Central Library is noteworthy also for its regional character. Bruder, for",Paragraph
"example, drew on a number of regional metaphors in the process of refining the initial",Paragraph
design concept. In addition to the crystal canyon and the saddlebags mentioned,Paragraph
"previously, Bruder has compared the building itself to a man-made mesa, its scaleless",Paragraph
mass rising abruptly from the desert floor. The building also acknowledges its locale,Paragraph
"through its attention to the power of the desert sun. The 12-inch concrete walls, which",Paragraph
"separate the main body of the building from the saddlebags to the east and west, insulate",Paragraph
those facades and allow the air conditioning to function smoothly. The experience of the,Paragraph
main reading room—where the glazing of the north and south walls is most apparent and,Paragraph
where sunlight washes the east and west walls—is particularly affected by the time of day,Paragraph
and the time of year.,Paragraph
The library’s regional specificity is also evident in the choice of materials: copper used,Paragraph
to clad the steel-frame saddlebags is one of Arizona’s most important natural resources,Paragraph
(although copper sheets of the size needed here could be found at a competitive price,Paragraph
"only in Germany). Striations in the copper are the result of roll forming, a technique",Paragraph
normally used to construct metal grain silos. Its use here is both expressive (in that it,Paragraph
links the library to the industrialized agribusiness that sustains the state) and practical:,Paragraph
"because of the rigidity of the corrugation that it achieves, the technique allowed the use of",Paragraph
an exceptionally thin gauge copper that cost only $1 more per square foot than the stucco,Paragraph
"often used in the Southwest to imitate adobe. In the end, the library cost less than $100",Paragraph
"per square foot, demonstrating Bruder’s commitment to an architecture in which “both",Paragraph
"pragmatism and poetry are served with equal passion” (Bruder, quoted in Ojeda, 1999).",Paragraph

"Renzo Piano, born in 1937 in the Mediterranean harbor city of Genoa, has been one of",Paragraph
the most influential architectural personalities since the 1980s. He was strongly,Paragraph
"influenced by Franco Albini and Emesto Rogers, who were his professors at the",Paragraph
"Polytechnical University in Milan. Jean Prouvé, Pierluigi Nervi, and the work of",Caption
Buckminster Fuller also exerted a strong influence on the architect.,Paragraph
"After Piano ended his academic career at the Polytechnical University, he founded",Paragraph
"Studio Piano, his first architectural office (1964-70). During this period, Piano also",Paragraph
worked with Louis |.Kahn in Philadelphia and Z.S.Makowsky in London. He first gained,Paragraph
international recognition when he went into partnership with English architect Richard,Paragraph
"Rogers from 1971 to 1977, emphasizing technology in architecture. From 1977 to 1981,",Paragraph
"he partnered with engineer and humanist Peter Rice (1935-92), who influenced Piano’s",Paragraph
"work significantly with his focus on structural systems. After the death of Rice, Piano",Paragraph
founded the Renzo Piano Building Workshop. The innovative and experimental character,Paragraph
of Piano’s work is based on team workshops that are filled with young talent from around,Paragraph
"the world. Like only a handful of architects, Piano has planned and realized a broad range",Paragraph
of projects on a worldwide basis.,Paragraph
For Piano architecture is a creative process of communication and participation in,Paragraph
"which architectural solutions follow a process of diagnosis, design, realization, and",Paragraph
documentation. This procedure was developed during the UNESCO-Workshop in,Paragraph
"Otranto, Italy (1978). A mobile display and communication box covered with a tent",Paragraph
structure offered a central public forum. Piano created an environment allowing direct,Paragraph
verbal confrontation and active participation of the community in the search for,Paragraph
respectful restoration methods.,Paragraph
Piano and Rogers’s Georges Pompidou Center (1978) is located in a sensitive urban,Paragraph
"environment in downtown Paris. Against considerable public and political resistance,",Paragraph
Piano and Rogers designed a cultural forum in the form of a highly visible machine.,Paragraph
"Approximately 25,000 visitors participate daily in all sorts of cultural events on the inside",Paragraph
as well as on the rectangular plaza in front of the Pompidou Center. Visitors enter the,Paragraph
building through a transparent escalator that is attached to the external structural,Paragraph
"framework, which opens to a multilevel, open spatial layout. The floor plan is flexible",Paragraph
and non-load bearing.,Paragraph
"In 1982 Piano produced the space of the Palazzo a Vela in Turin, Italy, for the",Paragraph
exhibition of the works of Alexander Calder. He put a stage installation together that,Paragraph
"incorporated the play of light, space, and temperature. Piano was able to create an open",Paragraph
environment that liberated the boundaries of materiality. The dark and cool space offers a,Paragraph
dimension where the mobile structures of Calder have a maximal effect on their observer.,Paragraph
"Piano’s work often experiments with the use of materials, which was especially evident",Paragraph
in the IBM Traveling Pavilion (1986). The 48-meter-long tube was designed to display,Paragraph
new forms of communication technology. The modular and transparent exhibition space,Paragraph
is remarkable in its unusual combination of old and new materials and their connecting,Paragraph
techniques.,Paragraph
In Turin Piano was engaged with the reorganization of a historical industrial,Paragraph
"monument, the Lingotto (1995). In the 1920s, engineer Matté Trucco designed a 500-",Paragraph
meter-long and five-story-high industrial complex for the car manufacturer Fiat. At its,Paragraph
"time, the structure followed the requirements of functionalism. Piano transformed this",Paragraph
highly visible sign of the industrial revolution into a “multifunctional service and,Paragraph
research center.” He placed a large auditorium space for cultural events into the existing,Paragraph
structure. An inner courtyard was transformed into a public garden that reflected the,Paragraph
"Mediterranean character of Turin, and a rooftop, bubble-formed conference room located",Paragraph
close to a helicopter platform became a new symbol of innovation for the city.,Paragraph
"For the 500-year anniversary of Columbus’s discovery of America, Piano completed in",Paragraph
"1992 his first large-scale urban project. His hometown, Genoa, commissioned Piano to",Paragraph
permanently reorganize the old harbor to revitalize the abandoned maritime area. Piano,Caption
was confronted with the difficult task of linking the industrial harbor with the historic,Paragraph
town structure by overcoming a division marked by an elevated major arterial road. Piano,Caption
"demolished no buildings but, rather, carefully implemented new functions in restored",Paragraph
historical buildings or added new ones. His gentle revitalization concept helped to,Paragraph
develop the old harbor into a vital cultural and recreational center of Genoa.,Paragraph
"Piano and Rice built the San Nicola sports stadium (1990) in Bari, Italy, for the soccer",Paragraph
"world championship. The project requirements demanded that 60,000 people could enjoy",Paragraph
the game and that standards for security not be ignored. They focused on optimal,Paragraph
"visibility, modular separation of fan masses, and an unusually high number of exit",Paragraph
systems. Staircases between the seating sections also enhanced the vertical and horizontal,Paragraph
"cross ventilation. Piano and Rice created an elliptical floral-like stadium, expressing the",Paragraph
plasticity of reinforced concrete in the manner of Pier Luigi Nervi.,Paragraph
The 220 low-income apartments (1991) in the Rue de Meaux in Paris were Piano’s,Paragraph
first housing complexes in which he proved that architectural and spatial quality do not,Paragraph
always depend on large budgets. The facade demonstrates Piano’s passion to reinvent the,Paragraph
"application of traditional and new materials. Glass, terra-cotta, and fiber-reinforced",Paragraph
concrete exude Piano’s interpretation of Le Corbusian rationality.,Paragraph
Piano’s final project with Rice was the design and construction of the Kansai,Paragraph
"International Airport (1994) in Osaka, Japan; a steel building of simple geometry in",Paragraph
which most internal structural elements were left visible. A physical site literally did not,Paragraph
"exist, as the proposed location of the airport was in the oceanic bay of Osaka. An",Paragraph
artificial island on stilts first had to be built under extreme engineering demands. Piano,Paragraph
envisioned a 1.7-kilometer-long building whose form derived from precise mathematical,Paragraph
calculations following the laws of aerodynamics.,Paragraph
"Piano unifies science and architecture in his work. Punta Nave, the Renzo Piano",Paragraph
"Building Workshop in Genoa-Vesima (1991), also serves as a UNESCO laboratory for",Paragraph
climate and the use of natural light in architecture. The transparent building is located on,Paragraph
"a significant slope, accessible only by cable car. The workshop building is organized in",Paragraph
"sections that step topographically down hills, providing most workspaces with a view to",Paragraph
the Mediterranean Sea. The glass roof is partially covered with solar-controlled louvers,Caption
that interact automatically with changing daylight conditions. With this rather small,Paragraph
"project, Piano was able to create a productive team space in which architects and",Paragraph
scientists are able to explore architectural solutions in tune with their environment.,Paragraph
"Among others, this building exemplifies Piano’s methods and ideas pertaining to",Paragraph
sustainable architecture.,Paragraph
"In Switzerland, Piano realized the Fondation Beyler Museum (1997) in Riehen/Basel.",Paragraph
"Similar to the Menil Collection, his most important building material was the natural light",Paragraph
"that he physically enclosed with sandstone, steel, and glass. The strict and rectangular",Paragraph
building is covered by a glass roof and opens on three sides to a park. Like few other,Paragraph
"architects, Piano understands how to dissolve the barriers between inside and outside.",Paragraph
One is reminded of Mies van der Rohe’s Barcelona Pavilion in the way that Piano,Paragraph
connects exhibition space on the inside and water ponds on the outside. The museum is,Paragraph
extended into a space continuum that finds a symbiosis between art and architecture.,Paragraph
"At the very end of the 20th century, Piano’s most significant project was the new",Paragraph
multifunctional development of the Potsdamer Platz (1999) in Berlin. The Potsdamer,Paragraph
Platz was one of Europe’s most important centers of cultural life in the 1920s. For Piano,Paragraph
it meant that he had to redevelop what years ago was either destroyed by World War II or,Paragraph
"erased by postwar city planners. Under the leadership of Piano, internationally renowned",Paragraph
"architects, such as Arata Isozaki, Hans Kohlhoff, Lauber and Wohr, Rafael Moneo, and",Paragraph
"Richard Rogers, have transferred the Postdamer Platz from a deserted empty historical",Paragraph
space back into a lively part of downtown Berlin. New architectural developments range,Paragraph
"from shopping centers, theater, cinemas, restaurants, offices, and corporate headquarters",Paragraph
"to apartment houses. Surrounded by the water of the nearby Spree River, Piano designed",Caption
eight of the 19 buildings of the Postdamer Platz. His buildings have the double-layered,Paragraph
"terra-cotta facade to formally unify the large area as a whole. As the core project, he",Paragraph
created a new piazza between Potsdamer Strasse and Kulturforum as a metaphoric,Paragraph
intersection between the former East and West German cultures.,Paragraph
"Piano’s projects are difficult to place in a particular category, but he is certainly one of",Paragraph
the most exceptional architects of the 20th century. He constantly tries to liberate his,Paragraph
design intentions from formal constricting preoccupations as he unifies art and technique.,Paragraph
"For Piano, the design process is not a linear progression to the final product. Piano’s",Paragraph
architecture develops out of a circular process in which presolutions are constantly,Paragraph
"reevaluated. For that reason, the team workshops develop a countless number of models",Paragraph
on an extraordinary high level of craftsmanship. His architecture often applies the latest,Paragraph
"technology but is never dominated by it. As a result, most of his buildings appear rich in",Paragraph
details but often seem so light as to lift up in the wind. Stability is achieved by their,Paragraph
"flexibility—an intelligent relationship to dominant cultural, historical, and environmental",Paragraph
facts.,Paragraph

"Architects, Finland",Title
"In the 1960s, Reima and Raili Pietilaé became the leading architects of Finland by",Paragraph
"proposing an organic architecture as opposed to the uniform, prefabricated architecture of",Paragraph
"that time, an approach that related their work to that of Alvar Aalto. The roots of Pietilis’",Paragraph
architecture lie partly in the tradition of European Expressionism of the 1920s; partly in,Paragraph
"the theoretical influence of Aulis Blomstedt, the founder of the study group Le Carré",Paragraph
Bleu; and partly in the awareness of the genius loci. They created a theory of imitating,Paragraph
"nature with architecture, and their design approach can be described as being natural and",Paragraph
intellectual at the same time.,Paragraph
"Although Reima and Raili Pietila adressed issues such as language, literature,",Paragraph
"philosophy, and art on the theoretical level, the formal approach of their architecture is",Paragraph
often directly related to the landscape and to the natural conditions of the building site.,Paragraph
"Lasting until 1969, their most creative period began in 1958, when Reima won the",Paragraph
competition for the Finnish Pavilion at the Brussel’s World’s Fair.,Caption
"After graduating in architecture from the Helsinki Institute of Technology, Reima",Paragraph
Pietila was first employed by the Master Planning Department of Helsinki City. In 1957,Paragraph
"he set up his own private practice, having won the 1956 competition for the Finnish",Paragraph
"Pavilion, a monument to the Finnish sawmill industry. The wooden modular",Paragraph

"Aalto’s office. The Kaleva church in Tampere, sited on an open hill, was their first",Paragraph
project together. The competition was won in 1959 and the building completed in 1966.,Paragraph
The floor plan is composed of U-shaped concrete curves that mark the outline of a,Paragraph
"Christian fish symbol. The section is very simple, with a flat roof: the plan was extruded",Paragraph
"to derive the interior space, a high volume with long, vertical window slits. The",Paragraph
sculptural monumentality of the interior with its mystical light choreography was,Paragraph
intended to recall organ music and was much indebted to the sculptural space concept of,Paragraph
Umberto Boccioni.,Paragraph
The Pietilds’ Dipoli student and conference center (1966) at Otaniemi is reminiscent of,Paragraph
Aalto’s habit of opposing a geometric form with an organic shape. The site where Dipoli,Paragraph
"was built was given character by its large, exposed, granite shield originating from the",Paragraph
glacial era. The roofline is a simulation of the microgeography of the site while also,Paragraph
being a reptilian metaphoric image. The idea was to work against any tradition and,Paragraph
preconceived styles but to let the building become part of the forest. More than any other,Paragraph
"project of the Pietilas, it is not architecture in the traditional sense but, rather, part of the",Paragraph
environment.,Paragraph
"The modular strategy appears again in the Suvikumpu Housing Project (1969), a mixed",Paragraph
"development of 162 apartment units sited on a steep, wooded hillside in Espoo that was",Paragraph
"planned in 1962 with some additions made in 1983. To avoid the monotony of massing,",Paragraph
"the apartments are connected along a line, following the form of the central hill. The",Paragraph
andscape is reflected in the varying vertical and horizontal masses of the building. The,Paragraph
facades are composed of white plaster and dark wooden surfaces that invoke the region’s,Paragraph
bright sunlight and respond to the changing patterns of light and textures of the,Paragraph
surrounding woods.,Paragraph
"After this project was realized, the Pietilas did not receive any important commissions",Paragraph
"in Finland, except for two minor projects, until 1975. This period certainly had a negative",Paragraph
"effect, as their later work did not achieve the strength of the earlier projects. Reima",Paragraph
"Pietila was nominated a professor of arts, and from 1973 to 1979 he taught at the",Paragraph
"University of Oulu, initiating the Oulu School—an architectural trend rich in form—and",Paragraph
applying regional and international features. In 1973 the Pietilas received the commission,Paragraph
for building the offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1982) at the Sief Palace in,Caption
"Kuwait, and in 1975 they won the competition for the Hervanta Congregational, Leisure,",Paragraph

"and the turn-of-thecentury mall in Tampere was most important. However, the architects",Paragraph
"make references to the ruins of the Forum Romanum, and the adjacent congregational",Paragraph
center of Hervanta suggests a forest fable. The Tampere Main library grew out of two,Paragraph
images: a male wood grouse and a mollusk shell. This representational approach seems to,Paragraph
follow the tradition of organic-shaped library buildings that Aalto had established.,Paragraph
"Indeed, the curved roof of the Metso recalls typical Aalto designs.",Paragraph

"assistants and presently housed in the National Archives of Australia, record one of the",Paragraph
most significant chapters in the history of modern urban planning.,Paragraph
The need for an Australian national capital arose when the six separate British colonial,Paragraph
states on the continent were federated in 1901 to provide a mechanism for dealing with,Paragraph
"one another and with the outside world. From the Australian perspective, this need for a",Paragraph
new capital city was not great; the competition for its creation was announced only a,Paragraph
decade later. The decision to locate the new Australian Capital Territory between,Paragraph
Melbourne in Victoria and Sydney in New South Wales—the capitals of the two most,Paragraph
populous states and notorious rivals—was more political than practical and produced the,Paragraph
only major inland Australian city.,Paragraph
"The competition for a capital city with an initial population of 25,000 was announced",Paragraph
on 30 April 1911 with a closing date of 31 January 1912. By that time (or at least by early,Paragraph
"March, when the actual judging began), the Department of Home Affairs had received",Paragraph

Walter Burley Griffin of Chicago was awarded first prize; second prize went to Eliel,Paragraph
"Saarinen of Helsinki, Finland; and third prize was given to Alf Agache of Paris.",Paragraph
"The selection of Griffin, a youthful 35 years of age, came as a complete surprise to",Paragraph
"nearly everyone. Raised in Chicago’s western suburbs, Griffin studied architecture at the",Paragraph

"Lloyd Wright as landscape designer, office manager, and site superintendent. Between",Paragraph
"1906 and 1914, Griffin practiced independently in Chicago before resettling in Australia",Paragraph
to supervise the construction of Canberra. His experience as federal capital director was,Paragraph
"fraught with difficulties, and he resigned in 1920. Although Canberra was officially",Paragraph
"dedicated in 1927 and has subsequently grown to a population of more than 300,000, it",Paragraph
bears only a general resemblance to Griffin’s original design.,Paragraph
"Griffin’s career encompassed the three separate disciplines of architecture, landscape",Paragraph
"architecture, and urban planning. Many of his most satisfying projects, like Canberra,",Paragraph
"combine all three. Because nothing remains of his reputed plan for enlarging Shanghai,",Paragraph
"China (ca. 1905-06), his earliest surviving urban scheme appears to be the small town of",Paragraph
"Idalia, Florida, designed around February to March 1911, only a few months before the",Paragraph
"official announcement of the Canberra competition. Griffin later recalled, however, that",Paragraph
he had known of the impending need for an Australian capital city for many years and,Paragraph
"was eager to contribute to its success. As he explained in 1913 to King O’Malley, head of",Paragraph
"the competition committee, “I...entered this Australian event to be my first and last",Paragraph
"competition, solely because I have for many years greatly admired the bold radical steps",Paragraph
in politics and economics which your country has dared to take...yours is the greatest,Paragraph
opportunity the world has afforded for the expression of the great civic ideal.” As James,Paragraph
"Weirick has explained, Canberra “was intended to express in its physical form, the true",Paragraph
"nature of the democratic experience” (Weirick, 1998).",Paragraph
The site was composed of a rolling valley surrounded by hills and bisected by the wide,Paragraph
streambed of the intermittent Molonglo River. Griffin created a design whose basic,Paragraph
format was determined by this landscape. The axis defined by the crown of the nearest,Paragraph
"high hill, Mount Ainslie north of the river (and just outside the city limits), to the most",Paragraph
"prominent point in town, Kurrajong to the south, became the generating line of the entire",Paragraph
plan. Griffin termed this the Land Axis. At the point where this line crossed the,Paragraph
"Molonglo, Griffin defined a perpendicular Water Axis, to be given expression by",Paragraph
"damming the river to create a series of lakes, the central three of which would be formal",Paragraph
and geometric and the outer two left irregular and “natural.”,Paragraph
"Griffin ordered the landscape by separating areas according to use: civic, cultural,",Paragraph
"political, economic, and residential. He divided the city into hexagonal, octagonal, and",Paragraph
"circular subcenters, connected by major boulevards that radiated from the subcenters. The",Paragraph
scheme was subtly configured to the changing topography while remaining part of a,Paragraph
clearly defined geometric diagram originating from Kurrajong.,Paragraph
Although the competition guidelines had called only for the general placement of some,Paragraph
"38 public buildings, most entries included perspective renderings that attempted to give a",Paragraph
corresponding architectural image to the proposed city. Although Mahony’s perspectives,Paragraph
"at first glance suggest that this was also the case with Griffin’s entry, in fact Griffin went",Paragraph
"beyond this, making complete designs for the group. By combining the footprints on the",Paragraph

PLAN OF CHICAGO,Title
"The Plan of Chicago, developed mainly by architect Daniel H. Burnham (1846-1912)",Paragraph
"and his assistant Edward H. Bennett (1874-1954), was the first master plan for an",Paragraph
American city and its region in the 20th century. Burnham developed ideas for the plan,Paragraph
"from 1894 on, though his consistent work on the project for Chicago’s Commercial Club",Paragraph
began in late 1906. The plan was published as a book in 1909 with renderings by Jules,Paragraph
"Gueérin (1866-1946), when its drawings were exhibited at The Art Institute of Chicago.",Paragraph
"Although the city’s form was discussed for decades after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871,",Paragraph
the plan was largely motivated by success of the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893,Paragraph
"in Chicago, for which Burnham had served as chief of construction and that had posited a",Paragraph
neoclassical model for urban design that integrated public buildings and parks. The Plan,Paragraph
"of Chicago also owed much to Burnham’s work as head of the MacMillan Commission,",Paragraph
"charged by the U.S. Congress with the planning of central Washington, DC, in 1901-02,",Paragraph
"and to his plans for Cleveland (1903), San Francisco (1905), and Manila (1905). The Plan",Paragraph
of Chicago was also based on Burnham’s systematic consultation with local experts and,Paragraph
"citizens, a process that helped to ensure its acceptance and partial implementation.",Paragraph
Burnham’s earlier urban plans featured a central focal group of neoclassical public,Paragraph
"buildings linked to each other and to the surrounding city with broad, tree-lined avenues.",Paragraph
"This idea was central to the Plan of Chicago, which featured large new railroad passenger",Paragraph
"terminals and a cultural and civic center on the city’s near West Side, dominated by a tall,",Paragraph
"domed city hall. Architecturally, the plan included recommendations for common cornice",Paragraph
"heights for buildings and generous street widths, aiming to create a visually unified",Paragraph
cityscape on the model of Second Empire Paris. Burnham requested plans of pre- and,Paragraph
"post-Haussmann Paris, along with information on over 20 American and 30 European",Paragraph
cities. As Burnham wrote: “the city has a dignity to be maintained; and good order is,Paragraph
"essential to material advancement. Consequently, the plan provides for impressive",Paragraph
groupings of public buildings and reciprocal relations among such groups.” Burnham saw,Paragraph
his city some 70 years after its founding in 1833 as,Paragraph
Plan of Chicago,Title
© Dennis Gale,Title
having reached a stage of development that called for permanent monumentality in civic,Paragraph
buildings and landscapes.,Paragraph
The Plan of Chicago was to both enable and present an image of ordered economic,Paragraph
growth. In this it went further than many essays in the City Beautiful Movement by,Paragraph
"proposing to consolidate Chicago’s extensive and varied rail traffic network, including",Paragraph
"tracks of common width, and a shared system for handling freight. Presented in the same",Paragraph
"year that the Model T Ford was introduced, the Plan of Chicago featured a regional",Paragraph
"highway system for automobiles, including both radial arteries and circumferential ring",Paragraph
roads within a 60-mile radius of the city’s center to connect it with its suburbs and to link,Paragraph
suburbs to each other. The future city was to be an efficient transportation network for the,Paragraph
"facilitation of commerce, with extensions of an ordered plan out into the surrounding",Paragraph
region. As Burnham wrote: “The plan frankly takes into consideration that fact that the,Paragraph
"American city, and Chicago pre-eminently, is a center of industry and traffic. Therefore",Paragraph
attention is given to the betterment of commercial facilities; to methods of transportation,Paragraph
for persons and for goods; to removing the obstacles which prevent or obstruct,Paragraph
"circulation; and to the increase of convenience.” Toward this end, the plan proposed",Paragraph
"routing different types of motor traffic on double-decker streets connected by ramps, with",Paragraph
pleasure vehicles above freight trucks. Water transport was to be improved by,Paragraph
straightening the Chicago River and by building windbreaks stretching a mile into Lake,Paragraph
Michigan to protect new harbor facilities.,Paragraph
The plan included an inland park system that vastly extended Chicago’s earlier parks,Paragraph
with connecting carriage boulevards designed by Horace Cleveland and Frederick Law,Paragraph
"Olmsted. Perhaps most important for the city’s future development, the plan proposed a",Paragraph
"comprehensive treatment of 23 miles of lakefront parks for public recreation, including",Paragraph
"lagoons for rowing, and numerous playgrounds, especially for the city’s poorer classes",Paragraph
"who had little access to green space inland. As Burnham wrote, “When a citizen is made",Paragraph
"to feel the beauty of nature, when he is lifted up by her to any degree above the usual life",Paragraph
"of his thoughts and feelings, the state of which he is a part is benefited thereby.” The",Paragraph
plan’s aim was to promote good citizenship at a time when 1.3 of Chicago’s 1.7 million,Paragraph
residents were foreign born and when the deplorable working and living conditions of the,Paragraph
city’s poor were as described in Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle (1906). The plan aimed to,Paragraph
create an ideal built environment that would educate citizens’ tastes and shape social,Paragraph
norms according to bourgeois models and in the service of capitalist interests. Burnham,Paragraph
"wrote: “It is realized, also, that good workmanship requires a large degree of comfort on",Paragraph
"the part of the workers in their homes and their surroundings, and ample opportunity for",Paragraph
that rest and recreation without which all work becomes drudgery.” Although aimed at,Paragraph
"improving the quality of life for all, the plan included no provisions for publicly funded",Paragraph
housing.,Paragraph
The Plan of Chicago directly influenced the subsequent development of the city from,Paragraph
the mayor’s appointment of an official planning commission in late 1909 through the,Paragraph
financial crash of 1929. Major improvements of these 20 years based on the plan,Paragraph
"included the widening and enhancement of Michigan Avenue north of the Chicago River,",Paragraph
the landfills and development of Grant Park on the central lakefront and lakefront parks,Title
"to the north and south, and the construction of Wacker Drive along the Chicago River.",Paragraph
"The Plan of Chicago had rapid influence beyond the city, first in inspiring the German",Paragraph
Kaiser to appoint a commission in 1912 to replan the capital of Berlin. The Plan of,Paragraph
Chicago was also a point of reference for developing the Regional Plan of New York,Paragraph

PLAN OF NEW DELHI,Title
At an imperial durbar in 1911 hosted outside the walled city of Shahjahanabad (later,Paragraph
"called Old Delhi), King George V announced plans to transfer the seat of the government",Paragraph
of India from Calcutta to a new imperial capital to be built in the vicinity of that very,Paragraph
spot. It was to become the “New” Delhi. The aim was to present the British Raj as the,Paragraph
legitimate successor of the Mughal Empire precisely at a time when British rule was,Paragraph
"being challenged by Indian nationalists. Near Shahjahan’s old capital, amid the ruins of a",Paragraph
score of erstwhile capital cities and far from the tumultuous nationalist politics of,Paragraph
"Calcutta, a new imperial British capital was hoped to capture the fiction of peaceful and",Paragraph
benevolent domination of an alien people. The historic importance of the site of Delhi,Paragraph
was to be revived after a century of neglect to serve as a necessary counterpoint to the,Paragraph
demonstration of British power.,Paragraph
"By early 1912, a Delhi Town Planning Committee was organized, comprising Edwin",Paragraph
"L.Lutyens, an architect then known mostly for his design of country houses; John",Paragraph
"A.Brodie, city engineer of Liverpool; and George S.C.Swinton, chairman-elect of the",Paragraph
"London County Council. Henry V.Lanchester, who had a well-established architectural",Caption
"practice in London, was appointed as an external consultant. Among them, only Swinton",Paragraph
had any previous firsthand knowledge of India. The committee’s responsibility was to,Paragraph
suggest a suitable site for the new capital and to formulate a general plan for the city.,Paragraph
"From the very beginning, two assumptions were made clear. First, the new capital would",Paragraph
"be used only as the government’s winter residence, with the customary annual migration",Paragraph
"to Shimla during the summer months. Second, the centerpiece of this plan would be the",Paragraph
"Government House (later called the Viceroy’s Palace, presently the Rashtrapati Bhavan),",Paragraph
"the residence of the head of the British administration, the viceroy. Designed as the center",Paragraph
"of government and not a commercial city, the imperial capital was to physically represent",Paragraph
"the administrative and power hierarchy of the British Raj, complete with its class and",Paragraph
racial stratification.,Paragraph
"At the initial stages, two different sites and two types of plans were proposed. One of",Paragraph
the sites was to the north of Shahjahanabad near the British Civil Lines and Durbar,Paragraph
Grounds; the other was to the south of the existing city between Raisina Hills and,Paragraph
"Green spaces around the Jami Masjid, New Delhi",Caption
© Aga Khan Trust for Culture,Title
the Jamuna River. The Town Planning Committee favored the spacious southern site as,Paragraph
more suitable for their exaggerated monumental vision of the city and the ease with,Paragraph
which one could make visual reference to the historic monuments that were located on,Paragraph
the southern and eastern limits. The principal feature of the committee’s early plan was a,Paragraph
ceremonial avenue with closely packed government buildings terminating at the,Paragraph
"Government House and opening up a vista to the Jami Masjid, the largest Mughal",Paragraph
mosque in the existing city; the rest of the new capital was conceived on a rectangular,Paragraph
"matrix of roads. The monotony of the plan raised questions, and Lanchester attempted to",Paragraph
improve on the committee’s scheme by suggesting replacing the rectangular pattern with,Paragraph
a series of radial streets. At the crossing of the ceremonial avenue and these radial,Paragraph
"arteries, he proposed a plaza around which to arrange the Secretariat buildings. When the",Paragraph
"committee was again asked to reconsider the northern site, their revised plan took some",Paragraph
hint from Lanchester’s layout. They proposed a more tightly knit ensemble o,Paragraph
government institutions headed by the monumental place of the Government House and,Paragraph
deviated from the rectangular pattern by making the peripheral roads adjust to the,Paragraph
topography.,Paragraph
"When officially “opened” in 1930, the city was planned for a maximum population o",Paragraph
"65,000, covering an area of 3200 acres. The final plan, which underwent many",Paragraph
"subsequent adjustments, was based on a revised treatment of the southern site that",Paragraph
"retained several ideas from the preceding plans. The Government House, or Viceroy’s",Paragraph
"Palace, was still the focal point. It was perched on Raisina Hills and connected by straight",Paragraph
"avenues to the Purana Qila on the west, to the railway station on the northwest, and to",Paragraph
Safdarjung’s tomb on the south. The scheme borrowed from the principles of Beaux-Arts,Paragraph
planning as well as from new notions of the garden city but ultimately conformed to the,Paragraph
hierarchical planning pattern of British cantonments in India. By the time the final plan,Paragraph
"was reached, Herbert Baker, an architect who had acquired a reputation for his work in",Paragraph
"South Africa, was brought into the team and the specific architectural treatment of the",Paragraph
monuments were being prepared. Lutyens was awarded the design of the Viceroy’s,Paragraph
Palace and Herbert Baker the Secretariat and Council House. It was the monumental,Paragraph
"classical architectural vocabulary, which Lutyens had rehearsed long before he was given",Paragraph
"the building commission, that gave specific meaning to the plan that ultimately",Paragraph
developed. The appliqué of Indian decorative elements on this imperial classicism at a,Paragraph
"later stage only enhanced the symbolic logic of the plan, which was meant to",Paragraph
unambiguously subordinate the “old” city and the Indian population to the new capital,Paragraph
and its British denizens.,Paragraph
"A long, processional 440-feet east-west parkway, named King’s Way (presently",Paragraph
Rajpath) and a cross-avenue named Queen’s Way (presently Janpath) formed the central,Paragraph
armature of a multinode hexagonal plan. Traveling along King’s Way from the Purana,Paragraph
"Qila, the visitor encountered a series of monuments along the Central Vista—a wide",Paragraph
expanse of green space accentuated by water channels. Anchored by the monumental,Paragraph
"canopy that once housed the statue of King George V and, on the west, the War",Caption
"Memorial, the parkway led to the “cultural” node, which was meant to house four",Paragraph
colonial institutions at the four corners of the crossing of King’s Way and Queen’s,Caption
"Way—the Imperial Museum, the Oriental Institute, the Lmperial Library, and the Imperia!",Paragraph
"Record Office (presently the National Archives, the only building constructed before",Paragraph
Indian independence). Then a dense arrangement of imperial symbols prepared the visitor,Paragraph
for the principal focus of the plan—the Secretariat Blocks on raised platforms on either,Paragraph
"side framing the centrally located Viceroy’s Palace, which dipped from view as one",Paragraph
"approached the Secretariat Plaza, only to emerge later in its full regalia once one reached",Paragraph
the top of the plaza. This vanishing vista was the result of a controversial miscalculation,Paragraph
"of the street gradient. The Viceregal Estate, the entry to which was guarded by a series of",Paragraph
"Britannia lions and anchored with the Jaipur column, covered approximately two-thirds",Paragraph
"of a square mile and housed, in addition to the main palace and integral council chamber,",Paragraph
the symmetrically arrayed staff quarters and the elaborate “Mughal” garden. The rotund,Paragraph
"Council House (included in the plan in 1919, presently the Parliament Building) played a",Paragraph
subsidiary role in the imperial administration and was located off the main axis to the,Paragraph
north of the Secretariat Blocks. Radial avenues from the Council House and War,Caption
"Memorial, as well as Queen’s Way, converged on Connaught Place—the principal",Paragraph
commercial node—before leading to the railway station. Residential space was allocated,Paragraph
"according to a strict sociospatial taxonomy based on site elevation, proximity to the",Paragraph
"Viceroy’s Palace, dwelling and plot size, and most important, segregation along",Paragraph
occupational and racial lines. The houses of the members of the Executive Council were,Paragraph
"located closest to the seat of power, whereas gazetted officers were allocated space to the",Paragraph
south of the Central Vista near the lavish and exclusive green recreational space of,Paragraph
"racecourse and parks. Indian princes were encouraged to purchase land to the east,",Paragraph
whereas European clerks were assigned space to the north. Indian and Anglo-Indian,Paragraph
clerks and “menial” staff were situated on the periphery of the new city in separate,Paragraph
enclaves. The separation between the new and the old city was physically completed with,Paragraph
a surrounding wall (demolished in 1950) and a 100-yard-wide and mile-and-a-half-long,Paragraph
green space around the old city.,Paragraph
"Obsessed with the demonstration of imperial power, the planners created an",Paragraph
"infrastructure of inequity that would pose both physical and ideological problems when,",Paragraph
"at midcentury, the city became the capital of a new democracy. Defined on the basis of",Paragraph
unequal access to resources and glaring population differentials between the old city and,Paragraph
"the new, it was neither amenable to public transportation nor anticipatory of a significant",Paragraph
"population increase and its attendant need for schools, shopping, and housing.",Paragraph

PLASTICS,Title
At no time in history has a material developed so rapidly and became interwoven in the,Paragraph
"fabric of our daily lives as have plastics. In fact, today’s styles of living would be",Paragraph
"unimaginable without their existence. Less than 200 years old, these materials have",Paragraph
become part of almost every facet of our daily lives. Plastics have played a variety of,Paragraph
"roles in the building and construction industry, but especially so in the 20th century.",Paragraph
"Although the invention of many forms of plastic has origins in the 19th century, their",Paragraph
practical application for consumer products and other industrial uses came about in the,Paragraph
"20th century. For example, a major milestone was achieved in the evolution of plastics",Paragraph
"when John Wesley Hyatt, an American, invented Celluloid in 1866 by adding camphor (a",Paragraph
derivative of the laurel tree) to nitrated cellulose. This was the first thermoplastic in the,Paragraph
sense that it could be molded under heat and pressure to form a shape and that it would,Paragraph
retain that shape after the heat and pressure were removed. In 1891 Louis Marie Hilaire,Paragraph
was trying to produce man-made silk in Paris when he modified nitrated cellulose to form,Paragraph
"rayon. In 1907 Leo Baekeland, a New York chemist, discovered the first completely",Paragraph
"synthetic man-made substance, which he called Bakelite. This liquid resin is considered",Paragraph
"the first thermoset plastic ever produced because once it hardened, it would never change.",Paragraph
"Later, in 1913, Dr. Jacques Edwin Brandenberger, a Swiss textile engineer, produced",Paragraph
"viscose (now known also as rayon), which led to his invention of cellophane, the first true",Paragraph
"waterproof wrapping material. After the use of cellophane spread worldwide, DuPont’s",Paragraph
"laboratories, under Wallace H.Carothers, developed Fiber 66, which was later named",Paragraph
"nylon. This fiber replaced animal hair in toothbrushes and silk stockings. In fact, nylon",Paragraph
"stockings enjoyed great public acceptance when unveiled in 1939, and reinforced nylon",Paragraph
"fabrics were being used in air-supported structures. At B.F.Goodrich, Waldo Semon, an",Paragraph
"organic chemist, developed an inexpensive, fire-resistant, and easily formable substance",Paragraph
"named polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or vinyl, which became the base material for thousands",Paragraph
"of household products, from garden hoses to records. Meanwhile, in Germany,",Paragraph
"H.Staudinger discovered the molecular structure of plastics, and Carothers, in turn,",Paragraph
"realized that by adding and replacing elements into the chainlike molecules of plastics,",Paragraph
one could produce many types of new compounds. This particular discovery gave the,Paragraph
plastics industry its prolific nature vis-a-vis the many useful polymers introduced since,Paragraph
"then, such as nylon, acrylics, neoprene, SBR (Styrene Butadiene Rubbers), saran,",Paragraph
"polyethylene, Velcro, Teflon, Spandex, Nomex, and Kevlar, all of which replaced, at one",Paragraph
"time or another, materials typically supplied by nature. The most widely utilized polymer,",Paragraph
"however, has been polyethylene, a thermoplastic first discovered in 1933 by Fawcett and",Paragraph
"Gibson. At present, polyethylene is the largest-volume plastic in the world, with such",Paragraph
"uses as milk jugs, soda bottles, grocery and dry-cleaning bags, food storage containers,",Paragraph
"packaging, and in the construction industry as a reliable source of water proofing.",Paragraph
"After World War IL, plastic products were everywhere. Inventors were continuously",Paragraph
"filing patents for new plastics, and the American public’s view of the image of such",Paragraph
"products became increasingly negative. In reality, polymers had two main disadvantages.",Paragraph
"First, they had relatively low stiffness, and as such they were rendered nonviable where",Paragraph
"structural integrity was required. Second, they degraded rapidly when exposed to heat",Paragraph
"and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Consequendy, plastic products were thought of as cheap,",Paragraph
"nonenduring, fake, and environmentally unfriendly. The U.S. military, however, noted",Paragraph
"the desirable characteristics of polymers. As such, it was military applications in the mid-",Paragraph
"1950s and 1960s that carried the torch for the plastics industry. In aerospace applications,",Paragraph
higher rigidity and lighter weight led to a landmark development in the evolution of,Paragraph
"plastics, and fiber-reinforced polymers were born. By combining the relative flexibility of",Paragraph
"some thermosetting plastics, such as epoxies, and the high rigidity of fibrous materials,",Paragraph
"such as graphite, aramid, and boron, new and far superior materials were created and",Paragraph
"dubbed advanced composites. The notion that embedding fibers, short or long, in a",Paragraph
binding medium to create a new and improved plastic manifested itself in different forms,Paragraph
and led to the creation of such materials as ceramic/metal composites and braided Kevlar.,Paragraph
These superior plastics were used in applications ranging from armored personnel suits,Paragraph
and gear to intercontinental ballistic missiles and the space shuttle.,Paragraph
Plastics and the Construction Industry,Title
All the desirable qualities of 1950s plastics did not escape the watchful eyes of the,Paragraph
"construction industry, which has always been on the lookout for more competitive",Paragraph
building materials to replace existing ones. Plastics appeared as vinyl siding and as foam,Paragraph
"insulation in homes and buildings, making them much more energy efficient and",Paragraph
comfortable for their occupants. Plastics were also used in underground storage tanks and,Paragraph
in pipe systems. There were even a few adventurous attempts by individuals and,Paragraph
companies to construct all-plastic houses intended as showcases only and not for mass,Paragraph
production. A primary early example was the Monsanto House of the Future (1957-68) at,Paragraph
"Disneyland in Anaheim, California. This structure was envisioned at the Massachusetts",Paragraph
Institute of Technology and assembled for Disneyland in 1957 using structural fiberglass-,Paragraph
reinforced polyester elements. Other attempts during the 1950s to build houses out of,Paragraph
"plastics were made, but they never quite presented the construction industry with any",Paragraph
serious alternatives. The only notable effort to mass-produce affordable plastic housing,Paragraph
was made by lIonel Schein when he presented his Maison Plastique (Plastic House) in a,Paragraph
housing exhibition in 1956. The Bucharest-born designer used 15 different plastics and,Paragraph
"three colors—yellow, red, or blue—in all 70 prototypes he produced. In 1974 the higher",Paragraph
"prices of raw materials, resulting from the oil embargo and more competitive concrete",Paragraph
"and steel industries, put an end to Schein’s production of plastic houses.",Paragraph
In the late 1970s and in response to the stabilization of oil prices as well as emerging,Paragraph
"environmental concerns for conserving natural resources, most manufacturing industries",Paragraph
made serious and successful attempts at incorporating plastics into their design and,Paragraph
"materials selection processes. Once again, plastics were gaining an excellent reputation",Paragraph
for superior and cost-effective performance in applications where their beneficial,Paragraph
characteristics can be best employed. The construction industry was not immune to this,Paragraph
"movement. Plastics were recyclable, and as such they reduced construction waste; their",Paragraph
"use in construction is environmentally responsible, conserves natural resources, and is",Paragraph
"consistent with the concept of sustainability; in addition, their ease of fabrication,",Paragraph
"transportation, and erection resulted in a relatively lower life-cycle cost. As a result, they",Paragraph
"started appearing in many applications, such as glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) moldings",Paragraph
"to replace cast-iron work, as cladding and roofing materials in multistory buildings, as",Paragraph
"corrugated translucent sheeting (e.g. indoor swimming pools), as replacement of metals",Paragraph
"for electrical insulation purposes (e.g. ladders, man lifts, light and telephone poles,",Paragraph
"special hospital structures, CB radio antennas, radar and military facilities, airport control",Title
"towers, transmission and electrical power towers, and power plant structures), as",Paragraph
structural and nonstructural elements in water/wastewater treatment and desalination,Paragraph
"plants, as agricultural and irrigation equipment and structures (e.g. manure filters, weirs,",Paragraph
"barn structures, and watergate guides), as cooling towers (e.g. housing units), as",Paragraph
"industrial chimneys, and as waterfront and offshore structures (e.g. oil rigs and marine",Paragraph
risers).,Paragraph
"Architecturally, plastics presented the designer with the advantage of controlling the",Paragraph
"texture, color, and the shape of any designed element. This inherent quality of",Paragraph
"manufacturing plastics allowed for greater design flexibility in such issues as shading,",Paragraph
"form flow, and patterns repetition, all the while maintaining lower costs and faster",Paragraph
erection time than other conventional materials. Examples of such cases include but are,Paragraph
"not limited to cladding panels for the Olivetti Training Centre (1972) in Haslemere,",Paragraph
"Surrey, England; 50-meter-diameter roofing domes at the Sharjah International Airport",Caption
(1977) in the United Arab Emirates; and the access ramps to Terminal 2 (1978) at,Paragraph
Heathrow Airport in London. A more widespread use of FRPs (Fiber-Reinforeed,Paragraph
"Plastics) in construction was hindered for three main reasons. First, there was still a",Paragraph
"prevalent lack of knowledge in the general design philosophy, behavior, and limitations",Paragraph
"of such materials, including their relative low stiffness and heat- and UV-light-resistive",Paragraph
"capabilities. Second, there existed other competitive, long-established, and more familiar",Paragraph
"construction methods and materials. Third, building and design codes dealing with the",Paragraph
design specifications and testing methods of plastics did not exist at the time. All these,Paragraph
reasons made it difficult for designers and builders to shift into unknown and untested,Paragraph
"building materials. As such, during the 1970s and early 1980s, the usage of FRPs",Paragraph
remained limited to specific applications in which they were the only choice for the,Paragraph
conditions under which a specific structure existed.,Paragraph
"Since the mid-1980s, the world has witnessed an unprecedented reliance on and use of",Paragraph
plastics in construction. The integration of plastics into the building industry proliferated,Paragraph
so rap-idly that in 1998 more than 20 percent of all plastic resin sales in North America,Paragraph
"were used for fixed construction. In fact, about two-thirds of all thermosetting polymers",Paragraph
(mainly polyesters and vinylesters) produced today are consumed by the building and,Paragraph
construction industry. There were six main reasons for that remarkable growth:,Paragraph

one area remained where the glass quality was insufficient: the making of mirrors.,Paragraph
"Mirrors, more than regular glass panes, required a much higher surface quality, free of",Paragraph

"summer vacations in Manchester, where two uncles were artists. While still in his teens,",Paragraph
"he became an early member of the Etching Revival, learning to etch from the",Paragraph
Philadelphia artist Stephen Parrish. Platt trained briefly in painting at the National,Paragraph
Academy of Design and the Art Students League before going to Paris in 1882 for further,Paragraph
"study at the Académie Julian. While in Paris, he met architecture students at the Ecole",Paragraph
des Beaux-Arts and discussed with them his emerging interest in this art. In 1886 he,Paragraph
"matried a New Yorker, Annie C.Hoe, while in Europe; she died the following year,",Paragraph
"losing twin daughters in childbirth. While slowly recovering from this tragedy, Platt",Paragraph

Charles Platt used the sketches and photographs they made of approximately 25 gardens,Paragraph
from throughout the Italian peninsula to illustrate two articles for Harper’s magazine in,Paragraph
"1893. He expanded these articles into a book, ftalian Gardens, published in 1894. This",Paragraph
modest volume was one of the first illustrated publications in English depicting the,Paragraph
"gardens of Renaissance Italy, and it heavily influenced the emergence of a formal garden",Paragraph
style in America.,Paragraph
"Platt turned from this book to a career as a designer of gardens and then as an architect,",Paragraph
both without any academic training or apprenticeship. He had begun to experiment with,Paragraph
architecture in his own summerhouse and garden at Cornish in 1890. He expanded and,Paragraph
"refined the gardens for his house, following the lessons learned from his travels in Italy.",Paragraph

PLAZA,Title
The term plaza is a Spanish word for an open space in the city. It is cognate with the,Paragraph
"French and English place, which are ultimately derived from the Greek word plateia,",Paragraph
meaning “broad street.” The Italian-word equivalent is piazza. The contemporary,Paragraph
"American term is square, although the terms park and green are also utilized. In all cases,",Paragraph
the terms mean an urban space (which might be paved or landscaped) surrounded by,Paragraph
streets and defined by buildings on one or more sides. They vary highly in both size and,Paragraph
geometric configuration. A plaza is inextricably related to the architectural frame that,Paragraph
"defines it, as it is the functions in these buildings and their density that directly influence",Paragraph
its use and design.,Paragraph
Plazas are the public open spaces in a city whose primary purpose is to provide a,Paragraph
gathering place for the people to foster the creation of community. They are sometimes,Paragraph
"called urban living rooms, places of formal and informal socialization. They are also",Paragraph
"places of spatial focus providing orientation, repose, and historical continuity.",Paragraph
"Plazas can also accommodate specific activities, such as markets, performances,",Paragraph
"celebrations, protests, and recreation. The traditional use of public spaces for political",Paragraph
activity waned in the 20th century in democratic countries but remains alive in socialist,Paragraph
"countries, as evidenced by the recent incidents at Wenceslas Square in Prague and",Paragraph
Tiananmen Square in Beijing. The use for markets also waned during this century in the,Paragraph
industrialized cities of the world. The other uses remain current.,Paragraph
"Virtually all Western historical cities, planned and unplanned, were formed around one",Paragraph
or more urban plazas. The vast majority of these cities throughout the world were,Paragraph
"founded before the 20th century. Thus, the primary design activity of this century has",Paragraph
been preservation with only modest changes. Many cities have renovated their primary,Paragraph
"plazas. This is most evident in Savannah, Georgia, with its integrated pattern of historical",Paragraph
squares.,Paragraph
"In cities where there has been dramatic change in density and transportation, the plazas",Paragraph
"have changed in design. This occurred in the 20th century primarily in the United States,",Paragraph
"Canada, and Australia. The most common response has been to build a parking garage",Paragraph
beneath the plaza and concomitantly redesign it. This occurred first at Union Square in,Paragraph
San Francisco in 1942.,Paragraph
Existing plazas in some cities needed to be redesigned in the 20th century to correct,Paragraph
design deficiencies. Bryant Park behind the New York Public Library at Fifth Avenue,Caption
and 42nd Street had become the turf of drug dealers because of its physical and visual,Paragraph
separation from the surrounding streets. Landscape architects Hanna/Olin produced a,Paragraph
highly acclaimed scheme that took out the perimeter hedge and widened the entry points.,Paragraph
They also provided abundant seating and luxuriant plantings.,Paragraph
"In other cities, the plaza had to be redesigned because of a changed context. This is the",Paragraph
"case with Boston’s Copley Square, which has been the subject of periodic design",Paragraph
"competitions since 1893. The 1966 design treated the square as a terraced Italian piazza,",Paragraph
windswept and inhospitable and lacking pedestrian amenities. The battle to preserve its,Paragraph
scale was essentially lost with the construction of the 60-story John Hancock Building on,Paragraph
a comer of the square. It overwhelms the two masterpieces of historical architecture on,Paragraph
the square: Trinity Church and the Boston Public Library. Another design competition in,Paragraph
"1984 resulted in a scheme based on a village green. Now, increased pedestrian traffic",Paragraph
from surrounding development threatens the survival of the soft landscape in this small,Paragraph
but precious public place.,Paragraph
"In Barcelona, Spain, more than 150 open spaces have been rebuilt in an effort to",Paragraph
revitalize the city after the neglect during the Spanish civil war. These range from,Paragraph
"neighborhood parks to urban plazas, many featuring large sculptural works. All are",Paragraph
designed as multiuse gathering spaces. Their designs are a dialectic between formal and,Paragraph
informal geometries taking advantage of circumstantial opportunities. The Mediterranean,Paragraph
tradition of paved places has been continued with judicious use of trees and planting. For,Paragraph
"the 1992 Olympics, the port was reconstructed as an urban plaza defined by shops and",Paragraph
restaurants featuring twin high-rise towers.,Paragraph
In Italy there is a great urban tradition of the piazza as the social and spatial focus of a,Paragraph
town. Some of these have been artistically redesigned to foster new vitality. Redesigned,Paragraph
"piazzas in Cormans, Vilanova, Pirano, and Santa Severina are abstract minimalist",Paragraph
compositions of paving geometry and urban elements that create new perceptions of these,Paragraph
places as they relate to the historic buildings that define them.,Paragraph

best social spaces in New York City.,Paragraph
Corporations have often built plazas in conjunction with new urban headquarters. One,Paragraph
of the first of this type was the Seagram Building (1958) on Park Avenue in Manhattan,Paragraph
"designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. This flat, elevated, granite-paved plaza was",Paragraph
intended to showcase the modern office tower that was set back from the street. The only,Paragraph
"features are two shallow pools of water, surrounded by ledges that separate the plaza",Paragraph

workshop.,Paragraph
"The following year, with assistance from the architect Leopold Theyer, who procured",Paragraph
"him employment with the firm K.K.Hof-Bau und Kunsttischelerei J.W.Miller, Pleénik",Paragraph
finally moved to Vienna. His arrival in the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire was,Paragraph
timely as it coincided with the transformation of the imperial city into one of the centers,Paragraph
of world architecture. The architectural and urban efforts of Otto Wagner and several of,Paragraph
his followers were decisive contributions to the transformation of this city’s infrastructure,Paragraph
"and physiognomy. In 1894 Ple¢énik met Wagner, who accepted him as a student at the",Paragraph
Academy of Fine Arts. This was a definitive period in the formation of the future,Paragraph
"architect, who became a devoted adherent of Wagner’s ideals. Wagner gave primacy to",Paragraph
technique over form and to innovation over tradition and emphasized a positive,Paragraph
"Rationalist position, thus anticipating many of the critical themes developed later as part",Paragraph
of the Modern movement.,Paragraph
In 1898 Ple¢nik graduated third in his class after Josef Hoffman and Jan Kotera. His,Paragraph
"efforts earned him a bursary that allowed him, from 1898 to 1899, to travel to Italy with",Paragraph
short incursions into France and Spain. Although the death of his mother prompted the,Paragraph
"young architect to put an abrupt end to this Grand Tour, the rich extant correspondence",Paragraph

architecture and art.,Paragraph

founded in 1897 by architects Joseph Hoffman and Joseph Maria Olbrich and painter,Paragraph
"Gustav Klimt. Pleénik worked on projects for the Secession, which included designs for",Paragraph

The second period of Pleénik’s professional career began in Prague in 1911. With the,Paragraph
"help of his friend Jan Kotera, he was appointed to a teaching position at the Prague",Paragraph
"School of Applied Arts. Ple¢nik’s stay in the Czech city, which included many visits to",Paragraph
"Vienna until the outbreak of World War I, permitted him to distance himself from the",Paragraph

"Slavic art, a theme that would shape his later work.",Paragraph
The search for Wagner’s replacement as a director of the Academy of Fine Arts in,Paragraph
Vienna during the early 1910s gave Pletnik the hope for a return to the city that he,Paragraph
"considered his home. Although Pleénik was the faculty’s choice for the post, the students",Paragraph
"protested the appointment, and after two years the position was given to Léopold Bauer",Paragraph
"instead. Disillusioned by this turn of events, Ple¢nik discarded any plans to return to",Paragraph
Vienna.,Paragraph
The second decade of the century saw Ple¢nik actively involved in teaching in Prague.,Paragraph
This phase was distinguished by a lack of built production that was nonetheless,Paragraph
counteracted by a return to a preoccupation with craft—particularly metalworking—,Paragraph
"through his teaching activities. During this period, the architect often traveled to",Paragraph
"Slovenia, beginning a process of reacquaintance with his family and native land that",Paragraph
greatly contributed to his desire to return to Ljubljana.,Paragraph
"In the early 1920s, Pleénik concluded his academic activities at the Prague School of",Paragraph

"Polytechnic School of Ljubljana. However, before his departure for Slovenia, he received",Paragraph

Masaryk intended to transform Prague’s highly visible historical royal compound into the,Paragraph

"thereafter by the National Socialists. In 1936 he accepted a professorship in Ankara,",Paragraph

"was a member of the “Novembergruppe” and the Workers’ and Soldiers’ Council for Art,",Paragraph
"the presiding officer of the German Werkbund (1919-21), and a member of the",Paragraph
"governing council of the League of German Architects (Bund Deutscher Architekten,",Paragraph
1926-33).,Paragraph
"Poelzig was passionate about the arts generally, and he also created large-format",Paragraph
"paintings. His contemporaries considered him to be an unpredictable, temperamental",Paragraph
"creative force. In addition to being an innovative architect, Poelzig was an influential",Paragraph
teacher whose concepts and ideas reached a large audience. Especially during his tenure,Paragraph
"in Breslau, he promoted a program of cooperative effort between handicrafts and art, and",Paragraph
"thus—years before the Bauhaus program was formulated—he represented a similar,",Paragraph
pathbreaking position.,Paragraph
"Unlike many of his contemporaries, Poelzig was less rooted in Jugendstil and more",Paragraph
"inspired by new concepts of living and house design, such as those formulated by Alfred",Paragraph
Lichtwark and Hermann Muthesius. He was also significantly influenced by rationalist,Paragraph
ideas about style based on an honest use of building materials. Fundamental traits such as,Paragraph
"these are apparent even in early works, such as his own house near Breslau/Wroclaw",Paragraph
"(1906), the Zwirners house in L6wenberg/Lwowek Slaski (1909-10), and the house for",Paragraph
"the Breslau Art and Crafts Exhibition (1904). Ever more pronounced, Poelzig had a",Paragraph
"strong interest in deriving plastic architectonic forms from the chosen building materials,",Paragraph
a practice that he had given theoretical form in his 1899 study Materialstillehre (Lessons,Paragraph
"in Materialist Style). Alongside his designs for country houses, his industrial designs bear",Paragraph
this trademark. The first such work of importance was the water tower,Paragraph
"(Oberschlesienturm) in Posen/Poznan (1911, partially destroyed) with its crystalline",Paragraph
"features, which was built as an exhibition pavilion in conjunction with a mining exhibit.",Paragraph
The exterior featured an exposed iron skeleton open to the elements into which he placed,Paragraph
brick niches that were clearly meant only to fill in the gaps in the exposed frame.,Paragraph
Poelzig also used building materials symbolically. Rather than rely on ornament,Paragraph
"borrowed from historicist or Jugendstil models, he allowed the special character of the",Paragraph
building materials to determine the decorative shape of a building’s interior and exterior.,Paragraph
"In this way, he composed visual confrontations based on the innate qualities of the",Paragraph
"materials. In his design for the Werdermihle in Breslau (1906-08), facade portions in",Paragraph
"glass contrast with massive brick walls. Similarly, in an office building (1912) on",Paragraph
"Breslau’s Junkernstrasse, he juxtaposed steel-framed concrete construction reminiscent of",Paragraph
half timbering with horizontal bands of windows running unbroken around the rounded,Caption
"corners of the building. In this way, even before World War I, he created a design motif",Paragraph
that was frequently used by the rationalistic architecture of the 1920s and 1930s and that,Paragraph
"for him was suggested by the plastic potential of glass, steel, and brick.",Paragraph
Poelzig successfully combined diverse elements into harmonious architectural designs.,Paragraph
"In many projects, he wanted to decrease the monotony of large industrial complexes and",Paragraph
"administrative buildings. Into such designs, he incorporated a variety of architectural",Paragraph
forms to artistically balance large-scale architectural masses and expressive construction.,Paragraph
"A good example of his use of these principles is found in the avant-garde, pseudo-",Paragraph
"objectivist buildings for a chemical factory (1911-12) in Luban. There, Cubist forms",Paragraph
blended into each other. Round-arched windows set flush with the masonry contrast,Paragraph
"sharply with rectangular windows. To show off the design’s engineering, rectangular",Paragraph
windows were specifically chosen for the parts where load-bearing steel beams visible in,Paragraph
"the facade made such windows possible. Occasionally, he punctuated such rationalist,",Paragraph
"material-derived effects with purely decorative elements; for example, Gothicinspired",Paragraph
stepped gables.,Paragraph
"Poelzig’s work after World War | was rooted in the Expressionist movement,",Paragraph
particularly his practice of overplastering plastic architectonic elements to heighten their,Paragraph
"effect. He began a series of crystalline structures, including his design for the House of",Paragraph
"Friendship (1916) in Istanbul, the plans for a Town Hall (1917) in Dresden, and the",Paragraph
Festival Hall (1920) in Salzburg. These projects show how he moved toward an ever,Paragraph
more individualistic treatment of design elements and materials. He combined new,Paragraph
architectural concepts with an extremely personal interpretation of formal traditions.,Paragraph
These developments culminated and were most demonstratively realized in his best-,Paragraph
"known building, the Grosses Schauspielhaus (1918-19), a transformation of the",Paragraph
Schumann Circus in Berlin undertaken for Max Reinhardt as an experimental theater. In,Paragraph
"the theater’s vaulted auditorium, he created a famous cavelike effect by covering the",Paragraph
domed ceiling with a sheath of stalactite forms. The room’s organic appearance was in,Paragraph
part the result of his use of a post-and-lintel system. Poelzig’s use of light as an aesthetic,Paragraph
"element in giving form to the space was innovative, creating a total spatial effect based",Paragraph
"on an elaborate conception of color—his “light architecture,” or Lichtarchitektur. The",Paragraph
"theater’s exterior was flat, with little surface decoration, although decidedly monumental",Paragraph
in appearance. Together with the simply delineated and sparsely decorated structure of,Paragraph
"the 1.G.Farben administrative building (1930) in Frankfurt am Main, the exterior of the",Paragraph
Grosses Schauspielhaus pointed the way to the International Style of the 1930s.,Paragraph
"The Radio House in Berlin (Haus des Rundfunks, 1929-30) likewise stands in this path",Paragraph
of development. It was the first German broadcasting building to be built. Based on a,Paragraph
"triangular floor plan, Poelzig articulated a brick-masonry facade with colored ceramic",Paragraph
"plates, creating a fenestration of high plasticity that, in pillar fashion, emphasizes the",Paragraph

"nearly 40 years. Perceiving the city as fundamentally an economic and social entity,",Paragraph
Portman resolved to return the historic agora to modern Atlanta.,Paragraph
"It was there, at the Hyatt Regency (1967), that Portman introduced the modern atrium",Paragraph

gave further expression to the life of the space through the dynamic vertical movement of,Paragraph

rotating rooftop restaurant called Polaris.,Paragraph
Portman enlarged the Hyatt in subsequent years and added two more hotels to,Paragraph
Peachtree Center: the Westin Peachtree Plaza (1976) and the Marriott Marquis (1985).,Paragraph
The latter was a theatrical demonstration of architectural space-making that broadened,Paragraph

"settings, poolside terraces, courtyards, lawns, and traditional rooms in which to display",Paragraph
"sculpture and paintings that its architect-owner admired, including reduced-scale",Paragraph
maquettes of sculptural forms that adorn major public spaces in Portman’s urban projects.,Paragraph
"At the same time, the studio-retreat was a workplace for Portman’s own production of art.",Paragraph
"Since the mid-1980s, Portman has expanded his artistic range by creating art in other",Paragraph

"POST OFFICE SAVINGS BANK, VIENNA",Caption
Designed by Otto Wagner; completed 1904,Caption
"Designed by Viennese architect Otto Wagner, the Post Office Savings Bank was",Paragraph
"completed in 1904. A member of the Viennese Secession, Wagner was educated at the",Paragraph
"Weiner Technische Hochschule, or Polytechnique (a program modeled on the Paris",Paragraph
"L’Ecole Polytechnique), and the prestigious Bauakademie in Berlin, where he was",Paragraph
influenced by members of the Schinkelschule.,Paragraph
Wagner’s approach to architecture at the turn of the century was essentially an,Paragraph
amalgamation of the rationalism of the Schinkelschuler (members of the so-called,Paragraph
"Schinkel School, so named after the 19th-century German architect Karl Friedrich",Paragraph
Schinkel) and the 19th-century “architects of the Ringstrasse” (Gottfried Semper and,Paragraph
Karl von Hasenauer). Yet Wagner’s polytechnical education also made him aware of the,Paragraph
significance of technology and impending social change for architecture. Like his,Paragraph
"predecessor Gottfried Semper, his awareness led him to formulate an antiacademic",Paragraph
position—one against the stodgy rule-based and tradition-bound education of the Vienna,Paragraph
"Academy of Fine Arts. Supported by Wagner, architects Josef Maria Olbrich (Wagner’s",Paragraph
chief assistant) and Josef Hoffman (his most prized student) joined with two prominent,Paragraph
"Viennese artists, Gustav Klimt and Koloman Moser, to form the Viennese Secession in",Paragraph
"1897. Under the skilled leadership of Klimt, the Secession group developed a new vision",Paragraph
"for architecture, inscribing Ver Sacrum, a publication devoted to the aims and ideas of the",Paragraph
"Secessionists, with works and ideas expressive of their revolutionary approach to the arts",Paragraph
and architecture. The Secessionist claims and actions were indeed revolutionary. Wagner,Paragraph
"stood as an elder statesman of the group, supporting not only the program of the Viennese",Paragraph
Secession but also its leaders and adherents through his pedagogy and his works of,Paragraph
architecture.,Paragraph
A principal example of Wagner’s embrace of Secessionist ideas for architecture is his,Paragraph
"design for the Imperial and Royal Vienna Post Office Savings Bank, known as the",Caption
"Postsparkasse. The building, completed in two phases (1904-06 and 1910-12), is",Paragraph
regarded as one of the primary examples of early modern architecture. Although,Paragraph
"Wagner’s Secessionist colleagues—Klimt, Moser, and to some degree Olbrich and",Paragraph
"Hoffman—were caught up in esoteric and utopian visions, Wagner remained attentive to",Paragraph
contemporary technical and social developments and their effect on architecture in a,Title
similar manner to those architects who understood the nature of building in their own,Paragraph
context as well as the context of the history of architecture. In an essay titled “Die,Paragraph
"Qualitat des Baukiinstlers” (The Quality of the Building-Artist) in 1912, Wagner argued",Paragraph
that “the ultimate goal of the architecture of his day was to add a building from our own,Paragraph
"time to the symphony of monumental buildings of all times” (Mallgrave, 1996). Yet he",Paragraph
did not discount the symbolist aspects of the Secessionist movements; elaborate and,Paragraph
diverse material and structural details adorn the building’s exterior and interior.,Paragraph
"The essential form of the building is trapezoidal, with the main hall—the public area of",Paragraph
the building—axially placed in almost equal measure between the two major wings,Paragraph
extending perpendicularly from the building’s main facade. Programmed as large work,Caption
"spaces that could be partitioned as necessary, the bank administration, postal offices, and",Paragraph
mailrooms are located in these wings.,Paragraph
"The exterior of the building is sheathed in thin sheets of Sterzing marble, the details of",Paragraph
which Wagner obsessively manipulated to produce an undulating plane along the,Paragraph
"projected face of the long, horizontal main facade. The building’s foundation is faced",Paragraph
"with granite, and the bolts holding the granite slabs are countersunk, giving them even",Paragraph
greater prominence on the facade. Wagner also used aluminum—a material that only,Paragraph
since the mid-19th century could be mined in great quantities—to refine certain details on,Paragraph
the facade. The acroteria—an ornamental aluminum “structure” and details by the,Caption
Viennese artist Othmar Schimkowitz—crowns the building. The liberal and pointed use,Paragraph
"of aluminum signals both Wagner’s embrace of advanced technologies and materials and,",Paragraph
"in his accentuated use of materials and ornamental detailing, his adoption of Secessionist",Paragraph
ideas.,Paragraph
Wagner continues his essay on the use of technology and materials throughout the,Paragraph
"entrance sequence and interior of the main public hall. The main facade, fronting a fairly",Caption
"natrow street, opens out to the Ringstrasse across a public square that focuses the main",Paragraph
entry and extends slightly into the urban space. Immediately on crossing the building,Paragraph
"threshold, the space of the city is compressed into a stair hall of elaborate plasticity.",Paragraph
"Flowing forms and animated light stancheons reduce the scale of the space even further,",Paragraph
lending it an aura of mystery. The stair—reminiscent of Michelangelo’s stair leading into,Paragraph
"the Laurentian Library or perhaps, more directly, similar to Schinkel’s elaborate",Paragraph
orchestration of public and private space in the entry of the Altes Museum—leads,Paragraph
through a cross axis of discrete secondary circulation just beyond the view of the public.,Paragraph
The entire procession—from the Ringstrasse through the square into the projected face of,Paragraph
the main entry—attenuates both time and the usual sense of separation accorded,Paragraph
"thresholds; in this case, the movement from the scale of the city into a series of zones or",Paragraph
chambers suggests a new kind of threshold where one side (the public) borrows and,Paragraph
"extracts from the other (the private) and vice versa. Accordingly, the spaces produce a",Paragraph
"quizzical, even aporetic form of experience, a kind of “intimate urbanism”—a scenario",Paragraph
that,Paragraph

Wagner’s architecture was motivated by social and cultural aims; he understood that,Paragraph

"for modern architects: the need to embrace modern technologies, materials, and",Title
constructional methods. The marriage of both in the Vienna Postal Savings Bank—social,Paragraph
and cultural responsibility and technological—marks an important step for the nascent,Paragraph

POSTMODERNISM,Title
Postmodernism became an intellectual buzzword within architectural circles in the 1980s,Paragraph
"and 1990s. Traced to literary theory, where Postmodernism was used to refer to new",Paragraph
"modes of fiction characterized by self-reflexivity, linguistic play, and the use of",Paragraph
"referential frames within frames (the “Russian doll” effect), the term rapidly entered",Paragraph
"other fields, such as the visual arts and architecture, to end up as a common denominator",Paragraph
to describe the cultural climate of the last decades of the 20th century. The precise,Paragraph
"content of the term has always been elusive—the more it was in vogue, it seemed, the",Paragraph
"less precise its meaning. In architecture, however, Postmodernism has been understood to",Paragraph
refer to a formal language that could clearly be distinguished from its modernist,Paragraph
"predecessor because of its free use of historical, vernacular, or populist references. A",Paragraph
"closer look, however, reveals that also in architecture, the confusing connotations and",Paragraph
paradoxical overtones of the term “Postmodernism” often gain the upper hand.,Paragraph
Important Publications and Exhibitions,Title
"Charles Jencks, in his widely influential The Language of Postmodern Architecture",Paragraph
"(1977), argued that modern architecture had run its course. He even provided a precise",Paragraph
"“death” of modernity: in St. Louis, Missouri, on 15 July 1972, at 3:32 p.m., when several",Paragraph
"of the 14-story slab blocks that together formed Pruitt Igoe, a prize-winning social",Paragraph
"housing scheme designed by Minoru Yamasaki and built only 20 years before, were",Paragraph
"demolished—the final proof, thought Jencks, that modern architecture could not live up",Paragraph
to its promises and failed to provide its users with a liveable environment. Lacking in,Paragraph
"modern architecture, Jencks stated, was communication: modern architecture did not",Paragraph
conceive of buildings as conveyors of meaning and did not treat architecture as a,Paragraph
"language. Modern architecture’s ideals of purity, transparency, and functional efficiency",Paragraph
(elements of the established International Style) failed to relate to a general public. A,Paragraph
Postmodernism characterized by meaningful architecture that was sensitive to its urban,Paragraph
context would provide the substitute. For Jencks the most important feature of this new,Paragraph
architecture was its “double coding”: Postmodernist buildings communicate on two levels,Paragraph
"at once—they convey a specific meaning to a minority public of experts (other architects,",Paragraph
"art historians, and the like), who recognize formal references to historical styles,",Paragraph
"innovations, or ironic gestures, while at the same time they communicate with a larger",Paragraph
public by invoking images that satisfy feelings of nostalgia and continuity. Whereas,Paragraph
"modernism rejected all popular references as kitsch, Postmodern architecture would",Paragraph
rather embrace the input of mass culture.,Paragraph
The criticism of modern architecture formulated by Jencks was not completely new. In,Paragraph
"the 1960s, there had been a growing literature that critiqued modern architecture and",Paragraph
"urbanism for their abstract and anonymous character, their paternalistic attitudes, and",Paragraph
their negation of history. In 1961 Jane Jacobs published her widely influential book The,Paragraph
"Death and Life of Great American Cities, in which she attacked modern urbanism for",Paragraph
failing to design liveable and safe environments. She argued that modern architecture’s,Paragraph
"hatred of the street was especially noxious, for it led to the creation of monotonous,",Paragraph
"monofunctional, utterly boring, and even unsafe dwelling environments in which social",Paragraph
interaction was hampered rather than stimulated. Robert Venturi complained in his 1966,Paragraph
Complexity and Contradiction that modernist ideals such as purity or directness led to a,Paragraph
"kind of order that was rigid and stereotypical, whereas the complexity and contradictions",Paragraph
"of ambivalent formal languages, such as mannerism, were much more capable of evoking",Paragraph
a continuing interest. Instead of the puritanically moral language of orthodox modem,Paragraph
"architecture, he preferred “hybrid” rather than pure elements, compromising rather than",Paragraph
"clean, distorted rather than straightforward, and ambiguous rather than articulated.",Paragraph
"Aldo Rossi, in L’architettura della citta (1966; The Architecture of the City, 1982),",Caption
claimed that the modernist precept “form follows function” was naive. Study of the,Paragraph
history of the city reveals a persistence of historical forms rather than constant,Paragraph
"innovation: urban forms tend to endure, even if their functions wither; this persistence",Paragraph
gives rise to the emergence of new functions. For Rossi the city (and context) is a crucial,Paragraph
"phenomenon at the heart of architecture. A contemporary architecture, therefore, has to",Paragraph
base itself on the morphotypological study of the city (morphology referring to the,Paragraph
"historical development of the form of the city, typology to the study and classification of",Paragraph
types in their relationship to the urban form).,Paragraph
"The books of Jacobs, Venturi, and Rossi are some of the earliest significant",Paragraph
"publications that analyzed a nascent Postmodernism. Other publications, such as Sibyl",Paragraph
"Moholy-Nagy’s Matrix of Man (1968), Peter Blake’s Form Follows Fiasco (1977), and",Paragraph
Colin Rowe’s and Fred Koetter’s Collage City (1978) exerted influence. For Rowe and,Paragraph
"Koetter, it was clear that modern architecture’s utopian beliefs had grown outdated. They",Paragraph
"proposed a “collage city,” in which the modernist technique of collage would bring",Paragraph
together several urban fragments stemming from different traditions. The collision of,Paragraph
these fragments would lead to an amalgam of simultaneous order and disorder that would,Paragraph
"allow for diverging interpretations, thus opening up the city for choice and freedom, as",Paragraph
well as multiplicity and ambiguity.,Paragraph
Another important impulse during the 1960s and 1970s concerned the interest in,Paragraph
popular and vernacular architecture. These populist architects criticized modern,Paragraph
"architecture for its paternalistic, bureaucratic, and antidemocratic character. Publications",Paragraph
"such as Sibyl Moholy-Nagy’s Native Genius in Anonymous Architecture (1957), Bernard",Paragraph
"Rudofsky’s Architecture without Architects (1964), or Amos Rapoport’s House, Form",Paragraph
and Culture (1969) provoked a genuine interest among a whole generation of architects,Paragraph
"for such factors as culture, site, climate, or conventions, which had been more or less",Paragraph
neglected within modernism. John Turner (1968) pointed to squatter settlements as “an,Paragraph
"architecture that works” (p. 355), arguing that the housing problems in developing",Paragraph
"countries should be solved by a bottom-up approach, relying on the experiences of self-",Paragraph
"builders in squatter settlements, rather than by the top-down approach favored by large-",Paragraph
scale modernist housing programs. Advocacy planning and participatory design gained,Paragraph
"influence in the United States as well as in Europe. At the same time, there was a",Paragraph
"growing interest in built products such as Levittown, New York, or Las Vegas. This trend",Paragraph
"culminated in Venturi, Scott Brown, and Izenour’s Learning from Las Vegas (1972), a",Paragraph
book in which they pleaded for the ordinariness of everyday life.,Paragraph
That Postmodern architecture also sought a different relation with history was,Paragraph
"evidenced at the 1980 Venice Biennale The Presence of the Past, organized by Paolo",Paragraph
"Portoghesi, who characterized the evolution away from modernist orthodoxy as “the end",Paragraph
"of prohibition.” The exhibition featured work by Venturi, Charles Moore, Hans Hollein,",Paragraph
"and Ricardo Bofill, as well as Aldo Rossi’s Teatro del Mondo, a small wooden theater,",Paragraph
"built on a ship, echoing the shape of the monuments of the San Marco basin where it was",Paragraph
"temporarily moored. Another important, dually sited exhibition—“Revision der",Paragraph
"Moderne” (Frankfurt, 1984) and “Nouveaux Plaisirs d’Architectures” (Paris, 1985)—",Paragraph
"included the work of Peter Eisenman, Frank Gehry, Rem Koolhaas, Oswald M.Ungers,",Paragraph
"Hollein, Moore, Rossi, and Venturi. Curator Heinrich Klotz argued that Postmodern",Paragraph
"architecture meant not a rejection but rather a revision of modern architecture, thus",Paragraph
"aiming at a third way between reaction and rupture. For Klotz, Postmodernism embraced",Paragraph
fiction alongside function: a building is not just an instrument but also a work that,Paragraph
"involves representation, poetics, and metaphor.",Paragraph
Tendencies within Postmodernism,Title
"A dominant distinguishing strand of Postmodernism is that of the vernacular, relying on",Paragraph
"popular images and references. Robert Venturi’s first building, the house for his mother,",Paragraph
"Vanna Venturi (Philadelphia, 1962), cleverly played with the archetype of the house. Its",Paragraph
"front facade looks appealingly conventional, but a closer look reveals that the interior",Paragraph
layout is quite complex and that what at first appears as a rather large chimney in fact,Paragraph
"hides a shifted stair and a small extra room. The house features ornamental strips, mullion",Caption
"windows, and arches—elements that were banished from any modernist building.",Paragraph
"Charles Moore, Michael Graves, and Robert Stern have contributed a great deal to",Paragraph
"Postmodern architecture in the United States. Moore’s Piazza d’Italia (New Orleans,",Caption
1979) is without doubt one of the most influential projects exemplary of a populist and,Paragraph
pluralist approach. The Piazza was commissioned to reflect the identity of the Italian,Paragraph
"community in New Orleans. Moore combined several references to Italy in the design,",Paragraph
"such as columns in an Italian order, a raised platform in the form of the Italian boot, and a",Paragraph
"fountain. At the same time, the design was built in a highly unusual combination of",Paragraph
"materials, using not only marble and stainless steel but also neon and cardboard. Michael",Paragraph
"Graves’s Portland Public Service Building (1982) in Portland, Ohio, and his Humana",Paragraph
"Tower (1985) in Louisville, Kentucky, show how a Postmodernist language can be",Paragraph
applied to the facades of office buildings that in terms of program and plan differ only,Paragraph
slightly from their modernist predecessors. Stern did a similar exercise with his Point,Paragraph
"West Place (1984) in Framingham, Massachusetts, but is also capable of reinterpreting",Paragraph
"more faithfully historical languages, such as the Shingle style (e.g., Bozzi Residence,",Paragraph
"1983, East Hampton, Long Island).",Caption
Whereas in the United States the populist tendency relies on play with formal,Paragraph
"elements, the best-known examples of participatory design are found in Europe; namely,",Paragraph
Lucien Kroll’s building for the Medical Faculty of the Catholic University of Louvain,Caption
"(Brussels, 1974} and Ralph Erskine’s Byker housing project (Newcasde upon Tyne,",Caption
"1981). Kroll’s “La Mémeé,” as it is affectionately called, provides its student inhabitants",Paragraph
with the possibility of continuously redesigning the distribution of its interior spaces. The,Paragraph
building’s facades appear as hybrid collages bringing together a surprising diversity of,Paragraph
"styles and references, implying that behind these walls a similar diversity of students has",Paragraph
found shelter. Erskine’s housing project in Newcastle resulted from a laborious design,Paragraph
process involving the future inhabitants. Where the project faces a highway at its northern,Paragraph
"side, it features a very high wall with only a few openings. It shows a much more friendly",Paragraph
"face toward the other side, sprinkling the facade with a multitude of balconies made of",Paragraph
wood and painted in bright orange and blue.,Paragraph
"Throughout the 1980s, however, in Europe the neorationalist tendency became",Paragraph
eclipsed by the populist model. Following the theoretical lead of Ross is Architecture of,Paragraph
"the City, neorationalism favored an urban architecture imbued with analyses of historical",Paragraph
"urban fabrics and forms. Instead of inventing new prototypes, neorationalists argued, new",Paragraph
contributions to the city should be based on the rational transformation of existing types,Paragraph
in accordance with their historical and urban context. This approach has been highly,Paragraph
"successful in the work of Aldo Rossi, Giorgio Grassi, Rafael Moneo, and Oswald Ungers.",Paragraph
"For example, Rossi’s Modena Cemetery (1985) combines multiple references to urban",Paragraph
forms and to symbols of life and death with an abstracted language to convey a feeling of,Paragraph
"melancholy. Moneo designed the impressive Roman Museum (1983) in Merida, where he",Paragraph
included archaeological findings in the foundations of the building and managed to,Paragraph
provide the whole with a magnificent sense of Roman grandeur. Ungers’s highly,Paragraph
"regarded Deutsches Architektur Museum (Frankfurt am Main, 1985) reinterpreted the",Paragraph
tradition of the urban villa by including in a bourgeois residence alongside the Main,Paragraph
"River a house within a house, thus evoking a fundamental architectural theme appropriate",Paragraph
for a museum of architecture.,Paragraph
Whereas the neorationalists saw their work as the continuation and transformation of a,Paragraph
"progressive historical genealogy, there were other protagonists of the so-called",Paragraph
reconstruction of the city who advocated a straightforward return to classicism. Authors,Paragraph
"such as Demetri Porphyrios, Maurice Culot, and Leon Krier—with the occasional support",Paragraph
of England’s Prince Charles—argued that only a faithful reproduction of 18th-century,Paragraph
typologies and formal idioms would be capable of providing a true sense of urbanity.,Paragraph
"According to such critics, industrialization and modernization had deprived architecture",Paragraph
"and the city of their very essence, turning architecture into a soulless repetition of the",Paragraph
same and the city into a loose conglomerate of freestanding buildings without any streets,Paragraph
or squares in which public life could unfold. The desire for a return to preindustrial forms,Paragraph
has led to various built projects in Brussels (the complex in the Lakense Straat [1994],Paragraph
"designed by different architects commissioned by the Archives d’ Architecture Moderne),",Paragraph
"London (Richmond Riverside [1988] by Quinlan Terry), and elsewhere. Its most",Paragraph
successful exponent might well be the increasingly influential movement of New,Paragraph
"Urbanism in the United States, which combines urbanist ideas similar to those of Léon",Paragraph
Krier and Culot with an architectural imagery that refers to the American colonial,Paragraph
tradition of small towns.,Paragraph
A classicist revival can also be recognized in the work of the Belgian Charles,Paragraph
"Vandenhove, who built in Belgium, Holland, and France. Vandenhove began his career",Paragraph
developing an eloquent modernist language in a series of individual houses and larger,Paragraph
"projects, gradually transforming this language toward a more classicist idiom.",Paragraph
Vandenhove’s Theatre des Abesses complex (1996) in Paris faithfully finishes the urban,Paragraph
"block it is part of, looking as if it has always been there. The buildings facing the street",Paragraph
"are inconspicuous, built in the Parisian idiom familiar since the mid-19th century. The",Paragraph
"theater, lying in the back, is more outspoken, featuring a Palladian entrance with a",Paragraph
fronton and a vestibule with pillars.,Caption
"In the United States, Philip Johnson has, with his partner John Burgee, occasionally",Paragraph
"designed projects that were faithful replicas of historical examples (e.g., his College of",Paragraph
"Architecture [1985], Houston, Texas, a replica of a project by Claude-Nicholas Ledoux),",Caption
but his Postmodernist stage is rather characterized by a free and informal use of historical,Paragraph
"references (such as his AT&T Building [1984], New York).",Paragraph
There are also many architects whose work is clearly Postmodernist but who cannot be,Paragraph
"categorized straightforwardly in any of the previously mentioned classifications (populist,",Paragraph
"neorationalist, or classicist). Ricardo Bofill of Spain, for example, is well known for his",Paragraph
"unorthodox use of classicist elements (columns, pilasters, pediments, cornices, and",Paragraph
moldings) within social housing schemes. James Stirling combined classicist references,Paragraph
"with highly populist elements in his Neue Staatsgalerie (1984, with Michael Wilford) in",Paragraph
"Stuttgart, a building that can be seen as exemplary of Postmodernism’s multiple",Paragraph
"references, urban sensitivity, and witty connotations. Austrian Hans Hollein’s Abeitburg",Paragraph
"Museum (1982) in M6nchengladbach, Germany, sensitively interacts with its urban",Paragraph
"context, reinterpreting several building types and combining these into a difficult whole",Paragraph
"that nevertheless has a clear signature. In Japan and in Southeast Asia, an eclectic attitude",Paragraph
"has been especially prolific, as exemplified in the work of Arata Isozaki. His Tsukuba",Paragraph
"Civic Center (Tsukuba, Japan, 1983) features a replica of Michelangelo’s Campidoglio",Caption
that is sunk under a plaza among other Western sources.,Paragraph
Such examples underline Jencks’s initial characterization of Postmodernism as a,Paragraph
"radical eclecticism. Postmodern architects are free to borrow elements from the context,",Paragraph
"from the past, from classicism, from popular culture, and from the architectural language",Paragraph
"and concepts of modernism. The latter makes up for a confusing connotation, for it means",Paragraph
that sometimes the work of architects such as Richard Meier or Rem Koolhaas has been,Paragraph
"labeled Postmodernist, although it clearly continues a modernist tradition (be it with",Paragraph
ironic or even cynical overtones).,Paragraph
The Postmodern Condition,Title
The common element among the different strands of Postmodernism in architecture,Paragraph
seems to be the rejection of the narrow focus on functionality and efficiency that,Paragraph
characterized modernism. Postmodernity is brought about by the loss of the grand,Paragraph
narratives of modernism: the modernist ideal of an increasing rationality that would result,Title
in progress and emancipation for all mankind has lost its validity and is seen as an,Paragraph
"illusion. In this sense, Jencks’s diagnosis of Postmodernism in architecture corresponds",Paragraph
with the French philosopher Jean-Frangois Lyotard’s interpretation of La Condition,Paragraph
"Postmoderne (1979; The Postmodern Condition). According to Lyotard, the main feature",Paragraph
"of the Postmodern condition is that the grand narratives (in literature, history, art, and",Paragraph
philosophy} have come under scrutiny. Grand narratives are collectively shared ideas and,Paragraph
convictions that are communicated by repeatedly told stories that grant legitimacy to,Paragraph
"institutions and values that form the basis of society. Such grand narratives, Lyotard",Paragraph
"argues, have lost their self-evident character, and their importance tends to become",Paragraph
"devalued in the minds of the people to whom they are addressed. Hence, there is a",Paragraph
general loss of shared ideals that can act as guidance for decisions about future,Paragraph
developments in our society.,Paragraph
"This, however, is about as far as the correspondences between Jencks and Lyotard can",Paragraph
be stretched. Jencks describes Postmodernism as that which chronologically succeeds,Paragraph
"modernism, whereas Lyotard discerns much more complex relations between the modern",Paragraph
"and the Postmodern. In his later essays on Postmodernism, Lyotard claims that the",Paragraph
relationship between modern and Postmodern can never be simply chronological because,Paragraph
"the modern includes in a certain way the Postmodern: modern is what is new, but this",Paragraph
"means that it always follows on the previous thing, which was new (Lyotard, 1991).",Paragraph
"Jencks, moreover, stresses the aspect of communication and symbolism: Postmodernism",Paragraph
"treats architecture as a language, capable of conveying meanings, although he does not",Paragraph
question how cultures navigate such communication. One of the arguments raised by,Paragraph
Lyotard is precisely that the power of the grand narratives rests on their presumed,Paragraph
"comprehensibility by all, whereas it has become clear to him that societies, generations,",Paragraph
and classes do not share a universal “metalanguage.”,Paragraph
Criticizing Postmodernism,Title
"One of the earliest critics of Postmodernism in architecture was Jiirgen Habermas (1980,",Paragraph
1981). Habermas blamed Post-modernism for hiding a conservative attitude behind a,Paragraph
"seemingly progressive mask. For him, Postmodernists have given up the project of",Paragraph
"modernity, the project of emancipation, to seek refuge in nice and pleasant but socially",Paragraph
irrelevant formal games. Americans David Harvey (1990) and Fredric Jameson (1991),Paragraph

POWER PLANT,Title
"Energy consumption is directly related to gross national product, and the expansion of the",Paragraph
"world market due to industrialization has accelerated the demand for energy. Originally,",Paragraph
small electrical generators were built by factory owners in Europe and the United States,Paragraph
"for their own manufacturing, but in the 20th century the proliferation of electric lights",Paragraph
and appliances required the construction of centralized stations. Throughout most of the,Paragraph
"century, power plants were icons of progress, but since the last quarter of the century, the",Paragraph
power plant has come to embody the threat of environmental degradation. The high-tech,Paragraph
exoskeletal aesthetic organic to many steam-generated power plants has been borrowed,Paragraph
and modified by architects such as Richard Rogers (England) and Eric Owen Moss,Paragraph
"(United States). Curiously, however, power plants themselves have received almost no",Paragraph
"attention, remaining virtually invisible features in the landscape unless identified as an",Paragraph
environmental hazard.,Paragraph
"Power plants come in a variety of types and forms, but ultimately they do the same",Paragraph
"thing: spin a turbine connected to an electric generator, thus producing electricity. One",Paragraph
type is distinguished from another by the mechanism used to spin the turbine. Power,Paragraph
"plants are large-scale machines converting kinetic energy into electrical energy, usually",Paragraph
by transforming thermal energy into kinetic energy first. The form of a power plant often,Paragraph
expresses this process by architecturally compartmentalizing the stages of transference in,Paragraph
distinct structures connected by plumbing and other conveying systems. Some types are,Paragraph
"spread across the landscape, however, taking advantage of the energy stored in local",Paragraph
"meteorological phenomena, such as wind blowing through a pass, a river propelled",Paragraph
"downstream by gravity, or the sun’s energy after it filters through the earth’s atmosphere.",Paragraph
Steam-Generated Power Plants,Title
"Most power plants use steam to generate electricity, and the first public electric-",Paragraph
generating stations were built in Europe and the United States in the late 1880s. Boilers,Paragraph
"of increasing size and complexity were developed in the 20th century, fired successively",Paragraph
"by wood, coal, oil, and natural gas and then by nuclear, solar, and geothermal energy.",Paragraph
"In steam-powered electricity generators, water is pumped into a steel chamber called a",Paragraph
"boiler, where it is heated by the consumption of the fuel (e.g., the burning of coal}. The",Paragraph
resulting steam is then channeled to nozzles that inject the steam against the fins of a,Paragraph
"turbine, forcing it to spin. Coal-fired plants are the most common, and a typical coal-",Paragraph
burning plant will produce 600 megawatts of energy in this process. The steam is then,Paragraph
condensed back into water and returned to the boiler or expelled for cooling either in a,Paragraph
cooling tower or in artificial ponds. Cooling towers are perhaps the largest and most,Paragraph
"architecturally distinctive features of power plants, usually constructed of reinforced",Paragraph
concrete and parabolically tapered from a broad base to a narrower top. Although,Paragraph
"condensed steam is clean, if discharged prior to cooling in such a tower (or in its",Paragraph
"horizontal equivalent, a cooling pond), its high temperature can disturb and even kill fish",Paragraph
"and other wildlife. Waste from fuel, especially coal and oil, must also be expelled.",Paragraph
"Chimney stacks, like boilers, became increasingly complex throughout the century, and a",Paragraph
"system of scrubbers and filters have been developed to reduce levels of sulfuric dioxide,",Paragraph
"which creates acid rain. By the 21st century, a coal-fired steam-generating electrical plant",Paragraph
"could be expected to have three principal structures: the multistory boiler, the precipitator",Paragraph
"or scrubber, and the chimney stack (the streamlined character of the chimney belies the",Paragraph
complex machinery inside its tapered conical form).,Paragraph
Non-Fuel-Burning Power Plants,Title
"There are two types of active solar power electric-generating plants, and both are rare",Paragraph
compared to fuel-burning plants. The first reflects the sun’s rays by the use of hundreds,Paragraph
"of reflectors arrayed in a field. The reflectors, called heliostats, are mechanically tilted to",Paragraph
follow the sun’s arc and to reflect light onto a parabolic receiver located approximately,Paragraph
"50 meters atop a tower to the south. Water is pumped to the receiver, where it is boiled by",Paragraph
"the reflected thermal energy, thus producing steam. The experimental Eurelios plant at",Paragraph
"Adrano, Italy, built in the 1980s, utilizes this process and produces 1 megawatt of",Paragraph
ectricity. The second type of solar plant uses semiconductors called solar cells to,Paragraph
"directly transform the sun’s energy into electricity. Like the first type, a solar field",Paragraph
consists of hundreds of panels mechanically aligned to track the sun’s trajectory. The first,Paragraph
"plant of this variety was built in Hysperia, California, in 1982 and produces as much",Paragraph
"electricity as the Eurelios plant and occupies the same land area, approximately 1,000",Paragraph
square meters.,Paragraph
"Hydroelectric plants skip the steam-generating process, using the force of water to spin",Paragraph
the turbines. Dams are the best-known hydroelectric generators and the most,Paragraph
"monumental, but water may also be pumped to a high point (a hill or a tower) and then",Paragraph
allowed to rush down to the turbines. Wind farms utilize the kinetic energy of air currents,Paragraph
"to produce electricity, and a typical farm consists of thousands of steel windmills 30 to 50",Paragraph
"meters high, each installed with an electrical generator behind the propeller. The surreal",Paragraph
landscape of the wind farm is highly visible since they are often sited in passes where the,Paragraph
flow of air is funneled and where civil engineers are likely to situate highways. The,Paragraph
"6,500-turbine wind farm at Altamont Pass, California (1986), for example, generates only",Paragraph
"300 megawatts (at maximum capacity, which it rarely reaches}. By comparison, Hoover",Paragraph
"Dam (1936) generates 650 megawatts, while the Volta Dam (1965) in Ghana generates",Paragraph
750 megawatts (and nuclear power plants typically generate nearly 900 megawatts).,Paragraph
Although these two types of plants do not pollute the environment like fuel-burning,Paragraph
"plants do, they still have an impact on the landscape. Dams, especially when built in a",Paragraph
series called a cascade (such as those in the Tennessee Valley in the United States or on,Paragraph
"the Dnepr River in the former Soviet Union), often raise the water table in areas on the",Paragraph
o,Title
"upstream side of the reservoir, even flooding basements in urban areas. Farms along",Paragraph
"rivers can be inundated, impacting local economies and ecologies. Even windmills can",Paragraph
have adverse environmental effects since the siting of wind farms on migration routes,Paragraph
seriously disturbs the nesting and foraging habits of birds.,Paragraph
Geothermal power plants have been constructed since the last third of the 20th century,Paragraph
"in Ireland, the United States, and parts of Europe. These plants, or fields, consist of a",Paragraph
"scattering of wells several kilometers deep, each well comprised of two bores. The",Paragraph
objective is to tap in to the heat generated in the earth’s core and stored in the earth’s,Paragraph
mantle. Water is pumped into the first bore and heated by the magma or dry rock at the,Paragraph
"bottom of the well. It is then pumped back out the second bore as steam, at temperatures",Paragraph
of 200 degrees Celsius or greater. The steam is then used to power the electric-generating,Paragraph
turbines.,Paragraph
Nuclear Power Plants,Title
Nuclear power was hailed in the third quarter of the 20th century as a clean source of,Paragraph
"energy, and the first power plant was constructed in 1956 at Calder Hall in Great Britain.",Paragraph
With core meltdowns in the United States (Three Mile Island in 1979) and the Soviet,Paragraph
"Union (Chernoby! in 1986), however, the former, optimistic view has been substantially",Paragraph
revised.,Paragraph
"In nuclear plants, a steel-encased core consisting of thousands of fuel rods (usually",Paragraph
"uranium, sometimes plutonium) encased in zircaloy creates heat via fission. Discovered",Paragraph
"in 1938, fission is the splitting of uranium or plutonium atomic nuclei, a process that",Paragraph
creates energy in the form of heat. The fuel rods are cooled by either water (at high,Paragraph
"pressure), gas, or liquid steel, which circulates through the core before it is pumped into",Paragraph
"another steel container called a heat exchanger. There, the heated coolant is circulated in",Paragraph
"pipes inside a secondary water supply that in turn becomes heated, thus producing steam.",Paragraph
"In some cases, the heat exchanger is omitted, and water circulates directly from core to",Paragraph
"turbine. More so than in other steam-generating systems, nuclear power plants require an",Paragraph
elaborate network of plumbing and instrumentation to monitor the flow of coolant.,Paragraph
"Because radioactivity is generated during fission, the core and its coolant are extremely",Paragraph
"hazardous, and containment structures are usually constructed around the reactor and the",Paragraph
"heat exchanger. If too little coolant is present in the reactor core, fission accelerates, and",Paragraph
heat is increased to the point of meltdown. This is what happened at both Three Mile,Paragraph
"Island and Chernobyl, and in the case of the latter, the remaining water in the core",Paragraph
"became so hot under pressure that a steam explosion blew the roof off the reactor,",Paragraph
exposing the core to the atmosphere. The reactors at Chernobyl were not enclosed in a,Paragraph
"containment building. After the catastrophe, the Soviets encased the dangerous reactor in",Paragraph
"a steel-reinforced concrete bunker dubbed “the tomb,” an allusion to the 10,000-year",Paragraph
half-life of the contaminated material buried inside.,Paragraph

"the most gifted of these was Frank Lloyd Wright, who was with Adler and Sullivan for",Paragraph
six years prior to his departure to found his own office in 1893. Wright saw the provision,Paragraph
of well-designed houses for the newly affluent Midwestern upper-middle class as a great,Paragraph
opportunity. His clients did not possess great fortune but were generally technological,Paragraph
entrepreneurs. Many had a taste for music. Wright gave them dwellings that responded to,Paragraph
the vision of Sullivan and that at the same time went beyond that vision to achieve a,Paragraph
"synthesis very much his own. For the next 15 years, he pursued his goals with remarkable",Paragraph
vigor and great success. The first executed houses in which the new style was fully,Paragraph
"visible were the Bradley house (1900) in Kankakee, Illinois, and the Ward Willits house",Paragraph
"(1901) in Highland Park, Illinois. In the next few years, there followed a number of",Paragraph
"important works, notably the Davenport, Dana, Heurtley, Huntley, and Thomas houses,",Paragraph
all finished by 1904. These houses had important elements in common: flowing interior,Paragraph
"space, directional or centrifugal lines, generous low roofs with pronounced overhangs,",Paragraph
"broad chimneys, reduced floor heights, rows of casement windows, geometric leaded",Caption
"glass, and an intimate relationship to the site. The interiors featured furniture and",Paragraph
sometimes fabrics designed by the architect. Wright’s objective was to control every,Paragraph
"aspect of the architectural experience. All were designed on a unit system, meaning that",Paragraph
they were based on a single module with a length equal to some specific architectural,Paragraph
"element, often, as in the Willits house, the distance between center lines of window",Paragraph
mullions. None of these houses show any hint of historicism. Although most were located,Paragraph
"in suburbs, with varying kinds of topography, all reflected the horizontal lines of the",Paragraph
prairie.,Paragraph
"The sources of these designs, for Wright and for the gifted young men and women in",Paragraph
"his Oak Park studio, were mixed. They owed something to the earlier Shingle style, and",Paragraph
they owed much to the contemporary English Arts and Crafts movement. The houses of,Paragraph
Voysey and the theoretical writings of C.R.Ashbee were discussed as they appeared in,Paragraph
"the pages of The Studio. In addition, they owed a debt to Japanese art, which most of",Paragraph
"them knew through prints (Hokusai and Hiroshige were familiar names). After 1904, the",Paragraph
"year of the St. Louis World’s Fair, there was a bit of influence from Germany and",Paragraph
"Austria. All these influences, however, were melded by Wright and the staff of his studio",Paragraph
into a distinctive Midwestern and American expression.,Paragraph
"Among Wright’s studio apprentices, the most important were Marion Mahony, Walter",Paragraph
"Burley Griffin, William Drummond, and Barry Byrne. All were substantially influenced",Paragraph
"by Wright, and all in later years made substantial contributions of their own. Their",Paragraph
"contemporaries spoke of a “New School of the Midwest.” Outside the studio, Hugh",Paragraph
"Garden, Robert Spencer, and George Maher, at different times in their careers, produced",Paragraph
excellent designs in the Prairie School manner.,Paragraph
In Minneapolis the firm of Purcell and Elmslie developed its own distinctive version of,Paragraph
the style. By 1910 it was generally recognized in the nation’s architectural press that the,Paragraph
most progressive tendencies in American architecture were in the Mid-west. Wright’s,Paragraph
own series of articles in The Architectural Record titled “In the Cause of,Paragraph
Architecture” (1909) were perhaps the clearest evidence of this evaluation. International,Paragraph
"recognition came with the publication of the famous Wasmuth folio on his work (Berlin,",Paragraph
1910) and with the influential articles of Hendrik Berlage for the Schweizerische,Paragraph
Bauzeitung in 1911. These publications had substantial impact on the Modern movement,Paragraph
in Europe.,Paragraph
"For Wright the climax of his Prairie period came with the great houses of 1908-09,",Paragraph
"particularly the Robie (1908) and Coonley (1909) houses, the first in Chicago and the",Paragraph
"second in Riverside, Illinois. Among public buildings, his major achievements were",Paragraph
Unity Temple (1904—05) in Oak Park and the headquarters for the Larkin Company in,Paragraph
"Buffalo, New York, done in the same years. The Prairie School idiom, however, was not",Paragraph
one that lent itself easily to large public buildings and industrial structures. There are a,Paragraph
"few of these. In the latter category, Hugh Garden made some noteworthy contributions",Paragraph
"with the Grommes and Ullrich Building (1901), the Schoenhofen Brewery (1905), and",Paragraph
"the Dwight Building (1910), all in Chicago. The last structure was for a printing company",Paragraph
and was framed in flat-slab concrete. The Prairie School architects also did a few,Paragraph
"churches. Of these, Sullivan’s Methodist Episcopal Church (1910) in Cedar Rapids,",Paragraph
"Iowa, with a contribution by George Elmslie, is perhaps the finest. On the whole,",Paragraph
"however, the Prairie School aesthetic lent itself to houses and small commercial",Paragraph
"buildings, and it is these building types by which its practitioners should be judged.",Paragraph
"Prairie School architects attempted almost every problem in the decorative arts, and",Paragraph
"they had great success with chairs, tables, case furniture, fabrics, and perhaps most",Paragraph
"important of all, leaded glass; their achievements would have been impossible without",Paragraph
the cooperation of cabinetmakers such as John W.Ayers and glass studios such as,Paragraph
"Giannini and Hilgart and the Linden Glass Company; and for Wright, the assistance of",Paragraph
the Milwaukee interior decorator George Niedieken was vital in such large commissions,Paragraph
"as the Robie and Coonley houses and the May house (1909) in Grand Rapids, Michigan.",Paragraph
"The architects saw building as a cooperative process in which client, designer, and artisan",Paragraph
"all had important roles to play. Among themselves, they deplored the tendency of Wright",Paragraph
"to claim all the credit for their achievement, as he commonly did after 1913-14.",Paragraph
"In certain respects, the Prairie School style can be understood as an idiom that could be",Paragraph
"employed by architects who had little or no contact with Wright, Sullivan, or Chicago.",Paragraph
"For the central figures—Wright, Sullivan, Griffin, and Purcell and Elmslie—architectural",Caption
"design was an act of faith, an optimistic faith in the liberal ideals of American",Paragraph
democracy. They liked to think,Paragraph
"Arthur Heurtley House, Oak Park, Illinois, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright",Caption

Photo © Mary Ann Sullivan,Caption
of their architecture as “progressive” and strongly disliked the academic traditionalism of,Paragraph
"McKim, Mead and White and their Eastern contemporaries. In fact, they viewed it as a",Paragraph
"rehash of outworm European forms. The Prairie School manner, however, was sufficiently",Paragraph
attractive that it was sometimes employed by architects who had relatively little,Paragraph
"sympathy with the ideals of the leaders. Thus, Osgood and Osgood in Grand Rapids, a",Paragraph
"firm that was essentially eclectic, did two houses in a distinctly Prairie School manner.",Paragraph
These dwellings might well have been responses to client demand. Sidney Robinson and,Paragraph
Richard Guy Wilson have shown that lowa is dotted with buildings that have Prairie,Paragraph
"School elements. The same kind of demonstration could easily be made for Minnesota,",Paragraph
"Wisconsin, and Illinois. Wilson and Robinson also argue that the Prairie School had two",Paragraph
distinct and separate phases. The first has been identified as from 1900 to about 1920.,Paragraph
They date the second from Wright’s return to the Midwest in the 1930s and cite his later,Paragraph
"Iowa houses and the work of Alfred Caldwell in Dubuque. This position is arguable, and",Paragraph
it has recently received support in Frank Lloyd Wright and Colleagues: Indiana Works,Paragraph
"(Michigan City, Indiana, 1999). This exhibition catalog also includes certain projects by",Paragraph
"the landscape architect Jens Jensen, whose stature in his field is comparable to that of",Paragraph
Wright in the building arts. Jensen certainly had a prominent role in the development of,Paragraph
the Prairie symbolism.,Paragraph
The gradual decline of the original Prairie School after 1914 was the result of several,Paragraph
"broad historical factors. For a variety of reasons, the supply of clients willing to accept",Paragraph
the innovations advocated by the architects dwindled considerably. Women were,Paragraph
"becoming increasingly important in American society, and as Thomas Tallmadge pointed",Paragraph
"out, wives now received their education from magazines edited in Boston and New York.",Paragraph
"In 1910 House Beautiful, which had always been sympathetic to the Prairie School",Paragraph
"architects, moved its offices to New York. The last prairie houses appeared in its pages in",Paragraph
1914. The story of Country Life in America is similar. Its last mention of a prairie house,Paragraph
"was in January 1914, when it featured a dwelling in Seattle by Andrew Willatzen, who",Paragraph
had worked in Wright’s office and absorbed some of his thought. The general shift of the,Paragraph
publishing industry to New York had enormous consequences for the cultural life of the,Paragraph
"entire nation, as it meant a homogenization of American culture. The Prairie School had",Paragraph
"flourished as a healthy type of regionalism, and regionalism became unfashionable.",Paragraph
The architects themselves withdrew from the Midwestern scene. Wright’s personal life,Paragraph
"was chaotic, and he spent much of the decade of World War | in Japan. Sullivan, the",Paragraph
"philosophical leader of the group, was able to build only a handful of small banks and",Paragraph
gradually descended into poverty and alcoholism. Walter Burley Griffin and Marion,Paragraph
"Mahony, two of Wright’s most talented apprentices, went to Australia in 1913 and spent",Paragraph
most of their careers in that country. Purcell went to Philadelphia in 1918 to enter the,Paragraph
advertising business and in 1922 moved to the West Coast because of ill health.,Paragraph
"Nonetheless, the achievement of the Prairie School was substantial, and it left the Mid-",Paragraph
west a great legacy in the form of a large number of buildings that are sought out and,Paragraph
admired to this day.,Paragraph

PRECAST CONCRETE,Title
Precast construction typically refers to concrete that is manufactured in a factory rather,Paragraph
"than at the site. Poured-in-place concrete, in contrast, is a process where formwork and",Paragraph
reinforcing bars are set and the wet concrete and its aggregates poured in the precise,Paragraph
position that they are to occupy in the completed building. Poured-in-place construction,Paragraph
allows contractors to tailor the various components of a building and more easily,Paragraph
compensate for minor discrepancies discovered during the course of a project. In many,Paragraph
"cases, however, precast construction offers both technical and cost advantages. Precast",Paragraph
"components are manufactured in factories, transported to the site, and then assembled and",Paragraph
"fastened together on the job. They may or may not be reinforced, but if so, they are",Paragraph
usually prestressed.,Paragraph
The technical advantages of forming reinforced-concrete components in a factory first,Paragraph
involve environmental factors. Heat and humidity influence the length of time that,Paragraph
concrete requires to set and cure as well as its load-bearing strength. The factory,Paragraph
environment allows manufacturers to control these atmospheric variables far better than,Paragraph
at a site. Precast structural members are often designed at higher strength than most on-,Paragraph
"site counterparts (which are designed typically for 3,000 pounds per square inch, 28 days",Paragraph
"after pouring). Temperature can be raised in a factory, accelerating the amount of time",Paragraph
"that concrete requires to cure. Also, reinforcing can be more precisely set into place, and",Paragraph
the tolerances and coverage of concrete around the reinforcing steel can be more,Paragraph
"accurately controlled, thus producing more efficient structural components. Complex",Paragraph
rebar configurations and more accurate lapping of one rebar over another can be more,Paragraph
"easily managed and inspected in a factory, where the movement of laborers and",Paragraph
technicians is not inhibited by on-site obstacles. Site conditions are also rarely conducive,Paragraph
"to the pretightening of steel tendons, and thus prestressed structural sections are far easier",Paragraph
to construct in a factory setting. Prestressing is a process where steel cables called,Paragraph
tendons are anchored to the ends of formwork and tensioned before concrete is poured.,Paragraph
"After the concrete hardens and gains sufficient strength, the cables are released. This",Paragraph
"internally applies a precompressive stress, which potentially reduces or minimizes",Paragraph
undesirable tensile stresses created by the structural member’s own weight as well as the,Paragraph
load that it will have to support once installed in the building. Prestressing tends to,Paragraph
"minimize cracking as well as de-flections. Finally, factory conditions also tend to allow",Paragraph
"better control over the finished appearance of concrete, including surface sheen,",Paragraph
"aggregate density, and color.",Paragraph
The cost advantages of precast construction derive from an economy of scale. Factory,Paragraph
settings are economical when manufacturing multiple copies of the same component.,Paragraph
"Poured-in-place construction requires assembling the formwork for components on-site,",Paragraph
"setting the rebar, pouring the concrete, and then removing the formwork for reassembly",Paragraph
"at the next pour, usually requiring more time and labor than manufacturing the equivalent",Paragraph
part in a factory. This is important because it can have a significant impact on the overall,Paragraph
cost and length of time to complete a building project.,Paragraph
"Precast construction comes with inherent limits, however, dictated primarily by the",Paragraph
problem of transportation. Manufactured components must be transported from the,Paragraph
"factory to the building site via ship, train, or truck and sometimes by a combination of",Paragraph
"means. Consequently, components must not be so long or heavy that they prohibit",Paragraph
"transportation. Generally, components longer than 30 feet are impractical. Weight is an",Paragraph
"especially crucial factor in transportation, and it is common for engineers to anticipate the",Paragraph
problem of transport by incorporating steel hooks or loops anchored in the concrete for,Paragraph
the purpose of lifting and lowering by crane. The cost-effectiveness of precast,Paragraph
construction can be compromised by building sites located in remote areas or in regions,Paragraph
"where infrastructure is insufficient. A mountainous site, for example, may be a poor",Paragraph
choice for precast construction if existing roads twist and turn at radii that a large truck,Paragraph
cannot negotiate.,Paragraph
The ramifications of precast construction affect both engineering and aesthetics.,Paragraph
Construction schedules must be carefully planned so that needed components arrive on-,Paragraph
site when needed. Since some parts may be built on-site and others manufactured in a,Paragraph
"remote factory, and in many cases precast components may be manufactured in separate",Paragraph
"factories miles apart, the interface between components is a crucial concern of engineers",Paragraph
and architects. A kit-of-parts approach to construction encourages the manufacturing of,Paragraph
"standardized parts that can fit together in a variety of configurations. Generally, irregular",Paragraph
"building designs can be problematic, while modularity tends to be advantageous in",Paragraph
precast construction.,Paragraph
"The most common precast structural components tend to be linear: beams, ribbed",Paragraph
"beams (also called T beams), inverted T beams, solid flat slabs, hollow-core slabs, and",Paragraph
tilt-up wall panels. Unreinfbrced-concrete components include wall panels with specific,Paragraph
"finishes either poured or applied as veneer. Unlike poured-in-place reinforced concrete,",Paragraph
"precast construction lacks the structural advantage of continuity, where rebar segments",Paragraph
can be lapped in a series the entire length of a structure. This is why connections between,Paragraph
components require great care. Slip-slab construction is a hybrid method where floor,Paragraph
"slabs are poured on grade at the site, then lifted into place by jacks secured to building",Paragraph
columns. This process is cost-effective for multistory buildings with repetitive floor,Paragraph
configurations since the forms do not need to be moved from one floor to the next.,Paragraph
"However, the connection between floor slabs and columns requires the same expertise as",Paragraph
precast construction connections.,Paragraph

PREFABRICATION,Title
Buildings are traditionally constructed by assembling materials and components of the,Paragraph
building trades according to an approved set of design drawings and specifications on a,Paragraph
given site. Having a smooth and timely pace for erecting buildings is highly dependent on,Paragraph
"the quality and steadiness of supplies, the availability of qualified labor, a safe and",Paragraph
"conflict-free working environment, and, last but not least, the weather. Because all these",Paragraph
"more or less controllable variables pose substantial risks, the desire to standardize the",Paragraph
"design and to relocate the production process into a highly controllable, productive",Paragraph
factory environment is an old dream of builders and clients alike. The technique dates,Paragraph
"back to the early stages of industrialization, at the turn of the 20th century, with prime",Paragraph
"examples being London’s Crystal Palace, built in 1851 for the Great Exhibition in Hyde",Paragraph
"Park, London, by Joseph Paxton, and cast-iron building facades created for commercial",Caption
structures in the fire hazard-prone early metropolitan areas of our times.,Paragraph
The term “prefabrication” in architecture normally describes the assembly of buildings,Paragraph
or their components at a location other than the building site. With the help of this,Paragraph
"method, the risk-creating variables of cost control, weather, and a dependable and,",Paragraph
"because of repetition, experienced workforce helps to optimize the use of materials and",Paragraph
time in a controlled environment. Prefabricated units can range from singular building,Paragraph
"parts that later find their way into a conventional on-site construction project, such as",Paragraph
"doors, windows, and roof trusses, to room-size elements, from bathrooms to entire",Paragraph
buildings. Prefabrication can also take place on-site if the scope of the project is very,Paragraph
"large, as in the case of housing developments of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s in Eastern",Paragraph
"Europe, the former Soviet Union, and Scandinavia.",Paragraph
"Historically, the main materials for prefabrication are wood, iron, and concrete. Early",Paragraph
traces of wood for prefabrication date back to the 1848 gold rush in the United States;,Paragraph
"experiments with prefabricated housing units made of wood in Great Britain, Germany,",Paragraph
"and Sweden were conducted between the two world wars. In 1850 in New York,",Paragraph
complete wooden houses where shipped as building kits to California in response to the,Paragraph
"huge demand in the West. Several hundred housing units made of other materials, such as",Paragraph
"corrugated galvanized iron, were imported from Manchester, England, completely fitted",Paragraph
"with wallpaper, water closets, and furniture to satisfy the demand for housing in",Paragraph
"California, where an established building industry was not yet available. Patented",Paragraph
plantation and camp buildings produced by lumber dealers in New York and Boston,Paragraph
consisted of a number of interchangeable parts and could be erected in hours. In Germany,Paragraph
"the company of Christoph and Unmack, founded in 1882, produced load-bearing wood",Paragraph
panels for cabins and camp buildings that were shipped in very large quantities to many,Paragraph
parts of the world. The oldest known U.S. firm specializing in prefabrication was founded,Paragraph
"in Boston in 1892. Ernest F.Hodgson manufactured dwellings of wood, which the firm",Paragraph
"labeled in a patent, dating back to 1861, “the portable house.” Other derivatives of early",Paragraph
prefabrication in the United States are so-called mail-order houses. Companies such as,Paragraph
"Sears, Roebuck, and Company (Newark, New Jersey), Montgomery Ward (Chicago,",Paragraph
"Illinois), Aladdin Company (Bay City, Michigan), Gordon-Van Tine Company",Paragraph
"(Davenport, lowa), and many others produced “precut” timber kits of parts, designed for",Paragraph
owner erection. Many might consider the system of precutting not to be a true,Paragraph
"prefabrication process. The enormous number of produced units, the industrialized",Paragraph
"process of factory-controlled cost estimating, the purchasing and cutting of wood",Paragraph
"products, numbering industrialized quality control, and packaging all were carried out in",Paragraph
"a efficient factory-assembly-line manner. Between 1908 and 1940, customers ordered",Paragraph
"some 100,000 houses from Sears, Roebuck, and Company alone. The designs could be",Paragraph
"selected from a catalog, ordered by mail, and shipped by rail. Approximately 450 ready-",Paragraph
"to-assemble designs covered almost every style, from cottage to mansion. Beside Sears’s",Paragraph
"brick and concrete masonry unit homes, the traditional wood frame erected on a wooden",Paragraph
platform was used as the standard method of construction.,Paragraph
Industry in the United States also experimented with concrete and iron as,Paragraph
prefabrication methods. In 1920 story-height precast reinforced-concrete stone elements,Caption
"were produced under trade names such as “Armostone,” “Moore Unit,” and “Tee-Stone.”",Paragraph
Frank Lloyd Wright designed a precast system in 1920 that consisted of two precast-,Paragraph
"element walls: one interior wall and one outside, reinforced and connected with tie-rods",Caption
and separated by an insulating air space. The large sizes of concrete elements made,Paragraph
"handling on a conventionally equipped, small-scale construction site difficult. Smaller-",Paragraph
"scaled precast units, such as 16-by-8-by-8-inch concrete blocks, were, and still are today,",Paragraph
more widely accepted.,Paragraph
Early experiments of prefabrication in Great Britain with elements made of iron date to,Paragraph
"Victorian times, when numerous prefabricated buildings were shipped from Britain to",Paragraph
every corner of the world. British settlers on the Australian west coast could order,Paragraph
"corrugated-iron cottages from the Phoenix Iron Works in Glasgow, Scotland, and from",Paragraph
the firm of Richard Walker. Other requests from Australia called for the shipment of,Paragraph
"“portable” churches, temporary metal structures to replace the hastily improvised timber",Paragraph
"structures of the early days. In Melbourne alone, 19 metal churches were erected with kits",Paragraph
shipped from the homeland between 1836 and 1851. When it was packed and ready for,Paragraph
"shipment to the colonies, a church weighed about 50 tons; the cost in the second half of",Paragraph
"the 19th century was £1000, and the building was ready to be used in five weeks. Before",Paragraph
"shipment to foreign coasts, it was common practice to fully assemble the structure on the",Paragraph
"grounds of the factory as a final quality check, which always attracted public attention.",Paragraph
"The lighthouse in Gibb’s Hill, Bermuda, is a sturdy, prefabricated iron structure shipped",Paragraph
"from England in 1857; the so-called Gordon’s Lighthouse in Barbados, a fully",Paragraph
"prefabricated-metal construction, stood for 112 years. The Iron Palace for King Eyambo",Caption
"on the banks of the Calabar River in Nigeria, erected in 1843, was built by the foundry of",Paragraph
"Laycock, Liverpool, “a composite structure of plate and panels of iron upon a wooden",Caption
"skeleton merely,” as the Liverpool Times described it.",Paragraph
"Besides prefabricated galvanized sheet-metal elements, cast iron contributed to a large",Paragraph
degree to the importance of metal prefabrication techniques. James Bogardus is more,Paragraph
identified with the advances of cast-iron prefabrication than any other inventor. Already,Paragraph
"holding numerous patents for metal fabricating tools and mills, Bogardus conceived the",Paragraph
idea of taking cast iron beyond its already widely accepted role as a decorative building,Paragraph
material to a multistory structural system. His first building would be his own factory in,Paragraph
"New York City, for which he tried to associate with other veteran iron makers to raise the",Paragraph
necessary funds. Bogardus’s system consisted of basic elements: a hollow column with,Paragraph
"flanged sides, a C-shaped hollow beam, a spandrel panel, and a diversity of decorative",Paragraph
"cast-iron elements, such as cornices, entablatures, window elements, cornerstones, and",Paragraph
"Medusa-head keystones, the trademark of the Bogardus Ironworks. With these decorative",Paragraph
"elements, which suited the Victorian taste of the time, a variety of designs could be",Paragraph
"created. The buildings were assembled by bolted connections, hidden on the inside of",Paragraph
"every element, forming rigid moment connections between columns and beams.",Paragraph
Bogardus was granted a patent for his “building system” in 1850. It did not take long for,Paragraph
"numerous commercial buildings with cast-iron facades to surface, and other founders and",Paragraph
builders created competition. It was also clear that the new technique would not be,Paragraph
confined to New York but instead would spread to every major commercial center in the,Paragraph
"United States. Stove makers, founders of cook pots, and hardware manufacturers soon",Paragraph
entered the field of cast-iron architecture. Part of the attraction of cast iron as a building,Paragraph
material was its fire resistance. Despite Bogardus’s claim that his own factory was made,Paragraph
"entirely out of metal, many cast-iron buildings used a significant amount of timber and",Paragraph
"stone building materials. Many of Bogardus’s own designs, both in Baltimore (1904) and",Paragraph
"in Chicago (1871), were consumed by fire. At the end of the Victorian period, the",Paragraph
material and the associated prefabrication techniques fell out of favor. Despite early,Paragraph
"hopes, they were not fire safe, nor could they resist strong winds, as shown by the",Paragraph
"entirely demolished cast-iron warehouses in Havana, Cuba—destroyed in 1906 by a",Paragraph
hurricane.,Paragraph
Neither fire safety nor resistance against wind is a major concern for reinforced precast,Paragraph
"concrete. With the invention of heavy trucks in the 1930s, reinforced precast concrete",Paragraph
elements could be transported to almost every construction site. The first modern use of,Paragraph
"precast concrete was in the Notre Dame du Haut Cathedral in Raincy, France, by the",Paragraph
architect-engineer Auguste Perret in 1922. The main structural systems of the church still,Caption
"show a largely in situ concrete system, yet the wide use of precast elements for in-fill",Paragraph
walls and partitions led the way for the industry. Such is the case with iron: prefabricated,Paragraph
"structures in concrete can be distinguished as load-bearing elements, such as columns,",Paragraph
"beams, and floor slabs, and in-fill materials and components, such as windows, panels,",Paragraph
"and utility cores. Yet concrete lends itself to a few interesting new techniques, developed",Paragraph
"in the years before World War II and employed in the years after the war, that are",Paragraph
uncommon in any other prefabricated process. The technique of a “lift slab” casts the,Paragraph
"reinforcedconcrete slabs of a multistory building on grade, one over the other, with",Caption
sleeves designed for slab connections to previously erected columns. After the curing,Paragraph
"process is completed, the “stack” of slabs is lifted into place and bonded to the",Paragraph
"connections with the vertical structural member, the column. Volumetric steel forms with",Paragraph
a high degree of precision and built-in heating equipment to accelerate the curing process,Paragraph
can produce U-shaped “tunnel forms” stacked on top of each other. It was mostly,Paragraph
"building types with a high degree of equally sized room cells, such as hotels and",Paragraph
"apartment buildings, that were erected with this method. Advantages to prefabrication",Paragraph
"methods employing concrete are an organized, orderly supply and storage of aggregates",Paragraph
at a different place than the site of erection; a clean construction site; the multiple re-use,Paragraph
of expensive formwork; and the improved surface quality of the finished product. Despite,Paragraph
"these advantages, the prefabrication of entire room cells (or “big boxes”) or ceiling-",Paragraph
"height big panels never caught on in the United States. In Europe, South America, and the",Paragraph
"former Soviet Union, including most of its allies, a significant number of housing",Paragraph
projects were carried out with prefabricated-concrete panels. Notable innovations in the,Paragraph
technique originated in Scandinavia and France and were paralleled by extensive large-,Paragraph
"scale developments in East Germany, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union. Most of the",Paragraph
panel systems in these cases were based on the full wall-size big panels. Despite the large,Paragraph
"number of projects executed, big panels proved to be expensive overall, called for",Paragraph
"multitude of joints that had to be made in the field, and seldom permitted the degree of",Paragraph
prefinishing and shop incorporation of utilities as originally anticipated.,Paragraph
"Today, prefabricated “architectural” precast concrete is widely used in the United",Paragraph
States and worldwide mainly as building components (not as a primary structural,Paragraph
"material), either for enclosure or highly repetitive elements, such as staircases. The",Paragraph
surface quality of architectural precast concrete produced in developed countries is high,Paragraph
compared with the beginnings of the industry. Because of the advantages in thermal,Paragraph
"properties over glass, mainly because of thermal mass inertia, precast concrete for",Paragraph
building envelopes has the chance to become a prime material in times of increased,Paragraph
energy costs.,Paragraph

PRIMITIVISM,Title
"Primitivism is a set of ideas arising in Western Europe during the 18th century, a period",Paragraph
of unprecedented European colonial expansion. Primitivism does not name a group of,Paragraph
"artists or architects or a style arising at a particular moment but, rather, encompasses the",Paragraph
various responses produced by contact between Western and non-Western societies,Paragraph
during the colonial period. It has three primary meanings: a belief in the superiority of a,Paragraph
"simple life close to nature, a belief in the superiority of non-industrial society to that of",Paragraph
"the present, and a valorization of the art and architecture of primitive peoples or primitive",Paragraph
creators. All three definitions indicate that primitivism is a critical attitude toward present,Paragraph
"society, culture, and art and a preference for societies, cultures, and art from simpler",Paragraph
"times, states of evolution, or mentalities. It is also used to indicate the art and architecture",Paragraph
"of primitive peoples or cultures, although this is not a correct usage, as primitivism is a",Paragraph
"phenomenon of Western culture, not the product of “primitive” peoples. The word",Paragraph
primitivism (primitivisme) was used first in France in the 19th century; William Rubin,Paragraph
"traces its appearance to the Nouveau Larousse between 1897 and 1904, meaning",Paragraph
"“imitation of primitives.” The term primitive has a wide range of meanings, including",Paragraph
"original, primeval, little evolved, elemental, natural, naif, characteristic of an early stage",Paragraph
"of development, and produced by a relatively simple people or culture or a self-taught",Paragraph
artist. This term is generally used to designate societies considered to have a lower level,Paragraph
of evolutionary development than Western societies.,Paragraph
"There are two tendencies in primitivism: a search for origins in the classical,",Paragraph
"exemplified by the primitive hut of Enlightenment theories, and the valorization of",Paragraph
"peasant, vernacular, or non-literate culture as a means for producing a more primal art or",Paragraph
architecture. This latter meaning is used extensively in the history of modern art but,Paragraph
"applies to modern architecture as well. In his groundbreaking book of 1938, Primitivism",Paragraph
"in Modern Painting, Robert Goldwater defined “primitivism” as a search among Western",Paragraph
"artists for something below the surface of things—further back in time, psychology, or",Paragraph
"geography—that is simpler and more profound, valuable, or powerful because of its",Paragraph
simplicity. The primitivists assumed that delving beneath the surface would reveal this,Paragraph
"basic quality. This search for simplicity unites the disparate primitivist movements, but",Paragraph
"the nature of “simplicity” varies with the goals of the seeker. Primitive art is usually,",Paragraph
"according to Goldwater, a stimulus or catalyst to modern art, not directly borrowed from",Paragraph
or the direct cause of primitive qualities in that art. The primitive helped Western artists,Paragraph
"and architects formulate their own goals and methods and served as a referent, not a",Paragraph
"direct source. Colin Rhodes, historian of primitivism in modern art, points to an",Paragraph
equivocal issue at the heart of primitivism: although artists used the primitive as a support,Paragraph
"and justification for cultural or social change, their efforts were directed toward change",Paragraph
expected to emerge within the West. There was no question of the comprehensive,Paragraph
"substitution of Western culture, or its unacceptable aspects, by the primitive.",Paragraph
"Enlightenment primitivism was motivated by a search for origins, a “higher” source,",Paragraph
"and a belief in the superiority of a simple life close to nature, exemplified by Montaigne’s",Paragraph
"and Rousseau’s valorization of the savage who lived in a more natural, less corrupt state",Paragraph
"of being. Enlightenment theories of architecture posited a primal architectonic form, the",Paragraph
"primitive hut, from which all forms of architecture derived. The glorification of the",Paragraph
"“noble savage,” as Peter Collins notes, contributed to the 19th-century revivals of Greek",Paragraph
"and Gothic architecture and the valorization of such styles as primitive, pure, and natural.",Paragraph
"In the mid-19th century, artists and architects sought a lost, relatively simple style that",Paragraph
was part of their tradition. This form of primitivism demonstrates a preference for non-,Paragraph
"industrial society to that of the present. A.W.N.Pugin, John Ruskin, and William Morris",Paragraph
shared a distaste and distrust for the mechanization and materialism of the industrial age.,Paragraph
They called for the revival of medieval art and architecture as a way of healing society,Paragraph
"and people, who had become extensions of machines rather than whole beings. Their",Paragraph
"theories stimulated the Gothic Revival, illustrated by Charles Barry and Pugin’s Houses",Paragraph
of Parliament (1836-51) in London and the Arts and Crafts movement. The Mission,Paragraph
Revival in the United States merged Arts and Crafts sensibility with a primitivist vision,Paragraph
"of early California under the Spanish missionaries (Charles Lummis, El Alisal, Los",Caption
"Angeles, begun 1898).",Paragraph
"In the 19th century, the search for primitive origins converged with Darwinism and the",Paragraph
“discovery” of primitive civilizations by Western colonizing powers to produce a,Paragraph
"hierarchy of races and cultures, with Europe and the United States at the apex.",Paragraph
"Colonization was justified, in part, by reference to the crude technology and material",Paragraph
"culture of the colonized peoples, seen as a sign of their innate evolutionary inferiority.",Paragraph
"Certain figures, such as Paul Gauguin, resisted the characterization of non-European",Paragraph
"culture as inferior; instead, they championed primitive cultures as an alternative to the",Paragraph
overcivilized art and intellect of Western society. Primitivist artists appreciated archaic,Paragraph
"and non-Western styles for their sincerity, vigor, and expressive power, qualities that",Paragraph
these artists and architects missed in the official art of their day. Whereas bourgeois,Paragraph
"society prized the virtuosity and finesse of academic realism and classicism, some artists",Paragraph
and architects began to value the simple and naif and even the crude and raw. Primitivism,Paragraph
"in this sense is a comparative concept, a theory of difference, and an implicit challenge to",Paragraph
"the assumption that Western culture was superior to the primitive. The Greene brothers,",Paragraph
"for example, emulated Japanese architecture in their Gamble House (1908) in Pasadena,",Paragraph
California. They took the craftsmanship of the Eastlake and Craftsman styles and,Paragraph
combined them with Japanese influences to create a freer attitude toward the organization,Paragraph
"of spaces and an integrated system of woodwork, stained glass, and custom furniture.",Paragraph
"Frank Lloyd Wright drew on Japanese and Mayan architecture, recreations of which he",Paragraph
saw at the World’s Columbian Exhibition of 1893 in Chicago. The effect of Japanese,Paragraph
"architecture asserted itself in the horizontal lines, unpainted wood, and delicate colors of",Paragraph
"Wright’s Prairie-style work. In his concrete, textile block houses of the 1920s, such as La",Paragraph
"Miniatura (1923) in Pasadena, Wright may have been inspired by Mayan sculpture and",Paragraph
massing.,Paragraph
"Art Nouveau, Jugendstil, or Style Liberty was heavily influenced by primitive sources.",Paragraph
"The “new art,” which flourished from about 1893 to 1905, was so called because it",Paragraph
"rejected historical precedent, academic regulation, and static convention. Art Nouveau",Paragraph
borrowed from Japanese decorative art and Mycenaean art and was motivated by a,Paragraph
"primitivist intent to create a more direct, less refined art by means of light, sinuous",Paragraph
"ormmament and materials. Victor Horta, in Belgium, combined the emphasis on structure of",Paragraph
"the Gothic Revival, new materials such as iron and plate glass, and the inspiration of",Paragraph
natural forms from the Arts and Crafts. Horta’s first important Art Nouveau work was the,Paragraph
"Tassel House (1892-93) in Brussels, in which the twisting iron columns and ornament",Paragraph
united with painted decoration to create a total environment of serpentine forms. He used,Paragraph
iron without stone cladding along with materials and vocabulary derived from industrial,Paragraph
"and public buildings, such as railway stations.",Paragraph
"By this time, according to Goldwater, the search for beginnings had shifted from",Paragraph
cultural to physical-emotional and became a search for “lower” rather than “higher”,Paragraph
"origins. In the 20th century, exotic, indigenous arts and those made by children and",Paragraph
madmen were valued for expressing emotional intensity. Expressionism exhibits this,Paragraph
tendency toward emotional primitivism. Expressionist architects in the Netherlands and,Paragraph
"Germany, such as Michel de Klerk (Eigen Haard, 1917-20, in Amsterdam) and Hans",Paragraph
"Poelzig (Chemical factory, 1911-12, in Luban), explored highly individualistic,",Paragraph
expressive form. Modern architects looked to the primitive as a source of artistic and,Paragraph
architectural stimulus that was not regulated by the norms of European civilization and,Paragraph
that would provide the means for a more primal architecture. Bruno Taut wrote several,Paragraph
"visionary books in the 1910s and 1920s, including Stadtkrone (1919), in which he",Paragraph
"imagined agrarian, craft-based settlements reminiscent of Morris’s vision of medieval",Paragraph
"society. Each city had a crystalline “city crown” (Stadtkrone), a religious and spiritual",Paragraph
"center, designed in pyramidal form like a Gothic cathedral, that acted as a symbol of the",Paragraph
"community spirit uniting the city’s dwellers. The Bauhaus was, at its foundation, based",Paragraph
on similar utopian ideals of community and the cooperation of all the arts under,Paragraph
"architecture. It was a social project for the future, realized through educating a new guild",Paragraph
"of craftsmen. Architecture would be the one unifying element in society, according to the",Paragraph
ideals of the Bauhaus founders. They chose to emulate the Gothic cathedral because all,Paragraph
the people of the cathedral towns had participated in building these monuments and,Paragraph
"because they unified sculpture, painting, weaving, and the other arts within one structure.",Paragraph
"The Glass Chain participants—Walter Gropius, Bruno and Max Taut, the Luckhardt",Paragraph
"brothers, Hans Scharoun, and others—explored free, unconscious form, an extension of",Paragraph
"utopian Expressionism, as an alternative to rational, machine-based design.",Paragraph
Le Corbusier passed through the three types of primitivism during his career. His early,Paragraph
"work in La Chaux-de-Fonds was part of a regional Arts and Crafts movement, creating",Paragraph
"design founded on natural forms and vernacular buildings (Villa Stotzer, 1907). After his",Paragraph
"Voyage d’Orient (1911), Le Corbusier became a staunch advocate of universal, classical",Paragraph
"language, translated into the undecorated, machine vocabulary that he believed was",Paragraph
"appropriate for the times (Villa Savoye, 1929, in Poissy). In his later work, he employed",Paragraph
"vernacular types and emphasized less finished materials, such as brick arches and stone",Paragraph
"(Maisons Jaoul, 1954-56, in Neuilly). This “peasantism” influenced younger architects,",Paragraph
especially members of Team X and the New Brutalists in Britain.,Paragraph
"In the post-World War Il period, there was a shift toward a universalizing view of",Paragraph
"humanity: the Family of Man. The earlier emotional primitivism continued, manifested in",Paragraph
"psychosocial references to primal qualities, such as shelter, enclosure, and place. Bernard",Paragraph
Rudofsky’s Architecture without Architects (1964) devalued professional training and,Paragraph
"“designed” form in favor of organic, natural architecture produced by indigenous peoples",Paragraph
"in non-industrialized countries. The New Brutalism, which took its name from Dubuffet’s",Paragraph
"art brut, attempted to create a simpler, more immediate architecture that expressed a new",Paragraph
aesthetic of coarseness and the primitive. Allison and Peter Smithson’s proposal for,Paragraph
"Golden Lane housing (1952) in London was illustrated with images of Greek islands,",Paragraph
"working-class backyards, Casbahs, and other dwellings expressive of a place and a way",Paragraph
of life. Dutch architect Aldo van Eyck referred to the settlements of the Dogon in Africa,Paragraph
and the Pueblos in the southwestern United States to create a more socially responsive,Paragraph
"architecture, as in his Orphanage (1957-62) in Amsterdam. In Italy the firm BBPR",Paragraph
"revived elements of the medieval palazzo tower in the Torre Velasco (1956—58) in Milan,",Paragraph
rendered in concrete. Bruce Goff used an extravagant naturalism in the Bavinger House,Caption
"(1950) in Norman, Oklahoma, as Dell Upton notes, that connects to a wider anti-artificial",Paragraph
"primitivism. Upton links American primitivism to European trends, with the difference",Paragraph
being that the noble savage was the Indian in American mythology.,Paragraph
Postmodernism contains primitivism as a return to highclassical origins and a search,Paragraph
for “low” origins in vernacular or popular sources. The rigorous classicism of Quinlan,Paragraph
"Terry, for example, revived a universal, timeless classical language; by contrast, Charles",Paragraph
Moore employed forms derived from such vernacular sources as northern California,Paragraph

"constructions of southern California—lifeguard stations, chain-link fences, plywood",Caption
"walls, and strip-mall stucco (Gehry House, 1977 and 1992, Santa Monica)—exhibits a",Paragraph
primitivism of low building sources.,Paragraph
The issue of “primitivism” in Third World countries challenges its definition as a,Paragraph
"purely Western phenomenon. Work by Western-trained architects such as Hassan Fathy,",Paragraph
"Luis Barragan, Balkrishna Doshi, and Geoffrey Bawa combines local materials and",Paragraph
traditional building forms with modern programs and systems. This postcolonial,Paragraph
architecture confounds the hierarchies and patronizing attitude established by social,Paragraph
"Darwinism, imperialism, and primitivism. Instead of a search for origins in a distant time,",Paragraph
"place, or culture, these architects produce hybrids of modernism and indigenous forms",Paragraph
responsive to particular local conditions. The classical primitive hut has been abandoned,Paragraph
in favor of other traditions.,Paragraph

"over the years. For most of the 20th century, the construction of prisons was a healthy",Paragraph
"industry but had relatively little to offer to, or gain from, the architectural imagination.",Paragraph
One of the key principles in the development of modern prison architecture was the,Paragraph
attempt to render imprisonment in itself neutral. Other than the deprivation of liberty for,Paragraph
"a certain length of time according to the offense, the prisoner was, at least theoretically,",Paragraph
to suffer no other punishment. This generated a new need for self-contained buildings,Paragraph
that could provide for a relatively complete range of human needs and behaviors. The cell,Paragraph

cells open toward a shuttered surveillance tower in the center. Although strict copies of,Paragraph
"this project were rare, such ideal geometries of surveillance were taken up in a significant",Paragraph
"number of projects, built and unbuilt, that followed.",Paragraph
Early debates over round-the-clock confinement led to reformers’ taking sides between,Paragraph
the “Pennsylvania” and “Auburn” systems. The former and more radical of the two had,Paragraph
"been developed from the 1780s by Quaker reformers, finding its definitive statement in",Paragraph
"William Haviland’s Eastern State Penitentiary, opened in Philadelphia in 1829. Each cell,",Paragraph
"arranged in double-loaded cell blocks radiating from a central hub, was equipped with",Paragraph
"complete furnishings for solitary life and work, including a small individual courtyard.",Caption
"Although developed in the United States, the system was much more widely adopted in",Paragraph
"Europe. The Auburn system, named after a New York State prison completed in 1816",Paragraph
"(W.Britten and J.Cray), provided a combination of individual cells for sleeping and",Paragraph
spaces for collective—but silent—work by day. Perhaps because it was less expensive to,Paragraph
"operate, it became the norm in the United States for the next century and a half, and",Paragraph
elements of the system are still embraced all over the world. The architecture of the,Paragraph
"Auburn-style prison placed cells back to back in long, rectangular volumes, separated by",Paragraph
"a galleried surveillance space from the exterior wall. The main cell block at Alcatraz,",Caption
"completed in 1912 (and now part of a popular national park site), is an example of this",Paragraph
"approach, which quickly took advantage of advances in reinforced-concrete and steel",Paragraph
"technology. Here, cells could be smaller and simpler than under the Pennsylvania system,",Paragraph
as they were to be used only for sleeping.,Paragraph
The first decades of the 20th century essentially prolonged the 19th century’s debate,Paragraph
"over solitary confinement and its variants. The cell remained the heart of the system, and",Paragraph
"it continued to be designed as a single-occupancy space, even though population",Paragraph
pressures were such that very few remained so for long. After the radial plans associated,Paragraph
"with the Pennsylvania system, the barracks-like rectilinear arrangements of the Auburn",Paragraph
"system, and a few experiments with courtyard and Panopticon-type cylindrical",Paragraph
"arrangements, all of which had been explored in the 19th century, the 20th century began",Paragraph

"principle, first seen at Fresnes Prison (1898, F.-H.Poussin) near Paris, was the",Paragraph
symmetrical distribution of rectilinear cell blocks along a covered security corridor—the,Paragraph
"“pole” of the arrangement. This arrangement, like radial plans, put an emphasis on",Paragraph
efficient and secure circulation but without the difficulties linked to the use of the,Paragraph
triangular outdoor spaces left over.,Paragraph
"Beginning in the 1920s and continuing to the present, some city jails on limited sites",Paragraph
"have been built as high-rise buildings, although these pose special security problems. Not",Paragraph
"long after, on the eve of World War I, some minimum-security prisons began to be",Paragraph
"conceived according to a so-called campus or open arrangement, where buildings",Paragraph

PRUITT IGOE HOUSING,Title
"Designed by Minoru Yamasaki; completed 1954-76 St. Louis, Missouri",Caption
Pruitt-[goe was an early and important post-World War II public housing project. Built,Paragraph
"on the near north side of St. Louis as part of a massive urban-renewal program, Pruitt-",Paragraph
Igoe was one of the largest public housing complexes in the United States. With 33,Paragraph
"buildings rising through 11 stories and towering over 57 acres of the city, it was hailed in",Paragraph
the early 1950s as an innovative application of modernist design principles to the,Paragraph
"problem of chronic urban-housing shortages. At its peak, it housed some 14,000 people in",Paragraph
"2870 apartments. Yet by the early 1970s, the project was crumbling and nearly derelict,",Paragraph
"its residents plagued by crime, isolation, and persistent poverty. Pruitt-lgoe was not only",Paragraph
the worst housing project in the city but also one of the most glaring failures of federal,Paragraph
"housing provision in U.S. history. For many architects, planners, and critics, the",Paragraph
demolition of three Pruitt-[goe buildings in 1972 symbolizes the death of architectural,Paragraph
modernism.,Paragraph
Pruitt-Igoe emerged as one piece in a larger postwar urbanrenewal program. As with,Paragraph
"most northern and midwestern cities, World War II had taken a toll on St. Louis, as large",Paragraph
numbers of southern black and white migrants streamed into already dense inner-core,Paragraph
neighborhoods in search of industrial work. Returning soldiers and their burgeoning,Paragraph
families further exacerbated a widespread strain on housing and municipal services. To,Paragraph
"provide cities with the legal and fiscal tools to cope with deepening urban problems,",Paragraph
"Congress passed the 1949 Housing Act, which enabled municipalities to create",Paragraph
redevelopment authorities with broad powers to assemble land parcels for clearance and,Paragraph
"“urban renewal.” The St. Louis urban-renewal program, overseen by veteran city",Paragraph
"engineer Harland Bartholomew, made full use of the federal provisions. Bartholomew",Paragraph
"and his protégé, Charles Farris, working for a succession of Democratic-machine mayors,",Paragraph
undertook an unprecedented transformation of St. Louis through a program of slum,Paragraph
"clearance, zoning application, expressway construction, and public housing development.",Paragraph
"As prerequisites for improving their city, planners and politicians viewed the",Paragraph
eradication of blighted neighborhoods and the reorganization of the urban landscape into,Paragraph
"modern, efficient land uses. Thus, the St. Louis public housing program developed both",Paragraph
as a catchment system for urban residents displaced through slum clearance and as a way,Paragraph
to funnel federal largesse into a visible showcase of modern municipal action. In 1950 the,Paragraph
city was ready to translate this “city-efficient” vision into reality with federal backing for,Paragraph
5800 units of public housing. Disposed toward large-scale project design and,Paragraph
"development, Bartholomew and then-Mayor Joseph Darst allocated nearly half of these",Paragraph
units to one public housing development: Pruitt-Igoe.,Paragraph
"Designed by Minoru Yamasaki of Hellmuth, Yamasaki, and Leinweber, the Pruitt-lgoe",Paragraph
plan called for a Le Corbusier-like “ville radieuse” of garden apartments and high-rise,Paragraph
edifices interspersed with broad tree-lined and landscaped plazas. Innovative skip-stop,Paragraph
"elevators would open onto every third floor, enabling a broad gallery to stretch for 85 feet",Paragraph
"across the front of the building. Not only would the skip-stop elevators reduce costs,",Paragraph
"architects argued, but the galleries would provide space for “vertical neighborhoods” to",Paragraph
"replace the streets and sidewalks of the low-rise city. Here, above the noise and",Paragraph
"congestion of the old neighborhoods, children could play, and adults could gather without",Paragraph
fear for their safety.,Paragraph
"In an attempt to ameliorate both white residents and segregationist political interests,",Paragraph
the project was divided on the drawing board into racially distinct clusters. Officials,Paragraph
designated the Wendell Olliver Pruitt Homes for black families and the James Igoe,Caption
"Apartments for white families. However, Pruitt-lgoe was completed in 1954, in the wake",Paragraph
"of the Brown vs. Board of Education decision, and the project had to be integrated on",Paragraph
"settlement. As a result, most white families dropped off the rolls, leaving the project",Paragraph
desegregated by law while segregated in fact.,Paragraph
"Meanwhile, federal cost-cutting measures eliminated many of the best features of",Paragraph
"Yamasaki’s design, such as scattered lowrise units, landscaping, playgrounds, and",Paragraph
"recreation facilities, while increasing the density from 30 to 50 units per acre. Federal",Paragraph
officials also insisted on the elimination of ground-floor bathrooms and most recreational,Paragraph
"facilities. With little foresight, they ordered an increase in the number of two-bedroom",Paragraph
"apartments at the expense of spaces for larger families, which led to overcrowding and",Paragraph
structural strain.,Paragraph
"Despite these problems, most families that initially settled the project regarded their",Paragraph
move into Pruitt-[goe as an improvement in their housing conditions. Many enjoyed,Paragraph
"indoor toilets and laundry facilities for the first time, and the project did eventually boast",Paragraph
"a number of amenities, including a playground, recreation center, public library branch,",Paragraph
"Boy Scout troop, day care center, and health clinic. Families managed to carve out new",Paragraph
networks within the project and to raise children amid difficult circumstances. Many,Paragraph
residents were involved in tenant organizing and civil rights campaigns through the,Paragraph
"1960s. Today, many former residents remember Pruitt-I[goe not simply as the desolate",Paragraph
landscape of media and scholarly accounts but as home—the place where they grew up,Paragraph
and where they experienced many important life events.,Paragraph
Statistics collected by the St. Louis Housing Authority show that Pruitt-Igoe residents,Paragraph
were similar in nearly all respects to residents of other public housing projects—at least,Paragraph
"in the first five years. Over time, however, they came to differ in one crucial respect: the",Paragraph
high percentage of female-headed households. Many better-off families left the project,Paragraph
for market-rate housing in the increasingly depopulated neighborhoods around the,Paragraph
"project, creating an irreversible occupancy crisis. The Housing Authority tried to",Paragraph
"maintain occupancy by filling Pruitt-lgoe with very poor, single-parent, female-headed",Paragraph
"families. The relative absence of black male adult residents, sociologists have argued, left",Paragraph
women and children more vulnerable to crimes of property and violence. By the mid-,Paragraph
"1960s, Pruitt-[goe was regarded as the most dangerous public housing project in the city.",Paragraph
"Firefighters routinely refused to answer alarm calls, and mail carriers and other service",Paragraph
agents avoided the project. A series of highly publicized murders and snipings sealed the,Paragraph
project’s fate as a symbol of inner-city urban decay and crime.,Paragraph

physical structure of Pruitt-lgoe deteriorated as well. Shoddy construction had already,Paragraph

Numerous attempts were made in the mid- to late 1960s to improve the project. Pruitt-,Paragraph
Igoe happened to exist in a city with a renowned collection of urban sociologists and,Paragraph
political scientists who were loosely connected through Washington University’s Urban,Paragraph
"Research Institute and Social Sciences Institute. Scholars such as Alvin Gouldner,",Paragraph
"Eugene Mechan, Roger Montgomery, Lee Rainwater, George Wendel, and William",Title
Yancey lent their talents to the study of Pruitt-lgoe and to the implementation of,Paragraph
"intervention strategies. The project was part of a Model Cities target area, and a variety of",Paragraph
urban poverty programs and tenant control strategies came and went in an effort to,Paragraph
reverse the decline. Pruitt-Igoe tenants themselves joined other public housing residents,Paragraph
in a citywide rent strike that drew national attention to their plight. The strike dramatized,Paragraph
the physical and mental stress of life in the projects and called attention to the civil rights,Paragraph
and social justice issues involved.,Paragraph
Yet no interventions proved successful in the long term. By 1972 Pruitt-Igoe had,Paragraph
become such an embarrassment to the city government and the Housing Authority that,Paragraph
they decided to demolish it. Even the residents themselves were divided over the fate of,Paragraph
"the project: some favored partial demolition, whereas others favored low-rise retrofitting.",Paragraph
"Between 1972 and 1976, however, the project was detonated, leaving a 57-acre empty lot",Paragraph
in the middle of the city. Aside from a small elementary school built on the southwest,Paragraph
"corner in 1992, the site remains empty.",Paragraph
"Over the years, scholars and critics have grappled with the causes of the project’s",Paragraph
failure. Architectural critics generally hold that design is at the heart of the matter. Oscar,Paragraph
Newman’s widely read manifesto Defensible Space argues that high-rise public housing,Paragraph
projects such as Pruitt-Igoe fail because they preclude spatial regulation and defense by,Paragraph
"tenants, leaving them vulnerable to crime. Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter argue in Collage",Paragraph
City that the spatial organization of Le Corbusier-influenced landscapes reveals a deep-,Paragraph
seated authoritarian impulse toward social engineering inherent in modernist design. Both,Paragraph
Charles Jencks (The Language of Post-Modern Architecture) and Peter Blake (Form,Paragraph
Follows Fiasco) use Pruitt-lgoe as a metaphor for the failure of modernist architecture.,Paragraph
Jencks argues that the modern design idiom abolishes history and ignores the contexts of,Paragraph
place—attributes that had long governed architectural practice. Blake presses Pruitt-lgoe,Paragraph
into a broad attack on CLAM (Congrés Internationaux d’Architecture Moderne) design,Paragraph
"principles, arguing that they result in sterile, inhuman environments. Each of these critics",Paragraph
"regard the 1972 detonations as a clarion call for a new era of architecture, one sensitive",Paragraph
both to the weight of history and to the contingencies of local environments.,Paragraph
"Social scientists, on the other hand, hold that Pruitt-Igoe’s failure has less to do with",Paragraph
design and more to do with structural conditions of racism and poverty. Lee Rainwater’s,Paragraph
"now classic Behind Ghetto Walls, derived from lengthy interviews with Pruitt-lgoe",Paragraph
"residents in the mid-1960s, demonstrates that racial segregation, joblessness, and chronic",Paragraph
poverty result in socio-economic isolation and anomie among public housing residents.,Paragraph
Eugene Meehan’s definitive policy analysis The Quality of Federal Policy Making holds,Paragraph
that public housing was doomed to failure from the outset because it never addressed the,Paragraph
"root causes of poverty and inadequate housing. Rather, the provision of public housing",Paragraph
"was always an ambivalent goal, hamstrung by fiscal austerity and lack of commitment.",Paragraph
Roger Montgomery’s concise article “Pruitt-I[goe: Policy Failure or Societal Symptom?”,Paragraph
shows how problems endemic to the St. Louis housing market led to the decline of the,Paragraph
city’s public housing program. He rejects the prevalent view among politicians and,Paragraph
"journalists that Pruitt-lgoe failed because of inadequate design or liberal welfare policies,",Paragraph
"arguing instead that the project unraveled because of declining land values, increased",Paragraph
"housing options in neighborhoods depopulated by “white flight,” persistent racism, and",Paragraph
inner-city poverty.,Paragraph
More recent research by historians and urban analysts supports this latter view.,Paragraph
"Although design was clearly a factor in the decline of Pruitt-lgoe, scholars such as Mary",Paragraph
"Comerio and Kate Bristol demonstrate that it was not the cause. In fact, Bristol argues",Paragraph
that the decline-by-design thesis is a rhetorical strategy common among architects and,Paragraph
"critics, one that serves to bolster the power of the profession by inflating the role that",Paragraph
"architects actually play in housing policy. Architects, Bristol argues, deceive themselves",Paragraph
with their own rhetoric because they fail to grasp the basic fact that design cannot by,Paragraph
"itself compensate for drastic social inequalities. Moreover, Pruitt-Igoe itself was never",Paragraph
"the example of modernist hubris that its critics claim. Contrary to standard memory,",Paragraph
"Pruitt-lgoe won no architectural awards, and its own designers were critical of the high-",Paragraph
rise form as a strategy for mass housing. Their designs were merely constrained by,Paragraph
"criteria dictated in advance by the Housing Authority, which favored high-rise, high-",Paragraph
density public housing.,Paragraph
Mary Comerio’s research takes the onus off design and places Pruitt-I[goe’s failure,Paragraph
"within the broader historical context of urban renewal and redevelopment, industrial",Paragraph
"relocation and economic restructuring, “white flight,” and the dwindling urban tax base.",Paragraph
"Pruitt-Igoe, she argues, and the larger public housing program in the United States were",Paragraph
"caught up in entrenched historical processes over which architects—and even, to an",Paragraph
"extent, planners and municipal officials—had little control. Moreover, treating public",Paragraph
housing as an issue of design obscures the social realities of race and class in urban,Paragraph
environments and distracts critics from the deeper political and economic structures,Paragraph
within which designers and planners operate.,Paragraph
"In the end, Pruitt-I[goe reflects a federal capital investment of $50 million, a relatively",Paragraph
small portion of the postwar federal housing chest. Tens of thousands of people found,Paragraph
"themselves directly involved with the project, whether as designers, planners, politicians,",Paragraph
"builders, residents, social workers, librarians, or police. This is a small number when",Paragraph
compared with the tens of millions of Americans affected by the federal underwriting of,Paragraph

"most housing is, in fact, subsidized with public funds. This is so because its cost to",Paragraph
"private owners is lowered by national, state, and local governments through tax",Paragraph
"expenditures (for example, the deduction of mortgage interest and property tax from",Paragraph
"personal taxable income, amounting to more than $65 billion annually) and the provision",Paragraph
"of public infrastructure (such as roads), among other subsidies. Indirect subsidies of this",Paragraph
"type are not tenure neutral (they benefit owners much more than renters}, and they are",Paragraph
also highly regressive (they benefit households with high incomes much more than those,Paragraph
with low incomes).,Paragraph
These distinctions and their implications are highly significant in the debates that help,Paragraph
"shape housing policies and programs in the United States and elsewhere. However, it is",Paragraph
not possible here to engage the full scope of this discussion. This brief article focuses,Paragraph
"mainly on U.S. public housing in the more conventional, narrower definition.",Paragraph
Historical Background,Title
"Public housing is a means-tested, non-cash transfer program. Only households with",Paragraph
"incomes below specified levels are eligible. At present, they pay 30 percent of income for",Paragraph
"rent. Initially authorized by the (Wagner Steagall) Housing Act of 1937, public housing",Paragraph
in the United States was meant to house families who were temporarily poor as a result of,Paragraph
"the economic depression. Its establishment came after a hard-fought, lengthy battle in",Paragraph
"which the National Association for Real Estate Boards, the U.S. Savings and Loans",Paragraph
"League, and the U.S. Mortgage Bankers Association opposed “socialist” government",Paragraph
intervention in the housing market. The compromise that was reached has been seen by,Paragraph
many as more an effort to boost the construction industry and reduce unemployment than,Paragraph
to provide affordable housing.,Paragraph
"After World War I, the Housing Act of 1949 declared the goal of “a decent home and",Paragraph
suitable living environment for every American family.” It called for the construction of,Paragraph
"810,000 public housing units in six years. However, production fell far short, and private",Paragraph
commercial interests succeeded in appropriating funds that had been tied to residential,Paragraph
"redevelopment. In the following decades, the U.S. commitment to public housing steadily",Paragraph
"declined, and in January 1973 President Richard Nixon imposed a moratorium on all",Paragraph
federal housing assistance. The moratorium was lifted the following year with the,Paragraph
enactment of legislation oriented to demand-side subsidies.,Paragraph
Subsequent significant changes in housing policy included a shift away from large,Paragraph
"projects (scattered-site approach), a trend toward privatization (e.g. in management and",Paragraph
"sale of units), and especially an increased use of the existing housing stock through a",Paragraph
"system of allowances and vouchers that reduced the cost of housing to tenants. Today,",Paragraph
"few new units are built. The total number of public housing units is, in fact, declining at",Paragraph
"present, as large problem projects are being torn down and replaced by higher-quality",Paragraph
redevelopments built at lower densities.,Paragraph
Profile and International Scope,Title
"Public housing in the United States provides homes to about 3.3 million people,",Paragraph
accounting for about 1.5 percent of all occupied dwelling units. The percentage is also,Paragraph
relatively low in other countries that have traditionally relied heavily on the private-sector,Paragraph
"supply to meet housing demand: Australia (6 percent), New Zealand (5 percent), and",Paragraph
"Canada (5.5 percent), to name three. In Japan, which has also favored a minimal role for",Paragraph
"government in housing provision, public housing for low-income households similarly",Paragraph
constitutes 5 percent of the total stock. These figures contrast sharply with those in,Paragraph
regions where national government has played an active role in creating a relatively large,Paragraph
"postwar social housing sector, such as Israel (13 percent), France (18 percent), Germany",Paragraph
"(20 percent), Denmark (24 percent), Britain (31 percent), Sweden (36 percent), The",Paragraph
"Netherlands (45 percent), Hong Kong (50 percent}, and Singapore (86 percent).",Paragraph
"Privatization trends have more recently resulted in a decline of some of these figures,",Paragraph
although they remain high in comparison. Countries in Eastern Europe and Russia have,Paragraph
"long had a very large housing sector controlled by the central state. During the 1990s,",Paragraph
their economies underwent a process of transformation oriented to a more market-based,Paragraph
"organization of society. Nonetheless, at the end of the 20th century, after significant sell-",Paragraph
"offs to tenants against nominal prices, diminished but still significant public housing",Paragraph
"stocks remained in, for example, Russia (49 percent), Poland (25 percent), and Hungary",Paragraph
(13 percent).,Paragraph
"In the United States, the popular image of public housing conjures up mass-produced",Paragraph
high-rises and superblocks built at high densities with low-quality construction materials,Paragraph
"according to bad designs and situated in undesirable locations. Undeniably, many",Paragraph
projects fit that description. The Department of Housing and Urban Development,Paragraph
"estimates that about 100,000 units are “severely distressed,” that is, physically",Paragraph
"deteriorated and with high vacancy and unemployment rates. However, such units",Paragraph
"constitute a minority of public housing, concentrated in a few large cities, and they are",Paragraph
"not representative. In fact, the largest proportion of public housing developments in the",Paragraph
"United States, 38 percent, comprises two- or three-story walk-ups; 34 percent are single-",Paragraph
family attached or detached dwellings. Only 28 percent consist of buildings of four or,Paragraph
"more stories, a share that is dwindling under the HOPE VI program. Public housing in the",Paragraph
"United States includes many examples of fine designs, and some of the most recent",Paragraph
developments incorporate design concepts strikingly similar to some of the earliest public,Paragraph
housing in the country.,Paragraph
"Initially, U.S. public housing was intended as temporary housing for poor households",Paragraph
"expected to work their way up to private-market housing. However, increasingly it",Paragraph
"became a last resort for people with no prospects for other housing options. As a result,",Paragraph
"over time, public housing has become residualized. Many residents are dependent on",Paragraph
welfare (over 50 percent} and social security or disability payments (25 percent). About,Paragraph
"75 percent of households are headed by a single adult, usually an elderly person or a",Paragraph
single parent. A majority are nonwhite.,Paragraph
"In western and northern Europe after World War Il, many governments embarked on",Paragraph
large-scale housing programs to meet pent-up demand and make up for housing stock,Paragraph
destroyed in the war. More than 5 million units were built. Most of this construction,Paragraph
"occurred in the form of high-rises built on peripherally located estates. By the mid-1970s,",Paragraph
the absolute shortages had been eliminated. Demand fell. Households with rising incomes,Paragraph
"moved out, leaving behind those without choice. Vacancies rose, revenues declined, and",Paragraph
"conditions quickly deteriorated. Since then, local authorities and nonprofit landlords,",Paragraph
"oriented to providing and managing social housing, have increasingly faced social",Paragraph
"welfare challenges engendered by economic, political, and demographic trends in the",Paragraph
larger society.,Paragraph
"In eastern Europe, national governments controlled property rights and financial",Paragraph
resources. Central planning produced a mass-housing sector owned and operated by state,Paragraph
agencies and state-run industries. Large estates comprising prefabricated dwelling units,Paragraph
in multistory buildings became home to 170 million people. Access to housing was a,Paragraph
"legislated entitlement, and since wages were low, households spent only a small",Paragraph
proportion of their income on rent (often around 3 percent). Limited rent revenues and,Paragraph
"subsidies insufficient for operating and maintenance needs, often combined with low-",Paragraph
"quality building materials and fast construction, caused the housing to fall into disrepair",Paragraph
quickly. Responsibilities for upkeep and repair became a salient issue in the transition of,Paragraph
the former state socialist systems into more market-oriented societies.,Paragraph
"In the developing countries, with a few exceptions, public housing has constituted only",Paragraph
"a minute portion of housing production. Typically, self-help and other informal processes",Paragraph
of housing provision have been much more important. Insofar as scarce resources were,Paragraph
"used for the building of public housing, the beneficiaries have usually been civil servants",Paragraph
rather than the poorest segments of the population. Current efforts are generally directed,Paragraph
"toward enabling housing markets to work, although it remains to be seen whether this",Paragraph
approach will extend access to housing to the lowest-income groups.,Paragraph
Design in Context,Title
"In terms of architecture and project layout, there have been three stages in the evolution",Paragraph
"of public housing in the United States. In the 1930s and the early 1940s, semienclosed",Paragraph
"courts with walk-up buildings dominated, aligned with the streets but with entries usually",Paragraph
from the interior of the site. Open areas between lines of row houses or walk-ups or,Paragraph
around widely spaced elevator high-rises placed at an angle to the street or in closed,Paragraph
streets were more characteristic of projects built from the 1940s through the 1960s. From,Paragraph
"the late 1970s onward, public housing designs more typically include private yards and",Paragraph
semi- or fully enclosed courts for row houses and low-rises with entrances reoriented to,Paragraph
front the streets. The different designs have been seen as the enactment of prevailing,Paragraph
belief systems concerning the place of public housing and its residents in the surrounding,Paragraph
community and society at large.,Paragraph
"Illustrative of the broader context of design is the Pruitt-lgoe project in St. Louis,",Paragraph
which opened its doors to the first tenants in the early 1950s amid high praise for its,Paragraph
"design. When it was dynamited scarcely 20 years later, many critics decried design",Paragraph
"features, such as the lack of semipublic space and the mismatch between the social and",Paragraph
"physical environment (for example, large families in high-rise apartments), attributing to",Paragraph
"them the project’s failure. Others, however, have downplayed the significance of design",Paragraph
"in the demise of Pruitt-[goe and similar projects, instead emphasizing the role of",Paragraph
insufficient budgets and discriminatory policies.,Paragraph
Current Approaches,Title
Public housing remains a valuable resource. It is home to millions of households who,Paragraph
cannot afford market housing. Maintaining this resource requires that extant challenges,Paragraph
"be effectively met. Current approaches fall into two categories. The first is tenant based,",Paragraph
primarily under the Section 8 program. It seeks to ameliorate the concentration of poverty,Paragraph
"by portable subsidies, such as vouchers and allowances, aimed at increasing household",Paragraph
"mobility, and sometimes provides additional supports, such as job training. The second,",Paragraph
"area-based, supply-side approach focuses on the housing estates themselves in an attempt",Paragraph
to address problems in a comprehensive manner. The latter approach is multipronged,Paragraph
"(incorporating more accountable forms of management, providing programs and services",Paragraph
"in support of resident needs, attracting mixed-income tenant populations, and carrying",Paragraph
out research-based design) and seeks to avoid past mistakes that led to higher rates of,Paragraph
vandalism and crime. HOPE VI funding has stimulated improved architecture and site,Paragraph
planning to foster neighborly interactions and promote safety (crime prevention through,Paragraph
"environmental design). In addition, examples are growing of public housing that",Paragraph
integrates programs to assist residents in becoming economically more self-reliant (for,Paragraph
"example, Project Self-Sufficiency) and that provides services that facilitate independent",Paragraph
functioning (such as Section 202).,Paragraph
"The problems facing U.S. public housing—problems of design, siting, maintenance,",Paragraph
and population composition—are often attributable to oppositional economic and,Paragraph
political forces rather than to causes inherent in the public subsidy of housing. Smaller,Paragraph
schemes that use individual street addresses rather than project names and that are woven,Paragraph
into the fabric of the surrounding community by integrating services and mixing different,Paragraph
income groups will make public housing less distinguishable from private housing.,Paragraph
"Indeed, evidence links the emergence of successful public housing to the dissolution of",Paragraph
its standout image and to its being an integral part of a comprehensive approach to,Paragraph
housing.,Paragraph

"PUIG I CADAFALCH, JOSEP 1867-1956",Caption
"Architect, Catalonia",Title
Josep Puig i Cadafalch was one of the leading architects of the modernisme movement,Paragraph
that flourished in the Spanish region of Catalonia during the first decades of the 20th,Paragraph
"century. In many ways, Puig moved elegantly between the organic extravagance of",Paragraph
modernisme and the ordered geometry of novecentismo. This was in part because of the,Paragraph
fact that he was much younger than Antoni Gaudi i Cornet and Lluis Doménech i,Paragraph
"Montaner, the leading architects of the first movement, and somewhat older than the next",Paragraph
"generation. Puig drew inspiration from 15th-century Catalan Gothic architecture, a style",Paragraph
that was decidedly different from classic High Gothic. Despite his almost religious zeal,Paragraph
"for regional historical traditions, he also looked outside Spain for inspiration. Puig",Paragraph
"traveled widely throughout Europe, especially Germany and Austria, and wrote",Paragraph
"approvingly of the work of Henry-Clement Van de Velde, Josef Maria Olbrich, and Otto",Paragraph
Wagner. He particularly admired Olbrich’s designs for buildings at the Darmstadt artist’s,Paragraph
colony. The English Arts and Crafts also had an enormous effect on his architectural,Paragraph
style.,Paragraph
"Puig rigorously examined and studied the historical architecture of Catalonia,",Paragraph
eventually publishing several leading scholarly texts. He rejected monumentalism and,Paragraph
classical forms in favor of a style firmly rooted in Catalan culture and society. Puig,Paragraph
"abhorred classical styles, declaring that they had little to do with native tradition and were",Paragraph
simply another non-Catalan fashion imposed by the central government in Madrid. In his,Paragraph
"own work, Puig attempted to combine the folk traditions of rural Catalonia with the",Paragraph
"deliberate artistry and modern materials of urban society. In all his structures, he",Paragraph
combined a commitment to local tradition and history with a strong faith in modernity,Paragraph
and internationalism.,Paragraph
Puig emphasized simple volumes that echoed the traditional floor plans of Catalan,Paragraph
farmhouses. These areas had an organic layout with spaces that gently flowed together.,Paragraph
His interiors became known for their remarkable sense of intimacy and warmth produced,Paragraph
through diffuse lighting and lavish use of wood as decoration. A strong sense of,Paragraph
"nationalism and history led him to encourage local craft techniques, including wood-",Paragraph
"working, ceramics, stained glass, and sgraffito. Puig’s structures emphasized a richness",Paragraph
of detail combined with a simplicity of form. The exteriors often faced the street with,Paragraph
"large, planar facades of stucco or unadorned brick punctuated with almost baroque-like",Paragraph
stone oriels and decoration. The specific decorative elements ranged from organic,Paragraph
"flowers and animals to heraldic devices, shields, and symbols of nobility.",Paragraph
His first major work was the Casa Marti (1896) in Barcelona’s Gothic quarter. The,Paragraph
hulking building recalled a feudal manor house of the medieval Catalan past. The,Paragraph
exposed brick walls combined with stonework decoration to give the structure an,Paragraph
artisanal feel. The interior contained large spaces covered by wood beams and,Paragraph
illuminated by delicate iron chandeliers. This illustrated Puig’s deliberate combination of,Paragraph
"traditional form with modern ornament. It was this interior that, a year after completion",Paragraph
"of the structure, housed a cafe called the Els Quatre Gats (the Four Cats). The building",Paragraph
"soon became the social gathering place of Pablo Picasso, Miquel Utrillo, Ramon Casas,",Paragraph

reputation.,Paragraph
"The politics of Catalan nationalism, combined with a growing class of wealthy patrons,",Paragraph
led to a series of important commissions during the period 1900-05. It was with these,Paragraph
"houses that the architectural style of Puig found its greatest expression. The first,",Paragraph
"constructed for a wealthy chocolate maker, was the Casa Amatller (1900). Puig designed",Paragraph
the house to be a jewel of individuality set within what he viewed as the rigid conformity,Paragraph
of Ildefons Cerda’s gridlike urban plan for Barcelona. He wished to express the opulence,Paragraph
and power of his wealthy clients through extravagant use of rich materials and,Paragraph
"symbolism. The plan exhibited the characteristics typical to rural Catalan homes, with a",Paragraph
large central courtyard and a central stair rising to the main public room of the first floor.,Caption
The interior was richly appointed in wood and plaster. The public rooms contained ornate,Paragraph
"columns, and the highly decorated wooden ceiling beams recalled traditional Spanish",Paragraph
"mudéjar ornamentation. The flat wall facing the street, however, revealed that Puig was",Paragraph
"not simply blindly following the ancient tenets. Instead, the wall was peppered with",Paragraph
sgraffito and topped by an ornate pediment decorated with brightly colored tiles. The,Paragraph
outline of the structure resembled the stepped triangular rooflines of Northern European,Paragraph
"homes. In addition to the tiles, the architect decorated the front of the structure with both",Paragraph
"whimsical and pious sculpture. Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia, shared space",Caption
"with rats, pigs, and frogs. Eventually, Doménech built the Casa Lled Morera to the left,",Paragraph
"and the building on the right was replaced by Gaudi’s Casa Batll6, making the short",Paragraph
block one of the single greatest concentrations of modernist architecture in the entire city.,Paragraph
"A second home designed for a wealthy patron was the Casa Terrades (1905), better",Paragraph
known as the “Casa de les Punxes” (House of the Points). The nickname came from the,Paragraph
building’s four small round turrets and a large main tower topped by sharp spires. It again,Paragraph
demonstrated Puig’s affection for Northern European designs. A series of profusely,Paragraph
decorated doorways and window openings punctuated the plain brick walls. The,Paragraph
decorative sculpture again included a large ceramic plaque dedicated to St. George. The,Paragraph
choice of decoration illustrated the ostentatious religiosity of the wealthy bourgeoisie and,Paragraph
also their nationalism.,Paragraph
"In addition to being a practicing architect, Puig had a second career as an architectural",Paragraph
historian. He employed a scientific approach that emphasized observation and,Paragraph
measurement. Puig was convinced of the connections between all aspects of a region’s,Paragraph
"culture, including language, art, and architecture. He thought of architecture as a",Paragraph
communal art form created by peoples and nations rather than individuals and that,Paragraph
historic forms had been dictated by the particular needs and traditions of the region.,Paragraph
"Although exiled following the Spanish civil war, Puig’s theory and practice continued to",Paragraph
influence Spanish architecture. The emphasis on regional design elements and quality,Paragraph
"decoration was later taken up by members of the loosely organized School of Barcelona,",Paragraph

GEORGE GRANT ELMSLIE,Title
"Architecture firm, United States",Title
The partnership of William Gray Purcell (1880-1965) and George Grant Elmslie,Paragraph
(1871-1952) was remarkable in the annals of architecture. It lasted from 1909 until 1922.,Paragraph
"During these years, the two men made a major contribution to the Prairie School and",Paragraph
created some of its finest buildings.,Paragraph
"Born on a farm in northeastern Scotland, Elmslie attended the famous Duke of Gordon",Paragraph
School in Huntly. His education included a strict Presbyterianism along with a,Paragraph
consciousness of the mysticism that is a strong feature of the Scottish heritage. With his,Paragraph
"family, Elmslie immigrated to the United States in 1884. They settled in Chicago, where",Paragraph
"his father was already working. After a brief period in business school, Elmslie followed",Paragraph
the suggestion of his parents and began the study of architecture in the office of Joseph,Paragraph
"Lyman Silsbee, where George Maher and Frank Lloyd Wright were already working.",Paragraph
"When Wright left Silsbee in 1889 to join Adler and Sullivan, he asked Elmslie to come",Paragraph
"with him. The offer was accepted, with momentous consequences for both Sullivan and",Paragraph
"Elmslie. When Wright left the office in the mid-1890s, Elmslie became Sullivan’s chief",Paragraph
"draftsman, a position that he held for 15 years. During this period, Elmslie learned",Paragraph
thoroughly the principles of organic architecture and became adept at designing ornament,Paragraph
in the Sullivan manner. He detailed nearly all the exterior ornament for the Wainwright,Paragraph
"Building (1890) in St. Louis, designed the ironwork entrance for the Carson Pirie Scott",Caption
"Store (1901-03) in Chicago, and had a major share in the design of the National Farmers",Paragraph
"Bank (1908) in Owatonna, Minnesota. By 1909 business in the Sullivan office had",Paragraph
declined to such an extent that Elmslie was open to the offer of a partnership from,Paragraph
"William Gray Purcell, a young Minneapolis architect whom he had known since 1903.",Paragraph
"Purcell had grown up in Oak Park, Illinois, in comfortable circumstances. He was",Paragraph
"educated in its excellent schools, at a liberal private academy, and at Cornell University,",Paragraph
where he took an architectural degree in 1903. The academic curriculum was profoundly,Paragraph
"distasteful to Purcell. (In correspondence with this writer, he always referred to it",Paragraph
"contemptuously as “Bozart.”} Nonetheless, he mastered conventional drafting techniques",Paragraph
"and, after graduation, was briefly in Sullivan’s office, an experience that stayed with him",Paragraph
for the rest of his life. He also worked in Berkeley for John Galen Howard and in Seattle.,Paragraph
"Then, in 1906, at the suggestion of his father, Purcell departed for a yearlong odyssey in",Paragraph
Europe in company with his Cornell classmate George Feick. The two young men not,Paragraph
only visited the classical sites in Greece and Italy and the French cathedral towns but also,Paragraph
"called on such progressive leaders as Hendrik Berlage in the Netherlands, Martin Nyrop",Paragraph
"in Denmark, and Ferdinand Boberg in Sweden. On their return to the United States, Feick",Paragraph
convinced Purcell that there was room for a new kind of architectural firm in,Paragraph
"Minneapolis. They opened an office in February 1907. Elmslie joined them in 1909, and",Paragraph
"in 1913 Feick withdrew. Although Purcell moved to Philadelphia in 1916, he continued",Paragraph
his association with Elmslie until 1922.,Paragraph
The great years for Purcell and Elmslie and for the other Prairie architects were those,Paragraph
immediately preceding World War |. Elmslie brought with him much domestic work,Paragraph
from clients who wanted progressive houses but could no longer endure the difficulties of,Paragraph
working with Sullivan. These clients included,Paragraph

"Frank Lloyd Wright, whose work Purcell and Elmslie had earlier admired. The houses of",Paragraph
"Purcell and Elmslie, however, were usually lighter in feeling and often more livable.",Paragraph
The other great specialty of the firm was the small-town bank. Encouraged by the,Paragraph
"success of the Sullivan-Elmslie Bank (1908) for Carl K. Bennett at Owatonna,",Paragraph
"Minnesota, the new partnership actively sought similar omissions throughout the",Paragraph
"Midwest. Happily, they found a number of similar progressive-minded bankers. Their",Paragraph
"banks in Leroy, Grand Meadow, and Adams, Minnesota, and in Rhinelander, Wisconsin,",Paragraph
are particularly fine. These banks stand like jewel boxes in hamlets that are reminiscent,Paragraph
"of Gopher Prairie in the novels of Sinclair Lewis. The largest of their banks, a superlative",Paragraph
"creation, is the Merchants’ Bank (1912) of Winona, Minnesota. For this building, the",Paragraph
firm used pier-and-lintel framing with steel girders set on brick piers to define the cubic,Paragraph
"form of the banking room, thus relieving the walls of support function so that they could",Paragraph
be opened up for large panes of leaded glass. There was also a great deal of terracotta,Paragraph
"ormmament, and the chairs and the other furniture were designed to match the architectural",Paragraph
"elements, all in keeping with Prairie School principles.",Paragraph
The largest building to be constructed by Purcell and Elmslie was the Woodbury,Paragraph
"County Courthouse for Sioux City, lowa, done in association with William L.Steele.",Caption
Steele won the commission in 1916 and then asked Elmslie to develop a plan expressing,Paragraph
the agricultural wealth of the region and the sturdy population of its inhabitants. Despite,Paragraph
"opposition from several quarters, the Elmslie concept was carried through. It featured an",Paragraph
amazing amount of terra-cotta ornament and a series of massive friezes by Alfonso,Caption
"Jannelli, who had earlier worked with Wright at the Midway Gardens. About 60 percent",Paragraph
"of the designing was done by Elmslie, who moved to Sioux City for the duration of the",Paragraph
job. The remainder came through the Minneapolis office. The courthouse is a building of,Paragraph
an almost indigestible richness.,Paragraph
"Design procedures in the office of Purcell and Elmslie were essentially democratic,",Paragraph
with both partners contributing at differ-ent stages to the finished project. In a profound,Paragraph
"sense, the two men were necessary to each other. Elmslie had a deep understanding of the",Paragraph
"organic principles underlying the architecture of Louis Sullivan, but at times his",Paragraph
preoccupation with the role of ornament could degenerate into decorative efflorescence.,Paragraph
"Purcell, equally convinced of organic and democratic principles but more cautious by",Paragraph

RAILROAD STATION,Title
"The railroad station as a building type was born in the early 19th century, when vehicles",Paragraph
that traveled on their own “railroads” began to be used for the transportation of not only,Paragraph
goods but also humans. The primary reason for such a building was the basic need to,Paragraph
"shelter both trains and people. However, the railroad station fulfilled a psychological",Paragraph
"need as well. Before the widespread use of railroads, traveling was an arduous and",Paragraph
extended affair consisting of a series of gradual transitions from one place to another. By,Paragraph
"means of the railroad (and later the airplane), traveling became an easier task consisting",Paragraph
"of merely embarking and disembarking a vehicle, with no stops in between. For the",Paragraph
"industrial city, the railroad station became what the city gate had been for the medieval",Paragraph
"city—that special inbetween transitional location, the first and last view of a city, the",Paragraph
physical and psychological location of entrance and exit.,Paragraph
The architectural history of the railroad station suggests a dialogue between the,Paragraph
"building and its train tracks. Buildings were first placed alongside of the tracks, as is still",Paragraph
the case in many suburban and rural train stations. Those on both sides of the tracks were,Paragraph
"sometimes linked with naturally lit steel-and-glass atriums, or train sheds. Those stations",Paragraph
"that terminated a train line, usually in large urban metropolises, tended to screen both",Paragraph
"tracks and shed from view by means of either a separate construction, as in Euston",Paragraph
"Station (1839, Philip Hardwick, demolished 1962) in London, or a third building that",Paragraph
"linked shed and buildings either side, as in Gare de |’Est (1852, Frangois Duquesney) in",Paragraph
"Paris. The shed and buildings of St. Pancras Station in London, although touching, were",Paragraph
designed and built separately by engineer William H.Barlow (1868) and architect Sir,Paragraph
"George Gilbert Scott (1876). Toward the end of the 19th century, the size of a railroad",Paragraph
"station’s train shed became its qualifying criterion, and a contest began to see who could",Paragraph
"build the largest. Broad Street Station (1893, Joseph and John Wilson, demolished 1953)",Caption
in Philadelphia reached a limit with its ingenious 300-foot three-hinged wrought-iron,Paragraph
shed.,Paragraph
"By the turn of the 20th century, the areas around such large urban terminals were no",Paragraph
"longer on the outskirts of town in unwanted industrial areas. Instead, the city had usually",Paragraph
"grown up around them, and they found themselves on valuable real estate. To take",Paragraph
"advantage of this, some train tracks, originally at street level or elevated, were buried",Paragraph
"below ground, and their land was sold for development. A new station building, not just",Paragraph
"shed and facade, could then be built on top of these sunken tracks. The main",Paragraph
characteristic of this new type of station was its central hall or concourse—large enough,Paragraph
to accommodate huge numbers of people and lofty enough to present itself as the center,Paragraph
"of the city, if not the whole world. Such is the case with Pennsylvania Station (1910,",Paragraph
"McKim, Mead, and White, demolished 1964) in New York; Union Station (1907, D.H.",Caption
"Burnham and Company) in Washington, D.C.; and Grand Central Station (1913, Warren",Paragraph
and Westmore and Reed and Stem) in New York.,Paragraph
"In Chicago, the acknowledged railroad city of the early 20th century, Daniel",Paragraph
"H.Burnham and Edward H.Bennett gave lengthy consideration to the location, multimode",Paragraph
"functions, and style of the modern railroad terminal in their influential Plan of Chicago",Paragraph
"(1909). For the next decade or so, City Beautiful architects and planners often made a",Paragraph
new railroad terminal one of the chief urban forms.,Paragraph
"By hiding the tracks from view, the concourse-type railroad station eliminated the",Paragraph
previously mentioned design problem of separate buildings and train sheds. This,Paragraph
elimination of separate building and shed is also characteristic of modernist railroad,Paragraph
"stations where train tracks and their roof covering, instead of being hidden below ground,",Paragraph
"became integrated into a complete design. Helsinki Station (1910—20, Eliel Saarinen),",Paragraph
"which does not rely on any 19th-century Gothic, Doric, or Moorish eclecticism for its",Paragraph
"decoration, is an early example of this. The main station in Florence, Italy (1934-36,",Paragraph
"Giovanni Michelucci), was one of the first International Style railroad stations,",Paragraph
integrating its building and shed so easily perhaps because steel and glass were part of the,Paragraph
whole building’s palette.,Paragraph
"Because of the increased usage of the automobile and the airplane, there were not",Paragraph
"many new railroad stations built after World War II, with the exception of those rebuilt",Paragraph
"because of war damage. Stazione Termini (1951, Montuori and Calini) in Rome,",Caption
"although newly built, was a prototype followed by most rebuilt stations: long, flat, and",Paragraph

were abandoned and even de-,Paragraph

"molished, particularly in the United States. During the 1980s, a small railroad station",Paragraph
renaissance occurred as existing stations were enlarged and appended to become home to,Paragraph

"way, railroad stations became more of a place to visit and stay rather than just a place to",Paragraph

"replaced with an office building (1984, Terry Farrell). Similarly, Union Station in",Paragraph
"Washington, D.C., turned its concourse into a giant shopping mall by pushing back its",Paragraph

RANCH HOUSE,Title
"After World War L, the American ranch house replaced the bungalow and the Cape Cod",Paragraph
cottage as the preeminent American house type. Because housing costs had doubled in,Paragraph
"the 1940s, most architects designed flexible, multiuse spaces emphasizing both function",Paragraph
"and convenience, including the ranch house. However, because of both the Depression",Paragraph
"and wartime materials shortages, most consumers could fulfill dreams of a new house",Paragraph
only with glossy magazines and corporate-sponsored scrapbooks. The end of World War,Paragraph
Il brought an enormous demand for new housing. The wartime development of new,Paragraph
materials and new manufacturing methods enabled merchant builders to meet postwar,Paragraph
"consumer demand, which was subsidized by new federal loan programs. Concurrently,",Paragraph
"consumer magazines, merchant builders, and museum exhibitions promoted the ranch",Paragraph
"house as affordable shelter for the newly informal, family-oriented, and frequently",Paragraph
suburban American lifestyle. Consumers embraced the ranch house as the paradigm for,Paragraph
"new, modern, and convenient housing, a preference endorsed by consumer magazines, an",Paragraph
"architectural pedigree that included Frank Lloyd Wright, and the unprecedented growth",Paragraph
of suburbia after World War IL.,Paragraph
The postwar ranch house is characterized by spaciousness facilitated by new building,Paragraph
"techniques, new materials, and interior design. The single-story house typically featured",Paragraph
"three zones: an open-plan common space, a centralized service core, and a cluster of",Paragraph
"private bedrooms. The open plan emphasized the flow of space between rooms,",Paragraph
"modulated by pass-throughs, open shelving, and built-in storage units. Indoor-outdoor",Paragraph
iving areas and large expanses of glass promoted the interpenetration of interior and,Paragraph
"exterior space. The rambling plan, horizontal em-phasis, and low-pitched roof ideally",Paragraph
integrated the ranch house into the landscape. Although the single-story ranch house,Paragraph
"proved prototypical, both the split level and the raised ranch abounded. Architects and",Paragraph
"merchant builders tailored the plan, exterior facings, and features such as appliances to",Paragraph
"the home owner’s means. For example, in 1959, American Home featured a 1040-square-",Paragraph
"foot ranch house for $12,950 (including lot), and the House Beautiful Pace Setter House",Paragraph
"boasted 3100 square feet for $51,500 (including indoor pool and air conditioning).",Paragraph
"Ranch house designers drew on numerous sources, including Spanish colonial",Paragraph
"architecture, Frank Lloyd Wright’s Usonian houses, and California modernism, to create",Paragraph
a distinctly American house type. Architect Cliff May traced the postwar ranch house to,Paragraph
the 19th-century Spanish colonial rancho in the West. Arguing that form followed,Paragraph
"function, May claimed that the casual, outdoor-oriented “California life” of a small",Paragraph
"population of wealthy ranchers had generated the rambling, open-plan, singlestory, adobe",Paragraph
"house with a corredor, or porch, instead of a hallway. The 20th-century suburban ranch",Paragraph
"house retained its associations with California casualness, indoor-outdoor living, and the",Paragraph
notion of a putatively native architectural heritage.,Paragraph
"Designers also adapted Frank Lloyd Wright’s Usonian houses, first realized in the",Paragraph
"Herbert Jacobs House (1937). The Jacobs House used the L-shaped, “pollywog plan.”",Paragraph
"The head of the pollywog contained both common spaces and the service core, including",Paragraph
"kitchen, bath, and other utilities. The interior expressed Wright’s notion of organic",Paragraph
"architecture consisting of an open-plan space subdivided by ceiling levels, lighting",Paragraph
"effects, and built-in furniture. Private rooms, such as bedrooms, the study, and the",Paragraph
"workshop, formed the tail of the pollywog. Generous eaves, natural materials, and a",Paragraph
horizontal silhouette integrated house and landscape. Wright’s rhetoric also commended,Paragraph
"his domestic architecture to postwar readers of magazines such as House Beautiful, which",Paragraph
promoted Wright as an American genius whose vision of American individualism,Paragraph
embodied by the single-family home not only accorded with Cold War ideology but also,Paragraph
affirmed the postwar development of suburbia.,Paragraph
"Wright’s reorientation of the kitchen, or “work space,” from backstairs to the",Paragraph
ideological and spatial center of the Usonian house proved fundamental to the postwar,Paragraph
"ranch house. The kitchen served as the control center, allowing the homemaker physical,",Paragraph
"visual, and even verbal access to the entire house, such as that afforded by the intercom",Paragraph
"system, one of a new array of appliances that facilitated the self-sufficiency of the",Paragraph
postwar family. Whereas previously even working-class women had hired help to do,Paragraph
"laundry and heavy cleaning, the postwar economy dictated that most women labored",Paragraph
"alone, assisted by appliances rather than servants.",Paragraph
"Both Wright and California modernists, such as Richard Neutra, used large expanses of",Paragraph
"glass—including picture windows, window walls, and sliding-glass doors—to integrate",Paragraph
"interior and exterior space. Similarly, Sunset promoted the “total combination of indoor-",Paragraph
outdoor space” created by ground-level access to outdoor living areas as the ideal,Paragraph
"situation for casual living and informal entertaining. The low rambling profile,",Paragraph
"overhanging eaves, and features such as planter boxes integrated into the facade further",Paragraph
unified house and landscape. Exterior adornment drew on both vernacular tradition and,Paragraph
"architectural design, at times simultaneously. A ranch house might combine the scalloped",Paragraph
bargeboards of the Swiss chalet with geometric arrangements of facing materials,Caption
indebted to modernists such as Edward Durell Stone.,Paragraph
The open plan essential to the ranch house not only maximized space on a limited,Paragraph
budget but also promoted American political and cultural values. In a series of articles,Paragraph
"written during the 1950s, House Beautiful associated the open plan with Wright’s organic",Paragraph
"architecture, American sociability, and democratic freedom of choice. Similarly, the",Paragraph
ranch house served as a vehicle for American nationalist ideology at the American,Paragraph
"National Exposition in Moscow in 1959, where exhibits of domestic technology included",Paragraph
"a “six-room, ranch-type house, completely furnished, within the price range of [the]",Paragraph

Steen Eiler Rasmussen’s broad range of talents were manifest in his activities as an,Paragraph
"architect, town planner, educator, historian, and critic. Although he exerted influence in",Paragraph
"all these areas in his native Denmark, his ideas were disseminated to a wider audience via",Paragraph
"his translated books and his work as a visiting scholar in England, Turkey, Australia, and",Paragraph
"the United States. Born in Copenhagen in 1898, Rasmussen entered the two-year",Paragraph
"preparatory course at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts at the age of 18 and, on",Paragraph
"completion, joined the office of Carl Brummer. During his first year at Brummer’s office,",Paragraph
he collaborated with Knud Christiansen on three first prizewinning competition entries,Paragraph
for the renewal of the Prinsensgade Quarter in Copenhagen and town plans for Ringsted,Caption
and Hirtshals. Rasmussen was elected as a member of the Academic Council of the Royal,Paragraph
Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1922 and two years later was appointed as its first,Paragraph
"lecturer in town planning. In 1938, he was promoted to professor of architecture, a post",Paragraph
"that he held until 1968. During this period, he also served as a member of the",Paragraph
Copenhagen Building Commission and the Copenhagen Traffic Commission and as,Title
chairman of the Danish Planning Laboratory and the Regional Planning Committee for,Paragraph
Copenhagen.,Paragraph
The early inclination toward town planning would continue to occupy Rasmussen,Paragraph
throughout his life. His most significant work in this area is undoubtedly “The Finger,Paragraph
"Plan of 1948,” which was an attempt to produce an overall regional plan for greater",Paragraph
"Copenhagen. Conceived in collaboration with a team headed by Peter Bredsdorff, the",Paragraph
plan called for the city to grow along a series of “fingers” marked by railway lines,Paragraph
extending radially from the center. The area between these transport corridors was,Paragraph
"intended for forests and agricultural lands. According to Rasmussen, no one was to live",Paragraph
"farther than a 10-minute walk to a station, and those living in the outermost areas should",Paragraph
be able to reach the center of the city within 30 to 45 minutes. Although the plan was,Paragraph
"never accorded legal status, the main structure of the plan was carried out in principal at",Paragraph
local levels. The significance of the “Finger Plan” lies in the fact that although many,Paragraph
other European cities sought to limit the growth of the town and establish “satellite,Paragraph
"towns,” Rasmussen devised a means by which the city could remain a singular entity and",Paragraph
extend outward in a controlled manner.,Paragraph
Rasmussen’s interest in the city was not confined to his town-planning proposals but,Paragraph
"also extended to his work as a historian and critic. In 1927, he was afforded the",Paragraph
opportunity to serve as a guest lecturer at the Architectural Association in London. Struck,Paragraph
"by the differences between life in Copenhagen and life in London, Rasmussen began to",Paragraph
record the observations made during his initial period of residence and many subsequent,Paragraph
"visits and compiled the material into the book titled London: The Unique City, which was",Paragraph
published in 1934. Although the book was almost immediately translated into English,Paragraph
"and has appeared in a number of editions, Rasmussen experienced disappointment",Paragraph
because the book did not fulfill his intention of initiating a debate among legislators and,Paragraph
politicians. Speaking of his disappointment in his foreword to the 1973 revised edition of,Paragraph
"the book, he stated that he had learned that one could not provoke discussion with a large",Paragraph
"book, but only with short, concentrated attacks in periodic publications. Rasmussen’s",Paragraph
commitment to debates regarding the quality of the physical environment are clearly seen,Paragraph
in the numerous published articles in Danish newspapers and in his work as editor of the,Paragraph
journal Arkitekten from 1927 to 1933.,Paragraph
"In addition to his book on London, two more of Rasmussen’s books have been",Paragraph
translated into English: Experiencing Architecture and Towns and Buildings. Both works,Paragraph
can be described as primers that provide a clear and cogent introduction to architecture,Paragraph
"and town planning, and they represent Rasmussen’s range of interest and breadth of",Paragraph
"knowledge. Soon after publication of the English editions of his books, Rasmussen was",Paragraph
"invited as a guest professor to various schools throughout the world, including the",Paragraph
"Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Yale University; the University of California,",Paragraph
Berkeley; the Royal College of Art; and the University of New South Wales.,Paragraph
Rasmussen described himself as an “unsuccessful” architect as the result of many of,Paragraph
his town-planning proposals not being carried through to an acceptable level of resolution,Paragraph
"because of a lack of commitment by municipal authorities. However, he was involved in",Paragraph
a number of architectural projects that demonstrate both his aptitude as an architect and,Paragraph
his adherence to the tenets of functionalism as they were expressed in Denmark at the,Paragraph
"time. Of particular note are Rasmussen’s own residence (1937), an extension to the hotel",Paragraph
"Hornbaekhus (1942), the Rungsted School (1953), and the “Blanche” hostel (1961) in",Paragraph
"central Copenhagen. Two multifamily housing projects, “Skovgaarden” (1958, 1961) and",Paragraph
"“Banehegnet” (1962), serve as examples of how Rasmussen’s ideas about town planning",Paragraph
and architecture could be realized.,Paragraph

RATIONALISM,Title
The Rational School in mid-nineteenth century was an amorphous body of architects who,Paragraph
"held that architecture was ornamented construction, essentially structural form, however",Paragraph
refined or adorned. Found in the philosophy that reason is the source and test of,Paragraph
"knowledge and best served by deductive inquiry, and as an extension of the",Paragraph
"Enlightenment, it was French in tradition as bequeathed by master masons of the so-",Paragraph
called Middle Ages. It was differentiated from the British empirical tradition that,Paragraph
"ultimately was popularized as the picturesque, a distinction to exist well into the 20th",Paragraph
century. Yet French and German architects consistently applied the theory to classical,Paragraph
"buildings; an early epitome was J.G. Soufflot’s Church of St. Genevieve (Pantheon),",Paragraph
"Paris, 1757, a building to lead into Romantic Classicism. Academic design rituals were",Paragraph
"then perpetuated by the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, followed by its many imitators in",Paragraph
North America 1890-1940.,Paragraph
"But the Ecole had devolved to classique formalism, much to the chagrin of committed",Paragraph
"rationalists such as Jean-Baptiste Rondolet, who in 1802 argued that architecture derives",Paragraph
from construction and is not an imaginative art. Or those impressed by the influential,Paragraph
"books of J.N.L.Durand, Rondolet’s contemporary. Proposing that architecture be",Paragraph
"conditioned—as his fellow revolutionaries insisted—by social demand, that style be the",Paragraph
"“visible expression of its functioning parts,” axial symmetry and classical forms in simple",Paragraph
"geometry were Durand’s aesthetic preferences. As a planning methodology, he used a",Paragraph
square grid to order structure and explain plan. It was a type of orderliness that post-1850,Paragraph
attracted theorist and architect E.E. Viollet-le-Duc. But Durand’s obsession was French,Paragraph
"Gothic with its constructional clarity of parts, not just expressed but plainly exposed. His",Paragraph
"written expositions on modernism (that is, speculation as to an appropriate architecture",Paragraph
"for his day), on the use of new materials and technologies, on reasoned “principles, as",Paragraph
"opposed to rules” or imitative forms, on buildings as organisms, on style rather than the",Paragraph
"styles, and so on, remains highly persuasive.",Paragraph
"Traditionally, the architecture of rationalism tended toward classicism, thereby",Paragraph
"emphasizing its foundation in 18th-century mathematics (measurable truth), therefore",Paragraph
"geometry plays a significant role. More lately this can be seen, for instance, in the early",Paragraph
"works of Frank Lloyd Wright, those post-1937 by a disciplined Ludwig Mies van der",Paragraph
"Rohe, and those beginning in the 1960s by Louis I.Kahn and his intelligent follower",Paragraph
Mario Botta. From their individualistic variety we also can see that there is no coherent,Paragraph
rationalistic style.,Paragraph
It is generally held that Rationalism arrived in the United States c. 1800 through,Paragraph
"French emigrant architects such as Joseph J.Ramée, Maximilian Godefroy, and Benjamin",Paragraph
H.Latrobe. But it was swamped by Jeffersonian Romanticism and formalism. The counter,Paragraph
was found first in the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson and then in the might of,Paragraph
industrialization and concomitant technical and engineering developments.,Paragraph
"Emersonian nature and utility and inspired sculptor Horatio Greenough, who praised",Paragraph
"monumental buildings that addressed the “sympathies, the faith, or the taste of a people.”",Paragraph
He wrote Emerson that architecture was: “A scientific arrangement of spaces and forms,Paragraph
"to functions and to sit,... features proportioned to their graduated importance in function.”",Paragraph
"The expression of functionality was the demonstration of reason. (The philosopher,",Paragraph
"whose tool is words, would refer to positivism.) Borrowing from American architect",Paragraph
"Louis Sullivan, who drew from Kant, Emerson, Greenough, and others, Wright was",Paragraph
"inspired by the “form follows function” aphorism, extending it by reflection on his",Paragraph
"family’s love of Emerson, who urged a link with those “pertinent object lessons nature so",Paragraph
"readily furnishes,” as Wright said. Is there anything in nature that does not function",Paragraph
"correctly, wondrously? Rationalism easily becomes entangled with the notion of utility",Paragraph
and nearly synonymous with functionalism. But nature was the perfect teacher.,Paragraph
The application of rationalism reached a practical epitome beginning in the 1880s with,Paragraph
the frighteningly tall buildings in New York City and Chicago. They had adopted,Paragraph
structural systems evolved by engineers and building contractors and contained utilitarian,Paragraph
features and technical innovations within a variety of facades. The expression of stacked,Paragraph
"spaces (to the Romantic), of stacked floors (to the rationalist), and vertical systems",Paragraph
"(water, people, structure, waste, etc.) was—and is—the architectural problem.",Paragraph
Although many were inspired by Viollet-le-Duc’s words Wright made them,Paragraph
contemporary and vital by speaking of an organic architecture for America’s modern,Paragraph
society and by producing works of an articulated (functional) clarity. The demonstration,Paragraph
"is the Darwin Martin house of 1904-05, and the Larkin Administration building (1903—",Paragraph
"06), both in Buffalo and both a rationalist’s paradigm for differing building types.",Paragraph
Many of Wright’s buildings possessed what he referred to as “picturesque”,Paragraph
characteristics as he interpreted them from the English Arts and Crafts movement. His,Paragraph
persuasion had a marked influence on European theory post-1910. Thus Wright and,Paragraph
many of those founding modernists who were inspired by his words (not necessarily by,Paragraph
"his romantic designs), such as Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier, even Louis Sullivan (from",Paragraph
"whom Wright had drawn much nationalistic and transcendentalist fervor), and by Albert",Paragraph
"Kahn’s industrial architecture, extracted intellectual sustenance from 19th-century theory",Paragraph
and speculation.,Paragraph
In 1902 Sullivan wanted to impress on his audience “the simple truth—immeasurable,Paragraph
in power of expansion—of the subjective possibilities of objective things.” The,Paragraph
architect’s role was to interpret those things. In Europe Hendrik P.Berlage wrote about,Paragraph
the “pure art of utility” and believed his Amsterdam Exchange buildings (1897-1903),Paragraph
followed principles espoused by Viollet-le-Duc. Auguste Perret was perhaps France’s,Paragraph
most ardent classical rationalist so dramatically expressed in concrete structures and axial,Paragraph
symmetry from 1903-25; consider Notre-Dame Le Raincy (1922-24). Up to the 1960s,Paragraph
"Le Corbusier was France’s most versatile structural rationalist, as a comparison of",Paragraph
"Monzie house, Garches (1927), and the monastery of Le Tourette, Lyon (1957-60)",Caption
patently reveal. Yet his three-dimensional compositions are also picturesque in manners,Paragraph
that baffle rigid theorists.,Paragraph
"When in the 1920s the central Europeans, in particular the Germans, absorbed the",Paragraph
visual aspects of the rationalism inherent in Albert Kahn’s industrial architecture (where,Paragraph
"primary considerations were daylight, production process, functionality, money,",Paragraph
"construction time, and structure), they elected for a reductive, chaste, plain interior and",Paragraph
"exterior aesthetic constructed in glass, concrete, or steel, usually exposed. Wright and",Paragraph
others (such as the Dutch) worried that such an architecture might lead to a rejection of,Paragraph
"its traditional role as a social art to become merely utilitarian, rationalized rather than",Paragraph
rational. In the 1920s the Modern movement was driven by rationalism until its industrial,Paragraph
style was found to be a useful expression for internationalism as promoted by the political,Paragraph
"left. Mies van der Rohe in the 1920s, for example, took much from Wright (and others) to",Paragraph
generate a dynamic architecture based on American industrial buildings. By the late,Paragraph
"1930s he settled for what is best classified as a severe classicism, appearing rational but",Paragraph
in fact it was prescriptively formal and abstract. Thus the reasons for Kahn’s industrial,Paragraph
aesthetic were abandoned by the Germans when they accepted an aesthetic that claimed,Paragraph
"to be expressively functional but was in fact a style applied to all building types,",Paragraph
regardless of all other considerations.,Paragraph
"In the late 1920s seven architects launched the Italian Rationalist Movement,",Paragraph
"announcing that a “[n]ew architecture, true architecture, must emerge from a strict",Paragraph
"adherence to logic, to rationality.” Their buildings and projects, supposedly born in",Paragraph
Italy’s traditions (and in opposition to the bustling but defunct futurists) and in fascism,Paragraph
"were widely diverse in appearance, many with structural clarity while immodestly",Paragraph
"betraying the influence of Russian Constructivists, Le Corbusier, and the Bauhaus.",Paragraph
Giuseppe Terragni was their more expert apostle through the 1930s.,Paragraph
"Then in 1941, a theoretical work was released on antecedents of 20th-century",Paragraph
"architecture by Siegfried Giedion, Space Time and Architecture. \t was a faithful",Paragraph
rationalist document in praise of functionalism. Giedion’s intention was to concentrate on,Paragraph
"“the interrelations with other human activities...[on] architecture, construction, painting,",Paragraph
"city planning, and science” (1954). This was followed in 1948 by his second seminal",Paragraph
"study, Mechanization Takes Command, whose title reveals all.",Paragraph
"In the decades after midcentury, rationalism became both clarified and distorted. Louis",Paragraph
"Kahn believed that a building had measurable qualities, that there were ordinate and",Paragraph
"subordinate spaces with natural hierarchies, that these functional aspects wanted to be",Paragraph
"defined by their unique form, and that perceptual awareness of architecture was in the",Paragraph
"orderly arrangement of forms. Supported by his poetic philosophy, these relationships",Paragraph
"were vigorously exploited by simple volumetric geometry, notably his A.N.Richards",Paragraph
"Laboratories, Philadelphia (1957-61), the second paradigm of 20th-century rationalism.",Paragraph
"If we accept that architectural form is shaped by programmatic functions, and this should",Paragraph
"include social and economic conditions, or by the spirit of its time, or by timeless",Paragraph
"principles, then the two extremes at midcentury were Kahn’s romantically, picturesquely",Paragraph
ordered forms and Mies van der Rohe’s internally preordered forms classically,Paragraph
composed. The reaction was the exploitation of form over function and hierarchies that,Paragraph
"were so apparent in 1950s sensualism and later the work of Arata Isozaki and Morphosis,",Paragraph
to cite two examples.,Paragraph
"A new neorationalism arose in the 1960s, again in Italy and composed by Fabio",Paragraph
"Reinhart and Aldo Rossi, among others, who rejected their predecessors. Soon there was",Paragraph
"the Madrid School, then in Germany architects Mathias Ungers and J.P. Kleihus, and in",Paragraph
"the United States, architects such as the New York Five, of whom the prolific Richard",Paragraph
"Meier has since remained the most faithful to original tenets. Again, these architects",Paragraph
"produced a wide variety of characteristics, none architectonically related, all distinct yet",Paragraph
often claiming a mix of rationalistic and existential foundations.,Paragraph
Much of neorationalism was a theoretical twist with the attempt to relate architecture to,Paragraph
"political theories (usually Marxist) or to social theories, particularly through semiotics,",Paragraph
"which recognizes that buildings carry meanings (signs) and symbolic overtones, more",Paragraph
often than not because of cultural continuity or history. Much of its theory was derived,Paragraph
from or instituted in linguistics. Therefore one can understand that the problem of,Paragraph
"analogies with the complexities of architecture are many, not the least that semiotics (and",Paragraph
"the earlier structuralism) is evaluative, tending to operate postmortem, therefore only",Paragraph
clumsily relevant to the processes inherent in creating architecture let alone to design,Paragraph
methodology.,Paragraph
There is something strangely romantic in the architectonic application of those,Paragraph
socioeconomic theories. Perhaps this reflects the continuing debate between rationalism,Paragraph
"and Romanticism, between the ongoing search for objective principles of design with",Paragraph
"universal application (regardless of complexity or culture, all functions are naturally",Paragraph
"similar throughout history), and the personal freedom that followed the collapse early in",Paragraph
the century or generally agreed principles: witness Expressionism in the 1920s or,Paragraph
sensualism in the 1950s or the independent Oscar Niemeyer and Frank O.Gehry.,Paragraph
"The house in Riva San Vitalo, Italy (1972-73), by Mario Botta, should send shivers of",Paragraph
"joy through a rationalist because of its precisely extended square, obvious structure and",Paragraph
"responding use of materials, consistent vertical organization, functional expression,",Paragraph

"houses, however, reflected a new concern for economy, efficiency, and the up-to-date",Paragraph
"amenities requested by her upper-middle-class suburban clients. In 1923, Raymond built",Paragraph
her own house out of a partially demolished townhouse on Charles Street on Boston’s,Paragraph

REGIONAL PLANNING,Title
Regional planning began from the idea that the essential basis for planning should be,Paragraph
"geography, not municipal jurisdictional lines. Although today this idea is easily accepted",Paragraph
"in principle, its history has been that of a reasonable proposition often ignored and",Paragraph
frequently difficult to implement.,Paragraph
The beginning of regional planning in the United States is marked by the publication of,Paragraph
"Patrick Geddes’ Cities in Evolution (1915), which first noted the tendency of large cities",Paragraph
to disperse as they grew because of the influence of the automobile and industrial power.,Paragraph
Although the idea of regional planning and governance had been considered as early as,Paragraph
"1909, when the National Municipal League had its annual conference, Geddes recognized",Paragraph
that the concept of a “city line” was being transformed by the growth of metropolitan,Paragraph
"regions, which no longer stopped at the end of municipal jurisdictions but were stretching",Paragraph
"into vast, spread-out areas that he termed “conurbations.” Geddes observed the dispersed",Paragraph
"growth of areas such as Pittsburgh, Chicago, and the entire region between New York",Paragraph
"and Boston and predicted that such growth was the wave of the future, where “millions of",Paragraph
people” would congregate in a way that ignored the significance of city boundaries.,Paragraph
"Geddes, a Scotsman, had a significant influence on a small group of idealistic planners,",Paragraph
"especially Lewis Mumford, who nourished his ideas, elaborated on them with the help of",Paragraph
"other innovative planning founders, and eventually put them into practice in the early",Paragraph
"1920s. However, it was Geddes who established the idea of the geographic region as the",Paragraph
proper object of the planner’s focus.,Paragraph
Geddes was an eccentric man who conducted masques and pageants to recapture past,Paragraph
civic life. His was a large vision of not only how cities should be planned but also how,Paragraph
the world must be transformed from the rule of technology and money into a new utopia.,Paragraph
"This transformation would take place, he maintained, by the creation of a “neotechnic”",Paragraph
"order that evolved through the public conservation of resources, eventually replacing the",Paragraph
present of “more and more of worse and worse.”,Paragraph
"According to Geddes, the regional environment was the appropriate locale for this",Paragraph
"evolution because it contained the seeds for ideal human growth. Thus, his famous",Paragraph
maxim “Survey before plan” meant that attention should be focused on the natural,Paragraph
"geographic characteristics of a region, such as its river basins, watersheds, and geology,",Paragraph
"and its social and cultural composition as well. Without naming it, he described urban",Paragraph
sprawl as a dan-ger to community life (“Towns must now cease to spread like expanding,Paragraph
ink stains and grease spots.”). Geddes was certain that the remedy could be found by,Paragraph
understanding the varied organic composition of regional settlements and planning for,Paragraph
growth by integrating nature into towns that grow “botanically.”,Paragraph
"These ideas were a shock to the system of early 20th-century urban planners, most of",Paragraph
"whom were firm in the embrace of the City Beautiful movement, with the girded, formal,",Paragraph
symmetrical orthodoxy it entailed. A diverse group of unconvinced planners and,Paragraph
"architects, however, sought a different direction. The group, which included Lewis",Paragraph
"Mumford, Clarence Stein, Benton Mackaye, and Charles Harris Whitaker, came under",Paragraph
the influence of Geddes and concocted a scheme that led to the Regional Planning,Paragraph
Association of America (RPAA).,Paragraph
"In 1923, the RPAA published a five-part program that set forth the principles for",Paragraph
regional planning that included the development of new garden city types of communities,Paragraph
over the next few years. The group elaborated on the need for regional planning as an,Paragraph
"antidote to the type of cities such as New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston that",Paragraph
were turning into “dinosaurs” because of the dispersed urbanization that was being,Paragraph
"created by the automobile. Mumford termed this development the “fourth migration,” the",Paragraph
result of a technological revolution that was turning the movement of population centers,Paragraph
outward for the first time. The goal of the RPAA was to lead it into “new channels” by,Paragraph
developing a national plan that would define regions by unified geographic,Paragraph
"characteristics consisting generally of climate, soil, vegetation, industry, and culture.",Paragraph
Part of the RPAA’s argument was economic. Stuart Chase contended that regional,Paragraph
planning could achieve vast improvements over the inefficiencies of transport and energy,Paragraph
that existed without it. Another part of the argument was based on the conservation of,Paragraph
"resources (“Regional planning is the new conservation,” said Mumford), recognizing that",Paragraph
"a regional focus can treat “people, industry and the land” as single unit so that the",Paragraph
"population is distributed in a way that is compatible to its resources. Finally, the",Paragraph
argument rested on the issue of attaining a “fuller quality of life” through regional,Paragraph
planning by developing new communities that harmonized with the natural environment.,Paragraph
These communities were not suburban housing tracts but rather “garden cities” that took,Paragraph
their influence from Ebeneezer Howard and strengthened “indigenous America” against,Paragraph
"the tide of disbursed, thoughtless development.",Paragraph
The RPAA’s diagnosis of the direction of urbanization in the United States was nearly,Paragraph
prophetic. Much of its interpretation of the endemic problems of what Mumford,Paragraph
described as the fourth migration is heard from contemporary urban planners who are,Paragraph
"daily confounded by the effects and consequences of urban sprawl. Moreover, most of",Paragraph
"the current remedies that are proposed to combat sprawl are contained, at least in concept,",Paragraph
within the proposals originally described by the RPAA. In terms of policy,Paragraph
"implementation, however, the RPAA’s influence remains solidly within the realm of",Paragraph
good ideas. The two major experimental communities directly linked to the RPAA—,Paragraph
"Sunnyside Gardens in Queens, New York, and Radburn, New Jersey—exist mainly as",Paragraph
"curiosities on the road to suburbanization, which in the years following the RPAA",Paragraph
"developed as such a powerful tide that regional planning, as envisioned by Mumford,",Paragraph
"Stein, and the rest of RPAA, was essentially pushed out of the picture.",Paragraph
"If the RPAA comprised the formative idealists of regional planning, the planners who",Paragraph
first conceived of the Regional Plan of New York in 1923 were sober pragmatists. The,Paragraph
"group, headed by Thomas Adams and brought together by the Russell Sage Foundation,",Paragraph
set out to create a regional plan for New York that was rooted in achieving economic,Paragraph
efficiencies for a growing concentration of economic activities in the New York area,Paragraph
through a scheme of “recentralization” of business and industry.,Paragraph
"The plan, which encompassed an area of more than 5000 square miles, proved to be",Paragraph
"widely influential in the evolution of the New York metropolitan area, mainly because of",Paragraph
its congeniality to business investment and its grasp of emerging trends in population,Paragraph
"movement and industrial development. Many of its suggestions for highways, bridges,",Paragraph
and tunnels were eventually brought to realization by the power broker Robert Moses.,Paragraph
"Distinctly nonutopian in outlook, the plan called for new roads, parks, and beaches at the",Paragraph
same time that it designated the last significant open space near Manhattan—Hackensack,Paragraph
Meadows in New Jersey—for commercial development and omitted any consideration of,Paragraph
"public housing. In addition, although it steered away from consideration of garden cities",Paragraph
"and ideal communities, it nevertheless included a section by Clarence Perry that",Paragraph
"described the development of “neighborhood units,” which offered a significant",Paragraph
alternative to the model of the suburban single-family house and a source for ideas on,Paragraph
clustered development planning years afterward.,Paragraph
The Regional Plan of New York was the first attempt to address the needs of a,Paragraph
metropolitan area outside its municipal boundaries. Without any regulatory power of,Paragraph
"enforcement, such as zoning, it relied on the power of good planning ideas to achieve its",Paragraph
"goals, which could ill afford to antagonize those engaged in business and investment. To",Paragraph
"Mumford, however, the plan was dreadfully misconceived. His criticisms of the plan and",Paragraph
Thomas Adams’s defense of it constituted one of the most famous dialogues in American,Paragraph
"planning history: Mumford proselytizing for the ideal, Adams for the obtainable.",Paragraph
One of the significant participants in the Regional Plan of New York was Frederic,Paragraph
"Delano, the uncle of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was receptive to the idea of",Paragraph
regional planning well before he became president of the United States. While governor,Paragraph
"of New York, he proposed a state commission (“cooperative planning for the common",Paragraph
good”) in rural homes and frequently spoke supportively of regional planning as a means,Paragraph
to relieve congestion in the cities and redistribute population and industry more equitably,Paragraph
"and responsibly. At about the same time (1930), the National Municipal League",Paragraph
described municipal boundaries as “obsolete” and called for expanded jurisdictional lines,Paragraph
to “give reality to the work of planning principles.”,Paragraph
"In June 1933, shortly after taking office, President Roosevelt pushed a $25 public",Paragraph
works bill through Congress that included funds to establish a resettlement,Paragraph
"administration, which was set up to plan a series of experimental greenbelt towns on the",Paragraph
"periphery of large metropolitan areas. However, the Resettlement Administration’s",Paragraph
"creator, Rexford G.Tugwell, soon came into conflict with Congress, which considered",Paragraph
this effort at regional planning by the federal government the bulwark of socialism.,Paragraph
"Within months, Tugwell and the Resettlement Administration were put out of business,",Paragraph
"although three greenbelt towns were eventually built (Greenbelt, Maryland, near",Paragraph
"Washington, D.C.; Greenhills, near Louisville, Kentucky; and Greendale, Wisconsin,",Paragraph
near Milwaukee).,Paragraph
The most shining symbol of New Deal regional planning was the Tennessee Valley,Paragraph
"Authority (TVA), which was the last direct federal involvement by the federal",Paragraph
government before World War Il. President Roosevelt described the project as an,Paragraph
"exercise in regional planning, but it was actually much more, as it included a massive",Paragraph
flood control project on the 650-mile-long Tennessee River basin and a huge power-,Paragraph
"producing operation that by 1944 was generating half the nation’s power. Originally, it",Paragraph
"was intended also as an armaments production facility, a proposal that President",Paragraph
Roosevelt was successful at eliminating.,Paragraph
The period immediately following World War I saw a resurgence of interest in the,Paragraph
idea of regional planning as the idea of reshaping local governments into regional,Paragraph
"jurisdictions was frequently debated. In 1950, Atlanta adopted its plan for improvement,",Paragraph
"which integrated the relationship of the City of Atlanta to Fulton County. In 1953, the",Paragraph
"Ontario Parliament approved the federated municipality of Metropolitan Toronto,",Paragraph
reflecting what seemed to be the current tide of good planning. Numerous reports and,Paragraph
studies in the early 1950s called for “intergovernmentalizing” services and frequently,Paragraph
petitioned for new interjurisdictional initiatives to better coordinate policies and planning.,Paragraph
"Fueled by a surge in federal spending, these efforts generally sought to make capital",Paragraph
planning on the municipal level more efficient and to coordinate the federal government’s,Paragraph
"spending programs. When Congress passed the Housing Act of 1954, for example, it",Paragraph
included direct federal assistance to regional and metropolitan planning agencies. Shortly,Paragraph
"thereafter, the National Municipal League responded by developing a so-called model",Paragraph
"state and regional planning law. In 1955, the Commission on Intergovernmental",Paragraph
"Relations, known as the Kestnbaum Commission, emphasized that metropolitan areas",Paragraph
were the most critical “focal points” for dealing with urban needs.,Paragraph
"Despite the increased attention to jurisdictional reform, local governments were",Paragraph
"reluctant to disturb traditional lines of authority. Efforts at metropolitan reorganization in,",Paragraph
"for example, Cleveland and St. Louis were ineffective. By 1959, the Advisory",Paragraph
Commission on Intergovernmental Relations was forced to conclude that metropolitan,Paragraph
"reorganization, whether through consolidation or internal restructuring, faced an uphill",Paragraph
battle because of strong local resistance. When voters were faced with public,Paragraph
"referendums, they were either indifferent or opposed. Jurisdictional reform held little",Paragraph
"appeal outside Washington, D.C., or among urban planners focusing on regional matters.",Paragraph
"By the early 1960s, the idea of jurisdictional reform—and with it regional planning and",Paragraph
governance—had lost much momentum. The continued expansion of federal funding and,Paragraph
"the mounting complexity of urban problems, however, required that some new structural",Paragraph
"solution be found. The answer, for the most part inadvertently created, was the",Paragraph
"development of new area-wide organizations of locally elected officials, which soon",Paragraph
came to be referred to as Councils of Governments (COGs).,Paragraph
"A veritable nationwide COGs movement soon developed, nurtured by federal funds. It",Paragraph
"began with the creation of the Detroit-area Inter-County Supervisor’s Committee in 1956,",Paragraph
and by 1960 more than one half of 212 metropolitan areas had created new COGs.,Paragraph
Areawide planning was gaining ground all across the nation. COGs provided a means to,Paragraph
"effectively address metropolitan problems, satisfying federal priorities for increased",Paragraph
coordination of planning functions within the metropolitan region while avoiding the,Paragraph
issue of jurisdictional reform. The federal preference for such planning was,Paragraph
"unambiguous. In the 1960s and 1970s, federal aid programs for highways, mass transit,",Paragraph
"and open space insisted on metropolitan planning as a funding requirement. By 1979, 39",Paragraph
separate federal programs required regional or metropolitan planning as a requirement for,Paragraph
local participation.,Paragraph
Regional planning had found its home within the arms of COGs. Sustained by federal,Paragraph
"financial assistance in the form of Section 701 comprehensive planning grants, regional",Paragraph
planning at long last gained institutional credibility as COGs joined with the National,Paragraph
Association of Regional Councils. Regional planning commissions proliferated as never,Paragraph
"before by becoming COGs. At the same time, however, because of their voluntary nature,",Paragraph
regional planning functions were separated from the idea of regional governance. The,Paragraph
"Miami Valley Regional Planning Commission, the Association of Bay Area",Title
"Governments, and the Metropolitan Washington (D.C.) Council of Governments were",Paragraph
"examples of this type of structure. Although countless regional plans were developed,",Paragraph
"few were implemented in any meaningful way, and many suffered from overly general",Paragraph
"recommendations. Whatever their virtues, most of these plans had the problem of being",Paragraph
politely ignored by local jurisdictions. The regional planning COGS settled into a,Paragraph
"comfortable existence of clearinghouses for federal grants, including those for water-",Paragraph
"quality planning, air-quality planning, solid-waste management, and the A-95 review",Title
"process. Many were limited to information exchange, coordination, technical assistance,",Paragraph
and the provision of some services.,Paragraph
"In speaking about regional planning in the 1930s, the National Municipal League had",Paragraph
"warned that “to be of value plans must be executed.” In the early 1960s, this advice",Paragraph
seemed particularly relevant as the goals of regional planning became separated from,Paragraph
regional governance through the establishment of COGs that had no real ability to,Paragraph
implement their plans.,Paragraph
"Although the COGS structure of regional planning has become the dominant one, there",Paragraph
"are significant exceptions. Since 1967, the Twin Cities Metropolitan Council has been a",Paragraph
prime model for regional planning in a major metropolitan area that effectively combines,Paragraph
"planning, policies, and implementation. Significantly, it came into being as an action by",Paragraph
"the State of Minnesota, not a local referendum. It is distinctive because its role in making",Paragraph
"regional policy is authoritative rather than advisory. With its own political base, it has",Paragraph
enjoyed a relatively productive history working with local municipalities within a seven-,Paragraph
"county area, particularly since passage of the Land Planning Act of 1976, an important",Paragraph
effort in regional growth management.,Paragraph
"Similarly, the Portland (Oregon) Metropolitan Area developed a regional approach to",Paragraph
planning. Its evolution encapsulates both the weaknesses and the strengths of regional,Paragraph
"planning. In the early 1960s, Portland, like many metropolitan areas, established a",Paragraph
voluntary association of governments to address areawide planning needs. The Columbia,Caption
Region Association of Governments (CRAG) originally encompassed an area of four,Paragraph
counties and 14 cities. CRAG emphasized intergovernmental cooperation to combat a,Paragraph
"number of regional problems, such as loss of farmland and the escalating public cost of",Paragraph
spread-out development.,Paragraph
"By the early 1970s, however, it became clear that CRAG’s advisory influence was",Paragraph
"powerless to overcome conflicts among member jurisdictions. In 1973, in response to",Paragraph
"heightened environmental concern, the Oregon State Legislature passed a bill that",Paragraph
significantly strengthened CRAG’s role. It made local membership in CRAG mandatory,Paragraph
and gave it authority to overrule local development plans within 27 participating,Paragraph
"jurisdictions that did not conform to the regional comprehensive plan. This bill, in",Paragraph
"conjunction with the passage of a state land use development law, eventually led to the",Paragraph
"Metropolitan Service District (METRO), a directly elected regional government with",Paragraph
"wide responsibilities. With strong land use powers, METRO became the rare bird of",Paragraph
"regional planning, an organization that came into being from broad public consensus that",Paragraph
is able to address regional land use policies effectively.,Paragraph
Although the federal government retracted many programs fostering regional planning,Paragraph
"in the early 1980s, such as Section 701 comprehensive planning grants, other federal",Paragraph
programs brought about new regional planning responsibilities. The most significant was,Paragraph
"the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, which provided grants to states to develop",Paragraph
comprehensive programs for preserving coastal resources. The result was the,Paragraph
establishment of state-run coastal programs in 18 coastal states that assumed regional,Paragraph
planning responsibility and varying levels of land use control in waterfront areas.,Paragraph
"However, the most significant helping hand that regional planning has received came",Paragraph
about on the state level as a result of heightened interest in growth management,Paragraph
programs. Numerous states have passed some sort of growth management (or “smart,Paragraph
"development”) controls in the last two decades. Usually, state growth management",Paragraph
"strategies have relied on regional planning agencies that came out of COGs, strengthened",Paragraph
"with additional funding and new authority. In general, these regional planning agencies",Paragraph
implement state growth management goals by identifying valuable regional resources and,Paragraph
"developing regional growth management plans. In Florida, for example, eleven regional",Paragraph
planning councils were established to develop plans and review local jurisdiction plans,Paragraph
for consistency. Even states in which regional councils do not exist within a strict,Paragraph
"government framework with regulatory authority, such as Florida, Georgia, Vermont, and",Paragraph
"Maine, nonetheless have regional statutory authority over local plans.",Paragraph
Most growth management strategies are concerned with directing development to,Paragraph
appropriate regions within a regional environment—to limit urban sprawl in favor of,Paragraph
"preserving open space and balancing service capacities. In Oregon, this effort has relied",Paragraph
"on the establishment of regionally drawn urban service boundaries, which attempt to",Paragraph
attain a regional balance between compact development and protection of natural,Paragraph
"resources. In all cases, regional planning councils are concerned with identifying the",Paragraph
greater-than-local planning issues that must be dealt with through an integrated growth,Paragraph
"policy. Increasingly, the recognition that a problem such as urban sprawl requires a",Paragraph
comprehensive area-wide solution has reinvigorated the role of regional planning.,Paragraph

REGIONALISM,Title
Regionalism in architecture is the desire to shape buildings according to the particular,Paragraph
characteristics of a specific place. Regionalism aims to obtain a visual harmony between,Paragraph
"the building and its geographical setting, to connect with the culture and architectural",Paragraph
"traditions of the local area, and to manage the local climate as naturally and as efficiently",Paragraph
as possible. Because regional buildings in a particular place respond to a similar set of,Paragraph
"local characteristics, they will possess a similar look that can often be described as a style",Paragraph
"like “Southwestern” or “Cape Cod,” and as these characteristics vary from place to place,",Paragraph
buildings in different regions will have distinctly different appearances relative to each,Paragraph
other.,Paragraph
Regionalism is the oldest and most pervasive of all building ideas. In the prehistoric,Paragraph
"world, and in vernacular settlements throughout the world, builders used local materials",Paragraph
because they were conveniently at hand. They also adapted their forms to the local,Paragraph
climate in order to moderate temperature swings and to manage precipitation for comfort,Paragraph
"and survival. For example, buildings in hot, dry climates are often constructed of thick",Paragraph
"adobe walls, which first absorb heat during the hot days, providing a cool interior, and",Paragraph
then radiate the heat into the building during the colder nights. Buildings in the wet,Paragraph
climate of Northern Europe evolved steep roofs to shed rain and snow. Most regions of,Paragraph
the world have similarly developed vernacular traditions of building that are well adapted,Paragraph
to their particular geographical circumstances. Distinctive regional vernacular traditions,Paragraph
"include Greek fishing villages, Italian hill towns, and the adobe of Santa Fe. Even today,",Paragraph
a great deal of the mass-produced built environment may be seen as regional in character.,Paragraph
"Houses in the suburbs of London look different from those in Switzerland, which look",Paragraph
different from those in Thailand. When builders are not self-conscious about style or,Paragraph
"fashion, regional tendencies are most likely to emerge because they make practical sense",Paragraph
and derive from successful traditions in the area.,Paragraph
"In the world of high-style or high-status architecture, however, the concept of",Paragraph
"regionalism has had a more complex history. For buildings like temples, public",Paragraph
"monuments, palaces, and corporate headquarters, clients and their designers often seek to",Paragraph
"express power, status, or philosophical outlooks that are not about the practical realities",Paragraph
of dealing with the local climate or geography. These statements are usually about,Paragraph
abstractions and are often meant to apply more universally than to a particular location.,Paragraph
"For example, ancient temples were designed as appropriate homes for deities whose",Paragraph
powers transcended a local place and time. These buildings therefore employed a,Paragraph
rigorous orthogonal geometry that was thought to be more universal and time-less in,Paragraph
character than the more casual geometries that adapted themselves to the peculiarities of,Paragraph
"the local site. More recently, proponents of the International Modernist movement",Paragraph
between the World Wars used a similar palette of industrial forms and materials for,Paragraph
"buildings in widely diverse geographical areas, because they wanted to express a",Paragraph
universal view of modern life and industrialization that transcended individual places.,Paragraph
These two ideas—regionalism and the universal—are not necessarily mutually,Paragraph
exclusive. One might express a universal sense of beauty while still accommodating local,Paragraph
"conditions and traditions, for example. But many times in the history of Western",Paragraph
"architecture, the one has been pursued at the expense of the other and vice versa. Builders",Paragraph
"sensitive to regional practicalities may scoff at higher aesthetic concerns and meanings,",Paragraph
whereas high-fashion designers may disparage regional concerns as parochial or,Paragraph
"inconsequential in relation to bigger philosophical issues. From the Renaissance on, for",Paragraph
"example, many architects transplanted ancient Roman Classical forms to other regions to",Paragraph
"express their connection with the high civilization of Rome, even",Paragraph

To understand the history of regionalism in high-status Western architecture in the,Paragraph
"20th century, one must look back to the end of the 18th century. Until then, high-status",Paragraph
architecture was dominated by various versions of Roman Classical architecture applied,Paragraph
irrespective of the local conditions. But several broad cultural movements in Europe and,Paragraph
America led to a renewed appreciation of different regions and their possibilities for,Paragraph
"design. Namely, the Romantic movement in the arts drew attention to the raw and varied",Paragraph
beauty of nature and to picturesque vernacular villages and cottages that appeared to live,Paragraph
"in harmony with nature. Second, as people began to identify more with their cultural",Paragraph
"groups than with the kingships that had often transcended cultural boundaries, they began",Paragraph
"to look for the special qualities of their own nationality and place, including the",Paragraph
"indigenous architectural traditions that they could claim as their own. Third, the rapidly",Paragraph
expanding Industrial Revolution created manufactured goods of such variable quality that,Paragraph
many began to call for a revival of handcraft by skilled craftspeople. Crafts were,Paragraph
"distinctly regional in character, which encouraged a renewed look at local traditions.",Paragraph

All of these combined in the Gothic Revival movement in the first decades of the 19th,Paragraph
"century, which in turn led to the Arts and Crafts Movement in the latter half of the 19th",Paragraph
century and the first decades of the 20th. The Arts and Crafts architects in Britain revived,Paragraph
"the medieval vernacular traditions of building in their local regions, which they believed",Paragraph
fitted the local culture and climate while embodying good craftsmanship. Charles Rennie,Paragraph
"Macintosh derived a number of his forms from Scottish Baronial castles, Sir Edwin",Paragraph
"Lutyens drew on medieval house forms in the southern English county of Surrey, and",Paragraph
Charles Annesley Voysey stripped down medieval house forms to their underlying,Paragraph
"essences, leading to some of the first simplified modernist architectural forms that",Paragraph
nonetheless still exuded a regional sense of place.,Paragraph
"This new focus on regionalism invaded the Ecole des Beaux Arts, the school of",Paragraph
architecture and art in Paris that had become the world center for teaching the principles,Paragraph
of ancient Roman Classicism. The professor of theory at the Ecole at the turn of the,Paragraph
"century, Julien Guadet, taught that a building in the city should be different from one in",Paragraph
"the country, just as one at the seaside must be different from one in the mountains. This",Paragraph
helped inspire a movement later named Academic Eclecticism by the historian Richard,Paragraph
"Longstreth, which among other things attempted to fuse the regional with the universal.",Paragraph
These architects derived their ideas from traditional architectural styles that they believed,Paragraph
"embodied timeless and universal principles of design, but at the same time they chose",Paragraph
their precedents to fit the particular geographical setting.,Paragraph
The Arts and Crafts tradition and aspects of Academic Eclecticism influenced Frank,Paragraph
"Lloyd Wright, who became America’s most influential spokesperson for the regionalist",Paragraph
idea. Borrowing the phrase “organic architecture” from Louis Sullivan and drawing on,Paragraph
"Japanese design sensibilities, Wright insisted that buildings should harmonize with nature",Paragraph
and sensitively address the local geology and site conditions. While living in Chicago in,Paragraph
"the first decades of the 20th century, he developed the Prairie School, whose low,",Paragraph
horizontal lines he said captured the essence of America’s Midwestern plains. The,Paragraph
buildings that he later designed for the Arizona desert looked distinctly different from the,Paragraph
"ones he designed in Wisconsin, as each responded to the particular local characteristics.",Paragraph
"Wright’s contemporary, Bernard Maybeck, also pursued the regionalist implications of",Paragraph
Academic Eclecticism and the Arts and Crafts movement. After moving to the Bay Area,Paragraph
"of San Francisco before the turn of the century, he began to develop a distinctive style for",Paragraph
the area that was based in part on medieval vernacular German forms and in part on the,Paragraph
Shingle Style that had enjoyed a brief popularity in the northeast seacoast resort towns,Paragraph
"several decades earlier. Despite these disparate and remote sources, Maybeck fused them",Paragraph
"into an organic whole that inspired other architects, including Julia Morgan, and that still",Paragraph
defines much of the special character of the East Bay area today.,Paragraph
"In the first two decades of the 20th century, many other builders and architects",Paragraph
followed this pattern of adapting and combining various architectural traditions to fit a,Paragraph
particular location. The Greene brothers Henry and Charles combined Arts and Crafts,Paragraph
and Japanese traditions for their distinctive version of the Craftsman style in Pasadena.,Paragraph
"Their shallow roofs, open sleeping porches, and casual assymetric forms suited well the",Paragraph
moderate climate and emerging southern California culture.,Paragraph
Regionalism faded in popularity for high-status buildings after the Second World War.,Paragraph
The mood in America and Europe had changed to favor an international outlook and a,Paragraph
"positive view of industrialization, and these were best expressed with the ahistorical,",Paragraph
"technological, and non-regional forms of Modernism. In the 1970s, however, the mood",Paragraph
changed again. As the world economy became more pervasively global in character and,Paragraph
"universal in taste, and as generic office buildings and chain retail stores began to make",Paragraph
"London look like Los Angeles or Houston, many people began to seek again a special",Paragraph
"quality in their particular place. Out of this grew the Historic Preservation movement,",Paragraph
"which sought to save historic buildings and districts for their local character, rather than",Paragraph
risk another blandly generic redevelopment.,Paragraph
"A number of architects have sought regional expressions from the 1980s, including",Paragraph
"Robert Venturi in Philadelphia, Robert Stern in New York, Antoine Predock in New",Caption
"Mexico, Harry Teague in Colorado, and Glenn Murcutt in Australia. Like their",Paragraph
"regionalist predecessors before World War Il, most of these new regionalists have",Paragraph
explored aspects of the traditional styles and vernacular forms that might provide clues to,Paragraph
"appropriate design qualities in their region; but in most cases, their Modernist roots have",Paragraph

"and the traditions of the area, whereas the uninterrupted space within supports the casual",Paragraph
"life-style of living in one large great-room. On closer inspection, however, one can see",Paragraph
that the architect has stripped away the outer skin on part of the facade to reveal the inner,Paragraph
structure and a recessed wall of windows that carefully frames external views. The,Paragraph

REINFORCED CONCRETE,Title
"Several European engineers, working independently, developed reinforced concrete",Paragraph
throughout the 19th century. Francios Hennebique of France was one of many to patent,Paragraph
"his experimental work (1887), and in the last two decades of the 19th century, he devised",Paragraph
"a coherent system of reinforced concrete. By 1917, Hennebique’s international firm had",Paragraph
"completed a staggering 17,000 contracts, forging a worldwide industry. Although the use",Paragraph
"of this type of construction was widespread in Europe, North Africa, and North America",Paragraph
"at the turn of the century, most builders were interested in its fireproofing characteristics,",Paragraph
and few understood the tensile potential inherent in the reinforcing. The notion that steel,Paragraph
and concrete could function monolithically had already been demonstrated on paper and,Paragraph
"in practice by many engineers, but the structural ramifications of that fact required time",Paragraph
to disseminate. Some early experiments erroneously failed to demonstrate that iron,Paragraph
embedded in concrete could withstand a greater load than iron without concrete.,Paragraph
Swiss engineer Robert Maillart was one of the first designers to break from the,Paragraph
masonry past by using steel-reinforced concrete in forms and configurations appropriate,Paragraph
to its technical properties. The monolithic potential of this new material offered great,Paragraph
"advantages in weight and labor, and with new theories of structural analysis emergent in",Paragraph
"the early 20th century, standards for both the design and the construction of reinforced",Paragraph
concrete were adopted in several countries as early as 1902. These standards were,Paragraph
"ultimately invested with quasi-legal status, incorporated into building codes later in the",Paragraph
century.,Paragraph
"Reinforced concrete is the union of two materials: concrete, which is strong in",Paragraph
"compression, and steel, which is strong in tension. Without reinforcing, concrete’s tensile",Paragraph
strength is typically only 10 per cent of its compressive strength. This tensile strength is,Paragraph
"so minimal, in fact, that it is typically omitted from structural calculations. Steel comes in",Paragraph
the form of bars ranging from 3/8 inch to nearly 3 inches in diameter. Placed into,Paragraph
"formwork before the concrete is poured, the steel reinforcing bars, or rebars, are typically",Paragraph
"located where engineers expect stress due to tension to be greatest, referred to as the",Paragraph
"tensile zone (in the case of a simply supported beam, the tensile zone occupies the bottom",Paragraph
"half of the beam). Because steel is also strong in compression, rebars are employed even",Paragraph
"when tension is not expected to be severe, such as in axially loaded columns. One of the",Paragraph
advantages of reinforced concrete is that the concrete insulates the steel during a fire.,Paragraph
Another is that concrete and reinforcing steel expand at approximately the same rate,Paragraph
during fluctuations of temperature. This is important because if the embedded steel were,Paragraph
"to expand at a greater rate than the surrounding concrete, stress and possible failure may",Paragraph
result.,Paragraph
"The embedment of the rebar requires care, however, because several factors can spoil",Paragraph
the advantages of its use. Proper concrete mixes are required so that the steel and the,Paragraph
"concrete bond and thus work as one unit. Also, the concrete must protect the rebar from",Paragraph
"corrosion, although corrosion in limited quantity actually increases bonding. Pouring the",Paragraph
concrete also presents opportunity for error because efforts to force the wet concrete and,Paragraph
its aggregates to fill the formwork can dislocate rebars from their intended position.,Paragraph
"This is also true for wire-mesh reinforcement, which is often used instead of rebar in",Paragraph
"slab-on-grade applications, such as sidewalks, driveways, and floor slabs. Welded strands",Paragraph
of steel formed in a gridlike mesh are often used to resist light tensile stress or to prevent,Paragraph
concrete from cracking because of temperature changes. This form of reinforcing is,Paragraph
"sometimes used to resist more severe stresses, such as the conical shaped wire mesh used",Paragraph
in the columns of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Johnson Wax Company Administration Building,Caption
"(1939) in Racine, Wisconsin. Twenty-two-foot-tall columns were supported by a base",Caption
"only 9 inches in diameter, tapering lotuslike at the ceiling. When a test column was",Paragraph
"axially loaded on the site, the concrete and its welded wiremesh reinforcing supported 60",Paragraph
"tons, five times the anticipated load.",Paragraph
"Generally, there are two ways that a reinforced-concrete structure can fail, namely,",Paragraph
excessive compressive stress or tensile stress. Engineers typically design reinforced,Paragraph
concrete to fail in tension rather than compression by underdesigning the rebar. Most,Paragraph
codes require this because steel fails gradually by yielding before reaching its ultimate,Paragraph
"capacity. When a reinforced-concrete structure fails because of tensile yielding,",Paragraph
"deflection gradually increases and becomes visually detectable. Compressive failure, on",Paragraph
"the other hand, is often sudden and sometimes drastic and even explosive.",Paragraph
"Because concrete is poured rather than cut, rolled, or extruded, designers sometimes",Paragraph
can afford the liberty of shaping structural elements to take special advantage of,Paragraph
"reinforced concrete’s inherent properties. Roof slabs, for instance, can be made 6 inches",Paragraph
thick and folded or curved in dynamic forms. Rebar can be stretched taut in its forms,Paragraph
"before the concrete is poured, thus prestressing the structural member and allowing for",Paragraph
lighter and thinner and thus more efficient structural elements. Reinforcing tenons may,Paragraph
"also be stretched after concrete has set, in a system called post-tensioning, which also",Paragraph
increases the reinforced concrete’s ability to carry loads. As analytical and mathematical,Paragraph
"sophistication has increased, engineers can often anticipate where the most severe lines of",Paragraph
stress are likely to develop in a given structure. The pattern of reinforcing can therefore,Paragraph
"be superimposed over those same lines, called isostatic lines, which is exactly how Italian",Paragraph
engineer Pier Luigi Nervi devised his dramatic scheme for a factory in Rome (Gatti Wool,Paragraph
"Factory, 1951). The underside of the factory’s floor slabs were articulated with an",Paragraph
irregular grid of reinforced beams radiating out from columns and crisscrossed by circles,Paragraph
"of beams concentrically ringing out from those same columns. This irregular, nearly",Paragraph
curvilinear waffle pattern is a classic example of what advocates would call beauty,Paragraph
"derived from pure structure. However, it was a structural solution that may have been",Paragraph
"efficient in its use of concrete and reinforcing, but the irregularity of the grid pattern",Paragraph
"required ex-tremely elaborate formwork, thus reducing the solution’s cost-effectiveness.",Paragraph
"For this reason, as well as the analytical complexity of determining the pattern of stress,",Paragraph
"Nervi’s isostatic-inspired slabs were rarely emulated. Waffle stab systems, however,",Paragraph
"where reinforced beams intersect one another at right angles, forming square voids rather",Paragraph
"than irregular voids and thus becoming more amenable to repetitive formwork, have been",Paragraph
widely used.,Paragraph

"coated fabric membrane. However, relying on the use of advanced structural systems that",Paragraph
produce a high-tech expression has not resulted in an innovation to laboratory design that,Paragraph
has been widely accepted.,Paragraph
"In the decade following World War II, the representational question posed by scientists",Paragraph
to architects became the promotion of a humanistic face for science. New laboratories,Paragraph
were expected to improve the negative social image of science that producing weapons of,Paragraph
mass destruction had in part created. The new labs were to also provide creative,Paragraph
environments in which scientists were encouraged to interact and remain sensitive to the,Paragraph
larger human condition. Notable examples based on these ideas are the Richards Medical,Paragraph

RESORT HOTEL,Title
"The resort hotel is an outgrowth of its 19th-century counterparts, including the spas and",Paragraph
seaside resorts of Great Britain and the United States and the mountain resorts of,Paragraph
Switzerland. The importance of the natural setting makes the relationship between,Paragraph
architecture and site a key component of resort hotel development that continues,Paragraph
throughout the 20th century. The hotel building grouped with associated recreational,Paragraph
"facilities and out-buildings seeks to enhance the experience of natural landscape features,",Paragraph
"such as mountains and bodies of water. For instance, the Suvretta House (1912, Karl",Paragraph
"Koller) in St. Moritz, Switzerland, is closely linked to the adjacent ski slopes, while Hotel",Paragraph
"Negresco (1910-13, Edouard-Jean Niermans) in Nice, France, features water-based",Paragraph
"activities. In comparison to urban commercial hotels, resort hotel architecture emphasizes",Paragraph
"linking interior spaces with the outdoors using balconies, verandas, and courtyards. This",Paragraph
emphasis descends from the horizontal forms and rambling porches of 19th-century,Paragraph
resort hotels.,Paragraph
"Otherwise, resort hotel architecture addresses many of the functional needs that other",Paragraph
"hotels do. The architect must carefully blend elegant public spaces, efficient service",Paragraph
"spaces such as kitchens and laundries, and comfortable guest rooms. With the expansion",Paragraph
"of tourism in the 20th century, many new resort hotels are constructed in places such as",Paragraph
"the Caribbean, the South Pacific, and southern and western portions of the United States,",Paragraph
"making these landscapes newly accessible to tourists traveling by bus, automobile,",Paragraph
"airplane, or train.",Paragraph
Improved railroad transportation during the late 19th and early 20th centuries,Paragraph
encouraged tourism and the development of resort hotels. Railroad companies built and,Paragraph
operated many resort hotels to encourage travel to western Canada or the southwestern,Paragraph
"United States from eastern locations. At the time, these resorts offered the only modern",Paragraph
"facilities in ruggedly beautiful locations, thereby providing a tamed adventure for",Paragraph
travelers. These ventures could be highly profitable but also risky. Resort hotels linked to,Paragraph
"the railroads failed when newer, competing resorts opened nearby; when transportation",Paragraph
patterns changed to favor the automobile; or when other locations became more,Paragraph
fashionable.,Paragraph
"With the growth of tourism in the early 20th century, particularly in the United States",Paragraph
"during the boom years of the 1920s, resort hotels became accessible to a wider economic",Paragraph
"range of guests. Many famous resorts, such as the Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs,",Paragraph
"West Virginia, remain exclusively upper-class playgrounds, but places such as Coney",Paragraph
"Island, Atlantic City, the Poconos, and the Catskills offer resort facilities for middle- and",Paragraph
prosperous working-class urban residents. This proliferation of resorts in the 20th century,Paragraph
represents the expansion of leisure culture across class lines.,Paragraph
Resort hotels often feature eclectic and evocative design motifs to attract guests.,Paragraph
Creative adaptations of regional motifs and historic architectural features give resort,Paragraph
hotels a distinctive ap-pearance and sense of place. A good example is Old Faithful Inn,Paragraph
"(1902-03, Robert C.Reamer), built by the Great Northern Railway at Yellowstone",Caption
"National Park. Materials such as boulders, logs, and peeled branches create an oversized,",Paragraph
romantic version of a frontier cabin combined with a Swiss alpine resort. This theme is,Paragraph
"echoed in other park structures in the West, such as the Canyon Hotel (1910-11), also",Paragraph
"designed by Reamer for Yellowstone, or the Lake McDonald Lodge (1913-14, Cutter",Caption
"and Malgram)} in Glacier National Park, Montana. Despite the rustic motifs, these",Paragraph
"examples are full-service resort hotels dedicated to guest comfort. In each case, the hotel",Paragraph
is situated to provide guests with spectacular views of the natural landscape.,Paragraph
Another noteworthy resort idiom that developed during the first half of the 20th,Paragraph
"century was a modified Spanish mode popularized by the resorts of Florida, California,",Paragraph
and the southwestern United States. The work of architect Addison Mizner in Palm,Paragraph
Beach and Boca Raton typifies the use of fanciful Spanish motifs to create an exotic,Paragraph
regional look promoting Florida as a tourist destination. Mizner’s Cloister Inn (1925-26),Caption
"in Boca Raton is a prime example, featuring the pale pink stucco and red-tiled roof that",Paragraph
was typical of Florida architecture and resort landscape. A carefully asymmetrical plan,Paragraph
arranged around a series of courtyards deliberately invokes the history and incremental,Paragraph
development of Old World buildings.,Paragraph
Resort hotels in the southwestern United States and California use another variation on,Paragraph
Spanish motifs that emphasize the plainer tradition of Spanish Colonial missions in the,Paragraph
"region. The Mission Inn (1902-03, Arthur B.Benton) in Riverside, California, is an",Paragraph
important early example that combines artistic use of white stucco and red tile with,Paragraph
selective copying from extant missions. Resort hotel architecture frequently promotes a,Paragraph
romanticized sense of place for visitors while providing modern accommodations and,Paragraph
comforts.,Paragraph
"After the upheaval of World War LI, tourism resurged in the 1950s, inspiring the",Paragraph
construction of a new generation of resort hotels. A key figure during this period is,Paragraph
"Morris Lapidus, a set designer turned architect who created the most influential resort",Paragraph
hotels of the 1950s. Lapidus’s Fontainebleau Hotel (1953) in Miami Beach was wildly,Paragraph
popular among the public and criticized by the architectural profession for its hybrid of,Paragraph
International Style and updated French Renaissance motifs. The sleek elegance of,Paragraph
Lapidus’s high-rise resort hotels influenced resort hotel design in many of the newly,Paragraph
"developing resort locations, such as Hawaii, Tahiti, Mexico, and South America.",Paragraph
Inexpensive air travel allowed increasingly large numbers of tourists from around the,Paragraph
world to reach faraway vacation places.,Paragraph
"In the second half of the 20th century, the resort setting became secondary to the",Paragraph
"theatricality of the architecture itself, as signaled by Lapidus’s hotels. This new trend is",Paragraph
"most evident in places such as Las Vegas and Orlando, where the location is virtually",Paragraph
unimportant compared to the grandiose stage set of the resort hotel. The element of,Paragraph
fantasy and play inherent in resort architecture is exaggerated as hotels using a variety of,Paragraph
regional and historical themes coexist in their competitive efforts to attract guests. In the,Paragraph
"late 20th century, the resort hotel employs a wide variety of forms while still sharing a set",Paragraph
of functional purposes. These trends and variations reinforce the creativity and luxury,Paragraph
inherent to the best resort hotel development throughout the 20th century.,Paragraph

"appears more suggestive than the orange roofs, golden arches, and smiling faces of the",Paragraph

Americans’ most basic desires and needs. As Americans have become more and more,Paragraph
"reliant on their automobiles, the early tendency of eating a meal of convenience in a",Paragraph
"luncheonette has grown into a consistent alternative to eating at home. Initially, though,",Paragraph
the desire for restaurants needed no automobile.,Paragraph
"Eat-and-run cuisine took shape following the Civil War. The Civil War encampment,",Paragraph
"the chuck wagon of the American West, and the railroad dining car each helped to",Paragraph
"introduce Americans to fast cooking and fast eating. Industrial workers, with a bit of",Paragraph
"discretionary income and very limited time, became some of the first consumers of",Paragraph
"meals—particularly lunch—at establishments called beaneries, greasy spoons, and stool",Paragraph
"lunches. By the end of the 19th century, the expansion of commercial cities into white-",Paragraph
collar labor combined with mass transportation’s creation of the commuter to further,Paragraph
American interest in eating out. Cafeterias designed specifically for the luncher on a,Paragraph
timetable allowed customers to move along a line while selecting from a display of daily,Paragraph
"items. Delicatessens provided sandwiches, and stores such as Woolworth’s installed",Paragraph
lunch counters.,Paragraph
"Between 1910 and 1927, the estimated number of restaurants grew by 40 percent. In",Paragraph
"New York City, the number of eating establishments grew from 7500 in 1915 to 17,000",Paragraph
in 1925. Scholars suggest many factors for this change in American behavior: a greater,Paragraph
"number of men and women working a way from home, a decline in the use of domestic",Paragraph
"help to prepare meals, and Prohibition, which eliminated bars and the social life that",Paragraph
accompanied them. There were also technological advances that facilitated this type of,Paragraph
"food preparation, including, refrigeration, shipping, storing, packing, and so forth. At this",Paragraph
"point, the propensity to eat out met its mate for the rest of the 20th century: the",Paragraph
automobile.,Paragraph
"As the automobile became more familiar in everyday American life after 1920,",Paragraph
planners and developers formalized refueling stations for the human drivers. Tearooms,Paragraph
were one of the earliest way stations designed to support family travel. The term conjured,Paragraph
"an obviously safe establishment during the era of the speakeasy. With a limited menu,",Paragraph
"based around afternoon tea, ice cream, cold drinks, and standard lunches or dinners,",Paragraph
packaging was critical for the first time in the industry. Owners used quaint names such,Paragraph
"as Copper Kettle, Wishing Well, Pine Cone, or Silver Spring to reinforce their family",Paragraph
"image. Most often, such establishments could be found along major tourist routes to",Paragraph
resorts. This was the model followed by one of the industry great entrepreneurs.,Paragraph
"Beginning in 1925, Howard D.Johnson took the form of the tearoom to develop the",Paragraph
"nation’s first great restaurant chain. During his family’s own travels, Johnson realized",Paragraph
that the new highways of the Northeast were almost entirely without food services for the,Paragraph
"traveler. After opening a few restaurants, Johnson expanded his operation in 1935 by",Paragraph
permitting individual investors (called agents rather than franchisees) to build their own,Paragraph
Howard Johnson’s. The restaurants combined all the aspects of the tearoom with the first,Paragraph
"recognizable, roadside architectural form: the orange roof combined with a colonial",Paragraph
"motif. In doing so, Johnson married the familiar with striking oddity. By 1940, the chain",Paragraph
"included 125 restaurants, and Johnson had secured exclusive access to the nation’s",Paragraph
greatest expressway: the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Details from colonial architecture were,Paragraph
used by Johnson as well as by the Dutchland Farms chain to add dignity to restaurants.,Paragraph
"Along the highway, such restaurants loomed like a colonial mansion, often with trappings",Paragraph
"of farm or country life added as well. After World War Il, Howard Johnson’s and other",Paragraph
similar restaurants would abandon colonial detail to become bastions of modernist,Paragraph
"design. In many ways, such restaurant design defines the postmodern landscape that we",Paragraph
call the “strip.”,Paragraph
No structure reflected the connection between modern design and eating-out like the,Paragraph
"American diner. First manufactured as lunch-cars in the early 1900s, the metal, self-",Paragraph
contained diner could be set down and wired up almost anywhere. Offering low cost and,Paragraph
"instant gratification for purchasers, the diner quickly became a standardized form on the",Paragraph
American roadway. This provided owners with a bit of recognition without the central,Paragraph
"control demanded from Johnson and other chains. After World War II, many diners could",Paragraph
not compete with the newer fast-food chains. The survivors often exaggerated their,Paragraph
"Modern detail, abandoning the resemblance to a rail car for a wider form—still pre-",Paragraph
"fabricated steel—that could seat family diners. The competitors, however, were not",Paragraph
slowing down.,Paragraph
"From the earliest days of auto travel, food stands informally provided refreshment in",Paragraph
"rapid, accessible fashion with no thought toward image or ambience. Convenience",Paragraph
"defined such locations, though there was variation within the fast-food form. White",Paragraph
Castle hamburgers (1921) combined the food stand with the restaurant to create a,Paragraph
restaurant that could be put almost anywhere. Drive-in restaurants would evolve around,Paragraph
"the idea of quick service, often allowing drivers to remain in their automobile. Fast food",Paragraph
"as a concept, of course, derives specifically from Ray Kroc and the McDonald’s concept",Paragraph
that he marketed out of California (1952). Clearly the idea of providing service to,Paragraph
automobile drivers had created an entire offshoot of the restaurant industry.,Paragraph
The design of such establishments quickly became part of the attraction. Most,Paragraph
"important, each of these types accentuated its contemporariness by incorporating modern",Paragraph
"design, including heavy use of glass, metal, and neon lighting. Kroc was one of the first",Paragraph
restaurateurs to understand the importance of the physical structure. He required each,Paragraph
franchise to duplicate the standard building design—the now-famous structure with its,Paragraph
"overhanging slanted roof, visual front, wall panels decorated in striped tile, and flanking",Caption
"golden arches. The form would, of course, change with consumption patterns. For",Paragraph
"instance, restaurants would eventually incorporate drive-through windows into the overall",Paragraph
design. The standardization of such structures defined American eating patterns along the,Paragraph
“strip” through the end of the 20th century.,Paragraph
"Although each restaurant and shopping mall bore its own design and architecture,",Paragraph
planners and developers synched the entire composite into a design referred to as the,Paragraph
commercial strip. Restaurants led the way from Main Street and downtown into the,Paragraph
suburban regions. The trend toward automobility demanded a new organization to the,Paragraph
landscape and restaurants had already pointed toward planned areas outside of urban or,Paragraph
"town centers. Fast food became the anchor of such “strips,” with McDonald’s or Burger",Paragraph
King generally acting as the first wave of commercial development. Design has followed,Paragraph
this trend while adding a dash of the amusement park: postmodern designs such as those,Paragraph
of Taco Bell cartoon bone fide architectural styles such as Mission to distinguish,Paragraph
themselves from the rest of the strip. Although diners have largely been squeezed out of,Paragraph
"the market, new family dining restaurants such as TGlFridays have created a",Paragraph
homogenized form that is somewhere between fast food and a “sit-down” restaurant. The,Paragraph
"strip is the home for each, as it is for most contemporary restaurants.",Paragraph
"In urban areas, the restaurant landscape has continually evolved to meet the demands",Paragraph
of changing tastes and needs. Although dining rooms for the wealthy established,Paragraph
"themselves by the middle of the 19th century, these were often luncheonettes or inns and",Paragraph
taverns. Demographic trends (including residential patterns in ethnicity and economic,Paragraph
class) significantly influenced the overall development of restaurants for other classes of,Paragraph
"patrons. In urban areas, restaurants, with department stores, theaters, and hotels, were",Paragraph
made more viable and widely available by the introduction of electricity during the,Paragraph
1890s. Entire shopping and eating districts could now be open into the evening; most,Paragraph
"important, restaurants were no longer stifled by the limitations of midday meals or",Paragraph
overnight patronage. This new opportunity was seized by many entrepreneurs.,Paragraph
"Between 1910 and 1930, Americans began to consider eating out a much more viable",Paragraph
"option. Most important, many more men and women were working away from home and",Paragraph
required the convenience of available dining. This trend coincided with a drop in,Paragraph
"available domestic helpers to assist in making meals and Prohibition, which eliminated",Paragraph
"barrooms between 1919 and 1933. This, of course, created a social void for many",Paragraph
"Americans. Finally, technological developments such as refrigeration and food packing",Paragraph
and shipping made it much more conceivable to produce meals for many customers at,Paragraph
once.,Paragraph
"In the early 1900s, efforts to differentiate restaurants as well as the growing diversity",Paragraph
"of American population stimulated the growth of ethnic eateries. In urban areas, ethnic",Paragraph
cuisine became a way of sharing cultural enclaves with patrons from other ethnic groups.,Paragraph
"For instance, Chinatowns became well defined at least partly through the restaurateur.",Paragraph
This diversity has only grown more obvious. From barbecue pits in the Southeast and,Paragraph
"beef houses in the Great Plains to fish houses in the Pacific Northwest, regional cuisines",Paragraph
"have become a terrific indicator of cultural plurality, which the U.S. began to achieve",Paragraph
after 1980. Although mass communications has flattened out much of the dining,Paragraph
"experience nationally, diverse opportunities in dining allow Americans in many urban",Paragraph
areas to choose from as many as 100 different cuisines.,Paragraph
Although ethnicity continues to be a driving force in the distribution and selection of,Paragraph
"restaurants, other patterns are also observable in the demographics of the restaurant",Paragraph
business. Technologies such as the automobile allowed restaurants to move outside of,Paragraph
urban areas. This trend placed a priority on modern design elements such as signage and,Paragraph
"the use of windows, each of which suggested the streamlining trend of modern design.",Paragraph

"When Viljo Revell was born in 1910 in the Finnish coastal town of Vaasa, his",Paragraph

"1917, competing domestic interests manifested themselves in the Red and White Armies,",Paragraph
"which embarked upon a brutal, class-based civil war.",Paragraph
The 1920s saw the brief emergence of an architecture that responded to Finland’s,Paragraph
"independence, a national romanticism characterized by a prevalence of wooden materials",Paragraph
used in Finnish vernacular building. Classicism inspired the symmetrical floor plans and,Paragraph
"exterior elevations, as well as the building ornament—garlands, medallions, columns, and",Paragraph

years his energies were devoted to conducting research into the development of standards,Paragraph

"and methods for prefabrication. Revell’s first large-scale project did come out of this era,",Paragraph
nonetheless. The Romantic style of his vocational school for the Liperi Rehabilitation,Paragraph
Centre for War Consumptives (1948) was indicative of the nostalgia that briefly,Paragraph
"developed after World War Il, as Finland renounced modernism and reverted to the",Paragraph
Romantic Nationalism that had dominated the early decades of the century.,Paragraph
"After entering private practice, Revell’s first successful competition entry was for the",Paragraph
"Industrial Centre and Teollisuuskeskus Building, also known as the Palace Hotel (1952),",Paragraph
"overlooking the Helsinki harbor and market. Designed in collaboration with Keijo Petaja,",Caption
the Palace Hotel was one of many design projects in which Revell was quite content to,Paragraph
"share the limelight with others, even those with less experience than himself. His",Paragraph
unprejudiced attitudes and his ability to encourage innovative design solutions became a,Paragraph
"trademark of Revell’s approach to architectural practice, and because of this, he attracted",Paragraph
young and talented newcomers to his studio.,Paragraph

opening off corridors whose widths corresponded with anticipated circulation loads. In a,Paragraph
"Le Corbusian manner, the mass of the building was elevated on two-story-tall columns,",Paragraph
or pilotis. Revell’s logical approach to design was evident in the hotel’s clearly,Paragraph
"articulated circulation patterns and floor plans. His attention to details, particularly",Paragraph
"noticeable in the fashionable Grill Restaurant, was evident throughout.",Paragraph
"Postwar conditions had a tremendous impact on the Finnish economy, and beginning",Paragraph
"in the 1950s, the government’s policy of reconciliation and declared state of neutrality",Paragraph
saw Finland precariously balanced between the Soviet Union and Western Europe.,Paragraph
Revell’s Reconstruction Agency was just one aspect of the social-welfare system that,Paragraph
Finland adopted to care for war survivors and to establish a thriving industrial sector in,Paragraph
what had previously been an agricultural economy. With the 1953 Housing Production,Paragraph
"Act, the government embarked on two decades of intensive construction programs to",Paragraph
"provide subsidized housing for the over 400,000 refugees who had arrived from the",Paragraph
Soviet territories. Severely restricted funding often resulted in sterile and boring,Paragraph
"apartment blocks and row houses, suburban developments, and new towns. Occasionally,",Paragraph
"some were internationally recognized for the excellent quality of their design, but more",Paragraph
"often they became bleak dormitory villages for newly uprooted migrants, isolated far",Paragraph
from essential services and lifestyle amenities. Revell’s architectural commissions,Paragraph
"attempted to find suitable solutions for these issues, and his systematic approach enabled",Paragraph
"him to become a master of conservative, yet innovative, use of space, materials, and",Paragraph
energy resources.,Paragraph
"In 1952 construction began on Tapiola, the internationally admired garden-city suburb",Paragraph
of Helsinki. Revell’s office designed five standardized apartment buildings and a school,Paragraph
during the community’s first and second development phases. Typical of government-,Paragraph
"supported projects of this era, the apartment sizes were strictly limited, and whenever",Paragraph
"these were exceeded, Revell had to compensate by making other apartments even",Paragraph
"smaller. For these projects, Revell experimented with using prefabricated elements, at the",Paragraph
time a novel application for residential construction in Finland.,Paragraph
"Revell was also able to apply his rational approach to smaller scale housing, such as",Paragraph
"the Karjensivu Rowhouse (1955), sited on a rocky hillside fronting a bay near Helsinki.",Paragraph
"To minimize costs and maximize comfort, he selected the row house form, putting all",Paragraph
"living spaces on the upper level and utility rooms, garage, sauna, and entrance on the",Paragraph
ground floor. Movable partitions and modular cupboards enabled occupants to customize,Caption
the interiors. Radiant floor heating provided evenly distributed warmth at minimum cost.,Paragraph
Energy expenses were also addressed by constructing the entire wall overlooking the bay,Paragraph
"of fixed triple-glazed windows, thus creating Finland’s first glass-walled building.",Paragraph
"In conjunction with community and residential projects, Revell’s office applied the",Paragraph
systematic process to the design of several schools. The Meilahti Primary School (1953),Caption
"in Helsinki was designed with Osmo Sipari. Classrooms were arrayed in a sinuous line,",Paragraph
"part of which curved protectively around an outdoor play area, sheltering the students",Paragraph
from the winds and reflecting the sun’s warmth. The school’s design was adapted to the,Paragraph
"landscape, its plan being clearly separated into distinct functional modules, which along",Paragraph
with the outdoor play areas stepped up the sloping terrain.,Paragraph
The postwar peace treaty negotiated between Finland and the Soviet Union also,Paragraph
included reparations in the form of “goods in kind” to be paid to the Soviet Union until,Paragraph
"1952, and in order to meet these obligations, Finland undertook industrial development",Paragraph
on a massive scale. Many architectural practices designed factories with workers’,Paragraph
"accommodations, and the competition for the Hyvon-Kudeneule hosiery factory and",Paragraph
employee housing (1955) near Hanko was won by Viljo Revell and Osmo Lappo.,Paragraph
"Primary attention was given to planning an efficient assembly process, minimizing",Paragraph
"energy consumption, and reducing operational costs. Revell specified a combination of",Paragraph
"prefabricated and cast-in-place reinforced concrete elements, as well as corrugated",Paragraph
"anodized aluminum sheets for finishing the exterior walls. To visually unify the complex,",Paragraph
all buildings contained a limited variety of materials and structural forms. The designs of,Paragraph
such industrial complexes were a natural expression of Revell’s functional design talent.,Paragraph
"Revell’s work was not confmed to utilitarian projects, however. In 1958, he completed",Paragraph
a private commission for the Danish-born entrepreneur and art collector Gunnar,Paragraph
Didrichsen—a villa on the Helsinki island of Kuusisaari. Revell used the hilltop site to,Paragraph
"advantage, creating a two-story wall of triple-glazed windows overlooking the water. The",Paragraph
"flat roof with its thick parapet extended out over the window walls, but the central portion",Paragraph
"of the roof was raised, and clerestory windows let natural light flood the central portion",Paragraph
of the house. Revell also designed the built-in furnishings and architectural hardware. In,Paragraph
"the wooded surroundings the Didrichsens installed a sculpture garden that included, at",Paragraph
"Revell’s request, the Archer by Henry Moore. To house their growing art collection, a",Paragraph
"new wing was added in 1965, and the villa now functions as the Didrichsen Art Museum,",Paragraph
Viljo Revell’s architecture being a major theme.,Paragraph
Given the international renown of Finnish architects Alvar Aalto and Eero Saarinen,Paragraph
"and the provocative urban development projects, the outside world began to take note of",Paragraph
"this small northern country. In 1958, Revell was prompted to enter the competition for a",Paragraph
"new city hall in Toronto, Canada, and from among a field of over 500, the jury selected",Paragraph
his proposal. Revell worked in association with the large Canadian modernist firm of,Paragraph
John B. Parkin Associates. His design for the Toronto City Hall (1965) included two,Paragraph
towers of unequal height rising facing each other above a multistoried plinth. Between,Caption
"the towers, the saucer-shaped council chamber was a discrete element supported on",Paragraph
slender piers. The elliptically shaped floor slabs of the office towers cantilevered out,Caption
"from the massive rear walls, creating open floor areas that would provide maximum",Paragraph
flexibility for interior layouts. The building group created by these three elements was,Paragraph
fronted by an open plaza (Nathan Phillips Square) containing a large reflecting pool,Paragraph
"spanned by elliptical arches, an elevated walkway around the perimeter, and a massive",Paragraph
"rendition of Henry Moore’s sculpture, the Archer. As with many publicly funded",Paragraph
"projects, the issue of cost overruns soon came to the fore, and Revell was constantly",Paragraph
"forced to compromise his unique design, even after construction was well underway.",Paragraph
"Massive columns soon interrupted the open interior spaces, the council chamber was",Paragraph
"supported on an immense concrete cylinder that overwhelmed the interior spaces below,",Paragraph
"and building finishes were frequently modified. In the view of several critics of the day,",Paragraph
Revell’s bold and innovative concept was altered to such a degree that construction of the,Paragraph
"City Hall should not have proceeded. In spite of the controversy, the Toronto City Hall",Paragraph
"became a well-loved nexus for the city’s inhabitants, and as an international landmark of",Paragraph
"Modern architecture, it garnered an international reputation for Viljo Revell.",Paragraph
"Unfortunately, Revell’s health seriously declined during this period, and close friends",Paragraph
ascribed his premature death to the turmoil surrounding this project.,Paragraph
"While living in North America, Revell designed a lakeside cottage (1960) for the",Paragraph
"H.F.Johnsons in northern Wisconsin. The cottage, with its sauna overhanging the water’s",Paragraph
"edge, was built using traditional, load-bearing timber construction methods. The",Paragraph
horizontal emphasis and open planning concepts of modernism provide a counterpoint to,Paragraph
the natural materials.,Paragraph
When the World Health Organization held a competition for the design of their new,Paragraph
"Geneva Administrative Headquarters in 1960, Revell was one of the 15 architects invited",Paragraph
"to participate. The collaborative entry, submitted by Revell and three other Finnish",Paragraph
"colleagues, garnered an Honourable Mention. They adhered to modernist principles,",Paragraph
elevating the low-rise building above a broad terrace. Recognizing that employees would,Paragraph
"be from many countries, the designers minimized the use of long, isolating office",Paragraph
"corridors. They created a triangular-shaped central volume containing an open hall,",Paragraph
"council chamber, and museum, which connected the three projecting wings.",Paragraph
"In 1962, Revell worked on his final project submission with a team of Finnish",Paragraph
"architects and engineers. Although never constructed, the design of the office tower for",Paragraph
Peugeot in Buenos Aires displayed an innovative use of concrete and steel technology.,Paragraph
The competition drawings described a pedestrian plaza and massive underground parking,Paragraph
"garage at the base of the building, surmounted by a skyscraper, which was subdivided",Paragraph
into three groups of 12 to 14 floors. Each group was separated by three-story-high,Paragraph
concave beams spanning between tapering pairs of structural piers located at each corner,Caption
of the tower. Each cluster of concrete floor slabs was supported by internal prestressed,Paragraph
"cables and exterior cable nets, suspended from the centrally located services core and the",Paragraph
massive tie beams.,Paragraph
"In hindsight, the architectural community has realized that Finland produced several",Paragraph
"talented designers during the postwar decades although they were, at the time, eclipsed",Paragraph
by the greater reputations of Aalto and Saarinen. In achieving national and international,Paragraph
"recognition, Viljo Revell is considered a leader of this group. Revell did not limit his",Paragraph
"modernist ideals to a particular genre of architecture, and his designs covered the",Paragraph

"Architect, India",Title
"Despite his rigorous education and training in modernist design aesthetics, Raj Rewal",Paragraph
"remains rooted in the culture of his native India. As Rewal himself noted, “Our",Paragraph
generation has been trying to discover the common thread in which the fabric of Indian,Paragraph
architecture has been woven in the past and its significance for our times.”,Paragraph
Rewal’s concern is with understanding the architectural history of India (especially of,Paragraph
the Mughal period) and forms such as the Aaveli (or urban courtyard house) of the,Paragraph
Rajasthan region; the attention to materials and climatic design mark each of his projects.,Paragraph
"Most of the architect’s buildings have been erected in the public sector, mainly",Paragraph
institutional complexes and low- to middle-income housing. Most of his buildings are in,Paragraph
"New Delhi, the Indian capital, although since the 1980s he has built more widely,",Paragraph
including outside the country.,Paragraph
Rewal’s early project for the French Embassy Staff Residences (1967-69) reveals his,Paragraph
preoccupation with concrete as a structural material with brick-and-stone in-fill. The,Paragraph
clustering of the lowrise units and their orientation to the sun and wind are a proto-type,Paragraph
"for his later, larger housing schemes. This is taken to much greater heights in his",Paragraph
"Permanent Exhibition Complex (1970-74) at Delhi’s trade fairgrounds, consisting of the",Paragraph
Hall of Nations and the Hall of Industries—large single-volume spaces—the largest of,Paragraph
which spans 78 meters and is 34 meters high. The structures are articulated as precast-,Paragraph
"concrete space frames. This experimentation, with the engineer Mahendra Raj, translates",Paragraph
"the use of steel and concrete, adapting the technology for local conditions and labor-",Paragraph
intensive building skills.,Paragraph
"Rewal’s consistent use of concrete structure with block in-fill, usually clad in the beige",Paragraph
"and red sandstone used in many historic buildings, gives his architecture a signature",Paragraph
"quality. The sense of stability and mass in his works are, to some extent, offset by their",Paragraph
"verticality and cantilevering of forms, as is evident in his office building, Engineers India",Paragraph
House (1979-83) and Standing Conference of Public Enterprises (SCOPE) office,Paragraph
"building (1980-89), both in New Delhi. In the latter project, the fragmentation of",Paragraph
volumes and the series of interlocking polygonal structures with their deep recessed,Paragraph
opening and sunscreens help to modulate his “metabolic Brutalism.” This form of,Paragraph
expression was continually refined until he produced his elegant World Bank Building,Paragraph
"(1993), built around a central square courtyard.",Paragraph
"In another of Rewal’s preoccupations—that of housing—he tries, usually successfully,",Paragraph
"to reconcile a rationalist sense of function, structure, and fabrication with typologies",Paragraph
"abstracted from the past. His Sheikh Serai Housing (1970-82), with its cruciform site",Paragraph
"plan and large central public square connected by pathways, keeps parking in central",Paragraph
areas surrounded by housing clusters. The notion of pedestrian streets and the grouping of,Paragraph
low-rise units was further developed in the elegant Asian Games Village (1980-82).,Paragraph
"Comprised of 500 units, the Village is clustered in groups around courtyards, separated",Paragraph
by “gateways” and connected internally by a series of open spaces and paths reserved for,Paragraph
pedestrians. It provides an insight into his strategy for dense low-rise (up to four stories),Paragraph
development.,Paragraph
Rewal’s notion of the “living unit” as a combination of indoor and outdoor flexible,Paragraph
space and patterns of growth that can be multiplied in numerous combinations is taken to,Paragraph
new heights in his CIDCO mass-housing scheme (of which 1048 units were built by,Paragraph
"2000) in Belapur, New Mumbai, as part of a much larger settlement. The units (each an",Paragraph
average of 40 square meters) on a site of 19 acres achieve a density of 55 units per acre.,Paragraph
"The units are organized in seven neighborhoods, each defined by a system of peripheral",Paragraph
"roads built along contours of the site. Here, as in all his works, Rewal’s attention to open",Paragraph
landscaped (planted and hard) areas is an integral part of his conception of space and,Paragraph
movement through the project.,Paragraph
Rewal is perhaps best known for his institutional projects. These complexes respond to,Paragraph
"the hot, dry climate and urban environment, providing interlocking spaces, streets,",Paragraph
"pavilions, terraces, and gardens surrounded by buildings. As the architectural critic Razia",Paragraph
"Grover noted,” [They] are meshed in a system that responds to climate as well as the",Paragraph
"pragmatic requirements of each scheme.” For example, the National Institute of",Paragraph
Immunology (1983-90) uses the rocky site and central courtyard around which to,Paragraph
organize the building. Again in the Central Institute of Educational Technology (CIET;,Caption
"1986-89), the courtyard generates the spatial complexity of the building.",Paragraph
"With the Parliament Library (1989-2001) and the World Bank Building (1990-93),",Paragraph
"both in New Delhi, and the Ismaili Centre in Lisbon, there is a shift in Rewal’s",Paragraph
architecture to a concern with what one might term a “symbolic ethos” that reflects the,Paragraph
"essence of culture in building. Rewal’s term for this is rasa (literally, “the juice of the",Paragraph
"core”). The Library, won through a major competition, forms part of Lutyn’s Capitol",Paragraph
"Complex in Delhi. In response to the built surroundings and the climate, the building is",Paragraph
"essentially depressed under a plaza forming its roof, with parts visible above this plane.",Paragraph
This formal contextual gesture is a success. The World Bank also reveals a similar,Paragraph
introspective stance and attention to detail with a resolution seldom found in,Paragraph
contemporary Indian buildings. This synthesis of classicism with modern sensibilities,Paragraph
evokes a feeling that the architect has been able to draw on what the anthropologist,Paragraph
Claude Lévi-Strauss called the “deep structure” of society without having to resort to,Paragraph
using imagery of the past.,Paragraph
"A departure from Rewal’s more familiar imagery, materials, and technology was made",Paragraph
"in a social and religious complex, the Lisbon Ismaili Center (1995-99). The garden court",Paragraph
"is surrounded by an expressive steel structure, clad in stone, marble, and more steel, in a",Paragraph
"more fragmented and Western version of his buildings in India. Here, too, there is a",Paragraph
"concerted effort to come to terms with the local climate, culture, and built environment.",Paragraph
"The vocabulary of interlocking spaces, expression of structure, use of materials and",Paragraph
"technology, attention to detail, and craftsmanship define the contemporary sensibility that",Paragraph

"Architect and furniture designer, the Netherlands",Title
Gerrit Thomas Rietveld was a prolific designer of furniture and architecture whose two,Paragraph
"most famous works, the Red-Blue Chair (1918) and the Schréder-Schrader House (1924),",Paragraph
are considered icons of early modern architecture and design. Rietveld’s career spanned,Paragraph
more than 40 years and included numerous designs for buildings and furniture as well as,Paragraph
"a number of published articles. An important figure in the De Stijl movement, Rietveld",Paragraph
was concerned primarily with the experience of architectural space. Through the,Paragraph
"articulation of component parts, scale, and structure, he created designs that, although not",Paragraph
"monumental, provided a setting that elevated the life of the occupant.",Paragraph
"Born on 24 June 1888 in Utrecht, Rietveld left school at age 11 to work in his father’s",Paragraph
furniture maker’s shop. He left his father’s shop in 1906 to work as a draftsman in the,Paragraph
"jewelry studio of C.J.Begeer in Utrecht, simultaneously pursuing architecture and",Paragraph
"drawing courses in the evening. In 1911, Rietveld established his own furniture maker’s",Paragraph
shop in Utrecht and continued his evening architectural studies under the architect,Paragraph
"P.Houtzagers. During this time, he designed several shops and a collection of furniture",Paragraph
"commissioned by H.G.J.Schelling, an architect for Dutch Rail.",Paragraph
The first design for which Rietveld received recognition was the Red-Blue Chair.,Paragraph
"Originally of unfinished wood, Rietveld added the color to articulate the individual",Paragraph
components. Two planes set at an angle to each other create the seat and back and rest on,Paragraph
a composition of horizontal and vertical rails. Extension of the wooden rails and planes,Paragraph
beyond their intersection points accents the open quality of the composition. An early,Paragraph
version of the chair had side panels that were later removed to create a greater feeling of,Paragraph
"openness. The cross section of the rail, emphasized with the bright yellow paint,",Paragraph
establishes a modular system for the chair. The Red-Blue Chair was followed by other,Paragraph
"pieces of furniture, including a buffet, in a similar style of horizontal and vertical rails.",Paragraph
"In 1921, Truus Schréder-Schrider commissioned Rietveld to design a study in the",Paragraph
house she shared with her husband and three children. This small commission was the,Paragraph
beginning of a collaboration and friendship that continued for many years and resulted in,Paragraph
his most famous design: the Schréder-Schrader House. Considered to be the preeminent,Paragraph
"architectural manifestation of the De Stijl movement, the house is the creation of a total",Paragraph
living environment based on Mrs. Schréder-Schrader’s ideas about modern living and,Paragraph
Rietveld’s spatial explorations. Rietveld saw in De Stijl an alignment with his own,Paragraph
interest in the study of new definition of architectural space. Both the Red-Blue Chair and,Paragraph
"the Schréder-Schrider House were prominently featured in the publication De Srijl,",Paragraph
edited by Theo van Doesburg.,Caption
"In 1928, Rietveld was a founding member of the first CLAM (Congrés Internationaux",Paragraph
d’Architecture Moderne) in Switzerland and was a deputy delegate in the 1930 CIAM in,Paragraph
Frankfurt with Mart Stam. Rietveld’s interest in modernism included the role of,Paragraph
"industrialization and mass production in architecture and design. In 1929, he proposed the",Paragraph
"“core” house in which vertical circulation, plumbing, and heating were condensed into a",Paragraph
prefabricated core around which the house would be built. Presented in a 1929 exhibition,Caption
"in Utrecht, the concept was well received, but none was ever built. Rietveld designed a",Paragraph
"number of housing projects, many in conjunction with Truus Schréder-Schrader,",Paragraph
"including a series of row houses across from the Schréder-Schrader House. In 1930,",Paragraph
"Rietveld designed, on invitation, five row houses for the 1930-32 Werkbund Siedlung in",Paragraph
Vienna.,Paragraph
This interest in industrialization can also be seen in a series of designs for economical,Paragraph
furniture by Rietveld and produced by Metz & Co. These included a line of “crate”,Paragraph
"furniture (1934), easily assembled from precut parts, and the famous Zig-Zag Chair",Paragraph
"(1934), a single bent plane of wood. Industrialization for Rietveld provided a means by",Paragraph
which good design could be made accessible as well as having the ability to eliminate the,Paragraph
repetition of tasks required in hand production. Although economy was key in terms of,Paragraph
"both cost and manufacture, Rietveld was equally concerned with the function and",Paragraph
flexibility of an item.,Paragraph
"Despite his early successes, however, it was not until the 1950s that Rietveld began to",Paragraph
"receive larger commissions. Prior to that time, he had produced small commercial and",Paragraph
"residential designs, some in a distinctly vernacular character. In 1954, Rietveld received",Paragraph
"the commission for the Netherlands Pavilion for the Venice Biennale, where he used the",Paragraph
architecture to create a distinct yet subdued exhibition space through the integration of,Paragraph
"natural light. Also in 1954, and initially intended as a temporary",Paragraph

"structure, was the Sonsbeek Pavilion in Amhem, which was later reconstructed in",Paragraph
"Otterlo. As in the Schréder-Schrider House, Rietveld explored the layering of spaces",Paragraph
through the dissolution of boundaries. The Pavilion is a composition of seemingly,Paragraph
independent horizontal and vertical planes creating a series of spaces that are,Paragraph
"simultaneously redefined by glass walls. Rietveld manipulated economical materials,",Paragraph
"such as concrete block stacked on its side so that the holes are visible, wood, and glass, to",Paragraph
create an interpenetration of space similar to the work of Mies van der Rohe’s Barcelona,Paragraph
Pavilion.,Paragraph
"Rietveld began designs for two prominent art academies, as well as for the De Ploeg",Paragraph
"Textile Factory (1956), that exemplify his later works. In 1961, he entered into a",Paragraph
successful partnership with the architects Johan van Dillen and Johan van Tricht and,Paragraph
"received a number of larger commissions, some of which, such as the Rijksmuseum",Paragraph
"Vincent van Gogh (1963-72) in Amsterdam, were completed by the partners after",Paragraph
Rietveld’s death.,Paragraph
"Rietveld received a number of awards and honors during his life, including the Crown",Paragraph
"Order of Belgium, the Order of Oranje-Nassau, and the Sikkens Prize. He was recognized",Paragraph
by his peers with the Bond van Netherlandse Architecten and an honorary degree from,Paragraph
the Technische Hogeschool in Delft. Although Rietveld did ultimately receive,Paragraph
"recognition for his contribution to modern architecture, no single other work was to have",Paragraph
the impact of his early designs: the Red-Blue Chair and the Schréder-Schrader House.,Paragraph

Brazilians entered the 20th century under strong influence of positivism and sanitary,Paragraph
"engineering, and the city of Rio de Janeiro, being the capital of the republic and the",Paragraph

French eclecticism as the appropriate language to affirm its power and convey,Paragraph
technological advancement. The 1900s would be marked in Rio by the urban,Paragraph
"reformations of Pereira Passos, with avenues being opened and slums being displaced",Paragraph
"with civic buildings in French neoclassical style taking their place (Teatro Nacional,",Paragraph
"1906). A few years later, another plan by French urbanist Alfred Agache (1927) would be",Paragraph
"the structure for Rio’s main transformations of the first half of the century. Still, in the",Paragraph
"second decade of the century, Rio would experiment with issues of local identity and",Paragraph
"their relationship to interna-tional images, with the arrival of Art Deco on one hand and",Paragraph
the development of neo-Colonial styles on the other. The Deco tradition left landmarks,Paragraph
"such as the Cristo Redentor statue over Corcovado hill, and the neo-Colonial movement,",Paragraph
"led by José Mariano Filho, would battle against the modernist avant-garde ideas",Paragraph
"throughout the 1920s and 1930s. In 1929, the high points of this debate would be a series",Paragraph

"In 1930, in what would be one of the key moments of Brazilian architecture, Lucio",Paragraph
Costa was named director of Rio’s ENBA (National School of Beaux-Arts). As soon as,Paragraph

ROADSIDE ARCHITECTURE,Title
"Roadside architecture, the bastard offspring of the automobile, had a pervasive effect on",Paragraph
the American landscape during the 20th century. Often denounced for crassness and,Paragraph
"monotony yet irresistibly convenient to a population getting around on four wheels,",Paragraph
roadside architecture was both the bane of the aesthetically sensitive and a boon to,Paragraph
"motorists looking for food, fuel, and lodging.",Paragraph
"When the century opened, the automobile had been in existence just seven years, and",Paragraph
"only 8000 sputtering, self-propelled vehicles plied the streets and roads. The promise of",Paragraph
"freedom of movement proved so compelling, however, that the number of registered",Paragraph
"automobiles reached 458,000 by 1910, surpassed eight million by 1920, and exceeded 23",Paragraph
"million by 1930. New automobile-oriented building types, such as filling stations, motels,",Paragraph
"and drive-in movie theaters, arose. Older building types, such as restaurants, banks, and",Paragraph
"grocery stores, gradually changed form.",Paragraph
"A mere seven per cent of the nation’s roads were hard surfaced by 1904, but many",Paragraph
"organizations, such as the Lincoln Highway Association, were formed in the 1910s and",Paragraph
"1920s to lobby localities, state governments, and federal authorities to construct reliable,",Paragraph
all-weather roads. Filling stations dispensing motor oil and gasoline were among the first,Paragraph
"automobile-oriented facilities to crop up as the roads improved. In urban districts, it was",Paragraph
"not uncommon for a two-story or taller building containing stores, offices, and",Paragraph
"apartments to be razed so that its site could be occupied by a diminutive gas station,",Paragraph
"surrounded by pavement, Chester Liebs observes in Main Street to Miracle Mile. The",Paragraph
"traditional urban practice of placing buildings shoulder to shoulder, right up to the",Paragraph
"sidewalk, gave way to a looser, more discontinuous pattern, with each building standing",Paragraph
"alone, farther back from the street.",Paragraph
Because gas stations soon invaded settled residential districts and desirable business,Paragraph
"areas, petroleum companies felt pressure in the 1910s and 1920s to design stations whose",Paragraph
"appearance would be seen as an asset rather than an eyesore. In Indianapolis in 1927, for",Paragraph
"instance, the Ohio-based Pure Oil chain introduced an English cottage-style station that",Paragraph
skillfully drew from the romantic house designs popular at the time. Scholars such as,Paragraph
"Liebs have viewed the styles employed by roadside businesses as “sales costumes,”",Paragraph
donned with salesmanship and appeasement of popular taste in mind. John A.Jakle and,Caption
"Keith A.Sculle, two leading scholars of roadside architecture, have attributed much of the",Paragraph
"character of roadside architecture to the concept of “place-product-packaging,” in which",Paragraph
"all the physical aspects of an enterprise, including signs, logos, uniforms, architecture,",Paragraph
"lighting, and landscaping, are part of a carefully coordinated effort to establish a strong",Paragraph
corporate identity. The consistent identity links all the units in a chain and reassures the,Paragraph

ROADWAY SYSTEMS,Title
"Although the road preceded the automobile, it was the invention of the motorcar that",Paragraph
transformed meandering muddy paths into functional roadways. The first 20 years of the,Paragraph
20th century marked a transportation revolution that began with the automobile and that,Paragraph
"brought about a new national system of roadways. In 1905, only one in every 1078",Paragraph
"Americans owned an automobile; by 1920, one in every 13 Americans had become proud",Paragraph
owners of the century’s most remarkable invention.,Paragraph
Although the automobile was a French invention dating to as early as the 1860s,Paragraph
"(witness such French words as garage, chassis, chauffeur, and of course, automobile), the",Paragraph
North American adaptation of the motorcar in the early 20th century was distinctly non-,Paragraph
"European. Instead of expensive motorcars designed for the wealthy, American auto",Paragraph
"designers concentrated on affordable, mass-produced vehicles, such as Ransom E.Olds’",Paragraph
"1900 horseless buggy. By 1910, more than two dozen companies were producing",Paragraph
"unpretentious low-cost vehicles, including Henry Ford’s 1908 Model T. Their",Paragraph
affordability countered the warning that Woodrow Wilson had made in 1906 when he,Paragraph
cautioned that the popularity of the motorcar would lead to socialism by stirring,Paragraph
dangerous envy of the rich.,Paragraph
"As a practical vehicle for the average American, the automobile needed to be more",Paragraph
than a curiosity for display. Its utility depended on reliable roadways. As the proud,Paragraph
"motorist ventured into the realm of travel, limited by a top speed of four miles per hour",Paragraph
and requirements that he be preceded by a man with a red flag so as not to scare the,Paragraph
"horses, the need for improved roadways became strikingly apparent.",Paragraph
The first public organizations to get involved in road improvements were,Paragraph
"municipalities, many of which had grown weary of the problems of the automobile’s",Paragraph
predecessor: the horse. Horses cost cities large amounts of money to remove manure and,Paragraph
haul away abandoned carcasses. Many municipalities welcomed the automobile as a,Paragraph
"cleaner, more trouble free alternative. Thus, the first decades of the 20th century marked",Paragraph
"a change in many cities from cobblestones to more even road surfaces, built at public",Paragraph
"expense. The cobblestones had kept horses from slipping since the Middle Ages, but for",Paragraph
"the automobile, new smooth and quiet road surfaces, such as macadam (a form of crushed",Paragraph
"stone}, were required. As traffic increased, tougher surfaces were applied, such as asphalt",Paragraph
and eventually concrete—all initiated before the 1920s.,Paragraph
"By the middle of the 1920s, smooth road surfaces had significantly enhanced the utility",Paragraph
"of the automobile, speeding its way into the future at faster and faster speeds. Road",Paragraph
"building became a major function of local governments, which were prodded by a",Paragraph
"collection of pressure groups that included automobile manufacturing, oil companies, and",Paragraph
tire manufacturers who lobbied intensely for new roadways. Others were also quick to,Paragraph
"see the economic dividends attached to highway building, such as real estate speculators",Paragraph
who argued in front of city councils for new roads as a basis for increasing property tax,Paragraph
revenues in new areas.,Paragraph
"At a pace, new thoroughfares were built as an emblem of modernity and forward",Paragraph
"thinking. Following the lead of William K. Vanderbilt’s Long Island Motor Parkway, the",Paragraph
"first limited-access thoroughfare opened in 1911, and roadways were built for higher",Paragraph
"speeds and greater efficiency. The Bronx River Parkway, in New York’s Westchester",Caption
"County, featured limited access and landscaping when it was completed in 1923. The first",Paragraph
thoroughfares accentuated the scenic qualities of the roadside. The use of “parkway” in,Paragraph
their names implied their primary use for pleasure driving. The Hutchison River Parkway,Paragraph
"in 1928, the Saw Mill River Parkway in 1929, the Cross County Parkway in 1931, and",Paragraph
the Henry Hudson Parkway along the West Side of Manhattan in 1934 all exemplified the,Paragraph
"scenic qualities of the new roadways. However, it was not long before this idea of",Paragraph
roadways for recreation was replaced by the utility of commuter expressways.,Paragraph
"By 1929, New Jersey began construction of a 13-mile expressway between Elizabeth",Paragraph
"and Jersey. In Boston, two new expressways were completed at opposite sides of the city.",Paragraph
"Chicago opened Wacker Drive, a new, elevated bilevel motorway that was designed for a",Paragraph
"daily commute of 60,000 vehicles. In Los Angeles, the Arroyo Silo Parkway was opened",Paragraph
"in 1940 after nearly 40 years of planning. Backed by downtown department stores, the",Paragraph
"new freeway became an instant success, but instead",Paragraph

"of funneling shoppers into the downtown area, it launched a massive suburban migration",Paragraph
that powered the development of the nation’s most elaborate freeway system.,Paragraph
"From the beginning, public subsides advanced the development of new roadways. The",Paragraph
"Federal Road Act of 1916 founded new highway departments, and a 1921 reenactment",Paragraph
"created the Bureau of Public Roads and provided matching funds for more than 200,000",Paragraph
"miles of roads. State gasoline taxes, starting in 1919, provided another source of road-",Paragraph
"building funds, enabling the value of highway construction projects to surpass $1 billion",Paragraph
by 1925.,Paragraph
"By 1943, the enormous economic potential of road building had become obvious not",Paragraph
"only to suburban land developers but also to a diverse group of oil and tire manufacturers,",Paragraph
"construction industrialists, and automobile manufacturers who united as the American",Paragraph
"Road Builders Association. Spearheaded by General Motors, the group’s largest",Paragraph
"contributor, the association became exceedingly influential, second only to the munitions",Paragraph
"industry. Their influence, along with a campaign by Cold War scientists to attain",Paragraph
"“Defense Through Decentralization,” led to the Interstate Highway Act of 1956, which",Paragraph
"called for a 42,000-mile system of federally funded limited-access thoroughfares at a cost",Paragraph
of $26 billion.,Paragraph
The influence of the Interstate Highway Act has ranged broadly across American,Paragraph
"society, transforming it into a suburban nation. With this expansion, architects designed a",Paragraph
"range of building types suited to automobile commuters and travelers, including hotels,",Paragraph
"shopping malls, office campuses, and others. With the advent of air travel, architects",Paragraph
"designed large and distinctive airports, all linked to their nearby cities by expressways.",Paragraph
"With each completed link of the nationwide system of high-speed, limited-access",Paragraph
"roadways, the population has spread farther from abandoned urban cores to satellite cities",Paragraph
"and low-density suburbs. To be sure, other factors abetted this extraordinary migration,",Paragraph
"such as federal mortgage subsidies and home ownership tax credits, but the Interstate",Paragraph
"Highway Act paved the way. As the nation has been increasingly consumed by highways,",Paragraph
"traffic jams, and endless commutes, the conventional wisdom of highway building has",Paragraph
been challenged. Led by numerous “freeway revolts” that began in California in the,Paragraph
"1960s, opposition to “more and more of worse and worse” has mounted, sometimes",Paragraph
halting highway construction projects or seriously modifying their size. Efforts to,Paragraph
"develop public transportation alternatives have increased, even in Los Angeles, where the",Paragraph
"freeway was once seen as the spine of life. Still, overall, no unanimously accepted",Paragraph
alternative has gained precedence over the drive of highway expansion.,Paragraph

ROBIE HOUSE,Title
"Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright; completed 1910 Chicago, Illinois",Caption
When Frederick Robie went to Frank Lloyd Wright in the winter of 1908 for a house,Paragraph
"on fashionable Woodlawn Avenue at the corner of Fifty-eighth Street in Chicago, Robie",Caption
"worked with his father, who among other things was a supplier of parts to the growing",Paragraph
"automobile industry. Like Wright, Robie was fascinated with the new machine and even",Paragraph
planned to open his own automobile factory. This surely explains the three garages (and,Paragraph
no stable) that Wright incorporated into Robie’s house. Preliminary plans for Robie,Paragraph
"House were completed in November 1908, with working (or contract) drawings",Paragraph
following in March 1909. Construction began in the spring of 1909 and ended in the early,Paragraph
winter of 1910. The house was furnished between September 1909 and May 1910.,Paragraph
Because Wright turned his business over to architect Herman Von Holst in September,Paragraph
"1909 and went to Europe for a year, completion of the house was left to Marion Mahony,",Paragraph
"long an associate of Wright, whom Von Holst had hired to complete Wright’s unfinished",Paragraph
commissions. It is likely that she designed the art glass of the house and iron gates of the,Paragraph
"auto court, as these had not been detailed before Wright left for Europe. George",Paragraph
"Niedecken, an interior architect from Milwaukee, already at work in the house before",Paragraph
"Wright’s departure, continued to have furniture and furnishings made according to",Paragraph
"Wright’s plans until they ran out, then designed additional furniture himself, mostly for",Paragraph
the living room.,Paragraph
Wright’s brick house for Frederick Robie is the most monumental of his Prairie houses,Paragraph
having the main living space on the second floor. Although Wright wrote frequently in a,Paragraph
"rationalist vein about his distaste for dank basements and cluttered attics, his real reason",Paragraph
for wanting to eliminate basements and attics was both visual and psychological. As a,Paragraph
"place of shelter and refuge, he felt that the home ought to be wedded visually to the earth,",Paragraph
"which to him meant relatively low structures spreading out horizontally, anchored by",Paragraph
massive chimneys at the center and protected by overhanging hip roofs of low pitch.,Caption
Typical 19th-century houses elevated above partially exposed basements with rooms,Paragraph
Having high ceilings and crowned by massive hip or gable roofs were anathema to him.,Paragraph
Early photographs of Robie House looking north show just such a house behind it.,Paragraph
Although in later years Robie thought that it was he who had inspired Wright to design,Paragraph
"for him a house with the visual and functional characteristics that mark Robie House,",Paragraph
Wright had actually developed the design over a ten-year period for other clients with,Paragraph
different tastes and requirements. The first house of this type was erected in Chicago in,Paragraph
"1899 for Joseph Husser. Except for having many details of late 19th-century origin, the",Paragraph
"Husser house was remarkably like Robie House, even to having its entrance halfway",Paragraph
"down the left side, a common practice in Chicago for siting large houses on the deep but",Paragraph
"narrow lots of that city. For example, Robie House stands on a parcel 60 feet wide by 180",Paragraph
"feet deep. The result of thus reviving for Robie House the plan of the Husser house,",Paragraph
"which was not built on a commer and had residential lots on either side of its narrow front,",Paragraph
has been to cause both laypersons and academicians to suppose that the right side of,Paragraph
Robie House facing on Fifty-eighth Street is actually its front rather than Woodlawn,Paragraph
"Avenue, which is its address. This confusion has fostered the myth that Wright intended",Paragraph
when designing the house to lead the observer slowly and inevitably around the house,Paragraph
"from its Fifty-eighth Street side to the Woodlawn Avenue front, where at last he would",Paragraph
discover the entrance door sequestered in shadow at the end of a long walk.,Paragraph
"Another residence, designed in 1905 and built of stucco on frame in Riverside, Illinois,",Paragraph
"for Frederick Tomek, served as the intermediary for translating the late 19th-century",Paragraph
"forms of the Husser house into the mature Wrightian style of Robie House. In fact,",Paragraph
"Wright has stated that the Tomek house served as a model for Robie House. Originally,",Paragraph
"the entrance to the Tomek house was to have been halfway down its right side, just the",Paragraph
"reverse of the Husser and Robie houses. However, before construction began, the",Paragraph
"entrance was moved to its left side, which faced the street. Both the Tomek and the Robie",Paragraph
house consist of a lower floor at grade with the main living floor above it. The latter is,Paragraph
devoted primarily to a large living and dining room connected through a passageway,Paragraph
illuminated by a continuous,Paragraph

"bank of windows, actually French doors at Robie House. The living room opens onto a",Paragraph
"porch. A partial third floor, looking something like a low tower or “belvedere,” as Wright",Paragraph
"termed it, contains the bedrooms.",Paragraph
"By 1905, when Wright designed the Tomek house, his style had become highly",Paragraph
"abstract and rectilinear in character. Almost invariably, he built his residences after 1902",Paragraph
"of rectangular masses, piers, and panels. These were sometimes solid, as for walls and",Paragraph
"piers, and sometimes transparent, as for doors and windows, the latter always casements",Paragraph
"grouped in horizontal banks. When possible, Wright carried the geometry of the exterior",Paragraph
"into the interior, where he applied it with equal vigor to walls, piers, screens, furniture,",Paragraph
and furnishings.,Paragraph
"In fact, it is the slope of the hip roofs of Robie House that deny for it the logical and",Paragraph
"final next step in Wright’s aesthetic development, complete rectilinearity, a goal already",Paragraph
achieved by him through his use of the overhanging flat roof for Unity Temple and the,Paragraph
"Yahara Boat Club, both designed in 1905, and for the proposed Fireproof House of 1907.",Paragraph
"It was not until 1909, however, that Wright first built a residence in which he abandoned",Paragraph
the hip in favor of the flat roof. This was the thoroughly rectilinear house that he erected,Paragraph
"for Laura Gale in Oak Park, Illinois. As a result, Robie House, despite its unrelenting",Paragraph
"rectilinear geometry and horizontal massing, remains a transitional work",Paragraph
"Interior dining room, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright (1910)",Caption
© James Reber. Photo courtesy The Frank Lloyd Wright Archives,Caption
along with Wright’s great Coonley House of 1907 because of the dissonant angularity of,Paragraph
its overspreading hip roofs.,Paragraph
Given the abstract geometry here and there in Wright’s work from the Winslow house,Paragraph
"of 1894 onward, one might suppose that the European avant-garde was somehow affected",Paragraph
"by this aspect of his work. Certainly, Wright was aware of developments in Europe",Paragraph
through European publications and from his visits to the St. Louis Exposition in 1904.,Paragraph
"Yet, except for a few European architects who passed through Chicago before 1910 and",Paragraph
"who might have returned with illustrations of Wright’s work, the only important",Paragraph
"presentation of Wright’s architecture did not appear until March 1908, when the",Paragraph
"Architectural Record featured his work. In it, Europeans would have seen the massive",Paragraph
abstract geometries of the Larkin Building and Unity Temple along with those of the,Paragraph
"Fireproof House. However, as Robie House was not completed until early 1910, its",Paragraph
"potential for effecting the evolution of European architecture had to wait until 1911,",Paragraph
"when it appeared in the German publications of Wright’s work by Wasmuth. As a result,",Paragraph
"if Wright’s abstract style did inspire European architects to move in that same direction,",Paragraph
Robie House could not have played a part until after 1911.,Paragraph
"Robie House does relate, however, to developments in European modernism going",Paragraph
"back to the 1890s and earlier. Certain aspects of Wright’s style, especially his extensive",Paragraph
"use of casement windows, presumably derive from the English Victorian Gothic and",Paragraph
"probably more directly from the use of such windows by Voysey, Baillie Scott, and other",Paragraph
English architects in the 1890s. Wright’s continuing interest in creating artistic interiors,Paragraph
for his houses whenever he found a pliable client with sufficient resources and in the art,Paragraph
furniture with which he furnished those houses also surely goes back to the English Arts,Paragraph
and Crafts movement of the 1860s to 1890s. That Wright also sought to devise a style of,Paragraph
"his own, one no longer derived from the historic styles, also served to align him with",Paragraph
Europe’s avant-garde architects.,Paragraph
"Unfortunately, Robie got to live in his house for little more than a year. His wife left",Paragraph
"him in April 1911, and he sold the house to another family in December of that year.",Paragraph
"After the new owner died suddenly in 1912, the house passed to a third family, who",Paragraph
"occupied it until 1926, when they sold it to the Chicago Theological Seminary for use as",Paragraph
"a dormitory. In 1957, a preservation battle erupted when the seminary proposed",Paragraph
"demolishing the house. Fortunately, Robie House was saved by developer William",Paragraph
Zeckendorf and eventually became the property of the University of Chicago. It is now,Paragraph
being restored and maintained by the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio Foundation,Caption
and is a historic site of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.,Paragraph

Kevin Roche (1922-) and John Dinkeloo (1918-81) met in 1950 when they joined the,Paragraph
"office of Eero Saarinen and Associates at Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where they worked",Paragraph
"for 11 years along with Robert Venturi, Chuck Bassett, Tony Lumsden, Gunnar Birketts,",Paragraph
"and Cesar Pelli. After Saarinen’s sudden death in 1961, Roche and Dinkeloo formed a",Paragraph
"partnership in Hamden, Connecticut, to complete the projects that were under way at that",Paragraph
time. The nascent partnership saw not only the successful completion of ten international,Paragraph
projects but also went on to receive many other important commissions. Roche and,Paragraph
"Dinkeloo practiced together until 1981, and during that 20-year period they designed a",Paragraph
number of outstanding buildings for a diverse group of corporate and institutional clients.,Paragraph
The ten buildings that Roche and Dinkeloo inherited from Saarinen were projects that,Paragraph
they had been centrally involved in designing and included some of the most significant,Paragraph
"American buildings of the period, sharing innovative approaches to technology and new",Paragraph

The first project awarded to the new practice was the Oakland Museum (1961-68) in,Paragraph
California. Eero Saarinen had been on the original list of architects being considered for,Paragraph
"the project, and Roche Dinkeloo, who asked to be considered after his death, was selected",Paragraph
from a group of 35 architects. Their award-winning museum design included landscaped,Paragraph
"roofs that created a new park at the heart of the city. Over the next 20 years, the practice",Paragraph
"grew to become one of the most vital American offices of that era, designing a wide",Paragraph
range of different building types for both civic and corporate clients.,Paragraph
The most significant buildings designed by Roche Dinkeloo include a series of,Paragraph
"university facilities, the office tower (1965-69) for the Knights of Columbus together",Caption
"with the neighboring Coliseum (1965-72) in New Haven, and arguably the most",Paragraph
"important, the Headquarters for the Ford Foundation (1963-68) in New York. These",Paragraph
"monumental buildings made innovative use of novel materials such as glass, advanced",Paragraph
"glazing systems, and self-rusting steel while at the same time exploiting the potential of",Paragraph
structural forms as large-scale ordering systems. Projects such as the factories and offices,Paragraph
"for Cummins Engine in Darlington, England (1963-65), and later at Columbus, Indiana",Paragraph

Rockefeller Center is widely considered to be a handsome commercial building,Paragraph

Fifth to Sixth Avenues.,Paragraph
"The original group, planned and built from 1929 to 1940, was erected on land that",Paragraph

"At first, the blocks were intended for bulky office towers on three sides of a large open",Paragraph
"square. A new Metropolitan Opera House was to occupy the fourth side, at the west,",Paragraph
extending toward Sixth Avenue. When the stock market crash of 1929 made this plan,Paragraph
"unworkable, Rockefeller requested new plans for high and low commercial buildings",Paragraph
around a smaller plaza. Most were to be office buildings with shops at ground level and,Paragraph
along a subterranean concourse connected to a subway line that replaced a noisy elevated,Paragraph

"ROGERS, RICHARD 1933-",Title
"Architect, England",Title
Richard Rogers was born in Florence in 1933 of British parents. He received his,Paragraph
architectural education at the Architectural Association School in London and at Yale,Paragraph
"University, where he held a Fulbright Scholarship. At Yale, he heard lectures by Paul",Paragraph
"Rudolf and Louis Kahn and also met his British contemporaries, Norman Foster and",Paragraph
James Stirling.,Paragraph
"He began work by designing a family house at Creek Vean in Cornwall, with white",Paragraph
"walls and large windows, a house of impeccable modernity that still appears fresh after",Paragraph
"nearly half a century. His career took off when he designed a factory, in partnership with",Paragraph
"Sue Rogers and Norman and Wendy Foster, a double husband-and-wife group that set up",Paragraph
under the name of “Team 4.” The Reliance Controls Ltd. Factory at Swindon (1967),Caption
became well known as an example of industrial architecture that makes its impact from,Paragraph
"the visual quality of its structural system, in this case a clear succession of rectangular",Paragraph
bays stiffened by tensioned diagonal braces.,Caption
Rogers has become increasingly devoted to the architecture produced by structural,Paragraph
"tours-de-force. Of these, the Pompidou Center in Paris (1971-77, with Renzo Piano) is",Paragraph
"the most famous. As with Reliance, the building is essentially a shed, and the main",Paragraph
elevation is similarly marked by a clear succession of rectangular bays overlaid by,Paragraph
diagonal tension cables. The designs for Lloyds in the City of London and for Inmos at,Paragraph
Newport South Wales both continue to gain their principal effect from the display of,Paragraph
structure and service elements on the exterior. Rogers (like Foster) has therefore become,Paragraph
"a principal proponent of a “true” functionalist architecture, going beyond Louis Kahn in",Paragraph
"the analysis of form and mechanism, in an attempt to eliminate the arbitrary and willful",Paragraph
character of facade making.,Paragraph
"Through this development, modernism was pushed closer to the machine, but also",Paragraph
closer to sculpture: Rogers’s work emerges from this conjunction. He was also influenced,Paragraph
"by Archigram, for whom expression was as important as technology. Disciples of the",Paragraph
"Archigram group, in fact, as employees of Piano and Rogers, realized the design",Paragraph
"development and working drawings for the Pompidou Center, so that it became the",Paragraph
nearest thing we have to a completed Archigram building. But it is also the building that,Paragraph
"most completely expresses Rogers’s attitude to architecture: for it has no hint in it, as has",Paragraph
"the Lloyds Building, of a conventional interior dominated by ancient tribal rituals, but is",Paragraph
entirely the product of an intellectual movement toward the “real” sources of functional,Paragraph
truth: the exposure of the bones and guts along with devotion to the principles of change,Title
"and indeterminacy in use, of which the prophet was the Archigram guru, Reyner Banham.",Paragraph
"From 1977 Rogers’s work has had the benefit of a multidisciplined approach, with the",Paragraph
"formation of the Richard Rogers Partnership, bringing in the collaboration of John",Paragraph
"Young, Marco Goldschmied, and Mike Davies, and improved access to inhouse",Paragraph
"engineering services. With this improved organization, the firm has become something of",Paragraph
an icon of the High-Tech aspect of modern architecture.,Paragraph
It is not that the High-Tech architect eschews beauty. But the beauty to be uncovered,Paragraph
"has to be identified with necessity, the result of applying reason along with engineering",Paragraph
principles. The method of construction becomes an artistic strategy and hence an end in,Paragraph
"itself. In the Tokyo Forum Project of 1991, for example, the spaces of use are first",Paragraph
"enclosed in a gleaming semitransparent shell, then suspended from a metal armature, then",Paragraph
approached by a complex of escalators. The object becomes a symbol of its own,Paragraph
"otherworldliness, a chapel to progress.",Paragraph

A more balanced approach is envisaged in the design for the European Court of,Paragraph
Human Rights (1989-94) at Strasbourg. Here the elements into which the complex is,Paragraph
"broken down are not the service elements as such, but spaces of use; they stand on the",Paragraph
"ground, forming a composition that is less obsessively analytical and more expressive of",Paragraph
"human habitation and intercourse, whereas the building takes its scale and shape from its",Paragraph
context on the curve of a river and from its situation within the city. This increased,Paragraph
"sensitivity toward the city is also evident in the very elegant project for the Alcazar, in",Paragraph
Marseilles (1988). Within a seven-story height limit (surely a donné for the French city),Paragraph
he inserted a wedge-shaped volume closely into the texture of the adjoining blocks.,Paragraph
"Service elements are still lied up on one side, office space on the other, with between",Paragraph
"them, a “spine,” which at ground level becomes a pedestrian route linking the frontage on",Paragraph
the Cours Belsunce to the quiet contained space of the Place de la Providence. The way,Paragraph
the building draws back to allow the space of this quiet square to be drawn into the,Paragraph
"scheme, the way it curves gently to make an entrance from the Cours Belsunce, show a",Paragraph
distinct sensitivity not only to an analytical idea of urban form but also to the sense of,Paragraph
"civic propriety. In France, where Rogers has many projects under consideration, there are",Paragraph
"several that seem to open up a less machine-oriented perspective, such as the master",Paragraph
plans for Dunkirk Neptune (1990) and Port Aupec (1990) and schemes for Bussy St.,Paragraph
Georges (1989—) and Sextius Mirbeau (1990). In all of these there is a distinct element of,Paragraph
contextual relevance.,Paragraph
"Rogers has been accepted as a master of modern design, to judge by his creation as a",Paragraph
"Chevalier de l’Ordre National de la Légion d’Honneur in 1985 and in his own country,",Paragraph
"too, as is evident from his election to the Royal Academy in 1978, the award of the Royal",Paragraph
"Gold Medal of the RIBA in 1985, his knighthood of 1991 for services to architecture, and",Paragraph

ROMANIA,Title
"At the beginning of 20th century, Romania was much indebted to Western European",Paragraph
architectural currents. The recently created national style had only a feeble impact on the,Paragraph
public.,Paragraph
"Foreign architecture, mainly Neoclassicism and Romanticism, was progressively",Paragraph
introduced in the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia during the 19th century as a,Paragraph
consequence of the process of opening up to Western European civilization. The two,Paragraph
"principalities, vassals of the Ottoman Empire, sought a model for emancipation and also",Paragraph
"political assistance, aspiring to create an independent unified state. After this state was",Paragraph
"founded in 1859, and particularly after it obtained its independence in 1878, its first",Paragraph
institutions embraced foreign architectural currents as a sign of modernization. At this,Paragraph
"time, the most widespread was the ecclecticism of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris,",Paragraph
which eventually became the official style of the Romanian kingdom. French architecture,Paragraph
"was practiced not only by French nationals but also by the first Romanian architects, who",Paragraph
were themselves trained at the Ecole.,Paragraph
"Some of these young architects trained in France, where they came in contact with the",Paragraph
"theories of E.E. Viollet-le-Duc, the French archaeological school, and the innovative",Paragraph
"concepts of Guadet. Once home, they relentlessly worked to create a new Romanian",Paragraph
"architecture based on the local tradition. Among them, the most fervent was lon Mincu,",Paragraph
"the father of this new style called either “national” or “Romanian,” which mirrored the",Paragraph
national ideology that animated the Romanian intelligentsia of the time.,Paragraph
Yet the first decade of 20th century was still strongly dominated by French,Paragraph
"ecclecticism, which maintained its status of official architecture and was also very in",Paragraph
"vogue for the rich residencies. The Beaux-Arts style was displayed in a variety of forms,",Paragraph
"going from classic solemnity (the Palace of the Chamber of Deputies, 1907, by Dimitrie",Caption
"Maimarolu in Bucharest) to a light elegance (the Casino, 1913, by Petre Antonescu in",Paragraph
"Sinaia) or to flamboyant fantasies (the town hall of lasi, 1907-26, by loan D.Berindey). If",Paragraph
"the Beaux-Arts style was perfectly assimilated, Romanian architects were less familiar",Paragraph
"with other currents, such as Art Nouveau, one of the rare examples of which is the Casino",Paragraph
"in Constanta (1910) by Daniel Renard. In contrast, Art Nouveau was very popular in",Paragraph
"Transylvania, where it radiated from Central Europe. A province of the Austro-",Paragraph

vocabulary of Art Nouveau developed on the vast territory of the empire: the aesthetic of,Paragraph

national style gained an important place on the architectural scene of Romanian kingdom.,Paragraph
"The exposition, with its multitude of pavilions, brought recognition for this style. In their",Paragraph
"quest for an expression of the Romanian specificity, the exponents of the national style",Paragraph
sought relevant examples in local tradition that they referred to as both major art history,Paragraph
monuments and folk art. Among the chief promoters of the national style were Petre,Paragraph

Budesti.,Paragraph
As its doctrine responded perfectly to the aspirations of national unity and as its,Paragraph
"aesthetic satisfied the taste for picturesque dispositions, the new style was progressively",Paragraph
"embraced in several architectural programs. First adopted in residential architecture, it",Paragraph
"spread progressively to administrative buildings, schools, and post offices, some of the",Paragraph
most significant examples of this period being the Prefecture of Galati (1906) by Ion,Paragraph
"Mincu, the Prefecture of Craiova (1912-13) by Petre Antonescu, and the town hall of",Paragraph
"Constanta (1913) by Victor Stefanescu. At the creation of greater Romania, by the",Paragraph
"unification of the ancient kingdom with Transylvania, Bessarabia, and Bukovina at the",Paragraph
"end of World War I, the national style was unsurprisingly appropriated as an official",Paragraph
architecture. The establishment of the new state generated a period of prosperity and of,Paragraph
"economic as well as cultural effervescence, which explains the unprecedented growth of",Paragraph
"architecture. The sustained building campaign obviously benefited the national style,",Paragraph
which now covered all the architectural programs and all the territory of Romania. To,Paragraph
"mention the huge operation of rising orthodox churches in Transylvania, the construction",Paragraph
"of oversize churches, called “cathedrals,” was a symbolic act of recuperating a territory",Paragraph
released from Catholicism.,Paragraph
Whereas the national style responded to the new context of the acknowledged national,Paragraph
"spirituality, modernism expressed the opening toward European culture and the efforts of",Paragraph
synchronizing Romanian culture with European tendencies. The architect and artist,Paragraph
Marcel Iancu played an important role in the introduction and assimilation of the,Paragraph
principles of Modern architecture. He contributed to the initiation to modernism through,Paragraph
"a sustained publishing campaign, writing numerous articles in the style of the avant-garde",Paragraph
manifestos in the magazine Contimporanul from 1924 to 1930. The diffusion of,Paragraph
"modernism was encouraged by the commands of the intellectual milieu, opened not only",Paragraph
"to the new architectural trends, but also by the prosperous members of the middle classes",Paragraph
"as well as by several societies, institutions, and industries that appropriated Modern",Paragraph
"architecture as the emblem of their efficiency. After 1930, the period of early modernism",Paragraph
"in Romania, the incontestable center of new trends was Bucharest. However, several",Paragraph
"examples, remarkable by their perfect adherence to the formal vocabulary of modernism,",Paragraph
were erected in other areas of the country. These examples belong less to the housing,Paragraph
program (except for the villas executed by I. Boceanu in Cimpina or the villa Tataru in,Paragraph
"Cluj, designed in Gio Ponti’s studio) than to the field of public buildings. It was an",Paragraph
architecture that advanced the idea of autonomy from the geographic environment—such,Paragraph
"as the sanatoriums in the mountain zones (Toria, 1933-34, by Grigore lonescu in Ciuc",Caption
"and Bucegi, 1934, by Marcel lancu in Predeal) and the hotels in the seaside resorts",Paragraph
"(Belona, 1933, by G.M.Cantacuzino in Eforie}—and that underscored the expressive",Paragraph
potential of the reinforced-concrete structure—such as the Central Market in Ploiesti,Paragraph
(1931-33) by Toma T.Socolescu. The industrial buildings of the 1930s exclusively,Paragraph
"adopted the vocabulary of modernism, employing vigorous structures with large openings",Paragraph

"particularly brick (the Banloc Plants, 1937-38, by O.Doicescu and the Astra Plants,",Paragraph
"1936-37, by Costinescu in Brasov).",Caption
"Parallel to the boom of modern architecture and obviously influenced by its principles,",Paragraph
the national style developed a new expression that adopted the formal simplicity and,Paragraph
functionality of modernism. Not only was this new image a transgression of a clear,Paragraph
"decline of the style (the result of an epigonic production), but it also brought a change of",Paragraph
"vision. Instead of the historic examples, sometimes quoted in a historicist manner,",Paragraph
tradition was now understood as the essence of Romanian spirituality through the,Paragraph
perspective of folk art values. The new expression found adepts among the old exponents,Paragraph
"of the national style (Andrei Saguna Orthodox College, 1938-39, by George Cristinel in",Caption

installation of the Communist regime on 30 December 1947 brought a radical,Paragraph
transformation for the development of architecture. The state established almost total,Paragraph
"control over architecture and urbanism, which became dependent on the strictly",Paragraph
centralized economic and social politics. The evolution of postwar architecture was,Paragraph
decisively conditioned by the dominance of standardized plans and of serialized,Paragraph
"industrial methods of construction, by the reduction in investment costs, and by the",Paragraph
replacement of theoretical and critical discourse with the authoritarian intervention of the,Paragraph
"party ideology. However, this pattern was transgressed in particular cases, as when",Paragraph
requested by the importance of representation. This representation emphasized either the,Paragraph
"regime itself or its ideology, either the urban role of the building or the uniqueness of its",Paragraph
function—in the city or in the whole country.,Paragraph
The regime exercised a progressive control over architecture that was reflected in each,Paragraph
phase of this period. The first part of 1950s was marked by the so-called realist-socialist,Paragraph
"architecture of Soviet influence. In these years, housing developments were built in",Paragraph
"numerous cities in Romania, as were plants and the infrastructure for the International",Paragraph
"Youth Festival, which took place in 1953 in Bucharest. The utmost symbol of this",Paragraph
"architecture remains Casa Scinteii (House of the Spark, 1950-51, by architects H.Maicu,",Caption
"L.Staadecker, M.Alifanti, N.Badescu, and others in Bucharest), a local reproduction of",Paragraph
"the Soviet models, where the forms, mainly classical, were adorned with details inspired",Paragraph
"partly by national tradition. Parallel to that, the old generation of architects continued to",Paragraph
use the vocabulary of the interwar rationalism that was present in Romanian architecture,Paragraph
until the end of the decade. The most relevant examples are the Clothing Industries,Paragraph
"APACA building (1948) by M.Alifanti, I.Ghica Budesti, and others and the Palace of the",Caption
"National Broadcasting (1960) by T.Ricci, L.Garcia, and M.Ricci, both in Bucharest.",Paragraph
The most interesting period of evolution in Romanian architecture started in the 1960s,Paragraph
and lasted until the mid-1970s against the background of an apparent ideological,Paragraph
"liberalization. Functionalist architecture became official, and the urbanist prin-ciples of",Paragraph
the Athens Charter were conclusively adopted. The dormitory districts built in almost all,Paragraph
"Romanian cities, with their impersonal architecture and huge dimensions (up to hundreds",Paragraph
"of thousands of inhabitants), were erected according to these principles of the Athens",Paragraph
"Charter. Starting at the end of the 1960s, the Black Sea littoral became the experimental",Paragraph
ground for both New Urbanism and Modern architecture. The necessity of modern public,Paragraph
"equipment in the cities brought the opportunity for various architectures, some of them of",Paragraph
"an incontestable value, to be employed. Among the most significant buildings of this",Paragraph
"period are a series of hotels (particularly at the Black Sea in the resorts Neptun, Olimp,",Paragraph
"and Aurora and in the mountain resorts, such as Poiana Brasov), theaters (the National",Paragraph
"Theater, 1972-74, by Al. lotzu in Craiova), cultural centers (such as those built in 1968",Paragraph
"by N.Porumbescu in Suceava and in 1975 in Baia Mare, where he employed a stylized",Paragraph
"interpretation of the traditional decorative patterns), and higher-education institutions and",Paragraph
"administrative centers (the Administrative Center 1972, by M.Alifanti in Baia Mare is",Paragraph
considered one of the most valuable works of the period). The Catholic church (1976) by,Paragraph
1.Fackelman in Orsova is unique in the whole postwar period.,Caption
The years following the devastating earthquake of 1977 coincided with the emphasis of,Paragraph
the totalitarian and nationalistic ideology of the Communist regime. This mutation in the,Paragraph
official ideology had dramatic consequences for architecture. Although numerous cities,Paragraph
were affected by rapid degradation because of the demolitions of their historical,Paragraph
"downtowns (increasing the damage caused by the earthquake), the tentative decision to",Paragraph
"rebuild urbanlike villages, according to controlled planning, threatened to destroy the",Paragraph
environment of traditional life. The architectural structures that replaced the demolished,Paragraph
"edifices, often reorganized as new civic centers, reflected the strict application of the",Paragraph
"regime ideology, resulting in a schematic and simplistic vocabulary. The control over",Paragraph
"architecture harshened, and a reduction in the quality of architecture became evident.",Paragraph
Official architecture clearly was oriented to a rhetoric of monumentality that was specific,Paragraph
"to dictatorships, the most significant example being the Pharaonic complex of the House",Paragraph
of the People in Bucharest by Anca Petrescu and collective. This enormous architectural,Paragraph
"complex concentrated the most important part of the state investments, a fact that",Paragraph
"drastically diminished the construction activity, and only a few buildings succeeded in",Paragraph
escaping the anonymity of a common architecture. This explains why the Postmodernism,Paragraph
of the 1980s did not produce noteworthy experiments.,Paragraph
"Starting in 1990, after the fall of the Communist regime, Romanian architecture",Paragraph
entered a new period of intense researches and the rediscovery of former local marks and,Paragraph
"of integration in the contemporaneous international movement. Unlike previous periods,",Paragraph
Bucharest is no longer the only center of architectural experiments. Several other cities,Paragraph
"have developed such experiences, the most significant example being the city of",Paragraph
"Timisoara for the refined architecture of Serban Sturdza, I. Andreescu and V.",Paragraph
"Gaivoronschi, R. Mihailescu, and others.",Paragraph

"ROME, ITALY",Title
"In the history of the city of Rome, it was not just the Church that appropriated and used",Paragraph
art and architecture for political or propagandistic purposes. From the city’s annexation to,Paragraph
"the kingdom of Italy in 1870, Rome became a space of contest in which the contrasting",Paragraph
"discourses of the classical Roman Empire, the papacy of a universal Church, and the",Paragraph
secular Savoyard monarchy were articulated. Such discourses affected and often reshaped,Paragraph
the urban landscape. One of the best examples is constituted by the Vittorio Emanuele II,Paragraph
"monument (or Vittoriano), built between 1885 and 1911 to honor the memory of the first",Paragraph
"king of united Italy. Some 80 meters high, it irrevocably changed the cityscape, throwing",Paragraph
"out of scale the capitol itself. The architect, Giuseppe Sacconi, winning an international",Paragraph
"competition, employed a dazzling white “bottocino” marble from Brescia that further",Paragraph
emphasized the monument with respect (or disrespect) to its surroundings. The Vittoriano,Paragraph
"was constructed in the Beaux Arts architectural style, which was popular at the time as",Paragraph
appropriately “imperial” for urban monuments throughout all the major European,Paragraph
"capitals. Interestingly, both Liberal and Fascist governments between the wars",Paragraph
emphasized the Vittoriano’s centrality within the city’s space and Italian territory.,Paragraph
Mussolini in particular used the monument to promote an imperial spatiality through his,Paragraph
"performative rhetoric, which often unfolded while facing the monument in the adjacent",Paragraph
Piazza Venezia.,Caption
The advent of Fascism had quite an effect on the architectural history of Rome. In the,Paragraph
"early 1930s, the population of Rome had grown from 244,000 to over a million. The",Paragraph
practical necessity to provide a modern infrastructure in terms of public transport and,Paragraph
utilities and to boost the regime’s image in Italy and abroad threatened to put Fascism on,Paragraph
a conflicting course both with the papacy (some 18 churches and Church buildings were,Paragraph
destroyed from 1928 to 1939) and with the city’s own classical heritage (many,Paragraph
archaeological sites were disrupted to build those grand avenues that had to host the,Paragraph
regime’s parades and other mass events). It soon appeared evident that the key issues of,Paragraph
planning in the city had to deal with finding a feasible compromise between the,Paragraph
conflicting double logic of conservation or demolition. It has been convincingly argued,Paragraph
"that the three principal laws that informed Fascist design, architecture, and urban",Paragraph
planning were the law of health (hygienic reasons were often at the basis of many,Paragraph
"interventions in the city), the law of speed (in the sense of both fast execution and, from a",Paragraph
"futurist perspective, active traffic, Hght, and air), and the Roman law, with its insistence",Paragraph
on the grandiose in the sense of the imposing and powerful. From Mussolini’s early years,Paragraph
"in power, his ideas on monumental interventions in the city center reflected such laws.",Paragraph
One of the best examples in this sense is the plan to free the Mausoleo di Augusto (or,Paragraph
"Augusteo). According to the project devised by the architect Vittorio Morpurgo, new",Paragraph
porticoed buildings of the National Fascist Institute of Social Insurance were to define the,Paragraph
piazza in which the Mausoleo stands on the north and east sides. A wide street piazza was,Paragraph
"created between the churches of San Girolamo and San Rocco. Moreover, a",Paragraph
reconstruction of the Ara Pacis was located in glazed protective building (an example of,Paragraph
rationalist architecture in sharp contrast with its classical content) between Via Ripetta,Paragraph
and il Lungotevere. Quite different from the works around the Augusteo is the EUR,Paragraph
"project (also known as E 42). In this case, the plan was to build a new Rome, a modern",Paragraph
"one but with the same characters of monumentality and universality, on a hilltop five",Paragraph
miles south of piazza Venezia. The EUR was meant to house the World Exhibition of,Paragraph
"Rome in 1942; thus, the task was to create a city of representation that conjugated the",Paragraph
scenographic and artistic necessities of a world exhibition with the practicalities of a real,Paragraph
"city. Although the first plan was not extremely original, it must be said that it lacked the",Paragraph
"usual iconography of fasces, eagles, statues, or epigraphs that would come later.",Paragraph
"However, Romanita and modernity, monumentality and rationalist aspirations could not",Paragraph
"coexist, so it happened that the more advanced projects were relegated to the temporary",Paragraph
"exhibitions buildings, whereas the permanent buildings had a neoclassical style. The",Paragraph
"EUR was not completed because of the war; still, what is left proves wrong the",Paragraph
"widespread misconception that after Bernini and Borromini, little of significance was",Paragraph
built in Rome.,Paragraph
"EUR lies to the south of the city, toward the sea, in an area that had been open",Paragraph
countryside until only a few years before. The building project was entrusted to the top,Paragraph
"architects of the day, who sought to blend the principles of ancient classical architecture",Paragraph
with European rationalism. One fine example of this composite style is the Palazzo della,Paragraph
"Civilta del Lavoro, familiarly known as the “square colosseum.” The defining features of",Paragraph
this original zone are the broad avenues and wide-open squares.,Paragraph
The Fascist era also saw the building of another major example of this type of,Paragraph
"architecture: the Foro Italico. Formerly named after Mussolini, the Foro Italico is a large",Paragraph
"sports complex that encloses several facilities, including an indoor swimming pool",Paragraph
"decorated with mosaic work. It also contains the Stadio dei Marmi, a stadium encircled",Caption
by 60 marble statues of athletes donated by towns and cities around the country. A sphere,Caption
measuring three meters in diameter rests in the forecourt.,Caption
"The Dora zone, completed in 1926, offers a unique example of Roman architectural",Paragraph
"eclecticism from the early years of the 20th century. A large, decorated arch leads rather",Paragraph
"unexpectedly into a remarkable area designed by Gino Coppedé, whose surname provides",Paragraph
"the popular name for the zone. Every building has its own special ornamentation, though",Paragraph
Art Nouveau and mock-medieval motifs stand out in the rich mix of styles.,Paragraph
"After the war, the Italian architects who had best represented the cause of modern",Paragraph
"architecture were dead: G.L.Banfi, G. Pagano, E.Persico, and G.Terragni. However, a",Paragraph
new sensation started influencing Italian culture: that of making contact with reality in a,Paragraph
"new way, seeing reality with new eyes. It was this sensation that gave rise to Neorealism,",Paragraph
which became widely known thanks to the films of Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio De,Paragraph
Sica but that influenced the arts and architecture as well. The best example of the latter is,Paragraph
the architecture of Ridolfi at Terni and the Tiburtino district in Rome in the early 1950s.,Paragraph
"To the design of the Tiburtino district, a sort of manifesto of architectural neorealism,",Paragraph
"C.Aymonino, C.Chiarini, M.Fiorentino. F.Gorio, M.Lanza, S.Lenci, P.Lugli,",Caption
"C.Melograni, G. Menichetti, L.Quaroni, and M.Valori also contributed.",Paragraph
"Neorealism, particularly for the architects of the Roman School (Ridolfi, Quaroni, and",Paragraph
"Fiorentino), is characterized by a concern for everyday reality, a preference for popular",Paragraph
"forms, an interest for one’s immediate environment, and the rejection of any abstraction.",Paragraph
"Such concerns were already evident in the design for the Stazione Termini (1947), the",Paragraph
"new Rome railway station, by Quaroni, Ridolfi, and Fiorentino. Between 1950 and 1954,",Caption
"Ridolfi also designed what was a nucleus of innovative tall houses on the Viale Etiopia,",Paragraph
"the so-called African quarter. In the years between 1954 and 1962, three different plans",Paragraph
were prepared for Rome while architects were facing a cultural and political debate that,Paragraph
included the status of a new town-planning discipline and a new legal ruling on building,Paragraph
"land. In the 1962 plan, inspired by Quaroni and Piccinato, a multifunctional axis girdling",Paragraph
the east zone of the city was due to connect up with the national superhighway system. In,Paragraph
"addition, the plan included the creation of three areas of expansion that would deploy",Paragraph
"some of the functions of the congested city center. Unfortunately, the Rome plan was not",Paragraph
"realized, mainly because of administrative deficiencies.",Paragraph
"For the Olympic Games in 1960, the Palazzo and Palazzetto dello Sport and the",Paragraph

"noticeable are the new magistrates’ courts, designed by the Perugini-Monteduro group",Paragraph

with advanced techniques of prefabrication.,Paragraph
"From 1975 to 1984, while Rome had a left-wing administration, there were plans for",Paragraph
"rehabilitating the most derelict districts (borgate), building new public housing, acquiring",Paragraph

"Aldo Rossi was an influential architect, designer, teacher, and theoretician whose",Paragraph
works emphasized historical types and memories as poetic elements in architectural,Paragraph
"design. Working primarily in Italy, his later work was designed and constructed for cities",Paragraph
"in the United States, Germany, Argentina, and Japan.",Paragraph
"Rossi’s representations of architecture, from the scale of furniture to that of urbanism,",Paragraph
were reminiscent of Giorgio de Chirico’s metaphysical paintings and the Enlightenment-,Paragraph
era projects of Etienne-Louis Boullée. Rossi’s design sketches contain haunting,Paragraph
"irregularities of scale and typology, disciplined and refined in their final construction.",Paragraph
"Rossi’s timeless vocabulary of forms remained relatively constant throughout his career,",Paragraph
"although the scale, material, and functions shift across projects. His works synthesized",Paragraph
"pure repetition, modern space, and remembered forms into a singular vision that he",Paragraph
"named “analogous architecture,” and the frequent return to the questions of cultural",Paragraph
"meaning and signification in architectural forms permeated his writings, images, and",Paragraph
buildings.,Paragraph
Rossi’s professional education at the Milan Polytechnic brought him into close contact,Paragraph
with Marxist critical theory and the revolutionary potentials in architecture under the,Paragraph
influence of Italian Neorealism in the arts. These sources influenced his work as a writer,Paragraph
and editor of the journal Casabella-Continuita (1961-64). Although his early written and,Paragraph
built work was sympathetic to the ascetic modernism of the Viennese architect Adolph,Paragraph
"Loos (1870-1933), he moved far from this position in his later career.",Paragraph
"In 1966, Rossi published his influential book on urban theory titled L'Architettura",Paragraph

"morphology as inseparable and always saturated with history, the city is conceived as a",Paragraph
"political construct. Written from a rationalist perspective indebted to the Enlightenment,",Paragraph
the text places politicized humanist concerns over the orthodoxy of modernist,Paragraph
functionalism and forms. Monuments and housing types are saturated with unique social,Paragraph
and political meanings and cannot be considered purely functionalist forms. This,Paragraph
reconceptualization of the historically structured meanings of cities operated as the,Paragraph
foundation for his and others subsequent designs.,Paragraph
Rossi’s later writings and projects moved from an ascetic architecture of concrete to,Paragraph
rich metaphoric constructions invoking memories of cities (as fragments). It was a,Paragraph
progression from ideological concerns to questions of memory and a revival of humanist,Title
"referents, an attempt to recuperate what modern urbanism had eliminated. Rossi’s works",Paragraph
were a deeply personal examination and reconstruction of architecture’s own history.,Paragraph
Rossi did not copy or imitate existing models but proposed reduced typological elements,Paragraph
to allow cultural and personal meanings to be projected into them. Relying on a limited,Paragraph
number of significant classical types and anonymous vernacular forms that are,Paragraph
"immediately familiar, Rossi’s architecture animated memories of these architectural",Paragraph
forms to create a strong visual and spatial effect of timelessness.,Paragraph
"Rossi’s architecture communicated simultaneously personal and archetypal concepts,",Paragraph
much like a visual language. He frequently described this method as “analogous,Paragraph
"architecture,” which he derived from the work of psychologist Carl Jung, who described",Paragraph
"analogous thought as “sensed yet unreal, imagined yet silent...it is archaic, unexpressed,",Paragraph
and practically inexpressible in words.” Analogous architecture draws on the dialogue,Paragraph
between the real and representation (as in photography or theater) to communicate,Paragraph
"meaning through nonlinguistic associations, fusing past and present into experience and",Paragraph
remembering.,Paragraph
Rossi examined the limits of analogous architecture at a large urban scale in his later,Paragraph
works and specifically through drawing in the hypothetical designs for an Analogous City,Paragraph
(1976) and an invited entry to the Roma Interrotta (1977). Given the original segment of,Paragraph
"Nolli’s map of Rome containing the Baths of Caracalla, Rossi proposed a historically",Paragraph
"self-conscious architecture that was to be “borrowed, converted, and invented,” a habitual",Paragraph

history.”,Paragraph

precise architectural expression but then involved distinct Platonic shapes found in books,Paragraph

"Rossi’s first built large-scale project, the urban housing project Gallaratese (1969-73)",Paragraph
"in Milan, was a fusion of high-modernist housing typology within an attenuated form",Paragraph

The circulation is arranged as corridors or elevated private streets unseen from the ground,Paragraph
"plane. Each housing unit appears identical, with identical fenestration, and the overall",Paragraph

Rossi completed two schools that evoked a concern with childhood memories through,Paragraph
"his emergent vocabulary. The elementary school (1972-76) at Fagnano Olana, Italy, and",Paragraph
"a secondary school (1979) at Broni, Italy, are both organized around a dominant central",Paragraph
courtyard containing individualized central elements as in the early plaza designs. The,Paragraph
public space is defined spatially by a strong perimeter boundary created by the repetition,Paragraph
of identical classrooms. This classical ordering schema appears in most later projects,Paragraph
when the functional program contains a diversity of spaces.,Paragraph
The role of timeless forms and historical memories in architecture is evident in Rossi’s,Paragraph

triangular district articulated as a labyrinth or mandatory path. The cemetery complex,Paragraph
"draws heavily on visual and historical references to history, memory, and death through",Paragraph
Rossi’s remembered archetypal forms.,Paragraph
"During San Cataldo’s construction, Rossi’s written and drawn works began to attract",Paragraph
"significant international recognition, defining a place for the reemergence of history in",Paragraph
"the postmodern period. Contemporaneous with San Cataldo, Rossi’s architecture began to",Paragraph
"include increasingly differentiated materiality (pattern, color, and textures) and overt",Paragraph
references to nostalgic memories of historic precedents. Timeless historical types become,Paragraph
specific to their unique sites and contexts. Rossi’s early interest in cinema and theater,Paragraph
became a dominant analogy in the theoretical and urban projects that followed.,Paragraph
"The Teatro del Mondo (Theater of the World), created for the Venice Biennale (1979),",Paragraph
was a floating pavilion enclosing a centralized theater space. The steel frame of its,Paragraph
"octagonal wood form was welded to a functioning barge that traveled the seas of Italy,",Paragraph

ROW HOUSE,Title
"The row house, also known as a town house in the United States or a terrace house in",Paragraph
"England, is a ubiquitous feature of Western urban landscapes. It is defined as one unit of",Paragraph
a series of attached houses that shares at least one common wall with its neighbor. The,Paragraph
traditional urban row house front is parallel to the street and shares sidewalls with its,Paragraph
"neighbors, giving it a narrow, rectangular footprint and only two facades. Generally, it is",Paragraph
one or two rooms wide but varies in depth and height.,Paragraph
Certain features of the row house are timeless. It has housed the entire socioeconomic,Paragraph
spectrum and thus ranges from luxurious in size and appointments to small and,Paragraph
"functional. Although it remained essentially a static, relatively rigid form until this past",Paragraph
"century, it has been affected by changes in architectural styles and societal needs in ways",Paragraph
"similar to freestanding homes. It is cheaper to build and easier to maintain, and its street",Paragraph
access keeps residents attuned to their neighborhood. Its efficient land use and sense of,Paragraph
private space make it an attractive alternative to higher-density apartment blocks. It has,Paragraph
consistently fought the idea that attached housing is less desirable than freestanding,Paragraph
housing and in the final decades of the 20th century has experienced a renaissance as a,Paragraph
solution to many housing issues in historic and newly developing cities around the world.,Paragraph
"Formerly, row houses were built by individual owners or in groups by small-scale",Paragraph
"speculators. Twentieth-century row houses, however, were most commonly built in entire",Paragraph
blocks or complexes by developers who included community facilities as part of the,Paragraph
complex. Row houses were designed not as individual entities but as component parts of,Paragraph
a larger whole and were seen in relation to the community at large. Despite this emphasis,Paragraph
"on the whole, market-driven builders still attempted to make attached houses",Paragraph
"individualized and private by varying the facades, building materials, floor plans, and",Paragraph
home sizes from unit to unit and minimizing intrusions from neighbors. There was,Paragraph
increased attention to row house surroundings as well. It became universal to provide,Paragraph
"each unit with private outdoor living spaces, such as patios, balconies, and gardens, and",Paragraph
landscaping became a crucial part of town house design. Access to services and private,Paragraph
garages was provided by alleys linked to the urban street grid.,Paragraph
The form of the 20th-century row house had infinite variations defined by local or,Paragraph
regional preferences or characterized by broader architectural design trends. Those built,Paragraph
"as urban in-fill often attempted to blend in by echoing older houses in scale, materials,",Paragraph
"and orientation, but architects emphasized individuality by varying the facades or",Paragraph
"staggering the houses by height or setback. As many were built in suburban areas, the",Paragraph
row house form was liberated in these more expansive settings from the gridlike plots of,Paragraph
"city streets. Traditional straight rows continued, but circles, clusters, steps, and curves",Paragraph
were common as well. Groups of houses were often designed to follow the topography of,Paragraph
"their location, rising up hillsides or curving along a shoreline, as seen in San Francisco or",Paragraph
"Miami. The shape of each house unit itself varied widely, from a plain gabled block to",Paragraph
"such extremes as a trapezoid or even a tilted cube, as in Piet Blom’s Pole Houses (1978—",Paragraph
84) near Rotterdam. The widespread adoption of central heating and electricity enabled,Paragraph
open floor plans designed to meet the needs of different populations. Interior space was,Paragraph
greatly expanded by the use of split-level floor plans. Large windows and glass walls,Caption
brought in more air and light than ever before. Another universal change was the addition,Paragraph
"of the garage, as convenient parking was a much-desired amenity after the automobile",Paragraph
"was made affordable to the middle classes. Initially, the garage was tucked under or",Paragraph
"behind the house, but more recently it has become part of the ground-level facade. In",Paragraph
"terms of style, eclecticism was mixed with pure form; 20th-century row houses expressed",Paragraph
all the major architectural trends of the century and admixtures thereof and were designed,Paragraph
by idealistic architects and profit-minded developers alike.,Paragraph
Twentieth-century changes in society and land use have had an immeasurable impact,Paragraph
"on the row house, which diverged dramatically from its constricted plan and adapted",Paragraph
"itself to both city and suburban lifestyles with astonishing flexibility. Initially, its popular",Paragraph
"image was negative, as older row house neighborhoods became slums and the attached",Paragraph
house seemed to connote an undesirable ethic. The vast spread of suburbs and commuter,Paragraph
culture led to the building of millions of detached homes across the countryside while,Paragraph
row houses were left behind in the cities to deteriorate. Although innovative row house,Paragraph
designs were explored in prewar Europe and working-class row houses were still built in,Paragraph
"growing cities, the form was obsolete elsewhere. Urban-renewal efforts in the 1960s led",Paragraph
"to the razing of entire row house neighborhoods in favor of high-rise public housing, seen",Paragraph
"as the best way to house the inner-city poor. By the 1980s, however, social reformers",Paragraph
"concluded that this housing type bred crime, misery, and a sense of isolation, and soon",Paragraph
many cities began tearing down the high-rise projects and replacing them with new row,Paragraph
houses.,Paragraph
"The rediscovery of the row house was not limited to public housing, however. By the",Paragraph
"1970s, faced with environmental conservation efforts and rising land costs, developers",Paragraph
began to reconsider town houses as a commercially viable option. The row house lent,Paragraph
"itself nicely to the concept of a condominium development, which gave it a more upscale",Paragraph
"image, and increasing concerns about sprawl have made town house communities a",Paragraph
popular option. Greater appreciation of historic town houses has added to the appeal of,Paragraph
"new ones. Vacation homes have become another force behind the row house revival, as",Paragraph
many resort developments were restricted in size because of land conservation and,Paragraph
higher-density attached housing was needed to shelter increasing numbers of vacationers.,Paragraph
"Finally, changes in the traditional family unit also supported town house developments,",Paragraph
"with increasing numbers of single people, divorced parents, childless couples, and",Paragraph
"retirees seeking smaller-sized homes. For many members of these groups, a row house",Paragraph
fulfills the need for one’s own house and garden while providing certain amenities not,Paragraph
"found in a detached home. Increased security, decreased maintenance, lower costs, and a",Paragraph
feeling of community among neighbors are common motivations. Many architects,Paragraph
"designed successful town house communities by targeting these demographic groups,",Paragraph
adapting the once-inflexible row house to meet highly specific needs.,Paragraph

"Between 1958 and 1962, Rowe was a lecturer at Cambridge University. There, Peter",Paragraph

ROYAL INSTITUTE OF BRITISH,Title
ARCHITECTS (RIBA),Title
The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) began its life in 1834 under the name,Paragraph
“Institute of British Architects.” After a Royal Charter was obtained from William IV in,Paragraph
"1837, the term “Royal” was added, and the purpose of the RIBA was clearly expressed:",Paragraph
“(for) the general advancement of Civil Architecture and for promoting and facilitating,Paragraph
the acquirement of the knowledge of the various Arts and Sciences connected therewith.”,Paragraph
"During the period from 1834 to 1900, most of the structure and workings of the 20th-",Paragraph
"century RIBA were put into place. Its Register of Architects, Architectural Library and",Paragraph
"Drawings Collection, Competitions Committee, Professional Practice Committee,",Caption
"Qualification Examinations, Scale of Charges, Code of Professional Conduct,",Paragraph
"membership rules, and publication of building contracts were all established during this",Paragraph
time.,Paragraph
Architectural examinations became a compulsory condition of RIBA membership in,Paragraph
"1882, but it was not until 1905 that the RIBA adopted the policy of statutory (rather than",Paragraph
discretionary) registration of architects. This policy move was brought on by pressure,Paragraph
"from the Society of Architects, a body formed in 1884 by dissatisfied RIBA members.",Paragraph
The Society of Architects and the RIBA later merged in 1925.,Paragraph
"In 1931, a competition was held to design the national headquarters of the RIBA on",Paragraph
Portland Place in London. This competition was won by George Grey Wornum (1888—,Paragraph
"1957), and the building opened in 1934. The building’s appearance is very much a",Paragraph
"product of its time period: not quite completely modernist—instead, a rather stripped-",Paragraph
down classicism bordering on Art Deco in its subtle usage of a limited palette of,Paragraph
"materials, generous proportions, and low-relief sculpture. The RIBA’s London",Caption
"Headquarters, however, does befit a building representing a professional body: it is",Paragraph
prominently located on the corner of Portland Place and Devonshire Street and contains,Paragraph
"the RIBA’s library, a large auditorium, a bookshop, several sizes of gallery spaces, and",Paragraph
"the RIBA’s administrative offices, all organized around a central main stairway.",Paragraph
One of the most significant changes to the RIBA in the 20th century was the,Paragraph
"Architects’ Registration Act, which came into force on | January 1932. This took the",Paragraph
responsibility for the architects’ register away from the RIBA and gave it to a newly,Paragraph
formed Architects Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK). This,Paragraph
separation of duties came about because the RIBA was beginning to be seen by the,Paragraph
government less like the representative body of the profession and more as merely a,Paragraph
“gentleman’s club.” It was thought that if the register were kept separately from the,Paragraph
"RIBA, then the public’s interests would be better served.",Paragraph
"The RIBA, however, still maintained control over professional examinations and the",Paragraph
schools of architecture that were accredited to conduct them. This division of labor is,Paragraph
"completely opposite to the situation in the United States, where the National Council of",Paragraph
Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) is responsible for architectural examinations,Paragraph
and the American Institute of Architects (AIA) for professional registration. Membership,Paragraph
in the RIBA (of which registration with ARCUK is mandatory) gives an architect the,Paragraph
"right to call him- or herself a “chartered architect,” whereas registration with the ARCUK",Paragraph
allows only for the title “registered architect.”,Paragraph
The years following World War II saw a large increase in the number of architects in,Paragraph
"England to match the increased amount of construction, especially in the area of public",Paragraph
housing. A widening of architects’ responsibilities also occurred. In addition to the,Paragraph
"traditional roles of building designer and construction manager, British architects began",Paragraph
to take leading roles in processes from large-scale town planning to smaller-scale,Paragraph
"furniture design. During this time, the RIBA focused its attention mainly on influencing",Paragraph
"the way that architects functioned and were treated. Topics such as fee scales, salaries,",Paragraph
"government interference, economic fluctuations, and the promotion of “good”",Title
architecture were addressed and attempted to be regulated.,Paragraph
"In 1969, three separate companies owned by the RIBA were formed to provide",Paragraph
additional services for RIBA members above those provided by membership fees. RIBA,Paragraph
Publications Ltd issues legal and professional documents used by architects and the,Paragraph
"construction industry and also runs the RIBA Bookshops in London, Manchester, Leeds,",Paragraph
"Birmingham, and Belfast. RIBA Services Ltd provides technical and other services, such",Paragraph
"as the RIBA Product Selector, Office Library Service, Conference and Exhibition",Paragraph
"Service, Appointments (Employment) Bureau, and RIBA-approved Building Site",Caption
"Signboards. Finally, National Building Specifications Ltd publishes specification",Paragraph
documents to be used in conjunction with professional contracts. The ownership of these,Paragraph
"companies was transferred to a holding company, RIBA Companies Ltd, in 1985.",Paragraph
"The British economic boom of the 1980s, combined with government policies that",Paragraph
"decreased social architecture expenditure, saw many British architects move away from",Paragraph
jobs with local government authorities and into the private sector. During this same time,Paragraph
"period, the RIBA was forced by the Thatcher government to change its standard fixed-",Paragraph
percentage scale of charges from “mandatory” to “recommended.” The result was a more,Paragraph
competitive atmosphere in which architects began undercutting each other in hopes of a,Paragraph
"commission—devaluing the knowledge, skill, and experience that a professional architect",Paragraph
possesses.,Paragraph
"During the 1990s, the RIBA endeavored to become more open to its members and the",Paragraph
general public. The most physical result of this campaign was renovating and restyling its,Paragraph
"London headquarters; incorporating a privately run cafe, a new bookstore, additional",Paragraph
"gallery space, and handicapped access; and founding an Architecture Center open to the",Paragraph
"public. In 1995, the RIBA introduced a program of compulsory Continuing Professional",Paragraph
"Development for its members, similar to the ALA’s Continuing Education System (CES),",Paragraph
in which members must periodically update their knowledge of professional and,Paragraph
technical issues to keep abreast of new developments.,Paragraph
"In 1993, a report to the Department of the Environment recommended abolishing",Paragraph
architects’ statutory registration with ARCUK and ending the protection of the title,Title
"“architect.” These recommendations did not come to be. Instead, in 1997, ARCUK was",Paragraph
"changed to the “Architects Registration Board” (ARB), a majority of whose council",Paragraph
members are external lay members (nonarchitects). The consequences of this on the,Paragraph
RIBA is yet to be seen in the 21st century.,Paragraph

"Soon after, Rudolph received the commission for Yale’s Art and Architecture Building",Paragraph
"(1958-64), a building that would unite the teaching of the arts in one monumental",Paragraph
structure in fulfillment of many of Rudolph’s developing ideas about urbanism. The,Paragraph
building was a monumental gateway marking the western edge of the campus. It was the,Paragraph
culmination of a processional that led the pedestrian from the New Haven Green past,Paragraph
"Yale’s earlier arts building, among them Louis Kahn’s Yale University Art Gallery",Paragraph
"(1955). The rough-edged, corduroy-like exterior was achieved by first pouring the",Paragraph
concrete into forms and then breaking the ridged edges with a bush hammer to create an,Paragraph
irregular outline that would cast an ever-changing play of shadows across the facade.,Paragraph
"Although it was similar to Le Corbusier’s beton brut, this method was actually derived",Paragraph
from the precisely rendered parallel lines in Rudolph’s pen-and-ink drawings. The,Paragraph
building resembled both Le Corbusier’s La Tourette (1955) and Wright’s then recently,Paragraph
demolished Larkin Building (1903).,Caption
"However, in violation of the established norms of modernism, the labyrinthine interior",Paragraph
seemed to have little relation to the exterior. The 36 or so different levels were arranged,Paragraph
in a pinwheel-like form around two double-height central spaces containing a drafting,Paragraph
room and jury pit. The building was topped by a glamorous penthouse that housed,Paragraph
"visiting lecturers and critics overnight. The sublimely gloomy, cavernous interior spaces",Paragraph
disconcerted many who thought that they were more like a glimpse into the maker’s,Paragraph
unconscious than a rational design for a school for the arts. Rudolph carpeted the building,Paragraph

curtain by the abstract expressionist artist Willem de Kooning.,Paragraph

of Beaux-Arts plaster casts and ornamental fragments from demolished Louis Sullivan,Caption

"camp, also practiced by Philip Johnson at this time, that reacted against the normative",Paragraph
"conditions enforced by postwar modernism and society. Most remarkably, the rough-",Paragraph
edged concrete surfaces found both inside and out gave the building an aura of aggression,Paragraph
that had as much to do with the hypermasculinization of postwar homosexual culture,Paragraph
"(e.g. the interest in bodybuilding and male figures of rebellion, such as James Dean and",Paragraph
Marlon Brando) as it did with anything found in the culture of architecture. Vincent,Paragraph
Scully said that the roughened surfaces were sadomasochistic. “The building repels,Paragraph
"touch: it hurts you if you try,” he wrote in Architectural Review in 1964. Rudolph",Paragraph
intended his surfaces to be a statement in favor of decoration and expression—qualities,Paragraph
long repressed by the Modern movement—and against the alienation and corporate,Paragraph
"conformity of the slick, glass-walled structures of the International Style.",Paragraph
"Although it was soon called “Brutalist,” the building’s highly aestheticized values were",Paragraph
"in fact the diametric opposite of the British Brutalism practiced by the Smithsons. In fact,",Paragraph
Banham said that the Art and Architecture building had nothing to do with his definition,Paragraph
"of Brutalism. The building was actually the culmination of the monumental, heroic",Paragraph

defend the liberal arts against the sciences and mass culture.,Paragraph
The accidental burning of the building in 1969 at the height of student unrest and the,Paragraph
apocrypha that this has generated has unfortunately overshadowed Rudolph’s other,Paragraph
"achievements. Leaving Yale in 1965 for private practice, Rudolph began a series of",Paragraph

Services Center (1962-71); and the master plan for a campus that he regarded as the most,Paragraph
complete expression of his ideas: the University of Massachusetts (1963-72) in,Paragraph
Dartmouth. An idea for which Rudolph is rarely given credit was the development of a,Paragraph
"rough-surfaced, mass-produced concrete block ubiquitous in American construction",Paragraph
during the 1970s that economically imitated the effects of his bush hammer construction.,Paragraph
"By the early 1970s, Rudolph’s monumental projects had fallen out of favor with clients",Paragraph
who thought that they were expensive and impractical and with a younger generation that,Paragraph
"now saw them as representing the Establishment. A casualty of state politics, the",Paragraph
University of Massachusetts campus was taken away from Rudolph and completed by,Paragraph
"others, and the Boston Government Services Center—intended to house the health,",Paragraph
"education, and welfare bureaucracy of the Great Society—was never completed. This",Paragraph
virtual ruin became a symbol of the demise of the liberal idealism of the 1960s after the,Paragraph
political and economic disarray of the early 1970s. The chorus of critical voices that had,Paragraph
"begun to turn against Rudolph culminated with the publication in 1972 of Robert Venturi,",Paragraph

many similarities between their ideas.,Paragraph
"During the 1970s and 1980s, Rudolph returned to practicing architecture in an austere,",Paragraph
almost 19th-century atelier-like environment. He maintained rigorous control of his,Paragraph

RUSSIA AND SOVIET UNION,Title
The origins of 20th-century Russian architecture derive not only from technological,Paragraph
advances in construction at the turn of the century but also from a reaction to 19th-,Paragraph
century Western eclectic styles that architects in St. Petersburg and Moscow applied,Paragraph
"profusely to the facades of apartment houses and commercial buildings. By the 1870s,",Paragraph
there arose a national style based on decorative elements from medieval Muscovy as well,Paragraph
as on motifs from folk art and traditional wooden architecture. Major examples of the,Paragraph
"Russian style in Moscow include the Historical Museum (1874-83), built on the north",Paragraph
"side of Red Square to a design by Vladimir Shervud (1833-97), and the Upper Trading",Caption
"Rows (1889-93) by Alexander Pomerantsev (1848-1918), assisted by the construction",Paragraph
engineer Vladimir Shukhov (1853-1939). The influence of this historicism continued,Paragraph
through the early 1900s as the “neo-Russian” component of the style moderne. Painters,Paragraph
"such as Viktor Vasnetsov (1848-1926), who created the entrance building at the",Paragraph
"Tretiakov Gallery (c. 1905), and Sergei Maliutin (1859-1937) were particularly active in",Paragraph
using traditional Russian decorative arts as part of a new architectural aesthetic.,Paragraph
"The “new style,” or style moderne, that arose in Russian architecture at the turn of the",Paragraph
century included among its diverse sources the Arts and Crafts component of the Russian,Paragraph
Revival style as well as Art Nouveau and the Vienna School. Its main emphasis was on,Paragraph
"the innovative use of materials such as glass, iron, and glazed brick in functional yet",Paragraph
"highly aesthetic designs. The style flourished above all in Moscow, where its leading",Paragraph
practitioner was Fedor Shekhtel (1859-1926). Shekhtel worked primarily for patrons,Paragraph
"among Moscow’s entrepreneurial elite, such as the extended Riabushinsky family. His",Paragraph
"most notable work was a mansion (1900-02) for Stepan Riabushinsky, which is rivaled",Paragraph
by his more modernist design for the Alexandra Derozhinsky mansion (1901). Shekhtel,Paragraph
"also designed a number of commercial buildings and public buildings in Moscow, such as",Paragraph
the Yaroslavl Railway Station.,Paragraph
Other leading architects of the early 20th century in Moscow include Lev Kekushev,Paragraph
"(1863-1919), Adolf Erikhson, and William Walcot (1874-1943). All three were involved",Paragraph
in the prolonged construction of one of the largest and most significant moderne,Paragraph
"buildings in Russia: the Hotel Metropole (1899-1905). Like Shekhtel, both Kekushev",Paragraph
and Walcot produced major examples of the modern style in the design of private houses,Paragraph
for wealthy clients.,Paragraph
"In St. Petersburg, the style moderne appeared primarily in the design of apartment",Paragraph
complexes by architects. (St. Petersburg’s relatively compact urban plan impeded the,Paragraph
"construction of detached private houses.) Yet, despite the rapid expansion of apartment",Paragraph
"space, the lack of adequate housing, particularly for workers, remained a major social",Paragraph
"problem. The style moderne also appeared in St. Petersburg’s commercial buildings, such",Paragraph
as the Singer Building (1902-04) on Nevsky Prospekt by Pavel Siuzor (1844-c.1919).,Paragraph
"After 1905 the style moderne began to merge with a form of modernized classicism,",Paragraph
known in Russia as neoklassitsizm. Architects in St. Petersburg were especially receptive,Paragraph
"to the neoclassical revival, and they applied it to almost every major structural type,",Paragraph
"including banks, department stores, apartment buildings, and private houses. One of the",Paragraph
"most accomplished and versatile architects in this style was Fedor Lidval (1870-1945),",Paragraph
designer of the Hotel Astoria (1911-12).,Caption
"In Moscow the most accomplished revivalist was Roman Klein (1858-1924), architect",Paragraph
of the Museum of Fine Arts (1897-1912; known since 1937 as the Pushkin Museum) and,Paragraph
"the Muir and Mirrielees department store (1906-08). Although less prolific than Klein,",Paragraph
other architects distinguished themselves in a more austere variant of the neoclassical,Paragraph

"Russia’s rapidly developing industrial base lay in a shambles after a war, a revolution,",Paragraph
and a civil war; technological resources were extremely limited in what was still a mainly,Paragraph
rural nation; and Moscow’s population—poorly housed before the war—increased,Paragraph
dramatically as the city became in 1918 the administrative center of a thoroughly,Paragraph
"administered state. One of the USSR’s earliest edicts, in August 1918, repealed the right",Paragraph
"to private ownership of urban real estate. Even as the country plunged into civil war,",Paragraph
groups of architects in Moscow and Petrograd (formerly St. Petersburg) designed,Paragraph
workers’ settlements that represent an extension of the Garden City movement which had,Paragraph
already tentatively appeared in Russia during the decade before World War I.,Paragraph
"The prerevolutionary building boom had established a viable foundation, in both",Paragraph
"architectural theory and practice, for urban development on a large scale. Furthermore,",Paragraph
the Russian architectural profession was relatively intact after the emigration that,Paragraph
"decimated other areas of Russian culture after the revolution. In addition, the most",Paragraph
prominent art and architectural schools in Moscow and Petrograd were capable of,Paragraph
providing a base for the development of new cadres despite sometimes sweeping changes,Paragraph
"in the composition of the faculty. Nonetheless, there were enormous problems in",Paragraph
"resuscitating these institutions, of allocating resources for new construction, and of",Paragraph
devising a plan for coordinating further development.,Paragraph
"With the gradual recovery of the economy in the 1920s, bold new designs—often",Paragraph
utopian in concept—brought the USSR to the attention of modern architects throughout,Paragraph
the world. The assumption that a revolution in architecture (along with the other arts),Paragraph
would inevitably accompany a political revolution was soon put to the test by social and,Paragraph
economic realities. The brief history of the Soviet avant-garde in architecture was marked,Paragraph
"by theoretical debates and factional disputes, such as that between rationalism and",Paragraph
"Constructivism. At the same time, the role of artists such as El Lissitzky, Kazimir",Paragraph
"Malevich, Vladimir Tatlin, and Nikolai Punin in defining new approaches to volume and",Paragraph
structure had a profound impact on the conceptualization of avant-garde architecture.,Paragraph
"Constructivism, the most productive modernist movement, adopted a rigorously",Paragraph

"After World War IL, architectural design became more firmly locked in traditional,",Paragraph

"Moscow State University (1949-53) by Lev Rudnev (1885-1956), Pavel Abrosimov",Caption
"(1900-61), and Alexander Khriakov (1903-76). On this, as on several other projects",Paragraph
"during the Stalinist period, much of the construction was done by prison labor.",Paragraph
"In the period following Stalin’s death, in March 1953, a reassessment of priorities,",Paragraph
"particularly in regard to the housing crisis, led to a functionalism that had been among the",Paragraph
goals of Soviet design and planning during the 1920s. Teams of engineers and architects,Paragraph
began to produce standardized plans that could be applied with relatively simple,Paragraph
"technology, and the pursuit of a historical framework for architectural style was largely",Paragraph
"discarded, as indicated by the abolition of the Academy of Architecture in the early",Paragraph
Khrushchev era. The acceleration of standardized construction achieved an impressive,Paragraph
"volume, first with five-story apartment buildings that appeared throughout the country",Paragraph
"and subsequently with mass-produced buildings as high as 20 stories and, in rare cases,",Paragraph
even higher.,Paragraph
The industrialization of building and the curbing of decorative pomposity produced a,Paragraph
"different set of problems. Apart from the general monotony of design, creative projects",Paragraph
"were constrained by the processes of standardized, “industrial” construction based on",Paragraph
prefabricated modules or precast-concrete forms assembled on-site. The seams and,Paragraph
cracks that resulted from such methods of assembly gave many buildings a shoddy,Paragraph
"appearance. Whatever the project type, Soviet architects were usually faced with a",Paragraph
natrow range of options limited by mass-construction methods and meager financial,Paragraph
resources.,Paragraph
Even showcase projects with considerable support shared in the general monotony.,Paragraph
The most prolific practitioner of postwar Soviet modernism was Mikhail Posokhin,Paragraph
"(1910-89), who had collaborated in the design of a Stalinist apartment tower on",Paragraph
Insurrection Square but shifted adroitly into the new functionalism of the Sputnik era. His,Paragraph
"design for the Kremlin Palace of Congresses (1959-61, in collaboration with A.",Caption
"Mndoiants and others) had the appearance of a modern concert hall of huge proportions,",Paragraph
whose marble-clad rectangular outline was marked by narrow pylons—also faced with,Paragraph
white marble—and multistoried shafts of plate glass. The main virtue of its style was how,Paragraph
"relatively unobtrusively the large structure stood among the historic Kremlin ensemble,",Paragraph
part of which had been destroyed in the 1930s.,Paragraph
Not all Soviet architecture of the modern period descended to nondescript conformity.,Paragraph
"Futuristic construction technology appeared in the Ostankino Television Tower (1967,",Paragraph
"N.Nikitin, L.Batalov, and others), a reinforced-concrete monolith of impressive design",Paragraph
"and engineering. The ferroconcrete shaft, 385 meters in height (on a foundation of only",Paragraph
"four meters), supports a steel-frame antenna superstructure that rises another 150 meters.",Paragraph
Technological ingenuity also characterizes the design of many contemporary sports,Paragraph
"arenas, which, like television, served the regime’s propaganda interests. Large stadium",Paragraph
"complexes began to take shape even in the late Stalinist period, such as Leningrad’s",Paragraph
"Kirov Stadium (1950, A.Nikolskii and others) on Krestovskii Island and culminating with",Paragraph
"the Luzhniki stadium complex (1955-56, A.Vlasov and others) in south Moscow. The",Paragraph
"emphasis on the culture of sports, which reached a crescendo in the preparations for the",Paragraph
"1980 Summer Olympics, produced some of the most interesting forms in contemporary",Paragraph
Russian architecture. An example notable for its high technology and sweeping lines is,Paragraph

"Moscow suburb of Krylatskoe, with a bifurcated roof composed of rolled-steel",Paragraph
membranes four millimeters thick stretched between a pair of tilted elliptical arches,Paragraph
supported by a truss frame system.,Paragraph
"With the demise of the Communist system in the USSR, the revival of private practice",Paragraph
"in architecture seems likely to change the face of the profession, even as new problems",Paragraph
"arise in zoning, housing, and resource allocation. Foreign investment has encouraged the",Paragraph
"assimilation of Western commercial architecture, from modernism to postmodernism to",Paragraph
"deconstructivism. At the same time, historicist elements from Russian and even Stalinist",Paragraph

was simple in form and refined in its combination of restrained and appropriately Nordic,Paragraph
"omamentation, including frescoes by Akseli Gallen-Kallela.",Caption
Saarinen’s ability to spend the long hours necessary for solving complex architectural,Paragraph
problems was the basis for his subsequent success. With his designs for the Helsinki and,Paragraph
"Viipuri Railroad Stations, he moved away from seeking a uniquely Finnish solution and",Paragraph
"toward International Style modernism, allowing function to play an ever-larger role in",Paragraph

An Israel-born and Canada-educated architect who has maintained practices in,Paragraph
"Jerusalem, Montreal, Boston, and elsewhere, Moshe Safdie is best known for his",Paragraph
"internationally recognized modern revisionist project, the Habitat housing experiment for",Paragraph
the 1967 World’s Exposition in Montreal.,Paragraph
The initial idea for Habitat came to Safdie when he was working on his student thesis,Paragraph
"concerning cellular housing, questioning the social, environmental, ethical, and tectonic",Paragraph
ideas of modernist architecture. Safdie drew on his childhood memories of the Israeli,Paragraph
settlements to create an unsentimental articulate structure based on these traditional,Paragraph
forms. Habitat was one of the first prefabricated housing complexes built at the time and,Paragraph
was the forerunner of R.Buckminster Fuller’s megastructure Triton City (1968). Fuller’s,Paragraph
"project model introduced a floating city comprised of prefabricated cellular units, a",Paragraph
"flexible structure that was never realized. It was during the late 1960s that Safdie, like",Paragraph
"Fuller, began to believe in the promise of industrialization and prefabrication for low-cost",Paragraph
and improved structures. The 1960s espoused various collective social agendas by,Paragraph
"architects as well as politicians; similarly, architects and urban designers were reassessing",Paragraph
the urban and architectural ideas of the modernists. Expo ‘67’s Habitat project proved to,Paragraph
"be too expensive, and many difficulties arose in its construction. Greatly reduced in size,",Paragraph
"Habitat proved to evoke Safdie’s revisionist attitude, one that rejected the Le Corbusian",Paragraph
and Miesian vertical models of Unite d’Habitation and the Lake Shore Drive Apartments,Paragraph
in Chicago.,Paragraph
During the 1970s Safdie concentrated his efforts on massive urban design schemes that,Paragraph
"emphasized context. One of these schemes was a plan (1971) for a new town, Coldspring,",Paragraph
"close to Baltimore, Maryland. During this time, he also produced a number of urban",Paragraph
projects in Israel including the Yeshivat Porat Joseph Rabbinical College (1971-79) in,Paragraph
Jerusalem and the Desert Research Institute (and Ben Gurion Archives) (1974) in the,Paragraph
"Negev. The Rabbinical College, located in the center of the Jewish Quarter of the old",Paragraph
"city, combines a traditionally shaped structure with traditionally shaped domes of the",Paragraph
"region, using modern construction and materials. In this work, Safdie explored the use of",Paragraph
natural lighting and its symbolic quality. This symbolic use of lighting played a key role,Paragraph
"in his later works. Corresponding to its site and its context within the city, the Rabbinical",Paragraph
College marries tradition with modernist invention. Safdie’s work in Jerusalem,Paragraph
"particularly corresponds with the indigenous architecture of the city, blending with its",Paragraph
traditional geometric shapes and colors as well as with the site.,Paragraph
"In 1982, Safdie was commissioned by the Canadian government to design the new",Paragraph
"National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa. The building was completed in 1988, when he was",Paragraph
"then asked along with the firm Belzile, Brassard, Gallienne, Lavoie, with Sungur Incesulu",Paragraph

mainly with stylization and detachment from site. Safdie’s technological ideas (manifest,Paragraph
in Habitat) are also viewed as a starting point for other projects concerned with high-,Paragraph
volume housing construction. He remains committed to a practice of contextualized,Paragraph

"SALK INSTITUTE, LA JOLLA,",Caption
CALIFORNIA,Title
Designed by Louis Kahn; completed 1966,Caption
"In 1959 the City Council in San Diego, upon learning of the Salk Institute’s intention",Paragraph
"to build a research institute, offered a number of sites for the development including a",Paragraph
unique piece of coastal land in La Jolla. The remoteness of the site and its relationship to,Paragraph
"the vast Pacific Ocean are often commented on in relation to the building’s function, as a",Paragraph
place of cutting-edge research with philosophical implications. In February 1960 Salk,Paragraph
"had a site meeting with Kahn, who soon began work on a master plan. The complex was",Paragraph
"to include the laboratories, as well as two unbuilt components—a meeting hall and",Paragraph
residences to the extreme west of the site. Apparently due to over expenditure on the,Paragraph
"laboratories, design work on the unbuilt components was suspended in 1963. Meanwhile,",Paragraph
"the property was deeded to Salk in April 1960, and construction of the laboratories",Paragraph
proceeded from June 1962 until 1965.,Paragraph
Stage one of the Salk Institute comprises two parallel laboratory buildings that,Paragraph
delineate the long sides of a rectangular courtyard space. Each laboratory block contains,Paragraph
"a column-free space that is 60 feet wide by 240 feet in length. Significantly, Kahn’s",Paragraph
design allowed each of the laboratory spaces to be coupled with a service floor. This,Paragraph
allows each block to consist of two laboratory and associated service levels above ground,Paragraph
and another such coupling of levels below ground—light reaches the lower laboratories,Paragraph
via sunken courtyards on either side. Although the structure of the Richards Building fails,Paragraph
"to provide a satisfactory “servant” space for pipes and ducts at ceiling level, the Salk",Paragraph
"laboratories are each “served”—to use Kahn’s words—by ninefoot-deep service floors,",Paragraph
or “pipe laboratories.” At the time these spaces seemed to provide excessive room for,Paragraph
"pipes and ducts, but since that time much of the space has been filled. These service",Paragraph
"floors occupy the spaces between a series of Vierendeel trusses, which Kahn developed",Paragraph
"with August Komendant, his engineer and collaborator on this and many other projects.",Paragraph
"In what would become a signature motif of his later work, Kahn rejected his",Paragraph
"contemporaries’ rough handling of concrete, choosing instead to detail the off-form",Paragraph
concrete for these laboratory blocks with great care and finesse. Like Le Corbusier’s,Paragraph
"rough concrete (béton-brut), which was made famous in his Unite d’ Habitation (1952) in",Paragraph
"Marseilles and his Capitol Complex (1952-60) in Chandigarh, concrete at the Salk",Caption
"Institute is presented as unmaniupulated. However, whereas Le Corbusier made a virtue",Paragraph
of the often-unintentionally rough finish he achieved in his buildings in Marseilles and,Paragraph
"Chandigarh, Kahn’s concrete at the Salk only displays the marks of carefully planned",Paragraph
formwork and ties.,Paragraph
In the intermediate zone between the laboratory buildings and the central plaza are a,Paragraph
series of small towers that comprise individual studies for the scientists. Each study,Paragraph
features a 45-degree angled wall section providing oblique views of the Pacific Ocean to,Paragraph
"the west. The studies have weathered teak wall panels, providing the only moment of",Paragraph
relief and counterpoint to the off-form concrete used elsewhere. Befitting their domestic,Paragraph
"scale, the study windows feature finely crafted glazing, insect screen, and sliding louver",Paragraph
"components, reminiscent of those found in Kahn’s houses.",Paragraph
The Salk Institute’s most memorable feature—its ascetic treeless plaza of travertine,Paragraph
"and concrete—was intended to feature two parallel rows of Italian cypress trees, until the",Paragraph
laboratories were almost complete and Kahn began to have misgivings. Credit for the,Paragraph
"potent image that is so familiar today belongs to the Mexican architect Luis Barragan,",Paragraph
who recommended to Kahn that the open space be left completely bare. Kahn conceived,Paragraph
"the resulting plaza as a “facade to the sky,” with a central canal that marks the",Paragraph
"development’s axis of symmetry. From the rear of the plaza, also known as the Theodore",Paragraph
"Gildred Court, the canal appears to extend to the ocean horizon; in fact, it spills into a",Paragraph
series of pools below and to the west of the plaza.,Paragraph
"According to Kahn, particular buildings of the same type share an archetypal",Paragraph
"counterpart, or form, which is seen in the mind’s-eye as a vague idea that can only be",Paragraph
represented by an esquisse-like diagram. The Salk Institute is important in this context,Paragraph
"because it provided Kahn with an ideal arrangement, or archetypal form, for a laboratory",Paragraph
"building and a model for subsequent laboratory proposals, such as the University of",Paragraph
Virginia Chemistry Building (unbuilt). In its form it would also be an intimation toward,Paragraph
"what Kahn termed “the unmeasurable,” a transcendent realm of inspiration with mystical",Paragraph
and divine connotations.,Paragraph

"Architect, Columbia",Title
The designs of Rogelio Salmona comprise over 70 projects built during the past 40,Paragraph
years and range from domestic to large housing complexes as well as institutional,Paragraph
architecture. He is undoubtedly one of the most prolific and significant architects of Latin,Paragraph
"America,",Title
Wanting to study fine arts but advised by his father to take a similar but more,Paragraph
"pragmatic route, Salmona entered the National University to study architecture in 1948.",Paragraph
"His first year of studies coincided with Le Corbusier’s visit to Bogota, where he had been",Paragraph
"invited to develop an urban master plan. In 1948, Salmona’s father decided to send his",Paragraph
children to France in light of the increasing political unrest in Colombia. Salmona began,Paragraph
"working for the architect at the atelier de la rue de Sévres 35, where he would stay for the",Paragraph
"next ten years. Under Le Corbusier, he would further develop his passion for drawing,",Paragraph
thereby coming in direct contact with the pragmatic aspects of architecture though his,Paragraph
work in projects such as the Jaoul and the Rob et Roq houses and in the projects for,Paragraph
"Chandigarh. At this same time, however, he began attending the lectures given by the art",Paragraph
historian Pierre Francastel at La Sorbonne and developing a strong friendship with him.,Paragraph
Francastel’s social concerns and humanistic views deeply influenced Salmona’s attitudes,Paragraph
toward architecture and led him in particular to develop a sense for an architecture in tune,Paragraph
with the Latin American reality and in opposition to both the precepts imparted by Le,Paragraph
Corbusier and those emerging from the International Style.,Paragraph
"From the onset, Salmona’s preoccupations with craftsmanship infused his work with",Paragraph
the tectonic aspects of architecture and a concern for its experiential qualities. His,Paragraph
"understanding of history, his intimate relation with the Colombian landscape, and his",Paragraph
affinity for the use of brick (Bogota’s local material par excellence) and concrete (with,Paragraph
which he had worked extensively while at Le Corbusier’s atelier) became his trademarks.,Paragraph
Three significant projects serve as a watershed in the career of the architect: the Torres,Paragraph
"del Parque residential complex (1967) in Bogota, the President’s House for Illustrious",Paragraph
"Guests (1981) in Cartagena, and the National Archives of Colombia (1992) in Bogota.",Paragraph
Las Torres del Parque is without doubt one of the most significant housing projects of its,Paragraph
"kind, built in the Americas at the precise moment at which the International Style",Paragraph
precepts were being questioned. The project consists of three brick towers built on a steep,Paragraph
plot at the northern edge of the Parque de la Independencia (Independence Park) at the,Paragraph
beginning of the Monserrate foothills. Las Torres del Parque was designed to house some,Paragraph
"1,500 dwellers in 300 units.",Paragraph
An architecture aligned neither to the vanishing ideals of the International Style nor to,Paragraph
"the emerging and multifaceted postmodern trends of the 1960s that replaced them, Las",Paragraph
"Torres is uncompromisingly fresh and vigorous, and it expresses a profound sympathy",Paragraph
"for a sense of urbanity, evocative of memorable places. In this project, Salmona also",Paragraph
introduced a major choreography of urban places in which plant materials play a major,Paragraph
"role, giving a precise character to the outdoor zones of the project and integrating it with",Paragraph
the adjacent park.,Paragraph
Salmona’s President’s House for Illustrious Guests in Cartagena is a careful,Paragraph
intervention in the topography. While respecting and enhancing the silhouette of,Paragraph
"neighboring El Manzanillo fort, it creates a new landscape on what previously was a",Paragraph
"barren site occupied by ruins. To accomplish this, Salmona used simple pragmatic",Paragraph
principles derived from the Spanish-Moorish tradition as well as from pre-Hispanic,Paragraph
sources.,Paragraph
The President’s House is a compound formed of seven courtyards. Quarters for the,Paragraph
"president, his guests, and accompanying personnel have been carefully arranged around",Paragraph
"these courtyards. Additional facilities include a living room, a dining room, meeting",Paragraph
"rooms, a library, and service areas. Throughout the house, the materials used in its",Paragraph
"construction are consistent: brick, tile, coral stone, concrete, and hardwood. Rooms vary",Paragraph
"in proportion according to their function, yet they maintain a continuous unity.",Paragraph
"Differentiation is evident everywhere, carried out with extreme subtlety. The President’s",Paragraph
House speaks clearly of solemnity and becomes a lesson in the restrained use of materials,Paragraph
and forms.,Paragraph
"In the General Archives of Colombia, site, history, and distance become integral",Paragraph
"elements of Salmona’s form-making process. It is not accidental that Salmona, although",Paragraph
"alluding to the traditions of Colonial architecture in Colombia, reintroduces two",Paragraph
important concepts evident in pre-Columbian buildings and poetry: the roof ambulation,Paragraph
and the skewed access to precincts along diagonal lines. It is possible to experience both,Paragraph

Sant’ Elia attended a technical school in Como and graduated as master builder in 1906.,Paragraph
"He moved to Milan in 1905, where he worked as a draftsman for a canal company, then",Paragraph
"for the municipal engineering department. In 1909, his study for a villa appeared in the",Paragraph
"Milanese review La Casa, and he enrolled at the Brera Academy. Between 1911 and",Paragraph
"1914, Sant’Elia participated in numerous competitions and exhibitions that would prepare",Paragraph
him for the most significant project of his oeuvre: La Citta Nuova (The New City). In,Paragraph
"1914, he exhibited 60 drawings in the show of the group Nuova Tendenze, which he co-",Paragraph
"founded. Its catalogue contained his Messaggio, a text later transformed into the",Paragraph
"Manifesto, with six views of La Citta Nuova. These, with the sketches, represent the peak",Paragraph
of his graphic work. He probably met the Futurist Fillipo Tomaso Marinetti at this time.,Paragraph
"When Italy entered the war in 1915, Sant’ Elia was among the first to volunteer, joining",Paragraph
"the same regiment as Umberto Boccioni, Marinetti, and Mario Sironi, among other",Paragraph
"Futurists. He enjoyed a brief period of leave, but his relations with the Futurists were then",Paragraph
"interrupted. Conscripted and sent to the front again, as second lieutenant in the infantry",Paragraph
"during the ensuing attacks against enemy trenches between June and July 1916, he was",Paragraph
"wounded and decorated. At this time, Sant’Elia was commissioned to design a cemetery",Paragraph
for the Arezzo Brigade at Monfalcone. It was still under construction when he fell during,Paragraph
"an assault, shot in the forehead by a machine gun bullet.",Paragraph
"Before Futurism, there had been pragmatic solutions to the problems of urbanism",Paragraph

renewal of architectural language. The symbolic and typological themes of the,Paragraph
"metropolis, skyscrapers, factories, residential and commercial complexes, power- and",Paragraph

"Sant’Elia in his Messaggio and drawings of La Citta Nuova. Here he proposed, even if in",Paragraph
"utopian terms, the profound modifications that were needed to connect architecture to",Paragraph
urban structure. The power and originality of his vision derives from an ability to,Paragraph
"interrelate, in all their complexity, the forms and volumes of his chosen elements. He",Paragraph
shows an interconnected system of circulation and communication that is different from,Paragraph
the American model of isolated skyscrapers. Though it would seem partly to derive from,Paragraph
"illustrations of futuristic American visions, he presents an architectural understanding of",Paragraph
"simultaneity derived not only from crisscrossing circulation but, above all, from a close",Paragraph
relation between urban form and building type. The layered traffic suggests a new and,Paragraph
mutual dynamism between building and circulation that may be understood by reference,Paragraph
"to the concepts that Umberto Boccioni had pioneered: fusion, all-embracing atmosphere,",Paragraph
"and a concept of space as a field. The radical innovation of his imagery, his conception of",Paragraph

SARASOTA SCHOOL,Title
The Sarasota School was the name given to a group of architects practicing from 1940 to,Paragraph
"1960 in and around Sarasota, Florida, on the Gulf of Mexico. The Sarasota School was",Paragraph
one of several regional interpretations of modern architecture in the United States to,Paragraph
"emerge in the years following the end of World War LI, including the Bay Area School in",Paragraph
San Francisco and the Case Study Houses group in Los Angeles. By comparison to these,Paragraph
"other regional movements, the Sarasota School was the least intentional, evolving as it",Paragraph
did from Ralph Twitchell’s fortuitous presence during one of Florida’s building booms.,Paragraph
"From the very start of his Sarasota career in 1936, Twitchell’s work exhibited a respect",Paragraph
"for the unique landscape and climate of the west coast of Florida, his interest in local",Paragraph
"vernacular building culture, and his desire to employ newly emerging construction",Paragraph
materials and methods to appropriately house the particularly American version of a,Paragraph
tropical lifestyle then being defined in Sarasota.,Paragraph
"In 1941, Twitchell was joined by Paul Rudolph, who moved to Florida as a result of",Paragraph
"his interest in Frank Lloyd Wright’s recent works, in particular Florida Southern College.",Paragraph
"Rudolph was a designer of remarkable ability, and the buildings and projects that resulted",Paragraph
"from this partnership were astonishing in their consistent high quality. In their designs,",Paragraph
Rudolph and Twitchell endeavored to engage the landscape and to develop individual,Paragraph
buildings that employed modernist concepts of spatial liberation framed by a,Paragraph
"complementary urban order. Their project for the Finney residence on Siesta Key (1947),",Paragraph
a design that Rudolph had made the previous year while a graduate student at Harvard,Paragraph
"University, proposed a series of walls, bridges, and dredged inlets that allowed the house",Paragraph
"to be fully integrated with its site, acting to join remote bodies of land and water while",Paragraph
remaining delicately suspended above the landscape. The Rudolph and Twitchell project,Caption
for six linked residences on the Revere property in Siesta Key (1948) represents a,Paragraph
remarkably prescient and constructive critique of postwar American suburban,Paragraph
"development. These six houses, of which only the Revere residence was built, opposed",Paragraph
"the typical suburban distribution of houses as freestanding objects, proposing instead a",Paragraph
"series of plastically interlocked walls and horizontal planes, providing a mix of shade and",Paragraph
sun to open-air courts while weaving interior and exterior space to yield both increased,Paragraph
privacy and significantly greater density.,Paragraph
"The paradise-like settings of the Sarasota School houses, which today appear so lushly",Paragraph
"“natural,” were in fact the result of a process of ruthless scalping, shaping, and dredging",Paragraph
"of the original mangrove-covered, water-saturated landscape to produce navigable canals",Paragraph
and buildable sites. These newly created and virtually barren lots on the Gulf coast,Paragraph
required the architects of the Sarasota School to design not only the houses but also their,Paragraph
sites. The result was a series of buildings that subtly wove their sharp-edged geometric,Paragraph
"forms into the relentless horizontality of the Florida landscape, employing structural and",Paragraph
"constructional techniques developed for the local climate, economy, and available",Paragraph
materials and providing their occupants varied seasonal experiences of sun-drenched,Paragraph
"interior and exterior spaces. The Healy “Cocoon House” (1950), built on the edge of a",Paragraph
"canal in Siesta Key, with its suspended rubberized roof secured with cable stays,",Paragraph
exemplified the manner in which Twitchell’s interest in engaging new building,Paragraph
technologies complemented Rudolph’s capacity to explore their liberative spatial,Paragraph
possibilities.,Paragraph
"Following the establishment of his individual practice in 1951, Rudolph began to",Paragraph
receive significant national and international attention. His Revere model house was,Paragraph
"visited by more than 16,000 people during 1949. His working relationship with the",Paragraph
"architectural photographers Ezra Stoller and Joseph Steinmetz (Steinmetz Studio,",Paragraph
"Sarasota, 1947) was instrumental in Rudolph’s ability to create his own publicity. Skillful",Paragraph
photographs highlighted the crisp lines and thin planes of the Leavengood residence built,Paragraph
"in St. Petersburg (1951), the Sandeling Beach Club built in Siesta Key (1952), the Walker",Paragraph
"Guest House built on Sanibel Island (1952), and the Hiss “Umbrella House” built on Lido",Paragraph
Shores (1953). When combined with Rudolph’s signature perspective drawings of both,Paragraph
"built and unbuilt projects, these publications conveyed a sense of informality and",Paragraph
naturalness of lifestyle while exhibiting an inevitability and precision in their,Paragraph
architectonic resolution.,Paragraph
"At its height, the Sarasota School included Mark Hampton, Victor Lundy, Tim Siebert,",Paragraph
"Jack West, Gene Leedy, Carl Abbott, Bert Brosmith, Joseph Farrell, William Rupp, and",Title
"Ralph and William Zimmerman, many of whom began their careers working for Rudolph",Paragraph
and Twitchell. Each of these architects developed his own distinct qualities of space and,Paragraph
"form, from Lundy’s sweeping pagoda-like wood roofs (St. Paul’s Lutheran Church,",Paragraph
"Sarasota, 1958) to Leedy’s rhythmic lines of precast concrete beams (First National",Paragraph
"Bank, Cape Canaveral, 1963) to Abbott’s elegantly articulated geometries (Weld",Paragraph
"Residence, Boca Grande, 1966). The variety of designs within such a small community",Paragraph
defied the stereotypical representation of modern architecture as lacking richness and,Paragraph
diversity.,Paragraph
After starting construction on his four final Florida masterworks—Riverview High,Paragraph
"School in Sarasota (1958), Sarasota High School (1959), the Deering residence in Casey",Paragraph
"Key (1959), and the Milam residence in Ponte Vedra (1960)}—Rudolph in 1958 was",Paragraph
"appointed dean of the School of Architecture at Yale University, where among his first",Paragraph
students were Norman Foster and Richard Rogers. With the exit from Sarasota in the,Paragraph
"1960s of Rudolph, Lundy, Hampton, Rupp, Farrell, Brosmith, and Leedy, the Sarasota",Caption
School ended.,Paragraph
"Sarasota High School, Sarasota, Florida, designed by Paul Rudolph (1959)",Caption

Although the American architectural profession has been slow to recognize the quality of,Paragraph
the work of the Sarasota School (having failed to award Rudolph the American Institute,Paragraph
"of Architecture Gold Medal at his death in 1997), it received extensive and immediate",Paragraph
international attention. Typical is the experience of British architects and Team 10,Paragraph
"founders, Alison and Peter Smithson, who, in their search for alternatives to the universal",Paragraph

"With a land area in excess of 2.2 million square kilometers, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia",Paragraph
today covers most of the Arabian peninsula. The recent history of its architectural and,Paragraph
urban development has been closely linked to its emergence as a modern nation and to,Paragraph
the development of a powerful economy based on the exploitation of natural resources.,Paragraph
Saudi Arabia’s opening to the international economy from the 1950s on introduced new,Paragraph
building technologies and styles that have today largely replaced centuries-old traditional,Paragraph
"practices. However, since the 1980s, the maturation of native Saudi institutions and the",Paragraph
"work of Saudi designers, engineers, and planners has led to many successful projects that",Paragraph
bridge modern design practices and technologies and still-valued traditional forms and,Paragraph
ifestyles.,Paragraph
Climate has played a key role in urban form and architectural production in Saudi,Paragraph
Arabia for centuries. The kingdom generally lies within one of the world’s hottest and,Paragraph
"driest regions, with more than 50 percent of its land being desert. Yet within this",Paragraph
"dominant climatic milieu, local characteristics vary considerably. This relationship was",Paragraph
long evident in the traditional approaches to the built environment in Saudi Arabia’s four,Paragraph
principal regions: the Central (Najd) and Northern region; the Western (Hijaz) region; the,Paragraph
Eastern region along the Persian Gulf; and the Southern mountainous region.,Paragraph
"In the extremely hot and arid areas of the Central and Northern region, the courtyard",Paragraph
was long the main feature of any building. Courtyards traditionally acted as climatic,Paragraph
"moderators and allowed a unique private lifestyle to develop. In desert communities, built",Paragraph
"argely of adobe, open spaces generally only took the form of private courtyards and",Paragraph
"natrow, winding streets.",Caption
"In the Western (Hijaz) region, with its hot and humid climate of Red Sea coastal",Paragraph
"communities, the basic traditional building type was the multistory row house built of",Paragraph
coral stone and imported wood. The refined building art of this region was also,Paragraph
influenced by an intermixing of cultures and the import of technological skills as the,Paragraph
result of trade and pilgrimage. One distinct vernacular form that developed here was the,Paragraph
"mashrabiyah, a facade of transparent wooden screens, originally used in the houses of",Paragraph
Jeddah to afford both ventilation and visual privacy. When this form gained popularity as,Paragraph
"a decorative element, it in turn influenced house design in the hot and dry inland cities of",Paragraph
Mecca and Medina and in the upland city of Taif.,Paragraph
"The Eastern Region along the Persian Gulf includes the cities of al-Ahsa, Qatif,",Paragraph
"Dammam, and Jubail and is characterized by a maritime inland desert climate. Here, two-",Paragraph
story courtyard houses built of mud were the typical building type. Such dwellings often,Paragraph
"featured traditional bagdir or malgaf, wind catchers used to control ventilation.",Paragraph
"The Southern region, which includes the Asir Mountains and extends from Taif",Paragraph
"through Baha to Abha, is characterized by a cooler climate with considerable seasonal",Paragraph
"rain. In its settlements, many located at altitudes greater than 2000 meters, buildings",Paragraph
"generally took the form of square, multistory towers. Four principal construction types",Paragraph
"developed based on the local microclimate and available materials: mud tower houses,",Paragraph
"stone rubble houses, stone apron houses, and mud and slate tower buildings. A",Paragraph
"particularly characteristic form of the Asir region was the gasabah, a freestanding tower",Paragraph
of mud or stone used in isolated farming villages both for defense and to warn of the,Paragraph
approach of raiders from other tribes.,Paragraph
"Until the second half of the 20th century, these regional urban and architectural",Paragraph
traditions responded well to local cultural and material conditions and allowed people to,Paragraph
"adjust their activity cycles to climatic variations. In more recent times, however, modern",Paragraph
forms and patterns have been introduced that have largely replaced these traditional,Paragraph
practices.,Paragraph
Two major building campaigns of the 1950s can today be judged as having initiated,Paragraph
this process: the expansion of the holy mosques of Mecca and Medina and the huge,Paragraph
program involved in transferring the nation’s capital from Mecca to Riyadh. From 1951,Paragraph
"to 1955, the government undertook a major effort to repair and expand the Prophet",Paragraph
"Mosque in Medina, with the result being a fourfold increase in the area for prayer; a",Paragraph
"second huge project from 1955 to 1974 expanded the holy mosque in Mecca, where the",Paragraph
"area available for prayer was increased from 29,127 to 193,000 square meters. The",Paragraph
"building program in Riyadh likewise spanned many years. Its first phase, in the mid-",Paragraph
"1950s, included construction of both a complex of ministry buildings on the airport road",Paragraph
and a housing project for government employees in the Malaz area. Also a part of the,Paragraph
early work were the rebuilding and expansion of the royal palace at Nasirriyah to cover,Paragraph
"250 hectares, the rebuilding of the main mosque and government palace in the city center,",Paragraph
and the widening of the two main streets leading into the city.,Paragraph
Coupled with the Aramco grid plans for al-Khobar and Dammam in 1947 and the,Paragraph
"Aramco Employees Home Ownership program launched in 1951, these government",Paragraph
building campaigns laid a foundation for the development of contemporary building and,Paragraph
"planning practices in Saudi Arabia. However, the introduction of new processes,",Paragraph
"materials, and techniques was first carried out largely through the import of foreign",Paragraph
"expertise to the kingdom. From the early 1960s on, the gridded street pattern and the villa",Paragraph
as a preferred house type assumed primacy in the development of most every city and,Paragraph
town. Processes of urban change and expansion were given further impetus by the,Paragraph
"compensation given private property owners in Mecca, Medina, and Riyadh following",Paragraph
the expropriation of their traditional city center houses to make way for government,Paragraph
"projects. Apartment buildings also first began to appear in Riyadh, Mecca, Medina, and",Paragraph
"Jeddah from the late 1950s on. In the mid-1950s, the government launched a national",Paragraph
"school-building program, which brought international-style design in reinforced concrete",Paragraph
and cement block to the smallest towns and villages.,Paragraph
A further change in Saudi cities and towns in the 1960s was the introduction of high-,Paragraph
rise construction. Distinct among the earliest such projects were the Saudi Arabian,Paragraph
"Airlines and the Saudi Radio Broadcasting buildings in Jeddah. However, the twenty-",Paragraph
two-story Queen building (1972) in Jeddah represented the most radical break with,Paragraph
"tradition, and for many years it stood as a principal landmark on the city’s skyline. Other",Paragraph
"notable projects in the early 1970s included the UPM Campus in Dhahran by CRS,",Paragraph

"Following the oil boom of 1973, the new wealth had profound, wide-reaching",Paragraph
consequences for Saudi cities and towns. This was particularly evident in campaigns of,Paragraph
"infrastructure development and in the design and construction of new universities,",Paragraph
"schools, hospitals, hotels, airports and seaports, factories, housing estates, and entire new",Paragraph
towns. The oil boom also led to the establishment of the national Real Estate,Paragraph

replenished through this program since its initatiation. Coupled with government land,Paragraph
"grants, available to every Saudi citizen 18 years of age or older, it has led to a several-",Paragraph
fold expansion of most Saudi cities and towns.,Paragraph
Although most early modern architecture and planning in the kingdom was carried out,Paragraph
"by foreign-trained experts, from the 1980s onward, local architects, engineers, and",Paragraph
"planners began to assume an increasingly important role. For instance, Ali Shuaibi and",Paragraph
Abdurrahman Al-Hussaini of Beeah Group Consultants have given special emphasis to,Paragraph
"sociocultural values, in particular to the desire to relate modern construction methods to",Paragraph
the Islamic past. Their distinct planning work has included the al-Ugqair Tourist,Paragraph
"Development Plan (1986), the Jubail Subregional Plan (1998), and the Strategic",Paragraph
"Comprehensive Plan (1998) for the Holy Environs and Mecca, which addressed the need",Paragraph
to accommodate and transfer two million pilgrims between Mecca and the Holy Environs,Paragraph
during the five-day pilgrimage. Beeah Group Consultants has also been known for such,Paragraph
"urban design work as its Central Spine, DQ(1980); the Qasr al-Hukm project (1983); and",Paragraph
"the King Abdulaziz Historical Center (1998), all in Riyadh. The continued value of",Paragraph
seclusion and privacy in Saudi culture was evident in the design of al-Kindi Plaza (1986),Paragraph
"in Riyadh, which won the Agha Khan Award for Architecture. Other important designs",Paragraph
"are the Saudi Embassy (1987) in Yemen, the King Saud Mosque (1992) in Riyadh, the",Paragraph
"SAPICO Headquarters (1992) in Islamabad, and the Municipality of Medina Complex",Paragraph
"(2000), all of which combine past and present, a necessity in the perpetuation of culture.",Paragraph
Equally impressive projects have been designed by the team known as Basim al-,Paragraph
Shihabi of Omrania. Their projects include the General Organization for Social Insurance,Paragraph
"(GOSI) Headquarters (1978); the Twaiq Palace (1985), an Agha Khan Award winner; the",Paragraph
Gulf Cooperation Council building (1987); and the King Abdulaziz Archival building (al-,Paragraph
"Darah) (1998), all in Riyadh. The current direction of ideas that al-Shihabi originally",Paragraph
synthesized in the 1970s are evident in the NNCI Headquarters building (1999) and the,Paragraph
"Kingdom Complex, which includes a 330-meter-high tower to be completed in 2001.",Paragraph
"A third noteworthy Saudi architecture firm, Mohammad Al-Naim and Farahat",Paragraph
"Tashkandi of Al-Nai, has emphasized the importance of continuity in cultural traditions",Paragraph
in a changing world. This theme can be seen in their neighborhood layouts and land,Paragraph
subdivision projects for MOMRA (1993) and in layouts for the Namar and Uraid,Paragraph
neighborhoods (1994) in Riyadh. The team’s design for municipal prototype houses,Paragraph
"attempted to revitalize the traditional Arab house, not through formalistic adaptation but",Paragraph
by reconstituting essential values in new forms. Other work has included the School of,Paragraph
"Environmental Design building, KAU (1987), in Jeddah and the College of Architecture",Caption
"and Planning, KFU (2000), in Dammam. Mohammad Al-Naim and Farahat Tashkandi’s",Paragraph
work on the Al Abbas Mosque (1995) in Riyadh won them an award for transforming,Paragraph
traditional aesthetic values to a more modern look.,Paragraph
Ziad Zaidan of Idea Center is another firm whose distinction lay in the team’s Master,Paragraph
Plan and Urban Design schemes for,Title

© Saleh Al-Hathloul,Title
"Yanbu Industrial City, a contemporary settlement for 150,000 people aimed at combining",Paragraph
state-of-the-art technology with the principles of Islamic town planning. Ziad Zaidan is,Paragraph
"also known for its Umm al-Qura University campus (1995) in Mecca, in association with",Paragraph
"Perkins and Will, a carefully considered campus plan creating a harmonious synthesis of",Paragraph
old and new. Other projects have included the Asir Governorate Complex (1995) in,Paragraph
"Abha, adapting elements of Asir architectural tradition with modern materials and",Paragraph
"technology, and Aramco’s Western Region Headquarters (1989) in Jeddah, for which the",Paragraph
team won the American Institute of Architects’ Award for Excellence in Architecture.,Paragraph
Zaidan also served as architectural consultant for the Institute du Monde Arabe (1987) in,Paragraph
"Paris, designed by Jean Nouvel and the Architecture Studio.",Paragraph
Abdulla Bokhari of Archi-Plan is a strong believer in the influence and importance of,Paragraph
theories in design. Bokhari sees tradition as having no authority except as a platform for,Paragraph
further transformation or as an ongoing experiment. This approach is best seen in his,Paragraph
designs for the SANCST Cultural and Leisure Facilities Center (1989) and the UNDP,Caption
"Headquarters (2000), both in Riyadh.",Paragraph
"Several regional architects have also produced important work in Saudi Arabia,",Paragraph
"including the contributions of Sami Anqawi, director of the Pilgrimage Research Center",Paragraph
for many years and a practicing architect in Amar. His strong commitment to tradition is,Paragraph
best reflected in the renovation of the Amar Office Building in Old Jeddah and in his,Paragraph
design of the al-Yamani residence (1980s) in Mecca. Saleh Qadah’s work in Asir is also,Paragraph
worth noting for his ability to use traditional architectural features as part of modern,Paragraph
designs. This was well demonstrated in Almiftah Village (1989) and in the Chamber of,Paragraph
"Commerce Building (1989), both in Abha.",Paragraph
"In addition to these individual designers and design teams, the government-backed",Paragraph
Arriyadh Development Authority (ADA) has also been a major contributor to the shaping,Paragraph
of urban patterns and architecture styles in the kingdom. Among the most notable,Paragraph
projects carried out by the ADA in the Riyadh area have been the development of the,Paragraph
"Diplomatic Quarter, a new town within the city; the MFA Staff Housing (1983); the",Paragraph
development of the Justice Palace District (1985-2000); and the development of the King,Paragraph
Abdulaziz Historic Center (1998). The award-winning quality of the ADA’s projects is,Paragraph
often demonstrated through magnificent architecture that marries traditional and modern,Paragraph
forms.,Paragraph
"In the political arena, Mohammad Said Farsi, the well-known mayor of Jeddah from",Paragraph
"the early 1970s to the mid-1980s, was also influential in the development of new trends",Paragraph
"in architecture and planning in the kingdom. An architect and planner, his efforts to",Paragraph
preserve the old city and develop Jeddah’s architectural tastes had wide-ranging effects,Paragraph
on the architectural profession in Saudi Arabia.,Paragraph
"In terms of architectural education, Ahmad Farid Moustafa was also extremely",Paragraph
influential on the course of architecture and planning in the kingdom. Moustafa served as,Paragraph
the first head of the Department of Architecture at King Saud University in the late,Paragraph
1960s. Later he was a founder and dean for the School of Architecture and Planning at,Paragraph
"King Faisal University. In these positions, he had a tremendous effect on the first",Paragraph
generation of architectural students in Saudi Arabia. Adel Ismail and Mohammad Said,Paragraph
Mousalli were others who played major roles in the development of architecture,Paragraph
"education, both through their teaching at King Saud University and through their",Paragraph
involvement as advisers for government agencies.,Paragraph
Formal architecture education began in Saudi Arabia with the establishment of the,Paragraph
Department of Architecture at King Saud University of Riyadh in 1967. Other schools,Paragraph
"followed: the College of Architecture and Planning at King Faisal University, Dammam",Paragraph
"(1975); the School of Environmental Design, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah (1976);",Paragraph
"the College of Environmental Design, University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dammam",Caption
"(1979); and the Department of Islamic Architecture, Umm al-Qura University, Mecca",Caption
(1983). Some of the first graduates of these universities in turn began teaching careers of,Paragraph
"their own in the 1980s. These have included Saleh Al-Hathloul, Mohammad Al-Hussayn,",Paragraph
"Mohammad bin Saleh, Tarik Al-Sulaiman, and Jameel Akbar. Such educators have had a",Paragraph
"broad effect on the field through teaching, writing, and involvement as jurors, reviewers,",Paragraph
and evaluators of major projects.,Paragraph
The role of national professional organizations has also increased in importance. In,Paragraph
"1982, the Engineering Committee was formed through the Chamber of Commerce to",Paragraph
oversee and organize design and consulting practice. The Saudi Association for,Paragraph
"Architects and Planners (AL-UMRAN) was formed in 1989, and its membership now",Paragraph
"exceeds 1000. Albenna magazine, covering architectural and development issues,",Caption
produced its first issue in February-March 1979.,Paragraph
"In addition to these local influences, the work of international architects in Saudi",Paragraph
"Arabia has continued, and in recent years this has also become more responsive to local",Paragraph
conditions. Among the many excellent examples of work by international design teams in,Paragraph
Saudi Arabia have been the Haj Terminal (1982) at King Abdulaziz Airport in Jeddah by,Paragraph
"Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, a 20th-century adaptation of traditional tent structures;",Paragraph
"the National Commercial Bank (1984) in Jeddah, also by Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill,",Paragraph

"Architect, Germany",Title
"Although born in Bremen, Germany, on 20 September 1893, Hans Scharoun grew up",Paragraph
"in the town of Bremerhaven, Germany’s major port just west of the industrial city of",Paragraph
Hamburg. Exhibiting a fascination with machines and architecture in his earliest sketches,Paragraph
"and drawings, Scharoun took careful notice of the rapid changes he saw in the world",Paragraph
"around him, changes even more exaggerated in the activities of the port. Bremerhaven,",Paragraph
"Germany’s gateway to the world, felt the impact of cultures beyond Germany’s borders",Paragraph
and was thus more cosmopolitan than much of the country. It was also a place in which,Paragraph
"new forms of technology and transport drove the city’s development; in this context, new",Paragraph
"theories involving space and time were not abstract but quite real, leaving an imprint on",Paragraph
"the port’s infrastructure and, consequently, the city’s architecture. As remarked by Peter",Paragraph
"Blundell-Jones, a noted scholar of Scharoun’s work, Scharoun appeared to have received",Paragraph
"the imprint of these ideas as well, for his architecture and planning ideas were anything",Paragraph
"but sentimental. From his earliest attempts at architecture and urban planning, Scharoun",Paragraph
engaged the dynamics of economic exchange and technological development directly.,Paragraph
"Yet Scharoun’s concept for architecture, or Baukunst (at the time German architects",Paragraph
"pointedly used, after Schinkel, the term Bawkunst, or “building art,” rather than",Paragraph
"“architecture” to describe their work), was not simply utilitarian but sought an expression",Paragraph
"of the Modern era. Scharoun’s vision, one he shared with several other members of his",Paragraph
"generation, espoused a kind of functionalism—although not the functionalism promoted",Paragraph
"by several of his contemporaries, including the Sachlichkeit architects Hannes Meyer and",Paragraph
"Ludwig Hilberseimer. Rather, Scharoun emphasized the spiritual foundation of organic",Paragraph
"form, where the formation of the interior generated the exterior form.",Paragraph
Scharoun was accepted as a student of architecture at the Technische Hochschule in,Paragraph
"Berlin-Charlottenburg in 1912 and became well versed in engineering technologies, the",Paragraph
primary emphasis of the architectural course at the time. He also worked as an assistant in,Paragraph
"the Berlin office of Paul Kruchen, an assistant at the Technische Hochschule and",Paragraph
"Scharoun’s first real mentor. While on holiday from his studies, the young architect",Paragraph
worked as a bricklayer’s apprentice. The curriculum of the Technische Hochschule did,Paragraph
"not engage his imagination; unlike contemporary architectural education, there was little",Paragraph
"focus on design in most German architectural programs at the time. Nonetheless,",Paragraph
"Scharoun took part in numerous competitions, seeing them as opportunities in which he",Paragraph
"could develop and exercise his architectural ideas. When World War | broke out,",Paragraph
"Scharoun voluntarily entered military service, where he was eventually assigned to assist",Paragraph
"Kruchen, who had by then become a military architect. His early reputation as an",Paragraph
architect was in fact based on these competitions; in comparison with other competition,Paragraph
"entrants, Scharoun’s work was exceptionally progressive. The most significant of these",Paragraph
"was his competition entry for the planning of the cathedral area in Prenzlau, a project that",Paragraph
led to an association with the noted Expressionist architect Bruno Taut and the,Paragraph
"architectural critic Adolf Behne, both of whom resided in Berlin. Both Taut and Behne",Paragraph
"were active in the utopian group Arbeitsrat fiir Kunst (Work Council for Art), an",Paragraph
"association of architects, writers, and artists founded immediately after the November",Paragraph
"1918 revolution. The group, reflecting the burgeoning socialist sentiments of many",Paragraph
"cultural figures during the Weimar Republic, sought to recover an art that was “for the",Paragraph
"people” and vice versa, a people energized by their creative actions. In so doing, many of",Paragraph
"them not only dispensed with the past but, in utopist fashion, overlooked the difficulties",Paragraph
of the present in favor of the possibility of future redemption. Seeing change and,Paragraph
"development as modern architecture’s foundational premise, Scharoun quickly became an",Paragraph
"associate and advocate of the group, participating in Taut’s “chain letters,” a secretive,",Paragraph
semianonymous correspondence known as the Gidserne Kette (Glass Chain). Scharoun’s,Paragraph
"language and visionary sketches from the period, bursting with intense light, color, and",Paragraph
"contrasts and using Expressionist symbols, are infused with utopian visions shared by",Paragraph
"members of the group such as Wassily Luckhardt, Herman Finsterlin, and Walter",Paragraph
"Gropius. Typical Expressionist architectural programs, such as Volkshaus (House of the",Paragraph
"People) and Stadtkrone (Crown of the City or City’s Crown), with titles such as",Paragraph
"“Monument to Joy” and “Crystal on the Sphere” (Luckhardt) and Kudtbau, or “Cult-",Paragraph
"Building” (Scharoun), exposed the underlying influences of German nature mysticism",Paragraph
"and 19th-century German Romanticism. Although interested in fantasy and longing,",Paragraph
Scharoun’s legacy from the period centered around subtle aspects of architecture:,Paragraph
"daylighting (Lichtfiihrung, literally “the control of daylight”) and organic form.",Paragraph
Expressionism’s resort to quasi-mystical (spiritual) issues and forms of nature was,Paragraph
effectively subsumed into the development of functionalism in the 1920s. Ornament—the,Paragraph
rendering of ideas in architecture through surface application and detail—gave way to the,Paragraph
"embrace of space and time, a shift dependent on changes in the ideas and methods of the",Paragraph
"physical and natural sciences. Accordingly, space—immaterial and implied—became the",Paragraph
"residence of Spirit (Geist), whereas form, perceived as plastic and mutable, was infused",Paragraph
"with references to organisms, growth, and change.",Paragraph
Scharoun’s architectural work from this period mirrored his incorporation of these,Paragraph
"influences, and his associations with certain architects and artists (several of whom",Paragraph
exhibited an interest in the a “constructed organicist” version of the post-Dada group,Paragraph
"Neue Sachlichkeit, or New Objectivity) grew. Among his closest associates were artists",Paragraph
"Kurt Schwitters, Hans Richter, and Theo van Doesburg, all of whom worked to sublimate",Paragraph
the mechanics and demands of persistent change and spirit in their art. Scharoun’s,Paragraph
"particular interest in painting and collage—at this time highly gestural and expressive,",Paragraph
with a hint of attention to vernacular traditions—supported the architect’s functionalist,Paragraph
"ethic. At the time, functionalism was both a method and a philosophy (or shared faith)",Paragraph
"whereby the spirit moves from within to without; accordingly, “form” is the result of",Paragraph
spiritual expansion and expression moving out into the world. Scharoun’s incorporation,Paragraph
"of fluid, complex forms and rhythms, coupled with his embrace of architecture’s new",Paragraph
"technologies and materials, aided and abetted his general resistance to academic form.",Paragraph
"Rather than static works resting on the landscape hidden behind an ordered facade,",Paragraph
"Scharoun’s architectural designs—his spaces and forms—remained fluid and organic,",Paragraph
engaging the landscape directly in providing a place for the infusion of plant life within,Paragraph
while extending space into the landscape itself.,Paragraph
"Ironically, Hans Scharoun’s reputation and significance as an architect increased just",Paragraph
as political and social tensions led to the demise of the Weimar Republic and the rise of,Paragraph
"Fascism in Germany. In the mid-1920s, the “housing question” became a central focus",Paragraph
for the development of modern architecture. Although a professor at the Kunstakademie,Paragraph
"in Breslau, Scharoun yearned for Berlin’s cosmopolitan cultural arena, finally relocating",Paragraph
"to the city in 1927-28. It was a fortuitous move professionally, and he began to obtain",Paragraph
various commissions (his association with Berlin developer Georg Jacobowitz was,Paragraph
particularly fruitful). Scharoun also had the good fortune of participating with several of,Paragraph
"his former Arbeitsrat colleagues, collaborating on several planning and housing",Paragraph
"developments, including both the Modern Siemensstadt living/housing project (1928-31)",Paragraph
"and a single-family dwelling for the Weissenhofsiedlung Stuttgart, a housing exhibition",Paragraph
"organized by the Deutscher Werkbund, in 1927. Both projects, manifestos of “social",Paragraph
"housing,” were “intended as...models for [a] new way of life.” However, the die had",Paragraph
"been cast portending the rise of Fascism by the late 1920s, and options for further",Paragraph
exploration of Modern cultural and social ideas diminished substantially.,Paragraph
Although he did not immigrate during the period—an option taken by many of his,Paragraph
closest friends and associates—Scharoun suffered an internal exile throughout the late,Paragraph
"1930s and 1940s. The last building of his “Weimar years,” a house for industrialist Fritz",Paragraph
"Schminke on the border of Czechoslovakia built in 1933, showcases Scharoun’s maturing",Paragraph
"architectural vision; light, material, structure, form, space, function, furniture, and",Paragraph
"landscape are fused into a seamless, organic whole. As German Fascism increased its",Paragraph
"hold, Scharoun’s work went underground; exterior projections of his architectural",Paragraph
ideas—formal and material play and movement—became hidden behind the mask of,Paragraph
"Nazism’s mandated, antimodern “German vernacular.” Nonetheless, Scharoun, in his",Paragraph
"design of small, residential projects, clearly maintains his developmental trajectory,",Paragraph
exploring with even greater intensity the dynamics of interior space and light and exterior,Paragraph
form. These projects—the Mohrmann House (1938) in Berlin-Lichtenrade and the Endell,Paragraph
House (1939) in Berlin-Wannsee are primary examples—map the increasing,Paragraph
internalization of his architectural work and effectively mirror Scharoun’s internal exile.,Paragraph
"Again ironically, it was during this same period that Scharoun’s most significant",Paragraph
"intellectual relationship developed: Hugo Haring, 11 years Scharoun’s senior, became",Paragraph
"Scharoun’s principal mentor, a relationship that would continue until Haring’s death.",Paragraph
"During the 1920s, Haring was known primarily for his architectural ideas and was,",Paragraph
"according to Blundell-Jones, considered more of a contemplative (theoretical) architect",Paragraph
"than a builder. During the years of fascist rule and World War II, Haring and Scharoun",Paragraph
"developed a close relationship—like Scharoun, he was also an internal exile—with the",Paragraph
"elder man fulfilling the role of mentor, Scharoun’s “intellectual authority.” Haring’s",Paragraph
"architectural theories were quickly absorbed by Scharoun, who adopted them as",Paragraph
explanations for his own architecture.,Paragraph
"Immediately after the end of World War II, Scharoun was asked to help with the",Paragraph
planning and rebuilding of Berlin and was appointed Berlin city architect until the city,Paragraph
"elections in 1946. Housing was a critical issue, and Scharoun began to work on numerous",Paragraph
"city-planning and apartment projects, including those associated with the Planungs-",Paragraph
Kollektiv. His work in this area exhibited a concern for the entire built environment and,Paragraph
its future viability. Incorporating the necessary functions of daily life within his planning,Paragraph
"schemes, Scharoun added public buildings, shopping areas, parks, schools, kindergartens,",Paragraph
"administrative offices, and cultural and recreational elements, including crafts workshops",Paragraph
and spaces for weekly markets and provisions for small-scale industry and future growth.,Paragraph
"In addition, his intro-duction of a wide range of transportation systems (with pedestrian",Paragraph
access being the most important) underlined Scharoun’s attention to the human,Paragraph
dimension of architecture.,Paragraph
"Scharoun was able to build many of his designs after the war, including apartment",Paragraph
"complexes, schools, and theaters—all building programs that directly engaged issues",Paragraph
"pertaining to the human dimension and, even more specifically, the quality of life. As one",Paragraph
"of the remaining architects of his generation still active in West Germany, Scharoun",Paragraph
continued to explore architectural themes that had governed his work throughout his,Paragraph
"career: fluid space and change, program flexibility, technological advances, the primacy",Title
"of the interior uses as a determinant of form, the dynamic interaction of landscape and",Paragraph
"form, and contextual response. Although there are numerous examples, notable housing",Paragraph
"projects include his design for apartments in Berlin, his “Romeo and Juliet” housing",Paragraph
"project (1954-59) in Stuttgart, Charlottenburg-Nord (1950s—1960s), and the Béblingen",Paragraph
Flats (1965) near Stuttgart. Scharoun was extremely interested in the relationship,Paragraph
"between architectural program, order, form, space, and light and the learning processes",Paragraph
"associated with educational programs, and he designed several schools, such as the",Paragraph
"Geschwister Scholl (1958-62) in Linen, where he adopted an aggressive color program,",Paragraph
and the Volksschule (1960-71) at Marl in Westphalia. Scharoun’s theaters included the,Paragraph
"Kassel (1952), Mannheim (1953), and Ziirich (1964) theater projects. The Wolfsburg",Paragraph
"Theatre (1965-1973), completed after Scharoun’s death on 25 November 1972, absorbs",Paragraph
the energy of the earlier projects and stands today as a testament to Scharoun’s,Paragraph
architectural genius. This is also the case in his design for the German Maritime Museum,Paragraph
"(1969-75), a project commissioned by the State of West Germany and located in",Paragraph
"Bremerhaven, where his earliest visions for a new architecture first took root. Likewise,",Paragraph
"his most famous building, the Berlin Philharmonie (begun in 1968 and completed in",Paragraph
"1987), sublates many of the ideas found in his earliest architectural work, becoming",Paragraph
something of a refined exemplar of Expressionist architecture. The programs for the,Paragraph
Philharmonie and the later Chamber Music Hall appear as instruments themselves—fluid,Paragraph
airangements of myriad systems that lend themselves to Scharoun’s improvisational,Paragraph
approach to the making of form.,Paragraph
"Among Scharoun’s last projects, a State Library (1964-79) and a Musical Instruments",Paragraph
"Museum and Institute for Musical Research (1969-84), both sited immediately adjacent",Paragraph
to both the Berlin Philharmonie and Mies van der Rohe’s masterful National Gallery in,Paragraph
"Berlin, display the full range of Scharoun’s vision. The created context is thoughtfully",Paragraph
"nuanced, with the grouping of buildings open and responsive not only to one another but",Paragraph
to the entire city of (West} Berlin as well—a studied contrast in the closed conditions,Paragraph
"presented by the city’s isolated context at the time. Completed after Scharoun’s death,",Paragraph
"they represent not only the sum of one architect’s vision but also, in returning to the",Paragraph
"opening themes of the 1910s and 1920s, the culmination of a generation’s vision, a",Paragraph
"generation that, from the beginning, saw architecture as a form of redemption, a form of",Paragraph
life that engaged and affirmed the dynamics of social interaction.,Paragraph
"As an architect, Scharoun was prolific. The number of projects designed amounts to",Paragraph
"more than 300, the majority (238) of which were built despite the intervening years of",Paragraph
Fascist rule and the post-World War II economic difficulties. Scharoun’s insistence on a,Paragraph
"dynamic, “organic” architecture, in particular an architecture fully engaged in the",Paragraph
"rhythms of daily life, exhibits his concern for architecture as a form of life (Lebensform).",Paragraph
This idea encapsulates the sense of play and the use of fluid ordering systems in,Paragraph
Scharoun’s work; architecture did not exist as an object but rather functioned as an,Paragraph
"organism, a viable, developmental, and flexible network of associations and",Paragraph
interrelationships.,Paragraph

Piano. Michael Hopkins was selected for the Cambridge project from a shortlist of 20,Caption
international practices.,Paragraph
"Phase I, commissioned in 1982 and completed in 1985, includes laboratories, offices",Paragraph
"for scientists, and a test station with a range of drilling pits used to simulate difficult and",Paragraph
"dangerous field conditions. Because of noise, dirt, and the risk of explosion, test stations",Paragraph
"traditionally had been isolated in separate buildings. However, both the preoccupations of",Paragraph
Hopkins and the aspirations of Schlumberger led to a radically different approach. The,Paragraph
"test station is combined with a winter garden, which serves as both entrance hall and",Paragraph
"restaurant, to form a long north-south central spine that is flanked on the east and west by",Paragraph
two slimmer bars comprised of laboratories overlooking the central space and offices,Paragraph
with views out to the surrounding pastoral landscape. The natural slope of the site is,Paragraph
utilized to sink the floor of the test station and service yard 2.5 meters below the winter,Paragraph
garden. This lower level also provides an easily accessible services undercroft.,Paragraph
"The efficient, rational plan gives little hint of the drama of the section. A tensile roof",Paragraph

"glazed walls between winter garden, test station, and labs and a glazed external",Caption
envelope—creates a high degree of visual interaction both within the building and,Paragraph
between the building and the outside world. An egalitarian workplace laced together by,Paragraph

programmatic integration is reiterated in the marriage of orthogonal and curvilinear,Paragraph

SCHRODER-SCHRADER HOUSE,Title
"Designed by Gerrit Thomas Rietveld; completed 1924 Utrecht, Netherlands",Caption
The Schréder-Schrader House is an icon of early modern domestic architecture and is,Paragraph
considered the greatest and most influential work of Gerrit Thomas Rietveld (1888—,Paragraph
"1964). Located in Utrecht at Prins Hendriklaan 50, the design is the result of the close",Paragraph
"collaboration between Rietveld and the client, Truus Schréder-Schrider (1889-1985),",Paragraph
whose full contribution has only recently been recognized. They collaborated in 1921 in,Paragraph
"the design of a study for Mrs. Schréder-Schrader in her house on Biltstraat. In 1923, on",Paragraph
"the death of her husband, Frits Schréder, Mrs. Schréder-Schrader decided to build a small",Paragraph
"house for herself and her three children that would represent her ideas of a new, modern",Paragraph
way of living.,Paragraph
"Sitting at the end of a row of traditional Dutch houses, the Schréder-Schrader House is",Paragraph
"a balanced, asymmetrical composition of seemingly independent planes and lines. The",Paragraph
ends of the elements slip past each other with balconies and roof planes also projecting,Paragraph
from the body of the house as though not fully containing the space inside. Rietveld,Caption
"initially conceived of the house as constructed in concrete, and it was noted as such in",Paragraph
"some early publications. This proved to be too costly, and only the foundations and",Paragraph
"balconies are of concrete, and the walls are of traditional brick masonry with plaster.",Paragraph
"Both wood and steel are used for structural support, wood generally at the floors and steel",Paragraph
for the balconies and flat roof.,Caption
Sheltered by the southeast balcony in the main entry to the house is a traditional Dutch,Paragraph
door lacquered black. The ground floor is a composition of fixed walls in which essential,Paragraph
functions have been carefully integrated into the design. Within the compact space of the,Paragraph
"entry hall, a coat closet, a telephone counter, and a place for mail delivery, as well as",Paragraph
"storage for the children’s toys, are carefully composed and built-in. Also on the ground",Paragraph
"level is a small study with a built-in desk, bookshelves, and a door into the garden.",Paragraph
"Although the room behind the study was intended as a garage, Mrs. Schréder-Schrader",Paragraph
"never owned an automobile, and both Mrs. Schréder-Schrader and Rietveld periodically",Paragraph
used this room as a studio. To the right of the entry hall is the kitchen with room for four,Caption
"people to dine. A small window and shelf for deliveries is built-in, as is a speaking tube",Paragraph
"to the living-dining area on the upper level. Accessed from the kitchen is a small cellar,",Paragraph
"and behind the kitchen is a maid’s room. Mrs. Schréder-Schrader, however, never had a",Paragraph
"live-in servant, and this room was used primarily for reading. Closely linked to the site,",Paragraph
"the garage, kitchen, and study have their own doors to the garden, and spatial connections",Paragraph
are made between the rooms with large transoms at the top of the walls.,Paragraph
Despite the fact that the drawings given to the building commission indicate the ground,Paragraph
"floor as the living area with the upper level noted as an “attic,” this was never the",Paragraph
intention. It is the upper level that most exemplifies Mrs. Schréder-Schrader’s desire for,Paragraph
an architecture to match her attitudes toward living. These ideas were manifested in an,Paragraph
inherent freedom in the ability to change the layout to accommodate a variety of spatial,Paragraph
"configurations. A single, open room, the upper level can be divided by movable partitions",Paragraph
that follow tracks in the floor and guides along the ceiling. Closing the partitions creates,Paragraph
four smaller rooms that provided privacy for the children and Mrs. Schréder-Schrader,Caption
and a shared living-dining area. The three bedrooms are equipped with built-in storage,Paragraph
and a sink to promote self-sufficiency. A skylight above the stair provides access to the,Paragraph
roof and fills the center of the upper level with light. The bath and toilet area along the,Paragraph
"party wall can be enclosed by movable partitions at the stair. Gerard van de Groenekan,",Caption
"Rietveld’s assistant, constructed the built-in furniture; chairs and small tables were also",Paragraph
"of Rietveld’s design. The living-dining area is a slightly larger space with a built-in table,",Paragraph
"storage, and a shelf for the children to do their homework. It was here that the lively",Paragraph
discussions that Mrs. Schréder-Schrader envisioned occurred.,Paragraph
Rietveld created the interpenetration of spaces and the connection to the surrounding,Paragraph
"landscape by the dematerialization of boundaries either physically, as in the use of",Paragraph
"movable partitions, or through the use of color. Rietveld’s offsetting of the support at the",Paragraph
comer window in the living-dining room literally opens the space and creates a direct,Paragraph
"connection to the landscape. In turn, the colors of the floor and walls of the upper level",Paragraph
define spaces not constricted by the placement of partitions.,Paragraph
The Schréder-Schrader House is often considered a quintessential example of De Stijl,Paragraph
"architectural principles. Theo van Doesburg, the founder of De Stijl, published the house",Paragraph
"several times in his journal De Stij/. However, the house was not initially acknowledged",Paragraph
"by the general Dutch press, despite its appearance in many influential European",Paragraph
architecture magazines and Henry Russell Hitchcock’s 1929 Modern Architecture. The,Paragraph
1950s brought a resurgence of interest in the house in conjunction with a growth in the,Paragraph
popularity of Rietveld’s work.,Paragraph
Rietveld moved to the house after the death of his wife and lived there until his own,Paragraph
"death in 1964. Over time, a number of changes were made to the house; a dumbwaiter",Paragraph
"was added from the kitchen to the upper living-dining area, and in 1935 a room was",Paragraph
added on the roof to give Mrs. Schréder-Schrader more privacy from the many visitors,Caption
"who came to see the house. This room was later demolished. The original, rural context",Paragraph
of the house also has changed with urban expansion and the construction of a bypass in,Paragraph
1964. Mrs. Schréder-Schrader established the Rietveld Schréder House Foundation in,Caption
"1970 to assist in the maintenance and preservation of the house. Five years later, the",Paragraph

"Of all the American monuments to the International Style, it is the Seagram Building",Paragraph
"by Mies van der Rohe that fully defines the aesthetic and time of high modernism, the era",Paragraph
"of postwar corporate and urban consciousness. In glass, steel, and bronze, the Seagram",Paragraph
symbolizes the bricks and mortar and martinis that were the 1950s.,Paragraph
"The Seagram, a 40-story slab skyscraper of amber glass within a grid of bronze |",Paragraph
"beams, rises above a fountained plaza on Manhattan’s Park Avenue. The body of the",Paragraph
"building, in typical Mies fashion, is supported by a templelike entry that is reminiscent,",Paragraph
"within a thoroughly modern composition, of the earliest post-and-lintel roots of archaic",Paragraph
architecture. The design is of interest not only for the glass slab that rises suavely above,Paragraph
mid-town Manhattan but also for the invention of the plaza fronting Park Avenue and the,Paragraph
"resulting relationship of urban architectural object to its opposition, void space, within the",Paragraph
"city grid. Architectural historian William H.Jordy, in his definitive analysis of the",Paragraph
"building, spoke of the Seagram as modern expression of “the potential of structure to",Paragraph
"create noble order, in the sense in which it created noble order in the past” coupled with",Paragraph
“truth of its time.”,Paragraph
"For modernism, the Seagram is an ideal, perhaps even a Platonic ideal, of perfection",Paragraph
"and purity of form. It symbolizes the type form of the gridded glass skyscraper, emblem",Paragraph
of the 20th century. The building has always seemed the epitome of form and function,Paragraph
"united in its most integrated and reductive sense, the clearest expression of Mies’ edicts",Paragraph
that “form follows function” and that architecture is “almost nothing.” It is émigré Mies’,Paragraph
American sublime manifestation of his German utopian renderings.,Paragraph
"Like its creator, the Seagram is both simple and complex. The simplicity is the gridded",Paragraph
steel frame with glass-curtain wall as a modern extension of the archaic building. The,Paragraph
complexity is inherent in the expression of that simplicity through the applied bronze |,Paragraph
"beams, which, although they symbolically stand for the meaning of structure, are",Paragraph
"themselves unstructural. Thus, the aesthetic of truth-in-structure is expressed through an",Paragraph
untruthfully convoluted visual metaphor.,Paragraph
"Over the four decades since its design, the Seagram has drawn architecture and urban",Paragraph
planning into a number of problems. The primary problem is the truth-in-structure,Paragraph
"problem, but other, more prosaic problems also exist. Unlike the ideal type-form",Paragraph
"buildings of the past, such as the Parthenon and the Pantheon, the Seagram as a type form",Paragraph
"was created within the fastest paced civilization in history. Thus, the Modern type form",Paragraph
engenders its own imitation and reaction within its lifetime. Thinking,Paragraph
Seagram Building Plaza: New York City (1958),Caption
Ezra Stoller © Esto,Title
"architects, after the Seagram, wrestled with the questions of, “Where can construction go",Paragraph
after total reduction?” and “How can the art of architecture follow perfection of form?”,Paragraph
"For the thoughtful architect, the Seagram has been inspirational, a standard against",Paragraph
which tall buildings will always be judged. Less-gifted builders have simply lowered the,Paragraph
standard set by Mies for the gridded glass-and-steel skyscraper. His work has been,Paragraph
"exploited, copied, and shortchanged as a standardized form by developers the world over,",Paragraph
"cheaply, in terms of both dollars and aesthetics. Thus, it is critical for an appreciation of",Paragraph
"early skyscraper design never to read the chronology of modern architecture backward,",Paragraph
"blaming the beautiful early type forms, such as the Seagram, for the debased works of",Paragraph
later imitators.,Paragraph
A further problem engendered by the Seagram is inherent in the design of the slab,Paragraph
"versus the plaza. For this revolutionary design, revised zoning rules had to supersede the",Paragraph
famous New York setback skyscraper law that had been passed to ensure that giant,Paragraph
buildings would not block light and air within the crowded Manhattan grid. As the rules,Paragraph
"of the 1916 zoning law had dictated the aesthetics of the setback skyscraper, so now with",Paragraph
the Seagram plan would new zoning standards allow for new forms in American,Paragraph
architecture. The Seagram plan meant that skyscrapers could go straight up to higher,Paragraph
"elevations without setbacks, in giant continuous slabs. In exchange for height, the",Paragraph
"footprint of the building would cover only a small percentage of the site, allowing an",Paragraph
open plaza to be created.,Paragraph
The assumption of city planners was that a public urban amenity would thus be created,Paragraph
and financed through private corporate funding. Although the concept of a plaza of,Paragraph
"negative space could be fully animated by Mies, by a less-deft planner the modern plaza",Paragraph
has all too often proven to be no urban amenity. Poor imitation of the Seagram plaza has,Paragraph
"led to urban plazas that are not, as Mies’s is, confined voids in an aesthetic dialectical",Paragraph
relationship with the solid form of a building but rather simply voids of leftover space.,Paragraph
Planners have learned that it is better to maintain a continuous street setback than to,Paragraph
disrupt it arbitrarily.,Paragraph
It is possible that the Seagram’s influence on architectural style has been even wider,Paragraph
"than Mies could have expected, for the perfection and reduction of this building perhaps",Paragraph
engendered the reactionary excesses of Postmodernism. After working with Mies on the,Paragraph
"Seagram, architect Philip Johnson left Mies but continued to react to the Miesian",Paragraph
"influence for decades. Johnson’s prolific later ornamental Postmodernism, the antithesis",Paragraph
"of his own International Style tenets, may be read as a reactionary comment on his own",Paragraph
work on the Seagram Building.,Caption
"These problems, of course, are latter-day events for which Mies should not be held",Paragraph
"responsible. It is not to his detriment that he sought, through his type form for the modern",Paragraph
"skyscraper, to create perfect architectural form; nor is it his fault that the imitators of",Paragraph
architecture so rarely comprehended the meaning of his architectural ideals. Mies would,Paragraph
"not have concerned himself with such problems, for his concerns were solely with the",Paragraph
significance of his Baukunst.,Paragraph

"a structural engineer and partner in SOM, developed a system called “bundled tubes” for",Paragraph
the Sears Tower. The solution was a system composed of nine structural bays each 75,Paragraph
feet by 75 feet in plan and independent of each other. Nine skyscrapers of varying heights,Paragraph
are tied together in one building with the lateral wind loads resisted by the interlocked,Paragraph
"exterior tubes, cantilevered from the ground augmented by horizontal diaphragms. With",Paragraph
"this concept in place, it became possible to stop the tubes at any level without affecting",Paragraph
the structural integrity. The result was a vertical form that is composed of a nine-tube,Paragraph
"base, floors 1 through 50; followed vertically by seven tubes on floors 51-65 where the",Paragraph
"northwest and southeast tubes were discontinued; followed vertically by floors 66-90,",Paragraph
composed of five tubes in the shape of a cruciform in plan and finally the top floors 91—,Paragraph
110 composed of two bundled tubes.,Paragraph
A building of this size and height is also strongly controlled by the vertical,Paragraph
transportation system. In order to satisfy user expectations as to speed and comfort of,Paragraph
"movement, a point of density arrives wherein the ground floor elevators consume the",Paragraph
"entire entry floor. To facilitate the size and density of the Sears Tower, technologies",Paragraph
involving double-deck elevators and high-speed express elevators were employed. The,Paragraph
Tower’s 103-cab system divides the building into three separate zones. Fourteen double-,Paragraph
"deck elevators carry passengers, non-stop to either the 33rd—34th floors or the 66th—67th",Paragraph
floors where sky lobbies provide space for loading and unloading at two different floor,Paragraph
levels. Once at these levels passengers can go to local floors via 63 single-deck elevator,Paragraph
cabs. The 103rd floor is a public observation deck and serves large crowds by providing,Paragraph
"two express elevators, which connect the ground and top floors. These elevators travel at",Paragraph
"the rate of 1,800 feet per minute, reaching the summit in less than one minute.",Paragraph
The Sears Tower is the second in a series of three headquarters buildings for the,Paragraph
company. The first building constructed in 1904 was located at Arthington and Homan,Paragraph
Avenues in the Chicago West Side Lawndale community. It included a 14’4-story tower,Paragraph
and a campus of decentralized offices. It is still standing today. This environment,Paragraph
produced a corporate culture,Title

wherein a high degree of personal interaction occurred through chance meetings along,Paragraph
daily pedestrian routes. The present Sears Tower replaced this earlier structure in 1974.,Paragraph
The downtown Sears Tower served the Sears Corporation until 1992 when a new,Paragraph
headquarters was developed in Hoffman Estates in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago.,Paragraph
"This building, designed by Perkins and Wills, Architects, returned to the culture of the",Paragraph

The prize-winning house for his mother (1948-50) was first among works in the 1950s,Paragraph
"that immediately captured attention worldwide, notably in Europe and the Los Angeles",Paragraph
magazine Arts and Architecture. They were recognized as an apogee of architectural,Paragraph

attention to site conditions. His early work was derivative of Marcel Breuer (he does not,Paragraph
apologize for this) but soon matured to reach a formal epitome in a block of apartments,Paragraph

new projected height of 500 meters.,Paragraph
The building occupies a site on Pudong Road adjacent to the recently completed Jin,Paragraph
Mao Tower in the rapidly developing Lujiazhui financial and trade district in Pudong.,Paragraph
This area has been dedicated to development by the Chinese government and is intended,Paragraph
to become the Asian epicenter for international trade and banking. The Shanghai World,Paragraph
Financial Center is the second of a planned trilogy of high-rise towers in the area. The,Paragraph
"program provides for a total of nearly 320,000 square meters of useable area, with a",Paragraph
"combination of ground-floor retail, commercial office space, hotel suites, and an",Paragraph
observation deck at the top of the building.,Caption
The design of the tower represents a transition by Kohn Pedersen Fox from the,Paragraph
extravagant Post-modern towers that characterized the firm throughout the 1980s toward,Paragraph
the more streamlined and technological aesthetic that dominates their recent architecture.,Paragraph
"Such a shift demonstrates a nostalgia for the clean forms of modernism, diminishing the",Paragraph
role of the fagade of the tower in favor of more refined and monumental geometric forms.,Paragraph
"This is evident in the design of the tower, which takes the form of a chiseled wedge,",Paragraph
carved by two sweeping arcs and punctuated dramatically at the apex by a circular void,Paragraph
50-meters in diameter. The diminishing proportion of the floor-plates formed by the,Paragraph
tapered block allows for commercial office space at the lower levels and hotel suites,Paragraph
above in the more longitudinally proportioned zones of the building. An observation deck,Caption
is to be located on a bridge across the dynamic circular void at a height of 380 meters.,Paragraph
"The tower is square at the base, tapering to a single line at the apex oriented along the",Paragraph
"diagonal of the ground-floor plate. The sweeping arcs give the tower a twisted, animated",Paragraph
form providing unique views of the tower from different vantage points throughout the,Paragraph
city. This is most noticeable from the historical Bund area on the opposite side of the,Paragraph
"Huang Pu River, which bends around the Pudong area and provides the primary sites for",Paragraph
viewing the building in the skyline. The circular void that dominates the top of the tower,Paragraph
"is the same diameter as the sphere atop the nearby Oriental Pearl TV tower, initiating a",Paragraph
"solid-void dialogue with the adjacent landmark, which the twisting form of the tower",Paragraph
addresses. The circular cutout is intended pragmatically to reduce the considerable wind-,Paragraph
"loads on the building, especially significant in typhoon-stricken Shanghai. It also contains",Paragraph
thinly veiled references to traditional Chinese architecture and the circular moon-gate that,Paragraph
adorns many temples and gardens across China. The geometry of the square and the,Paragraph
"circle that is pervasive throughout the tower is intrinsic to Chinese philosophy, symbolic",Paragraph
generally of the earth and the sky and ideas of unity and harmony.,Paragraph
"Juxtaposed against the monolithic tower is a fractured podium, which responds to the",Paragraph
"disparate urban cacophony of Pudong, induced by several years of rampant development.",Paragraph
"Because of setback restrictions, the tower is confined to the center of the site, dissected",Paragraph
by a triangular shaft that slices through the building at ground level and forms the entry to,Paragraph
"the lift-core. Based on the geometry of a perfect circle, from which the square floorplate",Paragraph
"of the tower projects, the podium wraps around the rear of the building, peeling back to",Paragraph
"reveal the intersection of the tower with the ground at the front, north-western edge of the",Caption
site. This gesture addresses the main road of the Lujiazui district and contains a,Paragraph
landscaped public space protected by an enveloping shield of trees. The southern and,Paragraph
western sides of the tower are bounded by a landscaped public garden that links several,Paragraph
parts of the urban Lujiazui district and connects the three projected towers. A large area,Paragraph
"of on-grade car parking is located on the southeastern side of the tower, screened from",Paragraph
the parkland by a natural earth-berm.,Paragraph
The lower portions of the building are to be clad in a combination of smooth and,Paragraph
heavily rusticated granite. This is juxtaposed against the lightly reflective glass and,Paragraph
oO,Title
"stainless steel of the tower, anchoring the composition at the base and celebrating the",Paragraph
lightweight elegance of the glass and steel as it disappears into the sky. The original,Paragraph
"design called for a steel structure cased in concrete, using slender perimeter columns at",Paragraph
3.6-meter intervals to transmit lateral loads and the reinforced concrete core to transport,Caption
loads to the ground. This was later rationalized to use steel-reinforced concrete perimeter,Paragraph
columns of the same size and spacing but to bolster the structure with a second concrete,Paragraph
tube around the central core. The columns are interconnected by horizontal steel trusses,Paragraph
"and diagonal perimeter bracing throughout the tower, which binds the columns vertically.",Caption
"Until its completion, it is difficult to gauge the significance of the building within the",Paragraph
broader architectural context. The design attempts to bridge the chasm between the latent,Paragraph
forces of ancient Chinese culture and the volatile global economy of modern Asia,Title
"through the understated clarity of late modernism. As a result, the tower announces a new",Paragraph
phase in the architectural language of Kohn Pedersen Fox and a new direction in Asian,Paragraph
"high-rise construction, but judgment of the success of the building must wait until the",Paragraph
completion of construction.,Paragraph

aesthetic success led to Shaw’s selection to design the Henneberry Press Building in,Paragraph

impressive Beaux Arts style structure for Ginn and Company Publishers (1907). The,Paragraph

"While Shaw designed many other commercial structures, the bulk of his practice was",Paragraph

"mason, roofer, painter and landscape designer. Known for his insistence of high quality",Paragraph
"workmanship, Shaw designed and carefully supervised the construction of over twenty",Paragraph

"house for John Bradley (1898), and then Georgian, as in the house for A.A.Sprague",Paragraph

"(1912). Whatever the style, though, Shaw plans typically revealed his training in the",Paragraph
methods of the Ecole des Beaux Arts: generously proportioned rooms were aligned along,Paragraph
axes that extended to geometrically defined gardens and lawns.,Paragraph
In 1915 Shaw turned his attention to small-scale urban planning when he became part,Paragraph
owner and sole architect for Market Square in Lake Forest. The first planned shopping,Paragraph
"center in the country, Market Square revitalized a dilapidated section of town by",Paragraph
"integrating commercial and residential quarters, coordinating both pedestrian and",Paragraph
"automotive traffic, and wedding various English, Dutch and German architectural motifs",Paragraph

"workers of the Mark Corporation of East Chicago, Indiana. With its creative mix of forty",Paragraph
"different English-style cottages, Marktown proved to be one of the most sophisticated",Paragraph
adaptations of British Garden City Movement planning in America.,Paragraph
Even at the height of his career Shaw maintained a fairly small office of apprentices,Paragraph
"and draftsmen, most notably David Adler. Shaw was gracious in social situations, a",Paragraph
"member of several civic organizations, and noted for his sense of humor. Despite",Paragraph
"persistent ill health, he traveled frequently to Europe to collect ideas and artifacts for his",Paragraph
clients. His love for the arts was manifested by his considerable devotion to the Chicago,Paragraph

"almost as many years, each of his works has been exquisitely crafted to express a",Paragraph

"generation of post-World War II Japanese architects, including Toyo Ito, Itsuko",Paragraph
"Hasegawa, and Issei Sakamoto, who were known collectively in the 1970s as the",Paragraph
“Shinohara school.”,Paragraph
Kazuo Shinohara was born in Shizuoka prefecture in Japan in 1925 and entered the,Paragraph
Department of Architecture at the Tokyo Institute of Technology at the age of 22.,Paragraph
"Following graduation in 1953, Shinohara became an associate of the same institution,",Paragraph
"where he remained for the following 40 years, being appointed associate professor in",Paragraph
"1962, professor in 1970, and professor emeritus in 1986. Shinohara completed a",Paragraph
"doctorate on spatial composition in traditional Japanese architecture in 1967. Lronically, it",Paragraph
was after the completion of this research that he began to reject the ordered spaces of the,Paragraph
Japanese vernacular that characterized so many of his early designs in favor of a more,Paragraph
complex and technological approach to design.,Paragraph
"Two themes, order and chaos, distinguish Shinohara’s early architectural works and",Paragraph
"writings from his later ones. The shift between these two extremes, from a preoccupation",Paragraph
"with order toward a fascination with disorder, took place between 1967 and 1970,",Paragraph
although traces of Shinohara’s growing interest in chaos are apparent as early as 1964.,Paragraph
"Prior to 1967, Shinohara describes his designs, including such projects as the House in",Paragraph
"Kugayama (1954), the House in Chigasaki (1960), and the House in Komae (1960), as",Paragraph
"distinctly ordered and traditional. These projects, which are named after the locations in",Paragraph
"which they are sited, are characterized by largely symmetrical spatial compositions that",Paragraph
are variants of historic Japanese house types.,Paragraph
"Following these works, Shinohara began to refine his approach to geometry and",Paragraph
structure to even greater levels of abstraction. This growth in design method is seen in the,Paragraph
"Umbrella House (1961), the House in White (1966), and the Suzusho House (1968), all",Paragraph
"of which feature simple geometric forms, white walls, and exposed-timber beams.",Paragraph
"Despite the success of these buildings, in the years that followed, Shinohara began to",Paragraph
question the role played by the house in the city and the importance of order and,Paragraph
symmetry. In the Incomplete House (1970) and the House in Itoshima (1976) on the,Paragraph
"Genkainada Sea, symmetry still governs the exterior of the dwelling, but inside the pure,",Paragraph
hierarchical planning that distinguishes so many of his early works has been eroded. This,Paragraph
"shift is even more apparent in Shinohara’s Uehara House (1976) in Tokyo, which features",Paragraph
a stark concrete exterior perforated with irregularly spaced geometric windows. This,Paragraph
"house, which is supported on a system of Y-shaped concrete columns, is asymmetrical in",Paragraph
both plan and section and does not possess the same polished finish of many of his early,Paragraph
works. The Uehara House is one of Shinohara’s first designs that expresses the dual,Paragraph
desire to isolate the interior from the exterior and to recognize the complexity of modern,Paragraph
life in the arrangement of spaces and forms. Shinohara describes these intermediate,Paragraph
works as possessing a “savage” or “barbarous” quality that is a result not only of his use,Paragraph
of raw concrete but also of his newly developed interest in the irregular geometry o,Paragraph
nature.,Paragraph
"For Shinohara, both the dream of utopia that preceded World War II and the influx o",Paragraph
modern architecture in Japan that followed in its aftermath were doomed to failure,Paragraph
because they did not take account of the need for complexity in urban space. It was only,Paragraph
in modernism’s aftermath that people began to see that cities such as Tokyo possess a,Paragraph
natural complexity that is intrinsic to its vitality. Shinohara describes the urban chaos o,Paragraph
"Tokyo as being paradigmatic of “the beauty of progressive anarchy,” a concept that for",Paragraph
him relates to the sense of energy and disorder often encountered in urban spaces. The,Paragraph
"Ukiyo-e Museum (1982), Shinohara’s first nonresidential building, attempts to capture",Paragraph

"triangles, and arcs. Internally, the museum is a mixture of contrasts, smooth floors are",Paragraph
"juxtaposed against rough concrete walls, and natural finishes compete with vibrant red",Paragraph
and green window frames.,Paragraph
"By 1987, Shinohara had begun to openly argue that “chaos is a basic condition of the",Paragraph
"city” and that if architecture is to respond to this chaos, it must adopt a new guise that is",Paragraph
informed by both technology and the sciences of complexity. He maintains that architects,Paragraph
"must focus their attention on machines (particularly computers, the F-14 fighter plane,",Paragraph
and the Apollo 71 lunar landing craft). Because modern machines are highly adaptable to,Paragraph
"complex environments, Shinohara proposes that they are suitable metaphors for design in",Paragraph
"an increasingly unpredictable world. Shinohara calls this approach to architecture, which",Paragraph
"he documented in his 1988 article “Chaos and Machine,” Modern-next. Although",Paragraph
"Shinohara has developed this philosophy of design in a number of projects, including the",Paragraph

SHOPPING CENTER,Title
Two trends were crucial for the development and success of the shopping center:,Paragraph
decentralization at the urban scale and increasingly sophisticated techniques of,Paragraph
advertising and display that encouraged the purchase of goods. In this sense the,Paragraph
"department stores, such as the famous Bon Marché of Paris (ca. 1862) and the much",Paragraph
larger Marshall Field’s store of Chicago (ca. 1880) prefigured the 20th-century shopping,Paragraph
"center and its later manifestation, the shopping mall. The French example was",Paragraph
"particularly important because it was fashioned as a place of “democratic luxury,” where",Paragraph
goods were presented to the clientele in the exciting manner of world’s fair displays. The,Paragraph
"shopping center did not become identifiable as a distinct building type, however, until the",Paragraph
"1920s. The 18th- and 19th-century arcades, and the late 19th-century department stores",Paragraph
"were not the precedents of this building type, per se, although they certainly influenced",Paragraph
"retail architecture and the culture of consumption. Until the 1930s in the United States,",Paragraph
"where it first materialized, a shopping center was nothing more than a term denoting an",Paragraph
"assemblage of businesses, usually situated “downtown.” In fact, downtown centers that",Paragraph
"sported a cluster of businesses, stores, and a department store were considered the",Paragraph
definition of a shopping core. Outlying districts that offered shops and businesses might,Paragraph
"also have been considered a shopping center, but these types of gathered buildings and",Paragraph
"spaces were not coordinated or planned as one. By 1930, however, developers and",Paragraph
architects created identifiable centers incorporating business factors as well as,Paragraph
architectural issues. The premeditated nature of this new landscape intervention marks,Paragraph
the shopping center’s most salient characteristic as a distinct building type.,Paragraph
"The typology developed out of a larger effort to decentralize the urban nucleus, a trend",Paragraph
that originated in the previous century. The five-unit block built as an integral component,Paragraph
"of the residential community at Riverside, Illinois, in 1870 is perhaps a more useful",Paragraph
"precedent than, say, the Marshall Field’s store. Just as Riverside was an early prototype",Paragraph
"of what would become a more powerful 20th-century movement to the suburb, so too",Paragraph
was its store building. As cities in the second half of the 19th century grew in terms of,Paragraph
"density, land area, and pollution, the demand for neighborhoods in pseudopastoral",Paragraph
"settings increased. Streetcar lines made such suburban communities viable, as resi-dents",Paragraph

"Market Square in Lake Forest, Illinois, was an important and early example, built in",Paragraph
1916 to cater to some of Chicago’s wealthiest families. Designed by Howard Van Doren,Caption

"pedestrian path was often punctuated with fountains or sculpture, whereas these shopping",Paragraph
centers were surrounded by massive parking lots that wrapped around the backs of the,Paragraph
stores in such a way that a customer could park near any given store. Perceptually,Paragraph
"disconnected from the street, this “mall was an environment unto itself. As historian",Paragraph
"Richard Longstreth noted, “Once divorced from their cars and walking amid what seems",Paragraph
"like an entirely different world, customers tended to spend greater blocks of time",Paragraph
"meandering, meeting friends, having meals, and buying goods.”",Paragraph

"were designed along a two-story, 1500-foot-long pedestrian path dubbed the “Miracle",Paragraph
"Mall.” In 1956, a fully enclosed mall in Minnesota called Southdale opened. Designed by",Paragraph
"Victor Gruen, who believed that malls held the potential for restoring social space to a",Paragraph
"socially bankrupt society, the enclosure allowed for climate control so that shoppers",Paragraph
"would not be deterred by heat, cold, or snow. The success of these malls was profound, as",Paragraph
by 1960 department store owners no longer had faith in the stand-alone branch store as a,Paragraph
viable business proposition. The dominance of the mall also had an ironic effect on the,Paragraph
"role of the architect in the retail market, because such large-scale projects, financed and",Paragraph
"built in one swoop as one integrated building and under single ownership, handed the",Paragraph
"architect greater influence in the design process. After the 1970s, when the completely",Paragraph
"enclosed pedestrian path became standard, architects were allowed even greater design",Paragraph
control over such projects.,Paragraph
The influence of American practices was also felt abroad. The first mall in Great,Paragraph

"complex boasting 82 tenants, 4000 employees, and 3500 parking spaces. Site selection",Paragraph

gender roles and greatly influenced the appropriate modes of heterosocial conduct.,Paragraph
"Although the gender of shopping changed in the last quarter of the century, as men",Paragraph

the truly remarkable aspect of the shopping center was the way social space was,Paragraph

The story of the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls is intimately tied up with the history,Paragraph
"of the establishment of the state of Israel. In the summer of 1947, a Bedouin shepherd",Paragraph
boy stumbled into a cave near the town of Qumran and inside discovered clay jars,Paragraph
containing parchments sewn together into long scrolls wrapped in linen. In November of,Paragraph
"that year, Dr. Elazar Sukenik, the head of Hebrew University’s Department of",Paragraph

documents. Although the next day the United Nations was scheduled to vote on the,Paragraph

"All told, the Bedouin shepherd had discovered seven scrolls, of which Dr. Sukenik had",Paragraph
purchased three. The remaining four scrolls were acquired by the metropolitan of the,Paragraph
"Syrian Orthodox Monastery of Saint Mark in the Old City of Jerusalem, who had shipped",Paragraph
them to New York in search of a better price. Although Dr. Sukenik died believing them,Paragraph
"lost, his son, General Yigael Yadin, also an archaeologist, was on a 1954 speaking tour in",Paragraph
"the United States when a journalist called his attention to an obscure, seven-line classified",Paragraph
advertisement in the Wall Street Journal offering “Four Dead Sea Scrolls for Sale.”,Paragraph
"Yadin moved quickly to secure the scrolls from the vault of the Waldorf Astoria,",Paragraph
"purchasing them with the financial backing of New York industrialist Samuel Gottesman,",Paragraph
"Armand Bartos’s father-in-law. Following Gottesman’s death in 1956, the D.S. and R.H.",Paragraph
Gottesman Foundation agreed to provide the funds for the construction of the Shrine of,Paragraph
the Book in Jerusalem.,Paragraph
"From its inception, the architectural program for the Shrine of the Book was",Paragraph
"symbolically overdetermined. First were the scrolls themselves, breathtaking in historical,",Paragraph
"archaeological, and religious significance. For Jews, often called “the people of the",Paragraph
"book,” the discovery of a manuscript written so near to biblical times was theologically",Paragraph
earthshaking. Second was the coincidence between the discovery of the scrolls and the,Paragraph
founding of the state of Israel. Both the parchments and the nation had lain dormant from,Paragraph
the fall of the second Jewish state until the resurrection of the third. The scrolls provided,Paragraph
a link between those Jews whose revolt had been crushed by the Romans and those who,Paragraph
"founded a new nation, bathing legitimacy on their territorial claims. Third was Kiesler’s",Paragraph
own struggle to practice architecture in a manner consistent with his critiques of the then-,Paragraph
"dominant International Style. Against its ethos of rationalism and transparency, Kiesler",Paragraph
"unleashed his surrealist passions for the mythological, the sexualized, the poetical, and",Paragraph
"the primal. What better commission for Kiesler than a sacred shrine to ancient scrolls,",Paragraph
"scratched from the prehistoric earth, that awed “the somnolent religious world of",Paragraph
cathedrals” and recounted a “war between the sons of light and the sons of darkness”?,Paragraph
"Kiesler and Bartos flew to Jerusalem in October 1957 and met with Mazar Ben Zvi, the",Paragraph
president of Hebrew University. As Kiesler recounts the events that followed in his,Paragraph
"journal fnside the Endless House, he persuaded the university to enlarge its ambitions and",Paragraph
construct a monumental sanctuary for the shrine on the new Givat Ram Campus (then,Paragraph
"under construction). On the flight back to New York, using a pencil nub on the back of an",Paragraph
"envelope from his jacket pocket, Kiesler scratched a double-parabolic dome, “a plastic",Paragraph
representation of ‘rebirth.’”,Paragraph
"By late December 1957, preliminary drawings of the dome were complete. The scheme",Paragraph
"called for a unified centralized chamber, partially buried in the ground, in which the",Paragraph
manuscripts and related artifacts would be displayed. The dome would fill the lobby of,Paragraph
"the planned cubic library building, and its throat and tip would peek out of the roof.",Paragraph
"Predictably, the campus architects objected, and the Shrine of the Book was removed to a",Paragraph
"second site outside the library, to be entered via a subterranean corridor. By 1959,",Paragraph
"detailed drawings were completed for this scheme, but in the fall of that year, the site was",Paragraph
"moved again, this time to the new campus of the Israel Museum. Kiesler and Bartos’s",Paragraph
"design process seems to have been essentially additive, and the dome and corridor were",Paragraph
transferred to the new location. Because they no longer had the strong mass of the library,Paragraph
"to play against, the architects added a freestanding basalt wall to balance the composition.",Paragraph
Some ancillary office and library space was also added. Although Kiesler is credited with,Paragraph
"the design sketches and poetic ideas, Bartos remained in Israel during most of the",Paragraph
construction and provided the essential on-site refinements and supervision.,Paragraph
The Shrine of the Book is composed of five primary pieces arranged in a linear,Paragraph
sequence. A visit to the shrine begins with a transverse walk across a stone entry plaza.,Paragraph

visitor turns and descends an open staircase to a sunken court. On one side of the court,Paragraph
"are supporting offices, and to the other is the entrance to the shrine. Once inside the",Paragraph
"lobby, the black wall reappears, but this time punctured with an opening at its base. As",Paragraph
"one passes through that opening and its tubular gates, a dark passage descends slowly",Paragraph
through a sequence of asymmetrical arches. Display cases on the side walls provide the,Paragraph
"primary illumination. At the end of this hall, another staircase climbs upward into the",Paragraph
"ribbed open dome, which swings its concentrically corrugated surface from almost 80",Paragraph
feet at its base to just 6 at its throat. Desert sunlight pours down from a transparent,Paragraph

central platform is a vertical shaft ringed with the unfurled “Book of Isaiah.” Below is a,Caption

which nontextual artifacts are entombed. A single passage leads out from the dome and,Paragraph
back to the surface.,Paragraph

"In accordance with Kiesler’s invocations of the primal, the Shrine of the Book",Paragraph
attempted to choreograph the four elements of the ancients. A literal penetration into the,Paragraph
earth is expressed materially through strata of progressively roughening and darkening,Paragraph
"masonry. At the deepest point in the complex, an axis is opened through the eye of the",Paragraph
"dome, linking the depths of the archaeological past with the bright skies of the heavens.",Paragraph
"On the surface, a pool of water surrounds the dome, small jets sprinkle its exterior, and a",Paragraph
trough of water encircles the base of the black wall. Plans for an even more dramatic jet,Paragraph
of water that would have shot up from the central shaft and out of the dome’s eye were,Paragraph
"abandoned when unexpected backsplash could not be solved. Similarly, Kiesler’s plans",Paragraph
"for a flaming trough of fuel to cap the massive black wall were also abandoned, although",Paragraph
torches were installed for the opening ceremonies in 1965.,Paragraph
"The importance of the shrine was recognized even before its completion, and it was",Paragraph
"immediately seen to be Kiesler’s long-delayed masterpiece, a triumphant success",Paragraph
crowning a lifetime of deferred hopes and unrealized visions. It was awarded the Gold,Paragraph
Medal by the Architectural League of New York and is now considered by the Israeli,Paragraph
"government to be one of its national treasures. Still, perhaps the greatest testimony to",Paragraph
Kiesler and to his lifelong struggle for poetic expression in architecture is the fact that the,Paragraph
Shrine of the Book continues to demand to be interpreted symbolically. Some are,Paragraph
"compelled by the relationship to the scrolls themselves, reading the white dome as the lid",Paragraph
"of a pottery jar and the shrine as a great cave, engaged together in a battle of light against",Paragraph
the darkness of the basalt wall. Others see the shrine as a symbol of rebirth; just as the,Paragraph
"Hebrew nation was reborn after 2,000 years of exile, bringing an ancient language and",Paragraph
"people back to Jerusalem, so, too, does the shrine emerge from the ground like a great",Paragraph
dormant seed. Others are drawn to shrine’s mysterious sexuality—seeing in the dome a,Paragraph
"female breast and traveling a dark passage into a great protective womb, violated only by",Paragraph
the episodic sprays from the tall central shaft. Others draw parallels with the dream of,Paragraph
"Jacob’s ladder, the staffs of the Jewish Torah, or the Roman Pantheon. Ultimately, the",Paragraph
significance of the Shrine of the Book does not lie in the selection of one of these,Paragraph
"readings over another. Rather, by speaking mythologically, by simply opening up a field",Paragraph
"of symbolic interpretation, Kiesler’s shrine sidestepped modern architecture’s dilemma of",Paragraph
"the monument and created a sacred building as rewarding to, the heart, and the spirit as it",Paragraph
is to the mind.,Paragraph

"charge and continued the work of the firm. Heikki Sirén’s father, Johann Sigfrid Sirén,",Paragraph

classicism. Both Heikki (1918—) and Kaija (1920—) studied under Professor Sirén at,Paragraph
"Technical University in Helsinki. Born 20 years after Alvar Aalto, Heikki Sirén belonged",Paragraph
"to the next generation, which was equally inspired and, at the same time, overshadowed",Paragraph
by Aalto.,Caption
The elder J.S.Sirén’s disciplined academic classicism emphasized the importance of a,Paragraph
clear plan as demonstrating the synthesis of the problem. The pair gained world,Paragraph
"recognition with the Chapel of the Technical University at Otaniemi, west of Helsinki, in",Caption
1957. No other single work ever matched the recognition that it achieved worldwide for,Paragraph
its brilliant classical simplicity allied to a uniquely Finnish identification with trees and,Paragraph
the forest. This concept echoed the primitive values of a forest people by its daring,Paragraph
selection of a forest clearing outside the chapel as the core site of spirituality and,Paragraph
redemption.,Paragraph
Its classicism was so well disguised beneath the chapel’s vernacular references that it is,Paragraph
"easily missed. However, on closer analysis the clarity of plan is the secret foundation of",Paragraph
the chapel’s underlying simplicity and experiential impact. The modest mode of building,Paragraph
in brick and timber exploited the Finnish tradition of wooden houses with their spacious,Paragraph
"yards. In one respect, the chapel’s simplicity is confusing. The building derives its power",Paragraph
"from the synthesis of several sources, including the Finnish identification and rootedness",Paragraph
"in nature found in the medieval Finnish national epic the Ka/evala, the Siréns’ obvious",Paragraph
"admiration of anonymous indigenous architecture, and the notion that architecture creates",Paragraph
the “stage” for human life.,Paragraph
The arrangement of an entry courtyard preceding the chapel separated the sacred from,Paragraph
"the profane. The chapel had its cross outside, a feature that is reminiscent of a",Paragraph
proscenium theater with the glass wall replacing the proscenium arch and the forest,Caption
clearing now reconstituted as a sacred stage. The cross set in the landscape was not,Paragraph
new—Gunnar Asplund used it for his 1940 Forest Crematorium at Sockenvagen—but,Paragraph
what is different in the Sirén version is the visual coupling of the cross with the chapel.,Paragraph
"Subsequently, Tadao Ando repeated the outside cross formula in his Church on the Water",Paragraph
(1988) at Tomamu on Hokkaido.,Caption
Many people are attracted by the ultimate simplicity of the Siréns’ architectural,Paragraph
"features. At the chapel, for example, the entry screen of horizontal timber poles in the",Paragraph
courtyard permits the outside to be visible and thus transmits metaphysical ideas of,Paragraph
considerable weight that mirror a Finnish identity linked at many levels to nature. Nature,Paragraph
belongs to a pantheistic religious experience imbued by a kind of rich poverty.,Paragraph
"Prior to the chapel, the small stage of the Finnish National Theatre (1954) in Helsinki",Paragraph
had been the Siréns’ first and most noteworthy work. It was completed as an annex to the,Paragraph
theater building and the new auditorium and had a lobby and restaurant on the ground,Paragraph

"clinker elevation, which provides a suitable backdrop to adjacent Kaisaniemi Park. The",Paragraph
Kontiontie terrace houses (1954) at Tapiola were built with black-stained prefabricated,Paragraph

"employed a simple steel-frame and in-fill aesthetic in-spired by Mies van der Rohe, but",Paragraph
these were carried out with a flare for mating the cubic masses to their sites. The Town,Paragraph
Hall (1967) at Kankaanpaa and the Villa Punjo (1967) at Espoo testify to the Siréns’,Paragraph
capacity to unite their buildings with forest settings by a simple juxtaposition of a finely,Paragraph
tuned classical simplicity and rhythmic succession of masses.,Paragraph

The Siréns’ holiday retreat (1966) on the island of Lingonsé exemplifies their respect,Paragraph

were built using an experimental prototype of prefabricated timber that was borrowed,Paragraph
from a traditional solid-log sauna system. Wood was selected for its weathering,Paragraph

the 1980s that he began to receive recognition through exhibitions and commissions in,Paragraph
other European countries.,Paragraph
"Siza’s architecture is strongly rooted in the Modern movement, but incorporates a",Paragraph
"subjective approach to concept and design, secking alternative interpretations of",Paragraph
"modernism. Siza has stated, “Architecture is increasingly a problem of use and reference",Paragraph
to models.... My architecture does not have a preestablished language and does not,Paragraph
"establish a language. It is a response to a concrete problem, a situation in transformation",Paragraph
in which | participate.”,Paragraph
The geographic and climatic conditions of the place of Siza’s architecture are of,Paragraph
profound importance to this thinking in addition to cultural and social concerns. In Siza’s,Paragraph
oeuvre sensitivity to context does not result in nostalgic historicism or critical,Paragraph
regionalism. It is rather a unique approach to a universal language transformed to respond,Paragraph
"to a local situation. His built works strive to integrate conflicting demands and affinities,",Paragraph
often embodying points of tension that exist in a delicate balance.,Paragraph
"For Siza, a building is at the same time autonomous and responsive, unified and",Paragraph
diversified. He eschews using technology for technology’s sake and employs local,Paragraph
"materials such as stucco, brick, and stone—all traditional building materials that he uses",Paragraph
to create abstract compositions.,Paragraph
"His swimming pools (1966) located in Lega de Palmeira, a small town near Porto, were",Paragraph
his first projects to receive acclaim outside Portugal. These seaside pools easily make the,Paragraph
"transition from man-made concrete to the natural rock formations, creating sublime",Paragraph
bathing pools. The changing rooms are in an unobtrusive pavilion of concrete with wood,Paragraph
roofs that guide the visitor through a corridor-like space before opening on to the,Paragraph
expansive sea.,Paragraph
"The Pinto e Sotto Maior Bank (1974) in Oliveira de Azmeis, a small town in northern",Paragraph
"Portugal, is very representative of his early work. This small building does not adopt the",Paragraph
formal architectural vocabulary of the place but rather creates a dialogue with its,Paragraph
"surroundings. The curved, glass facade looks out on to the square, however, creating a",Paragraph
"formal juxtaposition with the traditional forms of the square. Another bank building, the",Paragraph
"Borges and Irmao Bank (1986) in Vila do Conde, Portugal, takes a similar approach. It is",Paragraph
"both a separate entity and a participant in the townscape, respecting the scale of its",Paragraph
"surroundings. From the outside, little is revealed of the character of the interior.",Paragraph
"However, the space flows because of the visual connection between floors.",Paragraph
"In 1977, following the revolution in Portugal, the local government of Evora",Paragraph
commissioned Siza to plan a housing project in the rural outskirts of the town. It was to,Paragraph
"be one of several that he would do for the national housing association, consisting of",Paragraph
"1,200 low-cost row houses, some one-story and some two-story units, all with courtyards.",Caption
The layout of the new section gave order to an area at the periphery of the town while,Paragraph
connecting it with existing housing areas.,Paragraph
"During the 1980s, Siza was asked to undertake increasingly larger institutional",Paragraph
"projects, such as the School of Architecture (1992) at Porto University in Porto, the",Paragraph
"Teachers Training College (1991) at Setubal, and the Centro Galiziano (Museum of",Paragraph
"Modern Art, 1994) in Santiago de Compostela, Spain, located within the historical city.",Paragraph
This Centro Galiziano building fits into a complicated and historic site employing,Paragraph
"concepts of integration and contrast. The reductive, elongated form of the museum—",Paragraph
produced by two adjacent wings—seeks to create classical order in an area that had,Paragraph
"suffered decline. The granite exterior contrasts with the stark white interior. Once again,",Paragraph
Siza has approached the work with sensitivity to context without relinquishing the,Paragraph
autonomy and strength of the new construction. Other notable museum projects include,Paragraph

"Architecture firm, United States",Title
"An early proponent of the International Style, the architectural firm of Skidmore,",Paragraph
Owings and Merrill (SOM) was best noted for its technical innovations in skyscraper,Paragraph
"design, especially during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. The “glass box” aesthetic, derived",Paragraph
"from Mies van der Rohe, for SOM became an experiment in which, although the general",Paragraph
"style and form remained quite consistent and even somewhat bland, subtle modifications",Paragraph
and structural enhancements were progressively undertaken. SOM’s version of corporate,Paragraph
"architecture dominated the field of high-rise building during this period, even after",Paragraph
competing up-and-coming firms introduced more progressive design concepts and,Paragraph
"seemingly left SOM a dinosaur living off past laurels. Yet owing to its vast resources,",Paragraph
"stability, and reputation, the firm was able to maintain a consistently strong position with",Paragraph
"corporate clients, even after the retirement of the founding partners and key designers.",Paragraph
"Founded in Chicago in 1936, SOM emerged during troubled economic times and with",Paragraph
"few early building projects. Law-renceburg, Indiana, native Louis Skidmore (1897-1962)",Caption
graduated with an architectural degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Paragraph
"(MIT) in 1924. After working for Maginnius and Walsh for two years, Skidmore won the",Paragraph
prestigious Rotch Traveling Fellowship in 1926 and spent the next three years in Europe.,Paragraph
"While in Paris, he met and married Eloise Owings, sister of his future partner Nathaniel",Paragraph
"Owings (1903-84). Owings, a native of Indianapolis, had attended the architectural",Paragraph
school at the University of Illinois at Urbana in 1921. After becoming ill and passing up,Paragraph
"an appointment to West Point, Owings eventually graduated with a bachelor of arts",Paragraph
degree in architecture from Cornell University in 1927. The first major work of the,Paragraph
brothers-in-law was for the 1933 Century of Progress International Exposition in,Paragraph
"Chicago, of which Skidmore was named assistant to the general manager. Their",Paragraph
collaborative effort consequently led to the opening of a second office in New York in,Paragraph

University of Wisconsin at Madison for two years before joining the U.S. Army during,Paragraph

The firm’s reputation was elevated to a new level with its first major skyscraper,Paragraph

"During the 1970s, the firm reacted to changing economic conditions that required multi-",Paragraph
"purpose megastructures, literally vertical cities in the sky. Two of its best-known",Paragraph
"structures of this type were constructed in Chicago, both designed by Bruce Graham",Paragraph
(1925-) and engineered by Fazlur Khan (1929-82). The John Hancock Center (1970) is,Paragraph
by far the most satisfying. This multi-purpose 100-story structure of black anodized,Paragraph
"aluminum with tinted bronze glass rises 1,107 feet as a single tapered shaft. It combines",Paragraph
"retail, commercial, and residential functions into one colossal building. In order to",Paragraph

While the firm’s skyscraper commissions progressively increased in the 1960s and,Paragraph
"1970s, other types of projects also came its way, most significantly the campus design",Paragraph
and buildings for the United States Air Force Academy (1962) in Colorado Springs. The,Caption
"school’s Cadet Chapel offered SOM a rare opportunity to design a religious structure, and",Paragraph
"Netsch responded with a unique approach, constructing three chapels (one Protestant, one",Paragraph

abstractly references forms associated with aircraft and flying. Shortly after this,Paragraph
"commission, SOM began working on another campus plan, this time for the University of",Paragraph
Illinois at Chicago Center (1965).,Caption
"The firm was not restricted to skyscraper or campus planning projects. Indeed, SOM’s",Paragraph
work spanned the entire range of architectural forms. Some of its key designs include the,Paragraph
"technically sophisticated McMath Solar Telescope at Kitt Peak (1962) in Tucson,",Paragraph

"a modemist’s response to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Guggenheim Museum in New York,",Paragraph
lifted up on massive pilotis as per the Le Corbusier model.,Paragraph
It is important to note that the firm’s three founders actually designed few of SOM’s,Paragraph
hallmark buildings. They developed and led an architectural firm modeled on a corporate,Paragraph
organization. Branch offices were opened in a number of cities with design principals in,Paragraph
"charge of each office. Instead of the more typical hierarchical arrangement of power,",Paragraph
"authority within SOM was arranged in a linear fashion, as each office head theoretically",Paragraph
had equal voice in how the firm was run. A stipulation in the founding partners’,Paragraph
"agreement required retirement at age 65 for each principal, thus prompting a constant",Paragraph
renewal of the firm’s direction and focus.,Paragraph
"With such an arrangement, it is not surprising that SOM’s designs exhibit a good deal",Paragraph
"of diversity and quality, particularly during the 1970s and beyond. The firm grew to an",Paragraph
immense size in terms of both employees and offices. In addition to the original Chicago,Paragraph
"and New York offices, a San Francisco office was opened in 1946 when the firm took on",Paragraph
the design of Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines and the Monterey Naval Post-,Paragraph
"graduate School. In 1967, the Washington, D.C., office was established to handle the",Paragraph

"established in Los Angeles and Miami. Not all the new offices survived, however, as the",Paragraph
firm constantly reacted to changing economic and building trends. Those offices founded,Paragraph
"in Denver, Portland, and Boston were eventually closed in 1987, Houston’s closed in",Paragraph
"1988, and new offices were opened in the late 1980s in London and Hong Kong, as",Paragraph
construction boomed in those areas.,Paragraph
Netsch once bitingly complained that SOM in the 1980s was producing “Reagan,Paragraph
architecture for Reagan times.” The rejuvenation of design that the founding partners had,Paragraph
"intended thus did not always come to pass. In fact, once SOM had reached its pinnacle in",Paragraph
the early 1970s with the visually satisfying John Hancock Center and the record-breaking,Paragraph
"height of the Sears Tower, the firm had the luxury of essentially sitting back and waiting",Paragraph
"for clients to come forward. Still, several fine structures were designed by SOM in the",Paragraph
"1980s, including Bunshaft’s post-modern National Commercial Bank (1984) in Jeddah,",Paragraph
"Saudi Arabia, and the United Gulf Bank (1987) in Manama, Bahrain.",Paragraph
Because of its huge size and ability to provide numerous services ranging from,Paragraph
"interiors to transportation planning, corporate SOM could easily service clients’ needs",Paragraph
and provide one-stop shopping. The size of the firm particularly suited the requirements,Paragraph

"As the archetypal urban commercial building, the 20th-century skyscraper exhibited",Paragraph
continual structural innovation and stylistic exploration. Historicism and eclecticism,Paragraph
"moved in and out of fashion throughout the century, interspersed with periods of a new",Paragraph
“modern” aesthetic that exploited the pure form created by the steel-frame and glass,Paragraph
"curtain wall. In addition to concerns for ornamentation, constant competition to create",Paragraph
taller structures not only demonstrated the desire of patrons and architects to physically,Paragraph
outdo one another in creating a landmark structure but also reflected changing economic,Paragraph
"conditions and building patterns within particular cities. Importantly, not every",Paragraph
"skyscraper was constructed in an attempt to outdo its neighbor, and not every high-rise",Paragraph
building exhibited innovation. Critically successful structures in terms of aesthetics were,Paragraph
"also not always profitable. Mitigating factors such as material and technical innovation,",Paragraph
"zoning regulations, economic climate, and the client’s purpose for construction affected",Paragraph
the skyscraper’s success as much as the designer or engineer did.,Paragraph
"In the 19th century, the earliest high-rise buildings tended to simply be mere",Paragraph
"enlargements of traditional forms, such as the tower, progressively adding stories and",Paragraph
increasing height without adequately addressing the aesthetic of a tall structure.,Paragraph
"Designers such as Louis Sullivan, John Wellborn Root, and George B. Post eventually",Paragraph
"tackled this problem, theoretically and in practice, by considering the nature of",Paragraph
skyscraper form itself as a new building type. When combined with advances in,Paragraph
"engineering and materials, the skyscraper thus became not only a monument to modern",Paragraph
"progress but also a symbolic link to the historical past, a past that the United States",Paragraph
"lacked and sought to evoke or, perhaps, to distance itself from.",Paragraph
Two perceived “schools” of skyscraper design embodied these purposes. The Chicago,Paragraph
"School, with its emphasis on structural rationality and economy, personified what was",Paragraph
"new about skyscraper design in the United States, breaking from historical ornament or",Paragraph
form. Speculative commercial construction thrived in Chicago after the devastating fire,Paragraph
"of 1871 and dictated a simpler, more cost-effective method of exterior articulation as well",Paragraph
"as making the best use of available land for office space. On the other hand, in New",Paragraph
"York, corporate commissions had always demanded more ornamentation and more",Paragraph
"historical references, all in an attempt to present a landmark structure that would elevate",Paragraph
and promote its occupants. Businesses such as insurance companies and newspapers,Paragraph
employed elaborate styles that not only were self-promoting but also galvanized civic,Paragraph
pride.,Paragraph
Although the Chicago School made an indelible impression on many American cities,Paragraph
"and especially on European modernists, it was the Beaux-Arts-inspired style popular in",Paragraph
"New York that dominated skyscraper construction as the 20th century dawned. Ironically,",Paragraph
"the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, with its gleaming White City",Paragraph
"image personifying monumentality and strength, prompted this classical interest and,",Paragraph
"according to Louis Sullivan, set back architectural design by decades. Like the great",Paragraph
"mercantile princes of the Italian Renaissance, businessmen turned to Beaux-Arts-trained",Paragraph
"or-inspired architects to construct buildings that, by appropriating a classicized style,",Paragraph
"implied power and respectability. Not surprisingly, the most popular high-rise design",Paragraph
"firm at the beginning of the century was D.H.Burnham and Company, founded by the",Paragraph
"man responsible for the plan of the White City. Its successor firm, Graham, Anderson,",Paragraph

"the architecture schools in which they taught, such as at Harvard University, the",Paragraph
"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Armour Institute of Technology (later the",Paragraph
Illinois Institute of Technology). A full rethinking of the skyscraper began by which its,Paragraph
external form became expressive of its internal functions and the structure’s form and,Paragraph
materials became the ornamentation. The earliest expression of this new aesthetic was,Paragraph
George Howe and William Lescaze’s Philadelphia Savings Fund Society Building (1932),Caption
"in Philadelphia, with its elevator core pulled out at the back of the building and its glass",Paragraph
"curtain wall, steel-framed office tower cantilevered above the entrance block. Traditional",Caption
"materials, such as polished granite, brick, and limestone, were used, but the look was",Paragraph
entirely new and not necessarily welcomed by the architectural establishment.,Paragraph
"Nevertheless, the International Style had taken root and continued to strengthen through",Paragraph
midcentury.,Paragraph
"Modernism, as preached by Mies van der Rohe, was a reductive architecture with a",Paragraph
strong underlying classical sensibility. Mies’s maxim “Less is more” personified his,Paragraph
belief that pure austere form should serve as all the necessary decoration. His Lake Shore,Paragraph
"Drive Apartments (1952) in Chicago, although not a commercial but a residential",Paragraph
"venture, demonstrated his tenets for high-rise construction. The black-painted",Paragraph
prefabricated steel-frame and clear-glass windows simply encased the interior space,Paragraph
"without expressing internal function. There is no projecting cornice, no grand entrance,",Paragraph
and no elements characteristic of the typical tripartite skyscraper design. He would repeat,Paragraph
"this formula in the corporate Seagram Building (1958) in New York, done with Philip",Paragraph
"Johnson, and in numerous commercial, residential, educational, and other high-rise",Paragraph
designs.,Paragraph
"Designers who came in contact with Mies, affected by his commanding personality and",Paragraph
"strength of convictions, embraced his tenets and adopted them in their own",Paragraph
"interpretations of the Miesian glass box. For example, Eero Saarinen’s CBS Building",Paragraph
"(1965) in New York took a more sculptural approach to modernism, as the vertical",Paragraph
granite piers projected out from the wall surface and all sense of human reference in scale,Paragraph
was denied through the building’s abstraction. The structure startlingly isolated itself,Paragraph
"from its environment yet worked well as pure design. However, not all designers were as",Paragraph
"talented as Saarinen was, and in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, cities, towns, and college",Paragraph
campuses were polluted with poorly constructed and downright ugly Miesian copies gone,Paragraph
awry.,Paragraph
"The most successful Miesian-inspired firm was Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. Their",Paragraph
"early masterpiece, Lever House (1952) in New York, designed by Gordon Bunshaft,",Paragraph
"celebrated light and openness, revealing a significant influence of Le Corbusier as well,",Paragraph
"with the pilotis, or stilts, raising the main office tower off the humanly oriented space",Paragraph
"below. Eventually, the firm developed a more sculptural version of Miesian-inspired",Paragraph
"modernism, as visible in the John Hancock Building (1970) in Chicago, with its structural",Paragraph
yet decorative external cross bracing and tapered form.,Paragraph
"Their next major commission, the unsatisfying Sears Building (1974) in Chicago, fell",Paragraph
"victim to the ever-present corporate need to construct physically dominating, out-of-scale",Paragraph
"skyscrapers. At 1454 feet and 110 stories, the Sears Building became the tallest building",Paragraph
"in the world, yet its bundled setbacks, when combined with the Miesian aesthetic,",Paragraph
resulted in a very bland structure. Minoru Yamasaki’s 1350-foot-tall World Trade Center,Paragraph
"(1976) in New York had no more success, as its twin towers (which thankfully played off",Paragraph
"each other) appeared ready to capsize Manhattan, perched as they were on the edge of the",Paragraph
"island. Cesar Pelli’s Petrona Towers (1998) in Kuala Lumpur, at 1483 feet, finally topped",Paragraph
the massive heights attained by both these structures.,Paragraph
Not all architects or critics appreciated the International Style and modernism as,Paragraph
"preached by architects such as Mies van der Rohe and Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.",Paragraph
"The International Style could be, just as the term implied, a form used in any location",Paragraph
because it had no cultural or historical ornamentation that would affect its contextual use.,Paragraph
Frank Lloyd Wright in particular railed against “soulless” architecture that neglected,Paragraph
cultural context or interaction with its direct urban environment. Concerned as he was for,Paragraph
"“small-town” development, Wright rarely attempted skyscraper design, and when he did,",Paragraph
"it was usually undersized, such as the 15-story Price Tower (1955) in Bartlesville,",Paragraph
Oklahoma. Only once did Wright attempt the stratospheric proportions popular with,Paragraph
"corporate patrons: his 1956 project for a Mile High Skyscraper for Chicago, a soaring",Paragraph
"structure that was as impractical then as it is today. In his scheme, the skyscraper was not",Paragraph
"placed in competition with other high-rise buildings in an urban environment; rather, it",Paragraph
"rose isolated in the countryside. Ironically, Wright’s vision of the dominance of suburban",Paragraph
America was to become a reality as people increasingly migrated from the city center to,Paragraph
suburban developments in the post-World War II era.,Paragraph
"Business interests moved with them. Increasingly, corporate headquarters took the",Paragraph
"form of low, sprawling structures with green lawns and miles of employee parking lots.",Paragraph
"The trademark corporate skyscraper was increasingly becoming a thing of the past, yet",Paragraph
those that did stay and built in the cities understood the need to contextualize their,Paragraph
"presence. Thus, the stark, crisp modernism of Hugh Stubbins Associates’ Citicorp Center",Paragraph
(1978) in New York and I.M.Pei and Henry Cobb’s John Hancock Tower (1975) in,Paragraph
Boston increasingly battled a Postmodernism aesthetic that reintroduced historicism and,Paragraph
"context. Plazas, gardens, and other public spaces became an important aspect of the",Paragraph
"design, as much as the buildings’ materials, ornamentation, and form.",Paragraph
"Begun in 1978, many consider Johnson and Burgee’s AT&T Building (1984) in New",Paragraph
"York the first Postmodern skyscraper, with its broken pediment (Chippendale-like)} top",Paragraph
"and emphasis on its pink-granite stone walls. The reintroduction of rich, colorful",Paragraph
materials as well as the appropriation of a wide variety of historical forms characterized,Paragraph
"Postmodern design. It could be playful and fun, such as Michael Graves’s Portland",Paragraph
"Building (1982) in Portland, Oregon, with its miniature Acropolis on top, demonstrating",Paragraph
not only the abstract way in which history could be referenced but also the new emphasis,Paragraph
on the skyscraper top lost during the modernist years. Postmodernism could also be,Paragraph
"elegant and austere, as represented by the work of Kohn Pedersen Fox, arguably the most",Paragraph
"successful skyscraper design firm of the late 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Their 333 Wacker",Paragraph
Drive (1983) in Chicago responded to its site and surrounding environs with its curving,Paragraph
green-glass curtain wall and specific design elements that alluded to nearby landmarks.,Paragraph
"By attempting to integrate their buildings firmly into the urban environment,",Paragraph
Postmodern architects brought back an appreciation for historicism and traditional,Paragraph
materials that modernists had rejected in favor of pursuing pure form and modern,Paragraph
materials. Both “schools” continued to exist at the end of the century and adapted to,Paragraph
"changing client needs, particularly in the 1980s, when skyscrapers increasingly became",Paragraph
part of larger urban development plans with a wide variety of buildings clustered,Paragraph
"together. This usage differed from the traditional isolating nature of the skyscraper,",Paragraph
"which, whether corporate commission or speculative investment, had historically been",Paragraph
multiuse structures themselves. They not only provided company headquarters but also,Paragraph
"housed financial institutions, retail establishments, offices for professionals, and",Paragraph
residential units. Now those roles were being delegated to individual components within,Paragraph
the greater complex.,Paragraph
The slanted focus on American skyscrapers during the 20th century accurately reflects,Paragraph
"where the most significant construction and designs were occurring, a situation that did",Paragraph
change during the century’s final two decades. Thriving economic markets in oil-rich,Paragraph
Middle Eastern countries in the 1980s and in Pacific Rim countries during the 1990s led,Paragraph
to a boom market in high-rise construction in those areas. Europe additionally presented,Paragraph
"increasing skyscraper opportunities for builders, particularly in Germany and other",Paragraph
"former Soviet-bloc countries after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the USSR. Still,",Paragraph
clients in these countries turned primarily to American architectural firms such as,Paragraph
"Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (National Commercial Bank, 1984, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia),",Caption
"I.M.Pei (Bank of China Tower, 1989, Hong Kong), Kohn Pedersen Fox (Westendstrasse",Caption
"1/DB Bank Headquarters, 1993, Frankfurt), and Cesar Pelli.",Caption
"It can be argued that in the 20th century, architects explored the full range of aesthetic,",Paragraph
"stylistic, material, and structural possibilities for the skyscraper form. The design tastes",Paragraph
and innovations that dominated the earliest high-rise buildings in the 19th century either,Paragraph
mutated into various expressions of historicism or evolved into pure form with the aid of,Paragraph
"European modernists. However, understanding these factors provides only a fraction of",Paragraph
the skyscraper story. More specific studies of the economic and business climates of,Paragraph
"individual cities, particularly beyond Chicago and New York, and how that affected",Paragraph

"SMITH, CHLOETHIEL WOODARD 1910-92",Title
"Architect and urban planner, United States",Caption
"In her designs, Chloethiel Woodard Smith strove to combine functionalism and",Paragraph
aesthetics. Her concerns with “quality over quantity” and “improving the collective,Paragraph
"neglect,” as she described her goals, were strongly influenced by Lewis Mumford and her",Paragraph
work for the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Smith met Mumford during her,Paragraph
undergraduate studies and corresponded with him until his 1990 death. After completing,Paragraph
"her M.Arch. in 1933, Smith spent two years working for different architectural firms",Paragraph
before accepting the position as chief of research at the FHA in 1935. She worked for that,Paragraph
"organization until 1939. Consequently, she spent most of her career in Washington, D.C.,",Paragraph
and was a significant force in shaping the American capitol in the 1950s and 1960s.,Paragraph
"Her projects in Washington include the E Street Expressway, office buildings, and",Paragraph
residential communities. Smith managed the unequaled feat of securing commissions,Paragraph
from three different developers to build three of the four office buildings at a prominent,Paragraph
intersection in a major American city: the corner of Connecticut Avenue and L Street in,Paragraph
"Washington, D.C. Although they are competent modernist designs, the three corporate",Paragraph
"structures at Chloethiel’s corner, as it is affectionately known, do not reflect Smith’s best",Paragraph
work. Her most inspired designs and those for which she is best known are her residential,Paragraph
communities. Among these are two that helped to revive southwest Washington: Capitol,Paragraph
Park and Harbour Square.,Paragraph
Both Capitol Park and Harbour Square reflect Smith’s determination to “add,Paragraph
"something more” to the urban environment through the use of varied designs,",Paragraph
"landscaping, control of automobile traffic, and providing support facilities instead of",Paragraph
"adhering to stylistic dogma. In Capitol Park (1965-67), designed in partnership with",Paragraph
"Nicholas Satterlee, Smith characteristically relied on landscaping and miniparks to",Paragraph
connect the different building types to one another and their surroundings. The changes,Paragraph
of scale within both the landscaping and the structures—five Le Corbusian high-rise,Paragraph
apartment buildings and wood-framed townhouses—provide diversity within unity. To,Paragraph
"further avoid monotony, the facades of the high-rises are varied, and the exteriors of the",Paragraph
townhouses are painted in different pastel colors. In order to accommodate the different,Paragraph
"types of housing, streets are not laid out along a grid pattern. They are arranged to allow",Paragraph
easy access to the housing. The automobile is accommodated yet does not determine the,Paragraph
"plan. Smith also provided quality-of-life facilities, such as laundries and swimming pools.",Paragraph
A 1964 promotional brochure for Capitol Park described it as “The New Town in the,Paragraph
City.” “New Town” was the phrase that Smith preferred for her urban-renewal projects,Paragraph
such as Capitol Park.,Paragraph
"Therefore, “New Town” was applied also to the 1966 Harbour Square development by",Paragraph
Chloethiel Woodard Smith and Associates. Although similar support services were,Paragraph
"included, at Harbour Square Smith’s approach to the integration of contemporary and",Paragraph
traditional forms was different from the one she utilized in Capitol Park. Seven historic,Paragraph
houses from the 1770s were incorporated into a row of new townhouses. These are,Paragraph
balanced by high-rise apartment blocks. Smith placed all the new buildings on the ground,Paragraph
to relate them to the historic structures. Automobiles are not allowed into Harbour,Paragraph
"Square, although access to the underground parking is convenient. Variety is provided",Paragraph
"through the use of different building types, courtyards, and landscaping. In Harbour",Paragraph
"Square, Smith again made the new development compatible with its surroundings by",Paragraph
respecting the historic fabric and strategic landscaping.,Paragraph
"Smith’s innovative approach to the use of historic forms, her insistence that support",Paragraph
"services be included, and the automobile corralled contributed to the success of LaClede",Paragraph
"Township (1966-67) in St. Louis. In this federal housing project, two-and three-story",Paragraph
wood-frame houses are arranged along streets accentuated by traffic circles. Although,Paragraph
Smith was strongly criticized for designing a housing project closely resembling the,Paragraph
"clutter of buildings that had been cleared for it, LaClede Town was truly an urban-",Paragraph
"renewal project, unlike Capitol Park and Harbour Square, which were urban-removal",Paragraph
"projects. LaClede demonstrates Smith’s belief it is possible to provide affordable, quality,",Paragraph
"and pleasing housing despite the residents’ income levels. As such, LaClede stands in",Paragraph
"direct contrast to the purely modernist design of another St. Louis housing project, Pruitt",Paragraph
"Igoe, by Minoru Yamasaki, which was completed in 1954 and demolished in 1972.",Paragraph
"Furthermore, in her reliance on traditional housing forms at LaClede, Smith was",Paragraph
"anticipating such New Urbanist towns as Seaside and Celebration, albeit for completely",Paragraph
"different residents. She understood that well-designed and well-built homes, support",Paragraph
"facilities such as the delicatessen, art gallery, and controversial pub, and links to the",Paragraph
surrounding areas are more capable than high mortgages of instilling community pride.,Paragraph
"At LaClede, Smith strongly demonstrated well-designed public housing could provide a",Paragraph
positive environment while meeting government regulations.,Paragraph
Smith’s belief that good design resulted from many factors and not simple adherence to,Paragraph
"stylistic dogma manifested itself early in her career. For example, in 1939 she organized",Paragraph
"the exhibition “Washington, The Planned City without a Plan,” in which she criticized",Paragraph
the Washington Planning Commission for continuing to follow the L’Enfant and,Paragraph
McMillan plans. She advocated that these plans were outdated and unable to meet the,Paragraph
needs of a modern city. Her criticism was so shocking that the Washington chapter of the,Paragraph
American Institute of Architects (AIA) Retracted its sponsorship. Less problematic were,Paragraph
her articles about the spread of the International Style to South America. Instead of,Paragraph
"belittling South American architects for importing the European style, she discussed the",Paragraph
positive aspects of South American modernism within its sociopolitical context.,Paragraph
These articles constitute one aspect of her international career. Although the majority,Paragraph
"of Smith’s career was spent in Washington, she also lived and worked in Canada and",Paragraph
Bolivia. Her familiarity with South America and her responsiveness to local conditions,Paragraph
were instrumental in securing the commission for the American Embassy Chancery and,Paragraph
"Residence (1959) in Asuncion, Paraguay.",Caption
"Smith’s international projects were well received, but her most critically acclaimed",Paragraph
work was in the United States. She included the American Embassy in Paraguay and,Paragraph
Capitol Park among her most successful designs and surprisingly did not list LaClede,Paragraph
Town. It is difficult to understand by what criteria an architect judges her own work. As,Paragraph
"early as 1960, Smith’s colleagues gave their approval by electing her a fellow to the AIA.",Paragraph
Her colleagues were expressing their confidence in her unflinching commitment to good,Paragraph
"architecture and urban planning. They would not be disappointed. In 1960, Smith was",Paragraph
"slightly past the midpoint of her 49-year career, and her best work was yet to come.",Paragraph

"sensitively contextualized, and the housing at Robin Hood Gardens (1970), sandwiched",Paragraph
between highways in the east end of London and itself a fragment of their influential,Paragraph
competition project for Golden Lane (1952).,Paragraph
A number of competition entries from the early 1950s established the Smithsons,Paragraph
among a new avant-garde of architects eager to transcend the limits of the International,Paragraph
Style without betraying the rationality and rigor of modernist principles. The Smithsons’s,Paragraph
"solution was radical although contradictory: on the one hand, their work made reference",Paragraph
"to anthropological patterns of human association and settlement, and on the other,",Paragraph
advocated the embrace of new industrial technologies.,Paragraph
The Smithsons’ involvement with a movement of British Pop artists known as the,Paragraph
Independent Group at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) provided an opportunity,Paragraph
"to present their work to an audience of avant-garde artists, curators, critics, theorists, and",Paragraph
"other architects. The multimedia exhibitions “A Parallel of Life and Art” (ICA, 1953) and",Paragraph
"“This is Tomorrow” (Whitechapel Gallery, 1956) included the Smithsons’ work. The",Paragraph
"latter included a primitive hut surrounded by a sand-covered protected territory,",Paragraph
"accompanied by a symbolic collection of relics, or “found objects’—reminders of human",Paragraph
activity as well as machine-age technologies. The concept of the house as the focus of,Paragraph
post-war domesticity and commodity fetishism provided the theme for the Smithsons’,Paragraph
“House of the Future” entry constructed for the Ideal Homes Exhibition in London,Caption
"(1956). The Smithsons organic styling and built-in furniture, using molded plastic and",Paragraph
"fiberglass construction, produced a startling contrast to the traditional brick-and-timber",Paragraph
palette of the prevailing residential architecture.,Paragraph
Other projects diverted from the individualism of the home to consider large-scale,Paragraph
"movement patterns in city centers. Like Golden Lane, the Smithsons’ project for the",Paragraph
Sheffield University competition (1953) used pedestrian circulation as its major ordering,Paragraph
"device. This strategy was extrapolated in the Berlin Haupstadt competition (1958), in",Paragraph
which an elevated pedestrian network bridges the existing roadways. This project,Paragraph
"represented the desire to imagine a new scale of urban architecture, one more suited to",Paragraph
the increased speed of movement and the loss of engagement between inhabitants and,Paragraph
their immediate surroundings. These goals dovetailed with the work and concerns of,Paragraph
"Team X, a group that included other European architects such as Ralph Erskine,",Paragraph
"Giancarlo di Carlo, and Aldo van Eyck. As editor of the Team X Primer (published",Paragraph
"initially in Architectural Design in 1962), Alison Smithson articulated statements of",Paragraph
theory alongside diagrams and drawings of architectural projects that analyzed the crucial,Paragraph
"nature of architectural context and the continuity of historic living patterns. Nonetheless,",Paragraph
"the Primer illustrates proposals, such as the London Roads Study (1959), that appear to",Paragraph
disregard existing buildings and topographies.,Paragraph
"By the 1970s, a shift in the Smithsons’s work acknowledged these earlier",Paragraph
"contradictions, most clearly manifest in the campus buildings at the University of Bath.",Paragraph
The Smithsons defined the Bath architecture as Team X structures—through what they,Paragraph
termed “mat-building’—with blocks arranged along a raised pedestrian deck above a,Paragraph
ground-level service road. The inherent incompleteness of this extendable structure,Paragraph
"provided a challenge to the Smithsons’s sensibility, demanding that they create at least a",Paragraph
suggestion of stability and closure to an otherwise infinite system. The Bath buildings,Caption
presented new themes not previously seen in their built work: the notion of,Paragraph
"“conglomerate ordering,” referring to volumetric masses wrapped in a unifying skin; the",Paragraph
"building as “climate register,” expressing its relation to the external environment; the",Paragraph
concern for the sensory pleasure to be gained from concrete materials; and the sensitivity,Paragraph
"to inhabitation, making the building exquisitely appropriate to its function. All these",Paragraph

"The SSK project, instead of concentrating in one singular block, diffused the program",Paragraph

SOLAR ARCHITECTURE,Title
The technique of passive solar design—the direct use of solar energy to provide heat and,Paragraph
light in buildings—has a long history in building design. Its evolution during the 20th,Paragraph
century began as a reaction to what Reyner Banham (1969) subsequently termed “a dark,Paragraph
"satanic century.” Rapid urbanization during the 19th century brought with it polluted,",Paragraph
"unsanitary, and over-crowded conditions to the large industrial cities of Europe and North",Paragraph
"America. In England, as epidemics of disease threatened entire urban populations, liberal",Paragraph
reformers reacted against a laissez-faire attitude to city development and instead,Paragraph
promoted hygiene and sanitation as the founding principles of healthy urban planning.,Paragraph
"By the beginning of the 20th century, the bactericidal properties of direct sunlight had",Paragraph
"been established, and countries such as England and Germany enacted laws ensuring sun",Paragraph
"rights for all citizens. In England, architects such as Raymond Unwin (1863-1940) began",Paragraph
to systematically study solar geometry with the aim of maximizing solar access in and,Paragraph
around buildings.,Paragraph
"Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the health benefits of sunlight remained a strong",Paragraph
"influence in European urban planning and building design. In Germany, large residential",Paragraph
"complexes, such as Siemenstadt (1929) in Berlin, master planned by Walter Gropius",Paragraph
"(1883-1969), utilized the Zeilenbau (row house) form. This functional and land-efficient",Paragraph
"arrangement, influenced by the spirit of the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity),",Paragraph
consisted of high-density apartment blocks running north-south and set at precise,Paragraph
distances to maximize the penetration of sunlight from the east and west. The addition of,Paragraph
roof terraces or balconies provided further opportunities for occupants to soak up the sun.,Paragraph
"During the 1930s, in response to the harsh economic conditions of the interwar period,",Paragraph
"the emphasis in passive solar design moved away from daylighting alone. Saving fuel,",Paragraph
"particularly that used for winter heating, became a design priority. By 1933, the Swiss",Paragraph
solar community of Neubthl near Zurich consisted of rows of apartments oriented almost,Paragraph
"directly south with large areas of south-facing glazing to trap winter heat. However, as",Paragraph
"war loomed in Europe, the most significant developments in solar energy use for home",Paragraph
heating occurred in America.,Paragraph
Chicago-based architect George Fred Keck (1895-1980) had recognized the potential,Paragraph
"of passive solar heating while working on the highly glazed “House of Tomorrow,” built",Paragraph
"for the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. In 1940, following several years",Paragraph
"of experimentation with different passive solar configurations, Keck designed a house for",Paragraph
"Howard Sloan, a Chicago real estate developer. The detached house, situated in",Paragraph
"Glenview, Llinois, established what was to become the archetypal form of the passive",Paragraph
"solar house. All the necessary elements of the house—its walls, floors, roofs, and",Paragraph
windows—were arranged to maximize the benefits of solar energy in the form of heat,Paragraph
and daylight. The rectangular plan of the house was elongated along its eastwest axis and,Paragraph
arranged with the fully glazed living spaces facing directly south. Large monopitch roofs,Caption
overhung the glazing to intercept high-angle summer sun to prevent the house from,Paragraph
overheating in summer.,Paragraph
"In America, Keck’s designs received wide publicity, and the 1940s saw a growing",Paragraph
"market for energy-efficient, solar homes. This period also saw significant research and",Paragraph
development into passive solar design by a group of engineers at the Massachusetts,Paragraph
Institute of Technology who constructed and monitored a series of both passive and,Paragraph
"active solar homes. Despite these developments, by the 1950s a plentiful supply of cheap",Paragraph
fossil fuels diminished economic incentives for solar energy. In both domestic and,Paragraph
"commercial buildings, mechanical heating, cooling, and ventilation technologies had",Paragraph
"become widely established, further reducing demand for solar alternatives.",Paragraph
"During the 1960s and early 1970s, passive solar design enjoyed a limited rebirth",Paragraph
"inspired by two fundamental concerns. First, many had begun to question the",Paragraph
technological optimism of modernism and the International Style. Architects such as,Paragraph
Ralph Erskine (1914—-) began to draw on preindustrial and indigenous building,Paragraph
techniques as the basis of a climate-specific architecture that was both regionally and,Paragraph
"culturally appropriate. Second, a more overtly political environmental movement grew",Paragraph
critical of the social and environmental effects of industrial capitalism. By the early,Paragraph
"1970s, a number of autonomous cooperative communities, such as Arcosanti (1970) in",Paragraph
"Arizona and The Centre for Alternative Technology (1973) in Wales, had been",Paragraph
"established. For those environmentalists such as Steve Baer, who chose to live this",Paragraph
"alternative lifestyle, the development of independent and renewable energy from sources",Title
such as the sun was essential. Baer’s own house (1972) in New Mexico consisted of an,Paragraph
L-shaped organic cluster of 11 “Zomes” arranged to collect solar energy through large,Paragraph
areas of south-facing glazing and then store it as heat within the thermal mass of water-,Paragraph
"filled drums. At night, large insulated shutters were pulled up over the glass to retain",Paragraph
heat.,Paragraph
"By the late 1970s, passive solar design was no longer the sole preserve of",Paragraph
environmentalists. The oil crisis of 1973 had generated political concerns about the long-,Paragraph
term availability of fossil fuels and had resulted in widespread academic research into the,Paragraph
use of solar energy. A number of passive solar buildings were constructed on both sides,Paragraph
"of the Atlantic. During the 1980s, these concerns for energy efficiency were extended to",Paragraph
"global climate issues under the rubric of sustainability. In Europe, architects such as",Paragraph
Renzo Piano and Norman Foster and Partners began to utilize passive solar features in the,Paragraph
form of daylight and shading in order to naturally air-condition large-scale buildings.,Paragraph
"Among many, Norman Foster and Partners’ Commerzbank Headquarters (1997) in",Paragraph

"receiving a doctorate in architecture in 1946. From 1947 to 1948, he attended Taliesin",Paragraph
"West, Frank Lloyd Wright’s famous architecture studio. After practicing in southern Italy",Paragraph
"and Turin in the early 1950s, he emigrated with his wife, Carolyn Woods, to the United",Paragraph
States and settled in Arizona. Soleri devoted his life to the research of alternative urban,Paragraph
development. His chief interest was in cities as a framework in which to combine human,Paragraph
and natural resources and diversity of functions and events. This study moved him to,Paragraph
"explore a new concept, arcologies, environments that fused architecture and ecology.",Paragraph
His concern for the relationship between human-made objects and the earth is,Paragraph
"expressed in his early Dome house (1949) designed for Leonora Woods, his future",Paragraph
"mother-in-law. Located on a hillside at Cave Creek, Arizona, the house had retaining",Paragraph
"walls that were cast with red boulders and concrete, following Wright’s technique. Soleri",Paragraph
also explored thermal inertia resulting from a glazed dome above the living room and the,Paragraph
excavated areas underground. The dome can be shaded or opened according to the,Paragraph
seasons.,Paragraph
"In 1951, Soleri moved with his wife to southern Italy and began his explorations in",Paragraph
"ceramics. His first major building, a workshop for Ceramica Artistica Solimene (1953) in",Paragraph
"Vietri-sulmare, faces the Mediterranean on the Amalfi coast. It was built on reinforced",Paragraph
"concrete covered outside with pottery. Here, Soleri anticipates later explorations using",Paragraph
"materials from the area and relating engineering, site, and handicraft.",Paragraph
"After returning to the United States in 1955, Soleri began his project for Cosanti (from",Paragraph
"the Latin “before things”) on a five-acre site in Scottsdale, Arizona. The complex grew",Paragraph
according to the needs of the community and the experience gained in construction,Paragraph
"techniques. Soleri explored here the technique of wash-away silt casting, using it in",Paragraph
"construction of cast-concrete architectural buildings, wind-bells, sculptures, and models.",Paragraph
Cosanti consists of several units related with the site in an organic language of,Paragraph
"architectural form. The first structure was the Earth House (1956), inmersed in the site",Paragraph
after the land was excavated. The ceramic studio (1956) consisted of a structure of ribbed,Paragraph
"reinforced concrete. Other spaces are the Cosanti Gallery, with a vault formed in a",Paragraph
"mound; a series of working spaces with solar devices, the piscine and canopy; and the",Paragraph
"foundation offices (1971). As a comprehensive site, Cosanti provided an array of",Paragraph
"architectural prototypes. This was Soleri’s first experience relating craft, work, ecology,",Paragraph
and life in one complex.,Paragraph
Soleri’s chief aim was to keep the integrity of both the natural and the urban. He,Paragraph
needed a large-scale laboratory to research and develop his model for how to inhabit,Paragraph
cities in the future. To demonstrate how to improve urban conditions and to minimize the,Paragraph
"impact of destructive forces of suburbia on the environment, Soleri started Arcosanti in",Paragraph
"1971. Still in the process of construction, Arcosanti is located in Cordon Junction, 70",Caption
miles north of Phoenix in the mesa country. Soleri defines Arcosanti as an urban,Paragraph
"laboratory, an instrument for research meant to accommodate up to 7,000 people. Mostly",Paragraph
"pedestrian oriented, this prototype arcology project will eventually rise up to 25 stories,",Paragraph
covering only 13 acres and leaving open 860 acres.,Paragraph
"Arcosanti is composed of a series of public and semipublic areas, private zones, and",Paragraph
"utilities, most of which rely on passive energy. The East Crescend Complex is considered",Paragraph
"the essence of arcology, combining living and working spaces. These include the Colly",Paragraph
"Soleri Music Center (1989), a semipublic area dedicated to studios and diverse types of",Paragraph
"private housing. Arcosanti also has two greenhouses, gardens, a small vineyard, a field,",Paragraph
and an orchard.,Paragraph
"Over the last three decades, Arcosanti has been built by thousands of volunteers, all",Paragraph
sharing part of Soleri’s approach and visionary ideas about the environment. In this,Paragraph
"setting, workers share a communal way of life based on production of craft, agriculture,",Paragraph
and a healthy use and inhabitation of the land. Soleri calls this approach the ethic of the,Paragraph
urban and speaks of the culture of the automobile as the instrument of isolation and,Paragraph
"segmentation. In his view, our cities will require planners not only to change cities",Paragraph
"physically but also to change the habits and principles of human interaction. Presently,",Paragraph
"about 70 individuals live and work in Arcosanti. The community hosts a music festival,",Paragraph
"exhibits, lectures, and seminars. Arcosanti remains, essentially, a laboratory for multiuse",Paragraph

orientation.,Paragraph

"Architect, Spain",Title
Alejandro de la Sota is the maestro of many late 20th-century Spanish architects. On,Paragraph
"the one hand, he was an influential teacher at the school of architecture in Madrid from",Paragraph
"1956 to 1972. On the other, he was a master builder whose projects set an example to be",Paragraph
followed by his many disciples. It is unfortunate that his influence did not extend beyond,Paragraph
the boundaries of Spain. He was recognized internationally only in the 1980s. Born in the,Paragraph
"Galician region in the northwestern part of Spain in 1913, he graduated from the school",Paragraph
"of architecture at the Polytechnic of Madrid in 1941. From 1942 to 1949, he worked for a",Paragraph
"central government housing and relocation agency, creating a series of rural housing",Paragraph
developments for post-civil war Spain. Although the groupings relied on a rational plan,Paragraph
"and the repetition of forms, he adorned the houses with elements of vernacular",Paragraph
"architecture. With the exception of this first job, all his subsequent architecture was",Paragraph
"clearly modernist and characterized by its simplicity, rationalism, and abstract geometry.",Paragraph
"A follower of the Modern movement, de la Sota’s building always seemed understated,",Paragraph
"although his genius was ever present. De la Sota, who suffered from Parkinson’s disease",Paragraph
"in his final years, died in Madrid in 1996.",Paragraph
"In the buildings, projects, and furniture designs of de la Sota, the primary idea is",Paragraph
"paramount. The final design is the result of a process that eliminates, little by little,",Paragraph
"extraneous and unrefined aspects. In the end, what is left is pure, concentrated, but also",Paragraph
poetic. The generating idea of a project does not always come from the same source. In,Paragraph
"some cases, it may be the structure, the site, a technological aspect, or a programmatic",Paragraph
intention. Functional and technical concerns become the architectural language. The,Paragraph
"tectonic quality of the building is always present, as de la Sota’s works make constant",Paragraph
references to the materials of which they are constructed. Each project seems to start,Paragraph
fresh from the new situation at hand. Once de la Sota remarked that there is no reason to,Paragraph
do the same thing over and over again. He expressed the idea that each project should,Paragraph
present a new challenge and a new opportunity for exploration. De la Sota practiced,Paragraph
"architecture for about 50 years, maintaining an atelier type of approach. His body of",Paragraph
"work, both built and unbuilt projects, is part of the rich heritage of Spanish architecture of",Paragraph
the end of the 20th century.,Paragraph
"In 1955, a single-family house was built in Madrid on Doctor Arce Street. The site",Paragraph
exerted its influence on the final form. The required setbacks from the property lines,Paragraph
"encouraged a compact structure on the widest part of the side. The house, on a busy",Paragraph
"street, looks inward. The windows to the street facade are few and small. The facade",Paragraph
"toward the garden is the exact opposite, with its large windows creating a transparency",Paragraph
between interior and exterior. The entire house is made of brick with uneven surfaces that,Paragraph
"catch the changing natural light. The plan is simple; the staircase, with its gentle curve,",Paragraph
"seems to push out the exterior wall of the house, creating a bulge in the facade.",Paragraph
"The Civil Government Offices in Tarragona (1957), really the central government",Paragraph
"building in the province during Franco’s regime, shows clearly the architect’s evolving",Paragraph
"vocabulary. The building, for representation, administration, and housing, is the union of",Paragraph
"three blocks, each used for one purpose: The entrance is pushed underneath the main",Paragraph
"podium, which itself comprises the main government floors. The top of the podium forms",Paragraph
a terrace that dominates the square in front. It also creates a break between the building,Paragraph
used for government functions and the official residences located in the cube above. A,Paragraph
modular system of 18 by 18 feet is the underlying principle of the composition. The,Paragraph
residential cube is exactly three modules by three modules. The clear use of geometry,Paragraph
and the play between voids and solids call to mind Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe.,Paragraph
Terragni’s name also surfaces with a comparison made to the Casa del Fascio. The main,Paragraph
building material is cut and polished local marble.,Paragraph
The Maravillas Gymnasium (1965) had to respond to a very difficult site with limited,Paragraph
"financial resources. The narrow, trapezoidal site, about 90 feet wide, has a steep slope of",Paragraph
about 36 feet. The solution is one of fitting the building into the void and occupying the,Paragraph
entire site. An ingenious structural solution using 60-foot trusses set at right angles to the,Paragraph
"street span the gymnasium. On the upper level, the 18-foot spaces between the trusses are",Paragraph
"used for classrooms. Below is the gymnasium, with the benches on one side and light",Paragraph
from the windows above flowing into the other. The materials used are few and grant an,Paragraph
"idea of the thin skin enclosing the space, which becomes lighter and lighter as one goes",Paragraph
"up. At the lower level, the building faces a busy street and therefore has a rather closed",Paragraph
"facade at street level with brick. Higher up is glass, which seems to fold back and finally",Paragraph
"on top, surrounding the play space, is a wire fence.",Paragraph
"The Post Office and Telecommunications Building (1984) in Leon, Spain, can be",Paragraph
thought of as a functional building employing state-of-the-art technology. It is apparently,Paragraph
a simple cube that allows work to be carried out efficiently while admitting that changes,Paragraph
"in use can occur over time. The structure is simple, and the interior is filled with light.",Paragraph
The materials echo the intention of the building. It is clad in Robertson panels and uses,Paragraph
"glass, stainless steel, and straightforward fixtures.",Paragraph

"Architect, Portugal",Title
"Among the vanguard of modern Portuguese architects, Eduardo Souto de Moura",Paragraph
emerges from a recently revitalized architectural tradition that was singularly rich in the,Paragraph
"Renaissance and baroque periods. In the transition from the 15th to the 16th centuries,",Paragraph
"with astounding wealth accruing from a growing number of colonies, Portugal",Paragraph
"experienced a flourish of late Gothic building. This was the Manueline period, named for",Paragraph
"Manuel | (reigned 1495-1521) under whom colonies in southern Africa, the Indies, the",Paragraph
"Far East, and Brazil were discovered and settled. In the 18th century, with gold and",Paragraph
"diamonds flowing into the country from Brazil, the Portuguese baroque reached one of its",Paragraph
most intense periods.,Paragraph
"During most of the 20th century though, economically stagnant and politically",Paragraph
"authoritarian, the only “modern” construction of buildings in Portugal were scattered",Paragraph
examples of a neoclassical block-like fascist structures. The impetus for modernist,Paragraph
"architecture in the Portuguese-speaking world came not from Portugal but from Brazil,",Paragraph
primarily with the inauguration in 1960 of Brasilia. That futuristic capital’s signature,Paragraph
"structures, the presidential residence, the cathedral, the Congress, and the Foreign Office",Paragraph
"reflected the influence of Le Corbusier as interpreted with lyrical, tropical exuberance by",Paragraph
Lucio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer. Aesthetically Portugal itself only became free to,Paragraph
follow this style after the democratic revolution of 1974. Financially it only became,Paragraph
capable of supporting a significant increase in building after admission into the European,Paragraph
Union and the consequent growth of its economy.,Paragraph
Souto de Moura was born in the north of Portugal on 25 July 1952 in the country’s,Paragraph
"second-largest city, Porto (also referred to as Oporto). It was there from the Escola de",Paragraph
Belas Artes that in 1980 he received his degree in architecture. He forms the third,Paragraph
generation in the Portuguese architectural “School of Oporto.” This movement originated,Paragraph
"among young architects at the fine arts school in Porto during the decade of the 1960s,",Paragraph
the waning years of the Salazar dictatorship and its debilitating colonial wars in,Paragraph
"Portuguese Africa. The Atlantic harbor of Porto, lying on the Douro River, is generally",Paragraph
"known to the outside world for the port wine named after it, which originates from the",Paragraph
"vineyards in the valley of the Douro. To those who live in Porto, however, the city is",Paragraph
"known for the industriousness of its small businessmen, merchants, and manufacturers.",Paragraph
"With the post-World War Il growth of European and coastal Atlantic trade, its",Paragraph
metropolitan area expanded to half a million people. This growth required much new,Paragraph
construction together with significant remodeling of older buildings. Responding to these,Paragraph
building and design needs were Portuguese architects trained in the School of Oporto.,Paragraph
"The school began with the ideas of Fernando Tavora (1923—), seeking in the late 1950s",Paragraph
for a modernist building style that was socially responsible and allowed economy in the,Paragraph
use of basic forms and materials. This led him to minimalism and Alvar Aalto’s concepts,Paragraph
regarding discrete yet organically integrated construction elements. The great disciple of,Paragraph
"Tavora was Alvaro Siza Vieira (1933-), whose purist poetic style won him the 1992",Paragraph
Pritzker architecture award. One of the leading students and longtime colleagues of Siza,Paragraph
Vieira has been Souto de Moura.,Paragraph
"Like his predecessors, much of Souto de Moura’s work has been in Porto and cities in",Paragraph
"the north of Portugal, particularly Braga and Evora. Throughout most of his career he has",Paragraph
"designed houses, among his most famous works, and commercial spaces. He has also",Paragraph
done extensive restoration of historic and domestic structures. He has taught in Zurich,Paragraph
"and Lausanne, and beginning in the late 1980s his work assumed a more international",Paragraph
"projection, especially in Italy.",Paragraph
"In Porto he has built or restored numerous houses and apartments, medical buildings, a",Paragraph
"library, a museum, and a customs building. Possessing his own minimalist style, the",Paragraph
effectiveness of his work is borne by a subtle juxtaposition of elementary building,Paragraph
"materials: stone, wood, glass, and metal. He incorporates these elements in structures",Paragraph
"whose dramatic weight is often conveyed in basic geometric shapes of rectangles,",Paragraph
"squares, cubes, cylinders, and circles.",Paragraph
Two important early works were the plan for the city market in Braga (1980-84) and,Paragraph
the “Casa das Artes” cultural center in Porto (1981-91). The city of Braga has now,Paragraph
"outgrown the former, and he is redesigning the area as a complex of shops and cafes. The",Paragraph
cultural center projected a striking model that concentrated the accumulated design,Paragraph
tradition of international modernism.,Paragraph
"Most significant, though, was a small weekend home built in the Algarve (1984-89), in",Paragraph
the south of Portugal. Its all-white elements presented a subdued profile of long,Paragraph
"rectangular walls over which hovered the low silhouette of a dome and, varying with the",Paragraph
"angle of view, a triangle and cylinder. Occupying only one-fifth of the lot on which it",Paragraph
"lies, the structure establishes a balance of subdued tensions between itself and its setting.",Paragraph
Of further significance has been a series of residences he has built since the early,Paragraph
"1980s in Nevogilde, a developing seaside neighborhood of Porto. On more restricted",Paragraph
"terrains, these houses also have demonstrated a style achieved through balancing subdued",Paragraph
"forces of contrast in structure and environment. However, they furthermore demonstrate",Paragraph
"his command of interiors, a spare equilibrium of the elements of space and light, and a",Paragraph
"progressive integration of a spectrum of structural elements, stone, wood, and glass,",Paragraph
respecting principles of Mies van der Rohe. In Braga he built (1989-94) a two-story,Paragraph
house that strikingly balances a stone environment on the lower floor with a glass one on,Paragraph
the upper.,Paragraph
Among his more recent and significant challenges have been designing a civic center,Paragraph
"in Sicily, converting a monastery into a country inn, and redesigning the customs center",Paragraph
"of Porto. He has received numerous awards and honors in Portugal and abroad, including",Paragraph
an Italian one for his use of stone. In 1998 he was the first architect to receive the coveted,Paragraph
"Portuguese cultural distinction, the Premio Pessoa. In the same year the Swiss-Italian city",Paragraph
"of Mendrisio mounted a retrospective exhibition of his work, emphasizing his skill for",Paragraph
balancing structures in terms of their component parts and their placement within an,Paragraph

SPACE FRAME,Title
"A distinctly 20th-century structural form, the space frame is a three-dimensional system",Paragraph
that transfers gravitational and lateral loads through a network of interconnected,Paragraph
"structural elements. In this efficient system, the load path is completely controlled,",Paragraph
utilizing mainly straight elements that are securely joined together to safely transfer,Paragraph
applied loads to other structural subsystems. The effectiveness of their structural form,Paragraph
"comes from three factors. First, unlike other structural forms where entire members are",Paragraph
"sized on the basis of maximum stresses that occur at singular points along their elements,",Paragraph
the peak stresses in lattice space structures are distributed more evenly through the use of,Paragraph
"members transferring mainly tension and compression forces and, as such, requiring",Paragraph
"smaller cross-sectional profiles. Second, the fact that they are highly indeterminate",Paragraph
structures causes stress redistribution in the event of one member or more failing during,Paragraph
the life expectancy of such frames. This fact allows for the increase in allowable design,Paragraph
"code stresses and leads to smaller members. Third, coupled with their structural",Paragraph
"efficiency, their simplified and repetitive assembly techniques afford them the versatility",Paragraph
"to take on either flat or curved forms, making them systems of choice for designers and",Paragraph
builders.,Paragraph
Space frames are seen as an evolutionary step in the eternal quest for building and,Paragraph
spanning more with less natural resources and increased cost-effectiveness. Earlier efforts,Paragraph
to construct lighter-weight structural forms included Schwedler’s fully triangulated,Paragraph
framed domes in 1863. Even the famed Dr. Alexander Graham Bell experimented with,Paragraph
"such spatial structural forms when, in 1907, he illustrated their effectiveness as structural",Paragraph
systems by building a tetrahedron-based frame that could be used for the construction of,Paragraph
"kites, airplanes, and building structures. In 1942, architect Charles Atwood developed the",Paragraph
"Unistrut system, consisting of steel elements bolted into a flat gusset plate to form a space",Paragraph
frame.,Paragraph
"However, the major innovation in space frames came about when Dr. Max",Paragraph
Mengeringhausen introduced his Mero system in 1943. His system gave birth to today’s,Paragraph
space frame technology. Consisting of up to 18 hollow steel tubes that can be screwed,Paragraph
"into a steel ball at the same time to form a single joint, the system simply and",Paragraph
expeditiously builds a huge network of solidly connected members to form a long span,Paragraph
structure.,Paragraph
"Later, during World War Il, the military realized the massproduction and",Paragraph
prefabrication potential of such systems and utilized them in such structures as radar,Paragraph
"domes. In the 1950s, designers such as Konrad Wachsmann were developing space frame",Paragraph
systems similar to the Mero. An example of Wachsmann’s tetrahedral tubular space,Paragraph
frame system is a U.S. Air Force hangar that measured 240 by 155 meters with a 50-,Paragraph
meter cantilevered roof extending in both directions. Buckminster Fuller also invented,Paragraph
geodesic domes known as “tensegrity” structures that became very popular optimal,Paragraph
building forms in the 1960s and 1970s and led to the publication of the do-it-yourself,Paragraph
books Domebook One and Domebook Two.,Paragraph
Expo ‘67 in Montreal featured space frame structures that opened the eyes of designers,Paragraph
and builders alike to the potential of such building forms. The 1970s witnessed an,Paragraph
"eruption of space frames being used for airplane hangars, huge roofing systems, and",Paragraph
"efficient building frames. The British Airways 01 hangar at Heathrow Airport, designed",Caption
"by professor Z.S.Makowski, is a primary example of large roofing construction. The",Paragraph

"aircraft. The Interfirst Bank Building (1981) in Dallas, Texas, designed by Skidmore,",Caption
"Owings and Merrill, is an example of the versatility in the form design of space frame,",Paragraph

The advent of faster and more accessible computational power to structural engineers,Paragraph
allowed for an explosion in the amount of shape complexity and design optimization of,Paragraph
"those structural forms. The Javits Convention Center (1987) in New York City, designed",Paragraph
"by I.M.Pei and Partners, is a primary example of how computer analyses allowed the",Paragraph
creation of such complex building shapes.,Paragraph
The attractive properties of high strength-to-weight ratios and considerable torsional,Paragraph
"stiffness did not escape the everwatchful eyes of the aerospace industry, which started",Paragraph
"utilizing the technology in their air-space frames. At the same time, the car",Paragraph
manufacturing industries began as early as the 1950s utilizing space frames in their high-,Paragraph
"performance car chassis. Today, Audi’s A8 luxury car uses a very sophisticated form of",Paragraph
aluminum space frame for its chassis. The frame was designed in concert with Alcoa and,Paragraph
"required 40 patents, ten years, and seven new aircraft aluminum alloys.",Paragraph
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration also invested for decades in space,Paragraph
frame research. The result is its U.S. Laboratory module for the International Space,Paragraph
Station currently under construction at the Marshall Space Flight Center station,Caption
"manufacturing facility in Huntsville, Alabama. However, perhaps the epitome of",Paragraph
computer and space frame construction technologies coming together is the Fremont,Paragraph
"Street Experience Light and Sound Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. A 90-foot-high steel",Caption
"space frame, completed in September 1995, provides a high-tech display canopy over a",Paragraph
"1,400-foot stretch of the Fremont Street and serves also as a spectacular foyer for existing",Paragraph
"casino and hotel resorts in the Las Vegas downtown district. The frame is arched, being 5",Paragraph
feet deep and 44 feet in curved radius. The inside of the canopy contains 2.1 million light,Paragraph
bulbs acting like television pixels and fully controlled by 21 computers generating,Paragraph
animated images perfectly syncopated to sound. The computer-generated light and sound,Paragraph
show is produced using concert-quality sound emanating from a system of 208 speakers,Paragraph
"capable of generating 540,000 watts. Unofficially, this space frame is considered to be",Paragraph
the world’s largest graphics display system.,Paragraph
"Today, there are tens of thousands of space frames all over the world. The future likely",Paragraph
will witness an even greater reliance on space frame construction for the simple reason,Paragraph
"that computer, materials, manufacturing, and construction technologies are constantly",Paragraph
"evolving and successfully thriving to reduce cost with improved products. As such, in the",Paragraph
"very near future, architects, structural designers, and builders will have the option of",Paragraph

much lower in weight than any of the currently conventional materials and methods.,Paragraph
Primary examples of such construction materials are fiber-reinforced plastic composites.,Paragraph
"Their industry is extremely prolific, and they are light-weight, corrosion resistant, and",Paragraph
ideal for tailoring their fiber orientations to optimally resist principal stresses induced,Paragraph

SPAIN,Title
Spanish architecture of the 20th century has exhibited a dynamic eclecticism that is,Paragraph
rooted in the country’s turbulent political history and in the persistent individualism of its,Paragraph
historically autonomous provinces. The Castilian capital of Madrid and the Catalonian,Paragraph
capital of Barcelona were the epicenters of the nation’s architectural achievement,Paragraph
"throughout much of the century, each having gained international recognition for both",Paragraph
their architecture schools and their architects of distinction.,Paragraph
"By the early 20th century, Barcelona’s dramatic population growth prompted city",Paragraph
officials to address its urban expansion through an international competition that was,Paragraph

free use of space and light as well as in its indebtedness to the Wagnerschule of Vienna.,Paragraph
Palacios’ role as a professor at the Escuela de Arquitectura de Madrid (ETSAM) and as,Paragraph
an academician of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando ensured his,Paragraph
impact on early 20th-century Madrilefio architecture; his brand of Beaux-Arts eclecticism,Paragraph

Architects remaining in Spain were disconnected from the world’s architectural,Paragraph

"At the beginning of the 20th century, St. Petersburg was in the midst of a transformation",Paragraph
of commercial and living space that had begun in the 1860s and would continue until,Paragraph
"World War I. Although the great imperial monuments remained standing, practically",Paragraph
everything around them was rebuilt during this period in an eclectic array of architectural,Paragraph
"styles, including the style moderne. The densely constructed St. Petersburg environment",Paragraph
consisted of buildings within a city plan that followed the straightedge wherever its,Paragraph
"deltaic terrain permitted. The city’s height restrictions, which limited most construction at",Paragraph
"five or six stories, also encouraged perspectival uniformity.",Paragraph
"In this setting, the plasticity of structure and material that characterized the style",Paragraph
moderne in Moscow frequently assumed a two-dimensional form that depended on the,Paragraph
texture and shaping of the facade of contiguous apartment buildings. Of the several,Paragraph
"hundred building projects undertaken in the city between 1898 and 1915, only a small",Paragraph
"fraction applied the new style in anything other than a fragmentary, decorative manner.",Paragraph
"There were, nonetheless, architects whose work defined a distinctive variant of the new",Paragraph
style known as the “Northern modeme.” Fedor Lidval (1870-1945) was the most,Paragraph
"productive among them, and his career ranged from the early moderne to the more",Paragraph
austere neoclassical revival. Lidval’s buildings—primarily large apartment houses and,Paragraph
banks—also illustrate the developing links between large construction projects and,Paragraph
private capital resources in St. Petersburg.,Paragraph
"Among other architects active in the apartment construction boom, the work of Aleksei",Paragraph
"Bubyr is notable for its original approach to structure as a sculpted, textured block. A",Paragraph
"1902 graduate of the Institute of Civil Engineering, Bubyr often collaborated with the",Paragraph
"architect Nikolai Vasilev, who also designed a number of large housing projects in St.",Paragraph
Petersburg. Yet Bubyr himself developed a distinctive interpretation of the rationalist side,Paragraph
"of the style moderne, with equal attention to aesthetics and engineering. In the latter area,",Paragraph
he was a pioneer in the use of reinforced concrete for the walls as well as the floor,Paragraph
"construction of apartment buildings, and this familiarity with new construction methods",Paragraph
is reflected in the free style of even his largest structures.,Paragraph
The apartment house that Bubyr built in 1910-12 on the Fontanka Quay (no. 159) is,Paragraph
"striking not only for its lack of ornamentation but also for its massive outline, looming",Paragraph
"above the largest of St. Petersburg’s canals. In constructing the facade, Bubyr resorted to",Paragraph
"the familiar device of unfinished granite on the lower surface, but only to the level of the",Paragraph
"first-floor window ledge. For the most part, the walls are covered with gray roughcast,",Paragraph
"yet the facade is framed by a top floor and corner bays of smooth, light stucco that",Paragraph
produce a clarity of line and a bright exterior. Bubyr emphasized the tectonic character of,Paragraph
the building with multistoried window bays that define the vertical lines of the facade and,Paragraph
at the same time provide more light for the main rooms of each apartment. The upper,Paragraph
"stories culminate in a complex line, beginning as a mansard roof with low, narrow",Paragraph
"dormers (in effect, a seventh story) and rising at the corners to high gables and a series of",Paragraph
pyramidal forms covered by ceramic roofing tiles.,Caption
The style moderne also appeared in the design of public buildings for banking and,Paragraph
commerce. The most notable landmark of early 20th-century commercial architecture is,Paragraph
"the headquarters of the Singer Sewing Machine Company (1902-04), at the corner of",Paragraph
"Nevskii Prospekt and the Catherine Canal. Its architect, Pavel Siuzor (1844—c.1919), had",Paragraph
established a career remarkable not only for prodigious output (some 100 original,Paragraph
"projects and reconstructions, of which more than 60 are extant) but also for its success in",Paragraph
adapting to stylistic and technical innovations. Among the technical advances in the,Paragraph
"Singer Building is the use of something approaching a skeletal structural system,",Paragraph
although not the steel frame of the type widely used in the United States. The exterior,Paragraph
"facades are supported with a ferroconcrete and brick frame, and the interior floors (also",Paragraph
reinforced concrete) rest on iron columns. By surfacing the arcade of the first two floors,Paragraph
"with rusticated blocks of polished red granite and using a lighter, gray granite for the",Paragraph
"upper stories, Siuzor created a visual base for the structure, which rises in granite-",Paragraph
surfaced piers and glass window shafts that extend from the third to the sixth floor in a,Caption
secondary arcade pattern. The culminating element of the building is the elongated metal-,Paragraph
"ribbed and glass cupola, which could be illuminated to advertise the Singer logo.",Caption
By 1910 the style moderne had yielded to various modernized forms inspired by,Paragraph
"assical and Renaissance motifs, such as the Azov-Don Bank (1908-09) and the Hotel",Paragraph
"Astoria (1911-12), both by Fedor Lidval; the Mertens Building (1922-12) by Marian",Paragraph

"conceived of an enormous apartment development known as New Petersburg (1911-12),",Paragraph

"products had been used extensively in building, especially in the 19th century, but were",Paragraph
largely superseded by the beginning of the 20th century by hot-rolled steel members. The,Paragraph

"STEINER HOUSE, VIENNA",Caption
"Designed by Adolf Loos; completed 1910 Vienna, Austria",Caption
The Steiner House is among the best known of Adolf Loos’s early residential works.,Paragraph
"Loos designed the house in early 1910, at the same time he was working on the even",Paragraph
"more controversial Michaelerplatz Building, and the two projects bear a certain kinship",Paragraph
despite their programmatic differences. Both works followed immediately in the wake of,Paragraph
"Loos’s famed address, “Ornament und Verbrechen” (Omament and Crime), first",Paragraph
"delivered in January of the same year, and as a result, they may be understood as",Paragraph
"exemplars of the antiornamental ideas he laid out in the talk. The Steiner House,",Paragraph
"however, which was completed by the end of 1910, more than a half year before the",Paragraph
"much-discussed Michaelerplatz Building, initially drew little public notice, no doubt in",Paragraph
large measure because it was a private domicile in an inconspicuous residential,Paragraph
neighborhood.,Paragraph
"The clients, wealthy textile manufacturer Hugo Steiner and his wife, Lily, a graphic",Paragraph
"artist and painter, subsequently commissioned Loos to design the interiors of their elegant",Paragraph
"Knize tailor shops in Vienna, Paris, and Berlin. The house itself, by contrast, is rather",Paragraph
modest in terms of both its scale and its detailing. The freestanding structure is roughly,Paragraph
"square in plan (13.5 by 14.5 meters). Seen from the front, it appears to consist of a single",Paragraph
"story with a high attic. In fact, the house has three stories, which are clearly visible from",Paragraph
"the rear garden. The most distinctive feature of the building, the curving sheet-metal roof,",Paragraph
"was Loos’ reply to the local building codes, which required that the streetfronts of houses",Paragraph
"in the area be no more than one story, with a second-story mansard. Loos maximized the",Paragraph
space by concealing not one but two stories in the attic and connecting the half-barrel,Paragraph
vault in the front to a flat concrete roof covering the rear two-thirds of the structure. The,Paragraph
"resulting configuration, despite its somewhat peculiar profile, allowed Loos to make use",Paragraph
of nearly the entire interior volume.,Paragraph
"The front and rear facades of the house are symmetrically arranged, although the",Paragraph
"windows and doors have varying formats and dimensions. By contrast, the fenestration",Paragraph
"pattern on the two sides is irregular, and on the southeastern side is a projecting bay",Paragraph
topped by a small balcony accessible from the second story. Unlike Loos’ later residential,Paragraph
"works, with their complex interlocking volumes, the regular horizontal layering of the",Paragraph
"floors is maintained, but the rooms on the three levels are of different heights: the ceilings",Paragraph
"on the ground floor are 2.85 meters, those on the second floor 3 meters, and those on the",Paragraph
"uppermost floor 2.10 meters. The ground floor contains a large vestibule, a kitchen, and",Caption
"an adjoining living and dining room, which extend the length of the house’s rear. On the",Caption
"second story were originally two bedrooms, a servant’s room, a small children’s room,",Paragraph
"and a studio for Lily Steiner (facing out to the street), and the third floor was taken up",Paragraph
"with a laundry room and other service spaces. In addition, the house also has a basement,",Paragraph
"which at the time of its completion housed a garage, another servant’s room, a furnace",Paragraph
"room, and a coal storage space. As in all of Loos’ residences, there is a clear distinction",Paragraph
between the public and private domains and between the served and serving spaces. The,Paragraph
"principal living areas and the bedroom above are linked with a stair, but there is a second",Paragraph
spiral staircase to allow the servants access to all four floors.,Caption
"The original interior detailing was remarkably simple, combining white walls, dark-",Paragraph
"stained oak wainscoting, and beamed ceilings on the ground floor and painted white",Caption
wainscoting and floral wallpaper in the upstairs bedrooms. A number of the rooms were,Paragraph
also originally furnished with both built-in and free-standing furniture of Loos’ own,Paragraph
"design, including chairs, benches, stools, and a buffet. In contrast to the exterior, with its",Paragraph
"associations to the Mediterranean vernacular, the interior evoked an air of contemporary",Paragraph
"Anglo-Saxon domesticity, a feel-ing that was further enhanced by the flowing quality of",Paragraph
"the principal ground-floor spaces—living room, dining area, and music room—that Loos",Paragraph
"would further develop in his subsequent houses. Movement to and from these spaces,",Paragraph
"however, was limited to a conventional enclosed hallway, a strategy that Loos would",Paragraph
later largely abandon.,Paragraph
"In the early histories of modernism, much was made of the Steiner House’s simple,",Paragraph
"planar walls and lack of traditional detailing, which seemed to directly presage the rise of",Paragraph
the new purist architecture of the post-World War | period—an idea further advanced,Paragraph
"through views of the house’s rear garden facade, which were juxtaposed with later works",Paragraph
"by Le Corbusier and others. Vincent Scully, writing in 1961, similarly noted the",Paragraph
connection between “the obsessive puritanism” of Loos’ prewar works and His polemical,Paragraph
"statements concerning the elimination of ornament. More recently, however, it has",Paragraph
"become clear that many of the features of the Steiner House, like Loos’ other buildings of",Paragraph
"the time, derived as much from his attempt to find an appropriate modern language as",Paragraph
"from his belief in continuing the Viennese tradition. Indeed, both the house’s sheet-metal",Paragraph
"roof and its smooth stucco finish draw directly on traditional local building practices, and",Paragraph
the design must be seen not only in light of the turn-of-the-century Viennese interest in,Paragraph
abstraction but also in that of the contemporary Biedermeier Revival. Loos’ apparent,Paragraph
rejection of ornament in this view is less an expression of a new functionalism than a,Paragraph
"reaffirmation of older ideas of bourgeois modesty and propriety, values that very much",Paragraph
"suited the house’s first owners. The apparent contrast between the exterior and interior,",Paragraph
"which has also been repeatedly observed, may also be understood not as an inherent",Paragraph
contradiction but as a reflection of Loos’ notion of the difference between the public,Paragraph
"sphere, where propriety is paramount, and the private world, where a more relaxed",Paragraph
attitude may prevail. Such an interpretation suggests not only the complexity of Loos’,Paragraph
views but also the transitional nature of the house’s design.,Paragraph

domestic taste and residential design. Stickley’s model houses influenced builders and,Paragraph
home owners throughout the country to create whole neighborhoods of Craftsman,Paragraph
bungalows as well as an interior aesthetic that personified home for an entire generation.,Paragraph
Elements inspired by English domestic architecture and an Arts and Crafts attitude,Paragraph
toward craftsmanship especially informed the Stickley aesthetic. Inspired by the,Paragraph

"series of enterprises in various furniture-making companies over about 15 years, Stickley",Paragraph
"traveled to England and the Continent, where he was exposed to Arts and Crafts ideals",Paragraph
"and the message of artisan handwork. William Morris (1834-96) had recently died, and",Paragraph
"John Ruskin (1819-1900) was too ill to receive visitors, but Stickley’s affinity to their",Paragraph
ideals and philosophy was indicated by his devoting the first issue of The Crafisman,Paragraph
magazine (1901-16) to Morris and the second issue to Ruskin. Between Stickley’s,Paragraph
"England visit and the establishment of The Craftsman in 1901, Stickley produced his first",Paragraph
"pieces of Craftsman furniture, rejecting the stylish and ecclectic furniture of his earlier",Paragraph
"business associations. As he began to make simpler Craftsman pieces, Stickley also",Paragraph
"experimented with proportions, refined forms, and developed a finish that would",Paragraph
maintain the natural qualities of wood while protecting its surfaces and color.,Paragraph
"Some 40 years earlier, when Philip Webb (1831-1915) completed Red House (1859)",Paragraph
"for William Morris, the client realized proper furniture and interior fittings were",Paragraph
"unavailable for his simple and “styleless” house, and so Morris looked to his artist and",Paragraph
"artisan friends to design pieces to ornament the house, establishing William Morris and",Paragraph
Company to produce such furnishings for a wider audience and clientele. Stickley was,Paragraph
"faced with the reverse situation. He had developed a simplified, styleless furniture",Paragraph
"aesthetic and realized that late Victorian houses, particularly the popular Queen Anne",Paragraph
"domestic forms, were unsuitable for his simple, honest, and unadorned furniture, and thus",Paragraph
the Craftsman bungalow was born.,Paragraph
"The earliest designs for Craftsman houses were amateurish, and Stickley’s first",Paragraph
"architects less competent, but following a brief association (1903-04) with Harvey Ellis,",Paragraph
both the refinement of furniture and the quality of architecture improved. By the middle,Paragraph
"of the first decade of the 20th century, Stickley’s Craftsman aesthetic had reached a",Paragraph
maturity that stimulated a national craze. Both Craftsman furniture and Craftsman houses,Paragraph
were marked by a frank structural expression that was strong and conspicuous in the,Paragraph
"elimination of carving, inlay, moldings, and ornament. Built-in furniture (bookcases and",Paragraph
"china cabinets) became part architecture, part furniture, and even freestanding furniture,",Paragraph
"such as settles, thronelike armchairs, and large refectory-inspired dining room tables or",Paragraph
"writing tables and appeared architectonic in their four-square, virtually “trabeated”",Paragraph

James Frazer Stirling was born in Glasgow in 1926 but was rather proud of having,Paragraph

"and this might account for Stirling’s love of tight, shipshape modern design. He studied",Paragraph
"architecture at Liverpool University, where the presence of Colin Rowe as a fellow",Paragraph
student may help explain the classical and humanist tendencies seen in his later work.,Paragraph
"In 1953 Stirling worked for Lyons Israel and Ellis in London, where he met James",Paragraph
Gowan. They commenced practice together in 1956 and soon became known for a series,Paragraph
"of buildings that, although uncompromisingly modern, owed little to the thendominant",Paragraph

"designs, including the Cambridge University History Faculty Building (1964-67);",Paragraph

Some critics have seen Stirling’s work after 1970 as taking on an increasingly formalist,Paragraph
tendency. Works such as the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart and the Tate Gallery extensions have,Paragraph
"been referred to as Postmodern. Close examination, however, will show the underlying",Paragraph
"unity of all his work, although there is certainly an important shift (somewhat analogous",Paragraph
to the shift in Le Corbusier’s late work with the Chapel of Notre Dame du Haut in,Paragraph
"Ronchamp) in that, compared with his earlier buildings, a freer rein is given to expressive",Paragraph
gestures. Stirling is always consciously experimental in his use equally of eclectic,Paragraph
reference and formal structures. In freely admitting the premeditated nature of all artistic,Paragraph
"creation, he has liberated himself from the false determinism that plagued so much",Paragraph
architectural production after 1945. The element of historicity in his work is no less self-,Paragraph
conscious and willful than was the element of modernity in his early work. It is this,Paragraph
candor and lack of preconception that perhaps makes his work so vital.,Paragraph
"Some of Stirling’s most interesting work remains in the form of projects, such as the",Paragraph

forms. The single line of conical capitals carrying the administration building is rendered,Paragraph
"immaterial in certain lights by the choice of materials, so that the building seems to float",Paragraph
rather than bear down. It is as though the language of modern architecture had been taken,Paragraph
into meditation and revised in the light of an inner vision.,Paragraph
"All these works show a remarkable consistency in their conception and design, which",Paragraph
is probably explained by the talent and the loyalty of the architects that Stirling and,Paragraph

"Stockholm, Sweden",Title
"The City Library (Stadsbiblioteket) in Stockholm, designed by Erik Gunnar Asplund,",Paragraph
is one of those unusual 20th-century buildings that has had two lives. Design work began,Paragraph
"in 1918, and the Library opened to widespread acclaim ten years later. Its second life",Paragraph
"came in the late 1970s and the 1980s, when architects and critics were looking afresh at",Paragraph
"early 20th-century architects such as Asplund, whose work represented a form of",Paragraph
modernity that did not involve the adoption of modernist functionalism.,Paragraph
The commission of the City Library was prompted by a gift from the Knut and Alice,Paragraph
Wallenberg Foundation. Their donation of one million kronor (Swedish crowns),Paragraph
stipulated that matching funds as well as land and all design costs be provided by the,Paragraph
"Stockholm City Council. Carl Westman (1866-1936), who had just completed the",Paragraph
"Radhuset (1908-15), the municipal courthouse in Stockholm, was invited to serve as",Paragraph
"architectural consultant, but he declined, and an offer was made to Asplund, then only 32",Paragraph
"years old, who was appointed on 2 December 1918. It was an important commission, not",Paragraph
only for the prominence of building and site but also for its uniqueness: It was the first,Paragraph
public library building in Sweden from which patrons themselves could remove books,Paragraph
from the shelves.,Paragraph
"The site chosen was the corner of Sveavagen and Odengatan, slightly outside the",Paragraph
"center of the city, on a lot that included the termination of the Brunkebergsdsen ridge, on",Paragraph
which Carl Harleman had built an observatory (1746-53). The first plan (published 1921),Paragraph
"was to develop the entire lot, including a school of economics and law faculty for the",Paragraph
University of Stockholm as well as the Library and a market hall along Odengatan. Work,Paragraph
"began initially on the Library program, and in May 1920 Asplund and the city librarian",Paragraph
Fredrijk Hjelmqvist were sent to the United States to study American libraries. Their,Paragraph
"journey took them to the major cities on the East Coast and the Midwest, and the visitors",Paragraph
"were particularly impressed by Cass Gilbert’s Main Library (1913-21) in Detroit,",Paragraph
"Michigan, which provided a model for the centralized plan, second-story book room, and",Paragraph
upper-level down lighting later employed in Stockholm. Asplund was also impressed by,Paragraph
"the functionalist process by which Americans studied libraries. “In America,” he wrote in",Paragraph
"his travel journal, “one gets an overwhelming impression of the extraordinary, almost",Paragraph
scientific care with which the libraries are designed. It is a continuously evolving,Paragraph
development towards better result. Experiences of earlier libraries are studied and utilized,Paragraph
in every new one.”,Paragraph
Asplund was predisposed to a classically inspired solution for the Library. His earliest,Paragraph
"sketches, possibly from 1919, employ circular spaces that suggest that the original",Paragraph
inspiration might have been Palladio’s Villa Rotunda in Vicenza. This kind of source,Paragraph
"might have been expected for someone educated at the Klara School (1910-11), where",Paragraph
stripped-down classicism was used to evoke modernity. Revisions (1921) to the original,Paragraph
"proposals, after the American trip, show a gridded facade with paired columns and a",Paragraph
"truncated entablature that recalls, albeit much simplified, Ivar Tengbom’s contemporary",Paragraph
"Konserthuset (1920-26). As part of this early scheme, a dome rises prominently from the",Paragraph
center of the block.,Paragraph
Changes were made by the time of construction. The building was raised to a broad,Paragraph
"plinth above street level to accommodate the irregular terrain, and the university",Paragraph
"buildings and market hall were suppressed. Along Sveavagen, shops were added, and",Paragraph
entry to the Library was placed on axis with the main door along a ramplike flight of,Paragraph
stairs through the (later) shopping block. The Library itself is a square with a projecting,Paragraph
"cylinder rather than a raised dome, as originally proposed, to mark the circular reading",Paragraph
"room rotunda. Around the outside of the Library is a low-relief Etruscan-Egyptian frieze,",Caption
"and the marble door is Egyptian in style, with canted sides. From the marble entrance",Caption
"lobby, a flight of narrow stairs between dark marble walls leads directly to the reading",Paragraph
"room, a fact that is also revealed from street level.",Paragraph
The central reading room is the heart of the plan. Three levels of open-shelved books,Paragraph
"surround the central space. This was Asplund’s clear design preference, and he argued to",Paragraph
"the program committee that in addition to its formal value, the circular plan was more",Paragraph
"functional, allowing more space along the walls for bookshelves and on the floor for",Paragraph
"desks, chairs, and the librarians’ station. The reading areas were furnished with lights,",Paragraph

noted rooms is a special section for children that was decorated with a semicircular fresco,Paragraph
by Nils Dardel depicting the dream figure of John Blund and his umbrella. (Blund is a,Paragraph
kind of sandman who brings sleep and happy dreams to Scandinavian children.),Paragraph
There has been much discussion of the nature of Asplund’s sources. Roman sources,Paragraph
"from the Pantheon to the Castel Sant’Angelo (Rasmussen, 1940) and to the Tomb of",Paragraph
"Hadrian, as illustrated by Fischer von Erlach (Donnelly, 1992), have been the most",Paragraph
commonly cited for the square plus cylinder. Caldenby (1985) and others have suggested,Paragraph
that the Library might depend on Claude-Nicolas Ledoux’s Rotonde de la Villette (1785—,Paragraph
"89), one of his tollbooths for Paris. It has also been suggested that Asplund knew Etienne",Paragraph
"Boullée’s Cenotaph for Isaac Newton (Wrede, 1980), an unlikely possibility, as Boullée’s",Paragraph
"image was generally available only later. A more conventional source, one that is",Paragraph
"typologically appropriate, would have been Sidney Smirke’s rotunda (1854-57) for the",Paragraph
British Museum in London. Perhaps the initial idea for a dome came from Harlemann’s,Paragraph
"observatory on the hill above. Finally, it cannot be forgotten that the City Library stands",Paragraph
"at the north end Sveavagen, a street that originates at Tessin’s Royal Palace on Gamla",Paragraph
"Stan and that provides justification for the monumental character of the building. Indeed,",Paragraph
"a specific recollection might be found in the ramplike entry, which recalls the approach to",Paragraph
the Royal Palace up Slottsbacken in addition to stairway sequences that had inspired him,Paragraph
"during his Italian journey (1913-14), as has been observed by Winter. Finally, the",Paragraph
"classicizing order of the building includes decorative motifs: Egyptian, Etruscan, and",Paragraph
"Greek Revival, most notably from Michael Gottlieb Bindesbell at the Thorvaldsen",Paragraph
"Museum in Copenhagen (1839-48), whose Egyptian-style portal seems to have been a",Paragraph
specific inspiration.,Paragraph
"The precise symbolic program of the Library remains elusive. Of course, the circle",Paragraph
within the square and the dome recollect a heavenly universality. An early drawing,Caption
(1921) shows a medallic portrait of a bald-headed man with a short beard in profile over,Paragraph

"briefly, by patrons entering and exiting the Library. Do they suggest the potential dangers",Paragraph
of knowledge or a recognition that it is in human nature to eat from the tree of,Paragraph
knowledge? Or are they prelapsarian guardians of a paradisaic place of knowledge?,Paragraph
"The Library remains largely unaltered from its original construction. In 1974, a double",Paragraph
"flight of stairs was built to handle traffic to the upper gallery, elevators were installed,",Paragraph
and building restoration was undertaken (1979-81) with the opening of a further light,Paragraph
"well. The original entrance doors were replaced, the furnishings were renovated, and the",Paragraph
"lighting was improved at that time. In 1994, the entire Library and terrace building was",Paragraph
replastered and painted.,Paragraph
"Following the completion of the Library, Asplund plunged into work on the Stockholm",Paragraph
"Exhibition of 1930 and began his brief functionalist period. Already, the reflecting pool",Paragraph
(completed 1931) along Sveavégen evokes modernist architectural concerns as do the,Paragraph
"retail shops at street level and the small rear facade addition (1928-31). Indeed, the",Paragraph
building was completed at a critical point in Swedish architectural history. Writing in the,Paragraph

"tendencies of Swedish architecture, as some suggest, but between two phases of",Paragraph
fundamental difference in mentality.” Ahrén was right to the extent that the succeeding,Paragraph
years did not favor the classicizing references that Asplund deployed in the Library.,Paragraph
"Nonetheless, writers on Asplund, such as the Englishman Eric de Mare (1955), continued",Paragraph
to praise the prefunctionalist phase of Asplund’s career despite—or perhaps because of —,Paragraph
its traditional nature.,Paragraph

New influences arrived from the United States and from Germany in the 1910s and,Paragraph
1920s. Sweden was especially receptive to North American architecture as a result of,Paragraph
"emigration. Many architects and artists traveled to America, some to stay, some to profit",Paragraph

"need to be rationalized elsewhere, made perfect sense at 60 degrees north, where the sun",Paragraph
"barely moved beyond the horizontal much of the year. At another level, however, the",Paragraph
success of functionalism reflected a broader cultural effort: 20th-century Swedes who,Paragraph

"Stone has two distinct architectural faces: in monumental architecture, it stands for",Paragraph
"wealth, power, and permanence; on the other hand, especially when used at a domestic",Paragraph
"scale and based on local craft traditions, it appears as modest, forthright, and natural.",Paragraph
These two aspects of stone correspond to the varying levels of effort and skill marshaled,Paragraph
"in its fabrication, transportation, and erection. Finely worked, accurately cut blocks,",Paragraph
"sometimes of exotic origin or polished to a jewel-like finish, characterize monumental",Paragraph
"architecture, while fieldstone, rubble, or roughly worked stone set in thick mortar beds is",Paragraph
more often associated with modest works. Stone’s symbolic content is not determined by,Paragraph
these two traditions alone but also reflects the revolutionary changes brought about by,Paragraph

The most radical of the reactions against traditional architectural styles was,Paragraph
International Style modernism. Modernists invoked the idea of “truth to materials” to,Paragraph
provide intellectual cover for the unsettling changes in the built environment associated,Paragraph
"with the industrial revolution—specifically, the rationalization of the building process to",Paragraph
increase productivity and reduce costs. Eliminating gratuitous decoration (such as the,Paragraph
omamented stone facades of traditional monumental architecture) became a fundamental,Paragraph
"tenet of modernism. However, the use of stone as honest bearing wall or smooth-surfaced",Paragraph
veneer was generally accepted.,Paragraph
"Le Corbusier’s Villa de Mme de Mandrot (1931) in Le Pradet, France, illustrates the",Paragraph

STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS,Title
Structural systems are considered any collection of construction materials arranged in,Paragraph
specific configurations for producing the most efficient medium that safely transfers,Paragraph
"applied gravity and lateral loads in any given structure. More specifically, structural",Paragraph
"systems can be categorized into four main groups: solid, framed, surface, and tensile.",Paragraph
"Typically, combinations of those groups, particularly the first three, which encompass a",Paragraph
"huge and highly competitive variety of systems available for the designer to choose from,",Paragraph
"are selected for the construction of any specific building project. In general, the bases of",Paragraph
"such selection are economy, special structural requirements, problems of design and",Paragraph
"construction, and materials and scale limitations. Realistically, however, in the majority",Paragraph
of built projects the overriding criterion for selecting systems is that of economy.,Paragraph
"Solid and monolithic elements of foundations include footings (strip and isolated),",Paragraph
"slab-on-grade, large piers, and abutments. They represent the last components of the load",Paragraph
path in a structure. Their main purpose is to safely transfer all applied loads to the,Paragraph
supporting soil.,Paragraph
Structural walls function either as supports for horizontal spanning systems (as bearing,Paragraph
walls} or as stabilizing elements for the lateral bracing of structures (as shear walls).,Paragraph
"Depending on the way they are constructed, walls can be classified as either solid or",Paragraph
"framed elements. Examples of such systems can be found in any building project, such as",Paragraph
supports for floor and roof structural subsystems. Examples of structural walls acting as,Paragraph
"lateral bracing elements also abound, but particularly notable are shear walls in",Paragraph
"skyscrapers. In 1976, architects Johnson and Burgee designed the 36-story Pennzoil Plaza",Paragraph
"in Houston, Texas, with a concrete core for wind load resistance.",Paragraph
The oldest and most basic manner in which a frame is constructed is based on the post-,Paragraph
and-beam system. It is composed of two essential elements: the posts (typically vertical,Paragraph
compression members) and the beams (typically horizontal elements transferring applied,Paragraph
loads through shearing forces and bending moments). The degree of rigidity of the,Paragraph
connections between those elements determines the amount of moment being transferred,Paragraph
"from the beams to the posts. The beams can be continuous over several posts (columns),",Paragraph
"creating a multibay arrangement. Similarly, columns can be vertically continuous,",Paragraph
"creating a multistory configuration. As such, this system can be expanded to form the",Paragraph
three-dimensional skeletal frame of a building structure. Examples of such systems,Paragraph
"include the Empire State Building (New York City, designed by Shreve, Lamb and",Caption
"Harmon, 1931).",Paragraph
Other frame-based arrangements include such innovative systems as geodesic domes.,Paragraph
"Made famous by R. Buckminster Fuller in the 1960s, they utilize multiple stable",Paragraph
"triangularly shaped units that, when framed side-by-side, form a shell-like structure.",Paragraph
"Architects Murphy and Mackey in St. Louis, Missouri, implemented this framing concept",Paragraph
"in their design of the Climatron, a geodesic dome used in the Missouri Botanical",Paragraph
Gardens.,Paragraph
Trusses,Title
Perhaps the most efficient framing elements are trusses used for horizontal spanning in,Paragraph
roofs and floors as well as for bridges. Trusses rely exclusively on straight members,Paragraph
"framed together through bolted, welded, or a combination type of joints. By lining up the",Paragraph
"axes of the joined members and directing applied loads to the joints only, a truss will",Paragraph
transmit tension and compression forces mainly through its members. The advantage of,Paragraph
"trusses lies in the openness of their structure, allowing required electrical cables/conduits",Paragraph
and mechanical pipes/ducts to go through them without requiring additional dedicated,Paragraph
"space. Because of their relatively lightweight and rigid triangularly based framework,",Paragraph
trusses are capable of spanning very large distances. There are many examples of truss,Paragraph
"structural systems, but perhaps the most visible are the ones used in bridge construction.",Paragraph
"The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, opened in 1936, is one such example, with a",Paragraph
truss system connecting San Francisco to Treasure Island.,Paragraph
Arches and Vaults,Title
"The main objective of the arch is to span horizontally, utilizing a structural system that",Paragraph
develops internal compression forces only. A temporary structure is erected in order to,Paragraph
hold the arch solid elements (voussoirs) while being placed starting at the ends of the,Paragraph
"arch. Once both sides of the arch are completed, the last voussoir (keystone) is inserted in",Paragraph
"place and the temporary shoring removed. If expanded in one direction, arches form",Paragraph
"tunnel vaults. If crossed at 90 degrees, two vaults will produce a groin vault. Modern",Paragraph
arches and vaults are being achieved using structural systems such as framed truss,Paragraph
"members forming the arch without resorting to solid elements. In 1998, Tate and Snyder",Paragraph
"architects employed steel trusses, formed into arches, to support the curved roofing",Paragraph
"system in the main lobby of Terminal D of McCarran International airport in Las Vegas,",Caption
Nevada.,Paragraph
Plates and Shells,Title
"Classified as surface structures because of their very high surface-area-to-thickness ratio,",Paragraph
"plates and shells encompass slabs, panels, folded plates, and shells with various simple,",Paragraph
"as well as complex, geometric surface configurations (e.g., conical, spherical, and",Paragraph
"hyperboloidal). Architectural history in filled with cases of those forms. Notably,",Paragraph
"however, because of the vast repertoire of construction materials available to the designer",Paragraph
"in the 20th century, today’s architects have found these forms very tempting. As such,",Paragraph
there are many cases where plates and shells have been successfully incorporated into the,Paragraph
"architectural design. In 1997, the American architect Frank Gehry made use of the shell",Paragraph
"system concept to encapsulate his entire Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, with",Paragraph
curved titanium surfaces.,Paragraph
Tent and Cable-Suspended Systems,Title
"These systems act in an opposite way to the concept of arches and vaults, the difference",Paragraph
being that the internal forces induced in cable-suspended or tent systems are tensile in,Paragraph
nature. Engineers and builders have been successful in utilizing such systems whenever a,Paragraph
"large span is desired. Completed in 1999 and spanning 1,198 feet (365 meters), the",Paragraph
"Millennium Dome in Greenwich, London, is a contemporary example of the cable-",Paragraph

in the Golden Gate Bridge (with a span of 1280 meters) in San Francisco (1937). Another,Paragraph

STRUCTURALISM,Title
The term structuralism is generally applied to the work of a diverse group of French,Paragraph
intellectuals working in the 1950s and 60s. Drawing on modern philosophy and the,Paragraph
human sciences that arose in the 19th and early 20th centuries—linguistics and,Paragraph
"anthropology—and to a lesser extent on the hard sciences and mathematics,",Paragraph
structuralism’s influence continued long after its formal existence as a coherent,Paragraph
"movement. In the most general sense, structuralism was the search for the most",Paragraph
elementary and universal patterns underlying cultural reality—patterns and structures that,Paragraph
"form the basis of social life in its most fundamental expressions: language, economy,",Paragraph
"science, and so forth. Less doctrine than method, the basic tenets of structuralism were",Paragraph
"adapted to virtually every discipline in the academy. Simply stated, these tenets were,",Paragraph
"first, individual phenomena (utterances, rituals, the formation of social institutions) only",Paragraph
"have significance when considered as part of a larger system; second, the huge variety of",Paragraph
isolated phenomena that are discernible within the world or a given system are specific,Paragraph
"permutations of a very few general principles; and third, the structure or conceptual",Paragraph
model constructed to chart these general principles (and the meaning of their individual,Paragraph
manifestations) is just that—a conceptual model or structure that by definition cannot be,Paragraph
empirically verified.,Paragraph
"Even though generalizations like these can be identified, structuralism’s significance",Paragraph
lay in what it rejected as much as in what it adopted as its own method. By asserting the,Paragraph
"necessity of distinguishing between specific phenomena and their underlying principles,",Paragraph
"and placing the emphasis on the latter, structuralism leveled the cultural field to a certain",Paragraph
"extent, doing away with a Eurocentric model that would maintain a qualitative difference",Paragraph
"between, for instance, the social activities of modern and “primitive” societies. The",Paragraph
"fundamental rejection of the dichotomy modern/primitive, especially evident in the work",Paragraph
"of the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, was also a rejection of a century-and-a-half of",Paragraph
"Hegelian determinism, or the myth of cultural progress. In addition, by insisting on the",Paragraph
"syntactical consideration of phenomena—the relationships between them, as opposed to",Paragraph
their individual significance—structuralism rejected metaphysical hermeneutics as well,Paragraph
as phenomenology. This philosophical conflict was played out most dramatically in the,Paragraph
debates between Lévi-Strauss and the existentialist/Marxist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre,Title
"in the pages of the journals Les Temps Moderne, L’Homme, and L’Express. Whereas",Paragraph
"Sartre maintained the existence of conscious, human agency, Lévi-Strauss insisted on the",Paragraph
importance of the underlying elements that gave meaning to human action. The climate in,Paragraph
"postwar France was much more conducive to Lévi-Strauss’s approach, which seemed",Paragraph
more objective than Sartre’s—an important attribute during a time in which many,Paragraph
academic disciplines sought grounding in the hard sciences and mathematics.,Paragraph
Lévi-Strauss’s “structural anthropology” was not developed ex nihilo; it drew on the,Paragraph
"achievements of past ethnographers and, perhaps more important, on developments in the",Paragraph
field of linguistics. Whereas some earlier ethnographers had recognized the importance of,Paragraph
"a comparative method, according to Lévi-Strauss they remained mired in empiricism,",Paragraph
which prevented them from ascending beyond the level of the specific. Lévi-Strauss,Paragraph
sought to do away with the endless observation and cataloguing of human behavior,Paragraph
characteristic of ethnography and to implement a more conceptual comparative model,Paragraph
"that would establish underlying structural principles. For Lévi-Strauss, this gap was",Paragraph
bridged definitively when he was exposed to the work of the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de,Paragraph
Saussure.,Paragraph
"Lecturing earlier in the century, Saussure had students whose notes were published as",Paragraph
the Course in General Linguistics. The essential lessons of “the course” established,Paragraph
Saussure as the founder of structuralism. By far the most significant idea in Saussure’s,Paragraph
teachings is the fundamental distinction he makes between the signifier and the signified.,Paragraph
"For Saussure, there is no determined or natural relationship between a word and what it",Paragraph
"represents—be it thing or idea. Rather, words are small units in a larger linguistic",Paragraph
"system—phonemes whose meaning arises solely from their syntax, or relation to one",Paragraph
"another. From this assertion, Saussure derived yet another important dichotomy—that",Paragraph
"between /angue and parole, or the greater, underlying system of language and the",Paragraph
"individual instances of its utterance or speech. Thus, Saussure broke language off from",Paragraph
the empirical world and established a method for studying it as an autonomous system.,Paragraph
"Moreover, this system was to be studied synchronically as opposed to diachronically or",Paragraph
"historically. The relational nature of the signifier meant that for any given word or phrase,",Paragraph
"the relation to the rest of the system had to be considered simultaneously. Thus, the entire",Paragraph
structure is being studied at the same moment as an individual utterance. In the field of,Paragraph
"linguistics, this constituted a break with etymological studies of language, but for French",Paragraph
"structuralism, the emphasis on synchrony formed the basis for the later rejection of",Paragraph
classical history.,Paragraph
Saussure became one part of a triad of great thinkers to whom the new generation of,Paragraph

cultural criticism. The idea that the system of cultural signs was itself a kind of,Paragraph

STUDIO PER,Title
"Architectural firm, Spain",Title
"Studio Per was a collaborative group formed in 1964 by Pep Bonet (1941-), Oscar",Paragraph
"Tusquets (1941-), Cristian Cirici (1941—), and Lluis Clotet (1941-). Primarily because of",Paragraph
"political considerations, Spanish culture remained relatively isolated from the main",Paragraph
"currents of Western European art. Therefore, critics in Western Europe and the United",Paragraph
"States largely ignored Spanish architecture. As Spain became more open, both politically",Paragraph
"and culturally, a new generation of architects began to attract international recognition.",Paragraph
The four men of Studio Per came together in the burgeoning artistic climate of 1960s,Paragraph
Barcelona and soon emerged as leaders of this movement. The designs of Studio Per and,Paragraph
others provided the foundations for the development and consolidation of contemporary,Paragraph
Spanish architecture. The work of this group continued into the postdictatorship period of,Paragraph
"democratic Spain, and they participated in the dramatic refurbishing of Spain’s",Paragraph
"architectural reputation, both nationally and internationally. In general, their work can be",Paragraph
characterized by a qualified acceptance of the International Style tempered with,Paragraph
"pragmatic revisions, including a legacy of the organic and an avoidance of unnecessarily",Paragraph
utopian theory. They contributed to general currents of postwar architecture that rejected,Paragraph
or modified the ideology of modernism.,Paragraph
All the men had been students of Federico Correa at the Escuela Técnica Superior de,Paragraph
Arquitectura and inherited a tradition of Catalan architecture going back to Antoni Gaudi,Paragraph
"i Cor-net, Josep Puig i Cadafalch, and Lluis Doménech i Montaner. The group was part",Paragraph
"of the newly recognized but loosely organized movement of Spanish architects, including",Paragraph
"Ricardo Bofill and Oriol Bohigas, known as the School of Barcelona. Although a single",Paragraph
"firm, Studio Per was actually the combination of two distinct tendencies: the",Paragraph
Postmodernism of Clotet and Tusquets alongside the postrationalism of Bonet and Cirici.,Paragraph
This singular combination enabled the group to produce multivalent works that featured a,Paragraph
mixture of opposites. The group took inspiration from the architectural philosophies of,Paragraph
Robert Venturi and Aldo Rossi. An emphasis on form and composition along with an,Paragraph
unabashed faith in the value of historical tradition became important tenets of Studio,Paragraph
"Per’s artistic philosophy. Despite this reverence for traditional forms, the architects",Paragraph
avoided slavish devotion to past styles and always injected their projects with the very,Paragraph
latest design elements and structural materials.,Paragraph
The work of Studio Per was characterized by a fine attention to detail and an honest,Paragraph
"pragmatism. They viewed each project as a unique problem and opportunity, and the",Paragraph
group rejected adherence to rigidly programmatic solutions. The architects attacked basic,Paragraph
"problems of location, client wishes, and legal constraints with an eye toward simple,",Paragraph
elegant solutions. The work of Studio Per questioned established norms and avoided the,Paragraph
"blind implementation of romantic ideals. Instead, the architects constructed synthetic",Paragraph
designs aimed at achieving unorthodox yet convincing solutions. They often employed,Paragraph
high doses of irony and a respectful misappropriation of the past.,Paragraph
The guiding principles of Studio Per’s architectural philosophy can be seen in the Casa,Paragraph
Regas and Belvedere Giorgina (1972). The project was designed as a summer home in,Paragraph
"the mountains near Girona, Spain. The site already contained the massive ruined",Paragraph
foundation of an ancient dwelling. The architects chose to build on the antiquated walls,Paragraph
while also constructing a new section of the house. This fusion of the traditional and,Paragraph
"modern, the existing and the new, is one of the most important legacies of Studio Per.",Paragraph
"The original home provided the location for the service elements of the household,",Paragraph
"whereas the new building contained the living quarters. A short while later, the client",Paragraph
"envisioned a second structure for the same site. In this project, the designers had to deal",Paragraph
with an extremely small space of approximately 40 square meters. The solution was a,Paragraph
single structure topped by a neoclassical belvedere. The work became somewhat,Paragraph
controversial at the time for its ironic appropriation of classical elements.,Paragraph
The House on the Island of Pantelleria (1974) continued the elements seen in the Casa,Paragraph
Regas and Belvedere Giorgina. The building is situated on a small island between Italy,Paragraph
"and Tunisia. The site was in a protected natural park, and this imposed limitations on new",Paragraph
"building. Clotet and Tusquets, the principal designers, chose to retain the ancient walls",Paragraph
and foundations. They reconstructed the dwelling with local volcanic rock and formed,Paragraph
simple volumes that echoed the modular form of traditional buildings on the island. The,Paragraph
"home extended over two levels, one containing the sleeping quarters and the other the",Paragraph
"kitchen and other service areas. The dual levels flow over the landscape, following the",Paragraph
"natural slope to the sea. The most innovative design elements are the open-air terraces,",Paragraph
marked by rows of simple columns that again recall the island’s traditional architectural,Paragraph
"elements. The house was a simple, elegant design that respected local materials and",Paragraph
forms while at the same time seeming modern.,Paragraph
"In addition to being an architectural firm, Studio Per also constituted itself as an",Paragraph
"industrial design and furniture maker. A separate design studio, BD Ediciones de Disefio,",Paragraph
"was formed in 1972. As designers, they helped raise international awareness of the",Paragraph
innovative artistic culture of both Spain and Barcelona in particular. The group achieved,Paragraph
"some success as furniture and industrial designers, winning numerous Spanish and",Paragraph
international awards.,Paragraph
"Although disbanded, the individual architects and designers of Studio Per have",Paragraph
continued to exert a great influence on Spanish and international architecture and design.,Paragraph
Tusquets and Clotet in particular played large roles in the 1980s rejuvenation of Spanish,Paragraph
"design and construction. The project culminated in the Olympic Games of 1992, for",Paragraph
which Clotet designed apartment buildings in the Olympic Village and Tusquets a hotel.,Paragraph

often according to street plans predetermined by prior subdivision or municipal,Paragraph
"authorities. With the enormous increase in demand for housing following World War II,",Paragraph
"as well as the availability of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgages, extensive",Paragraph

"them into house lots, providing infrastructure and landscaping, providing sites for",Paragraph
"shopping centers and schools, and in some cases even building all the homes.",Paragraph
"Federal government intervention transformed the economics of real estate, with",Paragraph
"century-long consequences, beginning with establishment of the Home Owners Loan",Paragraph
Corporation (HOLC) in 1933 and then the FHA (1934). Endorsing the single family,Paragraph
"house above all other types, the FHA eventually made it cheaper to own than to rent; and",Paragraph
"by establishing minimum standards for housing and development, favoring homogeneous",Paragraph
"tracts of detached, single-family, automobile-dependent dwellings, the FHA contributed",Paragraph
substantially to the postwar transformation and standardization of suburbs across the,Paragraph
nation. Even during World War II the urgent need to house defense workers had begun to,Paragraph
set the pattern for large-scale suburban expansion.,Paragraph
Since the early 18th century origins of modern residential suburbs in the Thames,Paragraph
"Valley west of London, suburban planning and design have been substantially informed",Paragraph
"by ideologies of individualism, privacy, and the nuclear family. These basic interests",Paragraph
"underlie the predisposition of American suburban design toward private lots, single-",Paragraph
"family houses, distinct front and back yards and, by the mid 20th century, a driveway and",Paragraph
garage for one or more cars. While individuality could be reinforced by encouraging,Paragraph
economic and environmental homogeneity among large lot owners in 19th-century elite,Paragraph
suburbs efforts to maintain individuality in 20th-century middle-class suburbs have,Paragraph
"produced quite the opposite effect. Uniformity to the point of anonymity, and conformity",Paragraph
"to the point of oppressive monotony, are exemplified in many subdivisions, especially",Paragraph
"following World War II, when new production techniques facilitated mass replication of",Paragraph
"houses of a single type, size, and plan in vast tracts seemingly stamped out in “cookie-",Paragraph
"cutter” fashion (e.g., in the 1950s in Panorama City, California, or Park Forest, Ilinois).",Paragraph
Already in 1931 President Herbert Hoover had proclaimed the private dwelling to be,Paragraph
deeply embedded in Americans’ consciousness: “I am confident that the sentiment for,Paragraph
home ownership is so embedded in the American heart that millions of people who dwell,Paragraph
"in tenements, apartments, and rented rooms... have the aspiration for wider opportunity",Paragraph
"in ownership of their own homes” (quoted in Jackson 1985, 193-194). This confidence in",Paragraph
"the private individual as the principal constituent element of American society, and in the",Paragraph
"private house as the archetypal American dwelling, both of which notions long predate",Paragraph
"Hoover, have continued to inform shifts and innovations in planning during the last third",Paragraph
"of the century. Planned Unit Developments (PUDs), gated communities, and similar",Paragraph
homogeneous and exclusive subdivision types frequently are marketed explicitly as,Paragraph
"effective means for articulating the individual residents’ status, privilege, and position.",Paragraph
"Such exclusive enclaves, along with architectural shifts that increasingly have",Paragraph
"emphasized withdrawal to indoor spaces, have served to intensify the character of",Paragraph
"suburbia as a space of consumption, privacy, and the culture of the nuclear family.",Paragraph
"Suburban planning also reflects the importance of leisure, evidenced in the visual",Paragraph
"paradigm to which much of suburbia continues to adhere, a quasi-pastoral setting of",Paragraph
"lawns, trees, and meandering streets, explicitly differentiated by means of landscaping",Paragraph
"and zoning from proximate nexuses of commerce, transportation, and labor. Within",Paragraph
"residential areas, both planning and architecture have accommodated the growing",Paragraph
"penchant for personal, family, and community leisure activities, commonly through such",Paragraph
"amenities as community sports fields and recreation centers, backyard barbecues, and",Paragraph
"household recreation rooms, fitness areas, and entertainment centers.",Paragraph
The progressive theme that informed much of early 20th century planning originated in,Paragraph
"Ebenezer Howard’s To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform (1898), soon revised as",Paragraph
Garden Cities of To-morrow (1902). An English manifesto for social reform that took,Paragraph
"aim at the evils of the “teeming metropolis,” Howard’s tract was an effort to tame the",Paragraph
evils of capitalism by promoting a new approach to community organization that he,Paragraph
termed “social individualism.” Critical to this process would be a new form of,Paragraph
"community design, the garden city, which offered an attractive, almost romantic, vision",Paragraph
"of housing at far lower density than the industrial city, and in far greater visual and",Paragraph
"ecological harmony with the surrounding countryside, a design that with multiple",Paragraph
"replications he expected could effect broadscale social, economic, and political change.",Paragraph
"In America as in England, however, the city was not to be economically outmoded or",Paragraph
"abandoned. Still, in designs for suburban adjuncts to America’s growing cities, American",Paragraph
"designers did look to such figures as Howard and Sir Raymond Unwin, whose Town",Paragraph
Planning in Practice: An Introduction to the Art of Designing Cities and Suburbs (1909),Caption
offered practical examples. What American designers took was a disposition toward,Paragraph
"medium density, low rise, well landscaped, multiple family dwellings, together with a",Paragraph
conviction that such types of design could effect certain social reformist goals. John,Paragraph
"Nolen based his design for Mariemont (1921), east of Cincinnati, explicitly on English",Paragraph
"Garden City models, incorporating detached, semidetached, and row houses. His plan",Paragraph
"combined a formal town center, framed by baroque radiating avenues, with outlying",Paragraph
residential areas consisting of curving avenues circumscribing tracts of house plots and,Paragraph
"parklands. Consistent with the ideals of Howard and Unwin, Mariemont’s design",Paragraph
incorporated a philanthropic goal of establishing an affordable and healthy working-class,Paragraph
"community; but unlike the ideal Garden City, Mariemont remained a commuter adjunct",Paragraph
"to, not a replacement for, the industrial city. Palos Verdes, California, initially developed",Paragraph
"in the 1920s according to a plan prepared by Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., was a more",Paragraph
"ambitious effort at social engineering, incorporating a mix of large and small single-",Paragraph
"family dwellings along with some multiple family units, grouped into discrete",Paragraph
"neighborhoods, each with an elementary school and adjacent shopping areas. Olmsted",Paragraph
"argued that his design, along with the originally isolated location of this development,",Paragraph
would make it among the most stable and permanent of communities in an otherwise,Paragraph
changing and troublesome era.,Paragraph
"The Regional Planning Association of America, founded in 1923, initiated an activist",Paragraph
"approach to social reform through housing. In 1924-1928 two members of the group,",Paragraph
"architects Henry Wright and Clarence Stein, working under the auspices of the limited-",Paragraph
"dividend City Housing Corporation, laid out a section of already grid-platted Queens,",Paragraph
"New York, within commuting distance of the central city, in an innovative pattern, with",Paragraph
low-rise terraces surrounding open interior courtyards. Abandoning the custom of,Paragraph
detached dwellings on individual house plots in favor of common interior greenswards,Paragraph
"this development, called Sunnyside Gardens, was intended to improve both housing and",Paragraph
community for working-class people. Wright and Stein’s next project afforded,Paragraph
"comparable innovation for white-collar families with automobiles. Radburn, New Jersey,",Caption
"begun in 1929, was organized as a series of row-house terraces fronting on lawns and",Paragraph
"walkways, with automobile access diverted to cul-de-sacs at the rear of the terraces.",Paragraph
Vehicular traffic thus was separated and screened from pedestrian walkways. Promoted,Paragraph
"as “A Town for the Motor Age” and “A Town for Children,” it remains a well articulated",Paragraph
example of a planning type that ultimately succumbed to American predilections for,Paragraph
"privacy, autonomy, and the trappings of automobile culture. Nevertheless some of the",Paragraph
strategies first articulated in Radburn continued to be elaborated in the 1930s New Deal,Paragraph
"Greenbelt towns (Greenbelt, Maryland, Greendale, Wisconsin, and Greenhills, Ohio), and",Paragraph
"enjoyed a revival in the 1960s and 1970s in developments such as Columbia, Maryland,",Paragraph
"and Jonathan, Minnesota.",Paragraph
"Apart from the garden city, the other principal paradigm for early 20th century",Paragraph
"suburbia was the private enclave of singlefamily dwellings, generally inhabited by",Paragraph
"members of elite and near-elite social classes. Nineteenth-century exemplars of this type,",Paragraph
"such as Tuxedo Park, New York (1886), in effect defined themselves as communities of",Paragraph
"exclusion, often reinforced through gated perimeters. Indeed residence sometimes was",Paragraph
"limited to those who could pass a social test, such as personal approval by the",Paragraph
"community’s founder, or ability to gain membership in a private association such as the",Paragraph
community’s country club. While not all subsequent suburbs could even approach the,Paragraph
"elite tenor of Tuxedo Park, the protection of social homogeneity remained paramount in",Paragraph
"numerous developments well into the 1920s, notable examples being the Country Club",Paragraph
District developed by J.C.Nichols in Kansas City (1922) and the comparable Country,Paragraph
"Club District in Edina, a suburb of Minneapolis (1924), both of which were explicitly",Paragraph
promoted as implements of an exclusive social milieu and lifestyle—amenities that,Paragraph
would be conserved through such devices as minimum lot sizes and racial exclusions.,Paragraph
"Even in subdivisions targeted to a broader economic range of residents, such as Shaker",Paragraph
"Heights outside of Cleveland (1911 ff.), developers used restrictions against two-family",Paragraph
"houses, apartments, front porches, and other design and use characteristics to pointed",Paragraph
effect in marketing the suburb as a place where “standards” brought status and,Paragraph
restrictions safe-guarded a lifestyle.,Paragraph
The reformist and privatist-individualist trends in American suburban planning,Title
"converged, to an extent, in Frank Lloyd Wright’s series of designs for a paradigmatic",Paragraph
American community that he termed Broadacre City (1913-16). Renewing a long-,Paragraph
"standing American ideological aversion to the city, Wright’s design foresaw wholesale",Paragraph
"replacement of all cities with uniformly low-density, single-family, automobile-",Paragraph
dependent dwellings.,Paragraph
"Government too played a role in the shift toward the single-family suburban landscape,",Paragraph
"first in zoning initiatives concurrent with municipal reform movements of the 1920s, and",Paragraph
then especially in housing programs that were among early efforts to address the,Paragraph
Depression. Empowered by a Supreme Court decision enabling a proliferation of zoning,Paragraph
"codes in the 1920s, local zoning boards intent on refining suburbs’ residential character",Paragraph
"commonly banned or restricted commerce and manufacturing, legislated minimum lot",Paragraph
"sizes, and otherwise favored single-family dwellings. By establishing both locational and",Paragraph
"design standards for affordable government-backed loans in the 1930s and 1940s, the",Paragraph
HOLC and FHA assured that the bulk of new housing in America would be single-family,Paragraph
"dwellings located in neighborhoods that were preferentially newer, lower density and,",Paragraph
"well into the 1950s, racially white.",Paragraph
Small-scale builders and developers continued to produce a considerable portion of,Paragraph
"post-World War II suburbia, but the demands of the acute postwar housing shortage and",Paragraph
the stimulus provided by the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944 (or GI Bill) set the,Paragraph
"stage for the use of mass-production processes, and production on a larger scale than ever",Paragraph
"before. The most prominent figure in this transformation was the firm of Levitt and Sons,",Paragraph
who prior to 1945 had rapidly mass-produced thousands of homes for the war effort.,Paragraph
"Their postwar showpiece was the community of Levittown, in the Town of Hempstead on",Paragraph
"Long Island, where by 1947 they had completed, ready for occupancy, the first of some",Paragraph
"17,447 houses. Like many other postwar subdivisions, Levittown was exclusively white;",Paragraph
"yet there were also a number of African-American subdivisions, mostly in the South,",Paragraph
"such as Hamilton Park, a suburb of Dallas, and Bunche Park and Richmond Heights,",Paragraph
suburbs of Miami.,Paragraph
"As developed tracts soon backed up against each other, however, lack of community-",Paragraph
and region-wide planning often left little opportunity to alleviate the monotony of the,Paragraph
homogeneous domestic environment. Efforts to articulate some sort of community focus,Paragraph
often were limited to building shopping centers. As early as the 1920s it was recognized,Paragraph
"that an elegant, convenient, high-quality retail center could enhance the desirability of a",Paragraph
"subdivision, as demonstrated by the opening in 1923 of the nation’s first automobile-",Paragraph
"oriented shopping center, Country Club Plaza, as a much-vaunted amenity of",Paragraph
"J.C.Nichols’ subdivision in Kansas City. The need remained, however, to address the",Paragraph
lack of civic focus and activity in areas of vast subdivisions. One effort to remedy this,Paragraph
"was the country’s first fully enclosed shopping mall, Southdale Shopping Center",Paragraph
"(designed by Victor Gruen, 1956) in Edina, Minnesota.",Caption
Occasional attempts of a different order in the 1960s and 1970s to restore the full,Paragraph
breadth of civic and community life to suburban subdivisions are perhaps epitomized in,Paragraph
"Reston, Virginia, developed beginning in 1962 by Robert E.Simon. Considerably",Paragraph
"indebted to examples of contemporary governmentfunded new town planning in Europe,",Paragraph
Simon’s private-sector effort envisioned a town with a comparable range of housing,Paragraph
"opportunities, civic and educational institutions, and possibilities for employment and",Paragraph
"recreation, all to be kept in harmonious relation with the landscape. Despite major",Paragraph
"changes of ownership and direction in the 1960s through 1980s, Reston fulfilled much of",Paragraph
"that vision, becoming a town of seven village clusters plus a town center, and a wide",Paragraph
"range of recreational facilities, as well as a corporate business center employing over a",Paragraph
"third of the town’s residents, all laid out on a well-landscaped, hierarchized system of",Paragraph
"major through roads, looping residential streets, and separated pedestrian pathways,",Paragraph
"serving a mixture of detached houses, townhouses, and apartments.",Paragraph
"Reston was part of a shift, beginning in the 1960s, toward suburban planning that",Paragraph
"aimed to afford a greater sense of identity, community, and security through consistency",Paragraph
"of design and centralized, long-term management. Some of these efforts were on a",Paragraph
"deliberately limited scale, as with Planned Unit Developments (PUDs), which in many",Paragraph
"cases incorporated considerable sensitivity to landscape, community, and design quality,",Paragraph
often trading an increase in housing density for more continuous open space between and,Paragraph
"around the houses. In many of these developments, however, as with larger-scale Master",Paragraph
"Planned Communities (MPCs), standards of design and rules for land use were",Paragraph
"appropriated to a central authority, either the developer or a community board",Paragraph
empowered to maintain the developer’s original restrictions. One of the largest MPCs is,Paragraph
"the Irvine Ranch, a tract of over 50,000 acres southeast of Los Angeles, originally",Paragraph
planned in 1960 by William Pereira as a collection of village clusters centered around a,Paragraph
"university campus, along with adjacent industrial, commerical, and agricultural tracts. In",Paragraph
"1970 Pereira’s plan was superseded by the SWA Group, who began by laying out",Paragraph
"Woodbridge, one of Irvine’s earliest villages, in a highly controlled yet picturesque",Paragraph
fashion that incorporates a complex combination of mixed housing types and public and,Paragraph
"private spaces. A recent and controversial example is Celebration, near Orlando, where",Paragraph
the Disney Corporation has both imposed rigid design restrictions and retained,Paragraph
considerable authority over municipal government and influence in the school system.,Paragraph
But perhaps the ascendant form of development at the end of the century is the gated,Paragraph
community. Harking back to such smaller-scale prototypes as Llewellyn Park or Tuxedo,Paragraph
"Park, these enclosed tracts emphasize privacy, security, and in many cases status; but as",Paragraph
Blakely and Snyder (1997) have shown they also have the pernicious effect of decoupling,Paragraph
residence and community from the civic realm.,Paragraph
"However closely planned and managed some communities may be, the predominant",Paragraph
"mode of suburban development is thoroughly piecemeal, producing the wasteful and",Paragraph
chaotic consumption of land known as sprawl. Seeking to reverse this trend on both local,Paragraph
"and regional bases, the nationwide Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU) has sought",Paragraph
"since its establishment in 1993 to restructure design, policy, and planning practices in",Paragraph
ways that reconcentrate existing communities and incorporate new communities with,Paragraph
"compact centers, public spaces, coherent plans, and a diverse mix of facilities and",Paragraph
activities. Architects working in this vein include the firm of Andres Duany and Elizabeth,Paragraph
"Plater-Zyberk, and Calthorpe Associates. Parallel efforts, undertaking development in",Paragraph
"conjunction with explicitly ecological and conservationist objectives, are found in",Paragraph
"communities such as Prairie Crossing (Grayslake, Illinois), opened in 1994. Here",Paragraph
development has been limited to approximately one fourth of a 2500-acre nature,Paragraph
"preserve, concentrated in ways that safeguard the natural landscape, protect native",Paragraph
"vegetation and wildlife, conserve energy, and afford long views of open space, while",Paragraph

SUBWAY,Title
The subway is a 19th-century idea realized largely in the 20th century. The industrial,Paragraph
revolution was the primary catalyst for the advent of underground transportation; without,Paragraph
"it the iron horse that pulled the trains, the tunneling technology that bored through the",Paragraph
"earth, and the iron walls that held those tunnels up would have been impossible. The",Paragraph
problem of the subway also had its political and social implications. Mass transit meant,Paragraph
"reform, for increased mobility freed the working classes from the urban center and gave",Paragraph
them greater share of the public realm.,Paragraph
"The leader in the industrial revolution, Great Britain came to the forefront of subway",Paragraph
design as well. The Metropolitan Railway was opened to the public to much acclaim in,Paragraph
1863. The stations on this first line were architecturally undistinguished; the line’s,Paragraph
engineers quite naturally borrowed their architectural vocabulary from the established,Paragraph
"railroads, and so a distinct Underground aesthetic would not be developed until the first",Paragraph
"years of the 20th century, when consolidation finally allowed a cohesive architectural",Paragraph
"expression to develop, as ably accomplished by Leslie Green. Green designed more than",Paragraph
50 stations for the Underground; the details of these stations are closely associated with,Paragraph
"the Arts and Crafts design movement, as extensive tilework unifies the entire station: the",Paragraph
"exterior, the interior of the booking hall, and the platform. The Underground continued to",Paragraph
"expand and change throughout the century. After World War I, the lines were routed",Paragraph
farther into the suburban hinterlands. Charles Holden designed many of the Under,Paragraph
"ground’s stations for this expansion, those on the Northern Line in a stripped classical",Paragraph
mode that continued the Underground’s signature use of thermal windows. In 1930,Paragraph
"Holden traveled throughout Northern Europe, experiencing firsthand Continental modern",Paragraph
architecture. His stations for the Piccadilly Line evince his conversion to the modern,Paragraph
cause and continued the Underground’s excellence in design. Postwar expansions and,Paragraph
"new lines have not always maintained this architectural excellence, but they have",Paragraph
consolidated a uniform corporate identity through the use of supergraphics and,Paragraph
typography.,Paragraph
"Although the first Continental subway was constructed in Budapest, the Paris Métro is",Paragraph
the early European subway best remembered for its architecture. Hector Guimard’s,Paragraph
stations interpreted plant and animal forms to create an otherworldly art. Guimard,Paragraph
"himself thought of these designs as being entirely rational, and in fact the Métro was at",Paragraph
"the time on the cutting edge of French industrial technology, and Guimard’s stations are",Paragraph
"very much industrial products. They were designed to be mass produced, being made of",Paragraph
"enameled steel and manufactured glass, and yet the form that Guimard adopts is anything",Paragraph
"but a machine aesthetic and not simple transformations of natural forms. For example,",Paragraph
Guimard’s lamp standards were designed not after a plant stem but after the sap within,Paragraph
the plant stem. Three different station types were designed to give the entire system a,Paragraph
coherence and a corporate look. The simplest and most common were the balustrades and,Paragraph
"signposts, the second topped these balustrades with an iron-and-glass canopy, and the",Paragraph
third comprised an entire pavilion into which a ticket booth and newspaper stand were,Paragraph
"incorporated. Guimard’s tenure with the Métro was short-lived, and subsequent designs",Paragraph
"have been less adventurous, conforming to the engineering requirements of the systems.",Paragraph
"Opportunities for inventive underground public spaces, such as at the massive",Paragraph
"interchange at Chatelet, were missed. However, public art and signature graphics",Paragraph
emboldened the visual experience of the Métro in the final decades of the century.,Paragraph
"The Vienna Stadtbahn, more of a depressed railroad than a true subway for most of its",Paragraph
"run, is one of the best designed and aesthetically consistent systems in the world; it was",Paragraph
Otto Wagner who made it so. Wagner was made the artistic director of the subway,Paragraph
system and the Niissdorf and Kaiserbad Dams in 1894. Few men in Vienna were as well,Paragraph
qualified for the task. Wagner had studied civil engineering and understood the,Paragraph
interdependent roles that the engineer and the architect must play in order to bring a,Paragraph
complex public works project to a successful conclusion. A comprehensive design,Paragraph
"program prevailed at the Stadtbahn. Wagner and his design team designed the stations,",Paragraph
"the bridges, the tunnels and cuts, and just about everything except the rolling stock and",Paragraph
"the locomotives. Wagner built 36 stations from 1894 to 1900, most which survive in",Paragraph
some form. All are located in the inner city and along the Wien River. The stations’,Paragraph
"forms vary according to the site conditions and the mood of the architect, but all share a",Paragraph
"similar vocabulary and material and are unified by their structural logic, proportion",Paragraph
"systems, and decorative motifs. Many of the stations are unapologetically classical in",Paragraph
"their vocabulary, and others are less overtly “architectural.” Bridgelike forms are",Paragraph
"frequent, particularly on the elevated lines. Probably the most famous of the stations",Paragraph
along the Stadtbahn is that at the Karlsplatz. The twin entry pavilions are modeled on the,Paragraph
"Turkish kiosk, a referent equally important to subways under construction in Budapest",Paragraph
"and New York. This exotic form fits the Karlsplatz stations perfectly, as the strong",Paragraph
curvilinear rooflines of the pavilions respond to the elliptical dome of the Karlskirche,Paragraph
across the square. The highly ornamented walls of the pavilions were composed of,Paragraph
"standardized panels, allowing them, in theory, to be mass produced. Wagner understood",Paragraph
the importance of the emerging technical society and embraced it. He was able to,Paragraph
reassemble his versatile forms in many ways in order to solve the numerous different,Paragraph
"sites the Stadtbahn demanded, thus ensuring a corporate look to the enterprise. This is a",Paragraph
quality that other systems lacked.,Paragraph
New York’s subway also owes its existence and initial appearance to a brilliant,Paragraph
"engineer. After numerous abortive attempts at subway building on Manhattan, the",Paragraph
Interborough Rapid Transit Company finally realized the plans of William Barclay,Paragraph
Parsons between 1900 and 1904. Although New York’s system was only the second in,Paragraph
"operation in North America (Boston’s subway was inaugurated in 1897), it quickly",Paragraph
became the most extensive system in the world. Although the system was largely,Paragraph
"constructed using excavation techniques perfected in London and Paris, Parson’s greatest",Paragraph
engineering achievement might be his establishment of a four-track main trunk.,Paragraph
"Architecturally, the first stations on the line were fairly simple affairs that again",Paragraph
combined features of Parisian and London station design. A station’s street presence was,Paragraph
"marked by mass-produced iron-and-glass kiosks, recalling the entry pavilions in",Paragraph
"Budapest. The stations themselves were largely rectangular in section, as appropriate to",Paragraph
"their shallow cut-and-cover construction, and distinguished by the forest of steel supports",Paragraph
supporting the street above and the terra-cotta and tile murals that identified each stop.,Caption
"The most elaborate station, at City Hall, was designed by Heins and Lafarge and vaulted",Paragraph
in Guastavino tile—the effect was intended to induce a spiritual response among the,Paragraph
throngs who used the station. As the New York system expanded into Brooklyn and,Paragraph
"Queens, the architectural qualities of the original line were sacrificed to economy and",Paragraph
"efficiency. Stations became less uniquely identifiable, and lines in the outer boroughs",Paragraph
"were as often as not perched on bents several stories above the street, remnants of the el",Paragraph
system that was slowly supplanted by the subway across the East River.,Paragraph
"While many subway systems purposefully projected a modern, industrial design",Paragraph
"stance, in Stalin’s Moscow political symbolism prevailed over any avant-garde aesthetic.",Paragraph
"Begun in 1931, construction of the Moscow subway was led by Lazar Kaganovich, the",Paragraph
"labor boss of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Dam and Nikita Khrushchev, and the labor was",Paragraph
"supplied by tens of thousands of conscripted unfortunates, thousands of whom died in the",Paragraph
"works. The initial line was completed in May 1935, but construction continued under",Paragraph
accelerated conditions until the Nazi invasion of Russia in the early 1940s. Whereas the,Paragraph
"engineering of the Moscow subway was quite forward looking, the architectural",Paragraph
presentation of the subway stations was by contrast decidedly traditionalist. The classical,Paragraph
vocabulary of many of the stations was designed to allude to great moments in Russia’s,Paragraph
"past and was a part of the larger public works effort, the “Columns for the People”",Paragraph
"campaign. The monumental classical spaces of the subway, such as the rococo foyer of",Paragraph
"the Komsolskaya station, were intended to demonstrate that the wealth of the nation, once",Paragraph
"squandered on the nobility and their palaces, was as graciously serving the needs of the",Paragraph
proletariat under the Soviet regime. Although Western architects may not have found,Paragraph
"Moscow’s historicist vocabulary worthy of emulation, the Moscow subway did",Paragraph
demonstrate that architecturally significant spaces could be achieved five stories,Paragraph
underground.,Paragraph
"Ironically, the subway most akin to Moscow’s in its emphasis on architectural space",Paragraph
"was built in Washington, D.C.Whereas most postwar subway design aspired to nothing",Paragraph
"more than functionalism, the Washington, D.C., Metro achieved a meaningful",Paragraph
architectural experience; this success is due to the genius of Harry Weese. Weese was,Paragraph
"trained by both Alvar Aalto and Eliel Saarinen in the grammar of modern architecture,",Paragraph
yet he was also the restoration architect of Adler and Sullivan’s Auditorium Building in,Paragraph
"Chicago and Daniel Burnham’s Union Station in Washington, D.C.Weese’s sensitivity to",Paragraph
the classical heritage of the District of Columbia fused with his functionalist sensibilities,Paragraph
"to produce a dynamic set of station designs that were at once monumental, almost",Paragraph
"sublime, and yet were produced from a limited set of architectural elements, most notably",Paragraph
the deeply coffered concrete vault. Allusions to Washington’s classical heritage are made,Caption
"by Weese but are never literal, as in Moscow. With their soaring intersecting groin vaults,",Paragraph
the primary interchange stations at Gallery Place and Metro Center are particularly,Paragraph
effective and have become memorable spaces in their own right in a city of overscaled,Paragraph
interiors.,Paragraph
The formal design of the subway station depended very much on the personal,Paragraph
philosophy of the architect. Where that philosophy was in tune with the artistic,Paragraph
"movements of the day, contemporary architecture resulted. Where the architect was not",Paragraph
"so moved, nothing in the subway problem prevented a revivalizing aesthetic. The best",Paragraph
subway systems hired designers who understood the complex contextual problems of the,Paragraph
subway and responded with an architecture that melded the technical requirements of the,Paragraph
building type with their own aesthetic vision.,Paragraph

"Architect, United States",Title
Louis Henry Sullivan was the first internationally recognized architect in the United,Paragraph
States to pursue the idea of a modern architecture independent of historic styles. He was,Paragraph
"supremely gifted as a designer of architectural ornament, an important component of",Paragraph
almost all his major buildings and central to his thinking about architecture as art.,Paragraph
Sullivan was the first American modernist to write extensively on architecture—,Paragraph
"critically, theoretically, and philosophically. He was the most outstanding creative figure",Paragraph
"of the Chicago School of the 1880s and 1890s, particularly because of his designs for tall",Paragraph
office buildings. His work and thought inspired a number of younger contemporaries,Paragraph
"throughout his later life, including Frank Lloyd Wright, who was Sullivan’s assistant",Paragraph
"from 1887 to 1893. From 1880 to 1895, Sullivan was continuously associated with",Paragraph
"Dankmar Adler (1844-1900), whose skills in architectural engineering complemented",Paragraph

partnerships in U.S. architectural history.,Paragraph
"Louis Sullivan was born in Boston on 3 September 1856, the younger son of Patrick",Paragraph
"Sullivan, an lrish dancing master, and his wife, Andrienne, a Swiss-born pianist. After",Paragraph
"graduating from Boston’s English High School, Louis studied architecture for one",Paragraph

"he went to Paris, where he gained admission to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in October 1874",Paragraph

The most architecturally ambitious and historically acclaimed among these buildings was,Paragraph

SUPERMODERNISM,Title
Critic and historian Hans Ibelings—borrowing from anthropologist Marc Augé—uses the,Paragraph
term “supermodernism” (also called “hypermodernism”) to describe a style of,Paragraph
"architecture emerging in the 1990s, characterized by structures that are often airy,",Paragraph
"minimalist or monolithic, and transparent or translucent and that use an abundance of",Paragraph
"glass. Although supermodern structures exploit technological innovation, they are",Paragraph
"generally visually and symbolically simple, with clean lines, a minimalist style, and",Paragraph
neutral materials.,Paragraph
"Theoretically, Ibelings situates supermodernism in relation to Postmodernism and",Paragraph
Deconstructivism and in conjunction with some of the aims of modernism. Ibelings,Paragraph
noticed common tendencies in several architectural books published in the mid-1990s:,Paragraph
"Terence Riley’s Light Construction (1995), Rodolfo Machado and Rodolphe el-Khoury’s",Paragraph
"Monolithic Architecture (1995), Vittorio Savi and Josep Ma Montaner’s Less fs More:",Paragraph
"Minimalism in Architecture and the Other Arts (1996), and Daniela Colfrancescchi’s",Paragraph
"Architettura in superfice; Materiali, figure e technologie delle nuove facciate urbane",Paragraph
(1995). The almost simultaneous publication of these texts describing a similar aesthetic,Paragraph
led Ibelings to condense formal and theoretical tendencies into a description of a coherent,Paragraph
architectural style.,Paragraph
Contributors to this style include contemporary international architectural firms such as,Paragraph
"Rem Koolhaas’s Office of Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), Jean Nouvel, Dominique",Caption
"Perrault, Herzog and De Meuron, and Ifiaki Abelos and Juan Herreros. Noteworthy",Caption
examples of supermodernist architecture include Jean Nouvel’s beautifully transparent,Paragraph
Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art and Head Office of Cartier France (1991—94) in,Paragraph
"Paris as well as his design for the Tour sans Fin (1989), a glass-topped tower to be built",Paragraph
in Paris’s La Défense. Also significant are Dominque Perrault’s new home for the,Paragraph
Bibliothéque Nationale (1989-96) in Paris as well as her Hotel Industriel Berlier (1985—,Paragraph
"90) in Paris and Koolhaas and OMA’s Educatorium (1997), a multipurpose building",Paragraph
designed for Utrecht University in the Netherlands.,Caption
"Supermodernism is a phenomenological architecture, an architecture that appeals to the",Paragraph
experience of place rather than to ideas or symbols. Although postmodernist and,Paragraph
deconstructivist approaches to architecture often appeal to intellectual and historical,Paragraph
"relationships among forms, supermodernism suggested a shift toward (perhaps even a",Paragraph
return to) the formal qualities of space and the visual and tactile sensations that,Paragraph
"accompany them. According to Ibelings, the emphasis on space and place rather than on",Paragraph
form (or style as an end it itself} contradicts one of the main tenets of postmodern,Paragraph
architecture—that a particular building is an often-contradictory composite of symbols or,Paragraph
signs that carry cultural and linguistic meanings. Supermodern architecture rejects the,Paragraph
desire or need to decode symbols and instead appeals to a range of physical as well as,Paragraph
psychological qualities perceived through the experience of the forms. Supermodern,Paragraph
buildings reflect neither the history of architecture nor extraarchitectural ideas.,Paragraph
The supermodern structure in part appeals to universal concerns (a stronghold of,Paragraph
modernist ideology of the earlier part of the century). This emphasis on universality,Paragraph
"reflects the current interest in globalization, which Ibelings links to homogenization and",Paragraph
commodification in art and architecture. Global homogenization has generated a rash of,Paragraph
"chain stores, internationally recognized products, and expressionless, nondescript",Paragraph
architecture in world cities that resemble one another as well as architecture that is no,Paragraph
longer built by local architects in local styles.,Paragraph
Linked to globalization is the development of what Augé calls “nonspace.” Nonspaces,Paragraph
"are spaces that “cannot be defined as relational, or historical, or concerned with",Paragraph
"identity” (Augé, 1995). Rather than social centers where communities gather for",Paragraph
"collective activity, nonspaces function as common places where groups of people come",Paragraph
"together yet experience the space separate from others. The current built environment is,",Paragraph
"according to Augé's somewhat relativist reading, meaningless. However, meaningless",Paragraph
"space arises as a reaction to three kinds of abundance: an abundance of space, an",Paragraph
"abundance of signs, and an abundance of individualism. The plethora of nonspaces",Paragraph
"creates what Augé calls the supermodern condition, an obvious reference to French",Paragraph
philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard’s 1979 seminal study La condition postmoderne:,Paragraph
rapport sur le savoir (The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge).,Paragraph
"Because globalization has increased world travel to a phenomenal extent, the airport",Paragraph
"perhaps functions as the quintessential nonplace, although supermarkets, hotels, and",Paragraph
oversized malls could be added to this list. Ibelings argues that the airport structure has,Paragraph
evolved into a universal type he describes as “an exposed,Paragraph
"Hotel Industriel Berlier, Paris, designed by Dominique Perrault and Partners",Caption

"steel construction (a space-frame or gigantic trusses), a marked preference for vaulted",Paragraph

contemporary airport encompasses services such as shopping in addition to a means of,Paragraph
"travel, and further serves as an economic center for the surrounding area, a trend that",Paragraph
reflects the transition of the symbolic city center to the periphery.,Paragraph
"Supermodernism maintains particular traditions of modernism; namely, an aesthetic of",Paragraph
"neutrality, minimalism, and abstraction. Yet supermodernist architects seek expressivity;",Paragraph
buildings are intended to be as autonomous and obviously separate from their,Paragraph

"thermal mass, shading, ventilation, and local construction materials, were all but",Paragraph
abandoned after the invention of artificial lighting and air conditioning. Except for,Paragraph
"several notable exceptions (i.e., organic movement), architecture of the first half of the",Paragraph
20th century disregarded the environmental context of buildings. The energy crisis,Paragraph
brought about by the 1973 Arab oil embargo hastened the return to energy-efficient,Paragraph
design. The passive solar architecture movement of the 1970s responded by offering,Paragraph
"appropriate technical solutions that, for the most part, failed to address broader",Paragraph
environmental and architectural concerns. The sustainability movement emerged in the,Paragraph
"late 1980s as an outgrowth of this period, adding to a heightened environmental",Paragraph
awareness determined to achieve more comprehensive and integrated design solutions.,Paragraph
The term sustainability has its origins in the 1987 World Commission on Environment,Paragraph
"and Development report, Our Common Future. The concept was central to “a global",Paragraph
agenda for change” in current development patterns focusing on both underdeveloped,Paragraph
"and industrialized countries. The term recognizes the interdependency of economic,",Paragraph
"social, and environmental factors necessary to sustain life on Earth. The defining quote",Paragraph
from this report is: “Sustainable development seeks to meet the needs and aspirations of,Paragraph
the present without compromising the ability to meet those of the future” (WCED 1987).,Paragraph
"Buildings and sites that utilize natural systems to minimize their global, regional, and",Paragraph
"local environmental impacts on land, energy, water, and materials form the basis of",Paragraph
"“sustainable” or “green” architecture. Human health, economic affordability, and social",Paragraph
equity are also considered attributes of sustainable design.,Paragraph
Sustainable architecture involves both design philosophy and technology. Practitioners,Paragraph
"in the field have written manifestos, statements of principles, and guidelines to clarify the",Paragraph
"goals, intentions, and aspirations for sustainable design. One such widely published",Paragraph
"document is the Hannover Principles by William McDonough, named after the World’s",Paragraph
Fair 2000 city in which the principles were drafted. The statements in this document,Paragraph
elucidate the inherent value of nature and our need to seek a more symbiotic relationship,Paragraph
with it. Guidelines for sustainable design by contrast tend to focus on applications of,Paragraph
design strategies or technologies. The journal Environmental Building News of,Caption
"Brattleboro, Vermont, provides one such checklist, which serves as a concise listing of",Paragraph
"building design and construction practices for any home owner, builder, or designer",Paragraph
interested in building sustainability.,Paragraph
"Technologies for sustainable architecture form a long, cross-cutting list of alternatives",Paragraph
that need to be adapted to local environmental conditions. Daylighting design (Guzowski,Paragraph
"2000), passive solar heating (Mazria 1979), passive cooling (Givoni 1994), water",Paragraph
"recycling and reuse, and biological wastewater treatment are primary sustainable design",Paragraph
strategies that combine innovations in technology with extensive design knowledge and,Paragraph
expertise. Computer tools are still mostly segmented providing design assistance for,Paragraph
"particular building performance issues such as energy (Energy-plus, DOE2, and Energy-",Paragraph
10) and lighting design (Lightscape and Lumen-micro). A design tool that links disparate,Paragraph
design and analysis components is Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories’ Building,Paragraph
Design Advisor. The Green Building Advisor by the Center for Renewable Energy and,Caption
"Sustainable Technology (CREST), E build, Inc., and Design Harmony, Inc. gives",Paragraph
"designers qualitative recommendations for sustainable design including bibliographic,",Paragraph
"video, and electronic resources as well as documented case study buildings.",Paragraph
Selection of building materials is another key focus of sustainable architecture.,Paragraph
Construction materials and methods are sought that are low impact throughout the entire,Paragraph
"material life cycle; that is, the materials should create less environmental damage in their",Paragraph
"extraction, processing, use, waste, and disposal phases than conventional alternates.",Paragraph
Green building materials typically have one or more of the following traits: they are,Paragraph
"durable, compostable, recyclable, re-usable, and nontoxic to humans. Many of the green",Paragraph
building materials not only demonstrate superior environmental performance but also do,Paragraph
not degrade indoor air quality when strict adherence to non-toxic content is heeded in,Paragraph
installation as well as in the material. Recent history of sick building syndrome calls,Paragraph
attention to the health risks of creating sealed buildings with insufficient ventilation and,Paragraph
finish materials that cause chemicals to disperse into the indoor environment. In 1996 the,Paragraph
American Institute of Architects published their guide to environmental building products,Paragraph
called the Environmental Resource Guide. This book gave qualitative descriptions of the,Paragraph
impacts of common building materials. Alternative building construction materials also,Paragraph
play an important role in sustainable design (Elizabeth and Adams 2000). Straw bale,Paragraph
"(Bainbridge et al. 1994), rammed earth (Easton 1996), cob, recycled tires (Reynolds",Paragraph
"1993), and fired ceramics (Khalili 1986) are the most familiar alternatives to",Paragraph
conventional construction systems used in sustainable building.,Paragraph
There are a number of exemplary buildings that illustrate the principles of sustainable,Paragraph
"architecture spanning a wide range of building types, scales, and geographical locations.",Paragraph
The examples presented here highlight the qualities that differentiate sustainable design,Paragraph
from conventional practice.,Paragraph
The Center for Regenerative Studies at California State Polytechnic University at,Caption
Pomona is an example of an integrated design solution demonstrating ecological site,Paragraph
"planning as well as sustainable building strategies. The project, built on 16 acres across",Paragraph
"from the main university campus, completed the first phase of construction in 1993",Paragraph
although design ideas originated in the classroom almost 20 years earlier under the,Paragraph
"tutelage of the late Professor of Landscape Architecture at Cal PolyPomona, John",Caption
"Tillman Lyle. Professor Lyle elaborated on the design process and solution in his book,",Paragraph
Regenerative Design for Sustainable Development. The specific sustainable design,Paragraph
strategies applied to the landscape include biological wastewater treatment through pond,Paragraph
"ecosystems, a solar farm with experimental solar electric technologies, habitat",Paragraph
"preservation for wildlife, and edible landscapes woven throughout the building site. The",Paragraph
buildings were designed by the architectural firm Dougherty and Dougherty as,Paragraph
"demonstration facilities, with a variety of passive solar heating and cooling strategies.",Paragraph
"Building materials were selected for their durability, low maintenance, and low embodied",Paragraph
energy. Recycled materials were used in the landscapes such as recycled tires for,Paragraph
retaining walls and recycled concrete paving for outdoor patio spaces. The Center also,Paragraph
enjoys its unique status as a social experiment for participatory student cohousing.,Paragraph
Another example of an integrated building and landscape solution is the passive solar,Paragraph
"subdivision, Village Homes, in Davis, California, by Mike and Judy Corbett that was",Paragraph
started in 1975 (Corbett 1988). This 70-acre site with 220 homes manages storm water,Paragraph
"drainage using natural landscape features, narrow shaded streets to decrease exterior",Paragraph
"summer temperatures, a street layout that supports solar access, and edible landscapes",Paragraph
throughout. Shared open space is developed between units adding to recreational use as,Paragraph
well as a sense of community. Energy consumption for the passive solar homes in this,Paragraph
subdivision is less than half that of conventional homes in the surrounding area. Less than,Paragraph
"10 per cent of the homes use mechanical cooling, which is a testimonial to passive",Paragraph
cooling in a climate that has many days reaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit in summer.,Paragraph
An example of a retail project utilizing the principles of sustainable architecture is the,Paragraph
"Real Goods Headquarters in Hopland, California. Real Goods, a retailer of renewable",Paragraph
"energy products, commissioned a building design that reinforced their corporate",Paragraph
philosophy toward environmental stewardship. Architects from the Ecological Design,Title
"Institute of Sausalito, California, designed a straw bale structure finished with",Caption
“PISE” (pneumatically installed stabilized earth). The south-facing semicircular plan,Caption
"optimizes interaction with the sun, with tall clerestory windows on the southeast to",Paragraph
capture morning light and shorter clerestories on the southwest to reduce late afternoon,Paragraph
solar gain. An exterior trellis protects lower windows from the hot summer sun where,Paragraph
visitors can enjoy the evaporative cooling effect from a water fountain in the entrance,Paragraph
courtyard. Light shelves on the interior diffuse and reflect light creating a soft glow.,Paragraph
Thermal mass is achieved through the concrete floor and interior PISE walls. The site has,Paragraph
"additional sustainable design elements, some built, others planned. There is a solar",Paragraph
"powered water pump at the entry, flow forms that can be used in water treatment as",Paragraph
"sculptural water elements, and retention ponds that form part of the landscape ecology.",Paragraph
The parking lot utilizes biofilters to minimize the effects of nonpoint source pollution,Paragraph
from automobiles. The restrooms for this complex are touted to passersby on the nearby,Paragraph
"highway as a “must-see.” Waterless urinals, recycled plastic toilet stalls, and reused toilet",Paragraph
tank tops as wainscoting are the predominant features. This project and a more general,Paragraph

recovering the costs of energy improvements in energy savings after four months and,Paragraph
reducing absenteeism by 15 percent (Roodman and Lenssen 1995). The bank is not only,Paragraph
"energy efficient, but it is also evocative in the variety of spatial experiences and",Paragraph
environments it creates.,Paragraph
The C.K.Choi Building at the University of British Columbia utilizes a surprising array,Paragraph
of bold and more common sustainable design strategies that are well integrated into the,Paragraph
"final design solution. The three-story 30,000-square-fbot office building has a long north-",Paragraph
south axis to preserve adjacent forest land. Although this could pose a challenge for,Paragraph
"passive solar heating, the architects skillfully used roof forms to maximize north",Paragraph
daylighting while creating a surface for mounting solar electric panels in the future.,Paragraph
Reclaimed materials used in the building include salvaged wood trusses from a,Paragraph
neighboring building undergoing demolition at the same time and recycled bricks. The,Paragraph
architects experimented with a trickle ventilation system at the windows to encourage the,Paragraph
infiltration of limited quantities of fresh air and utilized stack ventilation through the,Paragraph
daylight atriums to avoid a conventional ducted ventilation system. The immediate,Paragraph
landscape utilizes the building’s gray water. One of the building’s more unusual features,Paragraph
for the building type is its use of composting toilets in an office building.,Paragraph
There are many more examples of sustainable office buildings worthy of further,Paragraph
examination. These include the Audubon Building in New York City by the Croxton,Paragraph
"Collaborative, the Building Establishment (BRE) Headquarters in Hertfordshire,",Paragraph
"England, by Feilden Clegg Architects, the Menara Mesiniaga in Selangor, Malaysia by",Caption
"Kenneth Yeang, the Thoreau Center for Sustainability at the San Francisco Presidio by",Caption
"TLMS Architects, and an environmental studies building at Oberlin College in Ohio by",Paragraph
William McDonough.,Paragraph
"As seen in these projects, sustainable design goes beyond the energy savings goals of",Paragraph
"the 1970s by creating buildings that satisfy energy as well as ecological, aesthetic, and",Paragraph
"functional considerations through the overall design of building envelope, components,",Paragraph
"systems, and siting. Besides computer analysis of building systems, much of the decision-",Paragraph
"making and evaluation of sustainable architecture, however, is of a highly qualitative",Paragraph
nature. Quantitative assessments that benchmark sustainable buildings for performance is,Paragraph
a logical next step in the mainstreaming of sustainable architecture. A few of the current,Paragraph
assessment methods are discussed next.,Paragraph
An attempt to combine economic and environmental measures for sustainable building,Paragraph
"materials has produced a number of computer-based life-cycle assessment tools. BEES,",Paragraph
"Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability, from the National Institute of",Caption
Standards and Technology allows comparative analysis of material selections on their,Paragraph
"environmental merit (e.g., global warming, ozone depletion, embodied energy) as well as",Paragraph
"their economic cost. Other life-cycle assessment tools, such as the Canadian product",Paragraph
"ATHENA, allow a detailed environmental accounting of a product throughout its entire",Paragraph
"manufacturing and use cycles in terms of energy, water, air, and solid waste effects. A",Paragraph
"concept called the “ecological footprint,’ developed by Mathis Wackernagel and Bill",Paragraph
"Rees at the University of British Columbia, considers the far-reaching energy, water, and",Paragraph
material resource effects involved in everyday patterns and products of consumption but,Paragraph
does so in terms of replacement resources to ameliorate the environmental impact.,Paragraph
Another means for assessing environmental performance of sustainable architecture is,Paragraph
through the use of green building rating systems. Rating systems assign building,Paragraph
performance categories a value judged against a set of prescribed baseline criteria.,Paragraph
Malcolm Wells’s 1969 Wilderness-based Checklist is one of the earliest rating systems,Paragraph
using ecologically based accounting to tally the rewards of designs that improve,Paragraph
environmental quality against the penalties of those with the opposite effect. More,Paragraph
"recently, the U.S. Green Building Council developed a national rating system called",Paragraph
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). Regional adaptations to the,Paragraph
"categories in this system allow jurisdictions, such as cities, to tailor the ratings to their",Paragraph
"locality. Other examples of rating systems include the Austin, Texas, Green Builder",Paragraph

SWEDEN,Title
Swedish architecture at the beginning of the 20th century was characterized by the same,Paragraph
search for an appropriate style that was taking place on the European continent at the,Paragraph
"same time. In addition to a range of stylistic tendencies, architects faced new tasks",Paragraph
"resulting from social and political changes, housing shortages, rapid urban growth, and",Paragraph
the development of new materials and principles of construction. One of the most,Paragraph
significant responses to the advent of novel materials and construction techniques came,Paragraph
"from Ferdinand Boberg, the architect of the 1897 Stockholm Art and Industry Exhibition.",Paragraph
"Boberg rejected the prevalent adherence to a neo-Renaissance style, instead employing",Paragraph
simpler medieval and Romanesque forms and reevaluating the role of ormmament,Paragraph
"(Electricity Works, 1889-92; Rosenbad Bank Building, 1899-1904). Although he did not",Caption
"reject the uses of ornament, Boberg believed that a building’s form should be based on",Paragraph
function and that the inherent properties of materials used in its construction should be a,Paragraph
primary consideration. These notions would be further developed and find their fullest,Paragraph
expression later in the century.,Paragraph
"Governed by economic necessity, commercial buildings constructed around the turn of",Paragraph
"the century employed new, more efficient materials and methods of construction",Paragraph
"imported from outside Sweden. In 1898, Johan Laurentz constructed the first building for",Paragraph
commercial purposes in Stockholm using iron and glass as the major elements for the,Paragraph
"facade. One year earlier, in 1898, Ernst Stenhammar had used a steel frame to construct a",Paragraph
facade devoid of ornament derived from historical references; Stenhammar was also the,Paragraph
first Swedish architect to use reinforced concrete in the Myrstedt and Stern Building,Caption
(1908-10).,Paragraph
"Like materials and methods of construction, stylistic tendencies were subject to",Paragraph
importation and further contributed to the debate over what was appropriate. One end of,Paragraph
"the spectrum was represented by Carl Bergsten, whose Industrial Hall at the 1906 Art and",Paragraph
Industry Exhibition in Norrképing was clearly influenced by the work of Otto Wagner,Paragraph
"and other architects active in Vienna at the time, and the other by Georg A.Nilsson,",Paragraph
whose stripped-down facades and clear plans anticipated functionalism. Reacting to the,Paragraph
"former tendency, Carl Westman criticized the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm,",Paragraph
completed in 1908 by,Paragraph
"Gothenburg City Hall Extension (1913-37), by Gunnar Asplund",Caption
© Kevin Mitchell,Title
"Fredrik Lilljekvist, for its adherence to style at the expense of function and the",Paragraph
inconsistent use of ornament derived from the Art Nouveau and Jugendstil movements,Paragraph
that had developed in continental Europe. Westman’s own position was made clear in the,Paragraph
"Medical Association Building (1904—06) in Stockholm, which is characterized by clear",Paragraph
expression of material and simple facade treatment. The work of Westman and those,Paragraph
"influenced by it, such as Ragnar Ostberg (Ostermalm Teacher’s College, 1906-10;",Paragraph
"Stockholm Town Hall, 1902-23), Lars Israel Wahlman (Engelbrekt Church, 1905-14),",Caption
"and Sigfrid Ericson (Masthugget Church, 1907-14), has been categorized as part of a",Paragraph
movement known as “National Romanticism.”,Paragraph
"Reactions to National Romanticism included a return to a classical form language, as",Paragraph
exemplified in Ivar Tengbom’s Enskilda Bank Building (1912-15) and Swedish Match,Paragraph
"Corporate Headquarters Building (1926-28). During this period, influences from",Paragraph
neighboring Denmark were readily apparent and served to inspire the return to,Paragraph
"classicism, as in Carl Petersen’s Faaborg Museum (1912-15). The influence of classicism",Paragraph
is apparent in the early work of Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz. Of particular,Paragraph
note is the proposed crematorium for Helsingborg designed by Lewerentz and Torsten,Paragraph
Stubelius in 1914 and the development of the original proposal for the Woodland,Paragraph
Cemetery developed by Lewerentz and Asplund in 1915. While continuing work on the,Paragraph
"Woodland Cemetery, Asplund completed the Lister County Courthouse (1919-21), a",Paragraph
"decidedly classical building based on pure geometric forms, and the Stockholm Public",Paragraph
"Library (1924-28), which can be seen as indicative of the shift from neoclassicism to",Paragraph
functionalism.,Paragraph
"During the mid-1920s, attention turned to developments occurring on the European",Paragraph
"continent. One of the major proponents of the ideas developed there was Uno Ahrén, who",Paragraph
had traveled to the 1925 Paris Exhibition and reported on the work of Le Corbusier. The,Paragraph
1927 Stuttgart Exhibition and new housing being developed in Germany influenced,Title
"architects in Sweden at the time, as did the periodical Kritisk Revy, published by the",Paragraph
Danish architect Poul Henningsen between 1926 and 1928.,Paragraph
Among the earliest functionalist buildings designed by Swedish architects were the,Paragraph
industrial structures and housing in a company town known as the Kvarholm Complex in,Paragraph
"Nacka (1927-34) and the Tiden office building (1929), both designed by the Cooperative",Paragraph
movement’s architects office headed by Eskil Sundahl. Other significant functionalist,Paragraph
"buildings included an office building on Drottninggatan in central Stockholm, designed",Paragraph
"by Wolter Gahn, and the Student’s Building (1930) at the Royal College of Technology",Caption
"and the Helsingborg Concert Hall (1932), designed by Sven Markelius.",Paragraph
The 1930s was a time of great change in the social and economic structure of Sweden.,Paragraph
"High unemployment, housing shortages, and substandard living conditions plagued the",Paragraph
country. The response by architects came via the 1930 Stockholm Exhibition and the,Paragraph
"accompanying manifesto titled acceptera, or “accept.” The manifesto was written by",Paragraph
Gregor Paulsson (director of the Swedish Handicraft Association and general,Paragraph
"commissioner of the exhibition), Gunnar Asplund, Wolter Gahn, Sven Markelius, Eskil",Caption
"Sundahl, and Uno Ahrén. This document and the exhibition out of which it grew",Paragraph
attempted to outline an approach based on “everyday” issues. The main Exhibition,Paragraph
"Building (1930), designed by Asplund, who was appointed principal architect, clearly",Paragraph
reveals his affinity for functionalism. Asplund would go on to complete other significant,Paragraph
"buildings in Sweden, including the crematorium and adjoining chapels at the Woodland",Paragraph
"Cemetery (1935-40), the Bredenberg Department Store (1935), the extension to the",Paragraph
"Gothenburg Court House (1936), and the National Bacteriological Laboratory (1937).",Paragraph
"One of the major themes of the Stockholm Exhibition was housing, and of particular",Paragraph
interest were the open-plan terrace houses designed by Uno Ahrén. Problems associated,Paragraph
"with housing continued to plague Swedish society well into the 20th century, and the",Paragraph
Housing Commission was appointed in 1933 to investigate the problems and propose,Paragraph
"solutions. Out of these investigations came the concept of “collective” housing, and the",Paragraph
most significant contributions to this building type were the apartment block on John,Paragraph
Ericssongatan by Sven Markelius in 1935 and the Yrkeskvinnornas House (1939) by,Paragraph
Albin Stark and Hillevi Svedberg.,Caption
"Throughout the 1940s, the government worked to establish guidelines for housing.",Paragraph
"During this time, many architects reacted against the monotony resulting from the rows",Paragraph
of parallel blocks of apartments built to solve the housing shortage throughout the 1930s;,Paragraph
"notable proposals included the first tower block houses in Sweden, known as “star",Paragraph
"houses” because of their starlike plan configuration, built in Stockholm by Sven",Paragraph
Backstrém and Leif Reinius in 1945. Backstrém and Reinius were responsible for other,Paragraph
"inventive proposals, including a large housing area in Gréndal built between 1945 and",Paragraph
1952. The concern for large-scale solutions to housing problems is also manifest in plans,Paragraph
"for the area of Arsta in Stockholm, initiated in 1942 by Uno Ahrén and continued by Erik",Paragraph
and Tore Ahlsén into the 1950s.,Paragraph
The 1940s brought increased international attention to architecture in Sweden as a,Paragraph
result of the work of Backstrém and Reinius and others. Attention was once again,Paragraph
focused on Sweden with the publication of Sweden Builds in 1950 by G.E.Kidder Smith.,Paragraph
"In a 1947 article, the English periodical Architectural Review labeled the work in Sweden",Paragraph
"as a part of a movement known as “New Empiricism,” which was characterized as a way",Paragraph
of building on the basis of experience and a practical knowledge of material traditions.,Paragraph
"One the most significant contributions came from Nils Tesch, who, just as the previous",Paragraph
"generation of architects, turned to Denmark for inspiration, particularly the work of Kay",Paragraph
Fisker and C.F.Meller. A number of Danish architects had emigrated to Sweden during,Paragraph
"World War IJ, and a number of them worked for Tesch, including Erik Asmussen, who",Paragraph

"complete a series of simple churches built from dark-fired Helsingborg bricks, including",Caption
"the Church of St. Thomas in Vallingby (1959), Almtuna Church in Uppsala (1959), and",Paragraph
Bolinden Church (1960). Although Celsing introduced a building style that explored the,Paragraph
"role of brick in religious structures, it was Sigurd Lewerentz who demonstrated the full",Paragraph

St. Peter’s Church (1963-67).,Caption

"Chapel (1972), and the “Sparta” student housing complex and Lund University (1964—",Paragraph

The oil crisis in 1974 greatly affected Sweden’s economy and contributed to the,Paragraph
"collapse of the Million Program. Large-scale building programs were no longer feasible,",Paragraph
and much of the work for architects involved renovations and the upgrading of existing,Paragraph
buildings. Economic recovery in the 1980s generated new building commissions,Paragraph
resulting from urban-renewal programs and a number of “new towns” planned as an,Paragraph
alternative to urban sprawl. Of particular relevance is the area of Skarpnack on the,Paragraph
outskirts of Stockholm.,Paragraph
The search for an appropriate style that characterized turnof-the-century debates has,Paragraph
"reappeared in Sweden, accompanied by a multiplicity of approaches and stylistic",Paragraph
tendencies. Whereas the Vasa Museum (1990) by Mansson and Dahlback was clearly,Paragraph
influenced by contemporary architecture based on complex geometries and a divorce of,Paragraph

a series of houses by the Austrian architect Josef Franck in the late 1920s and early 1930s,Paragraph
and two apartment complexes by Swiss architects Alfred Roth and Ingrid Wallberg in,Paragraph
1930. Recent buildings by architects from other countries include the Volvo Headquarters,Paragraph

SWITZERLAND,Title
"Like other European countries, Switzerland’s architecture was dominated by historicism",Paragraph
at the turn of the century. This style emphasized correctness and distinction in design and,Paragraph
produced buildings that excelled in formal and aesthetic aspects. The Swiss National,Paragraph
"Museum (1898) in Ziirich by Gustav Gull exemplifies this approach with an irregular,",Paragraph
picturesque grouping of building shapes inspired by medieval architecture.,Paragraph
"At the beginning of the 20th century, Art Nouveau became the choice for architects",Paragraph
"intent on expressing a new beginning, a new “spring.” In Switzerland, this style",Paragraph
emphasized superficial qualities above all else and is found primarily in the decorative,Paragraph
"treatment of structural parts. Buildings were assembled from heavy elements, in utter",Paragraph
contrast to the delicacy of Belgian and Austrian Art Nouveau. These forms were derived,Paragraph
from historical styles but transformed into seemingly lighter structures. Through,Paragraph
"decoration, individual forms merge fluidly into one another. The ornamental treatment",Paragraph
emphasizes relationships and influences between parts and focuses on movement,Paragraph
expression. This is demonstrated especially in large building complexes that are,Paragraph
"articulated as pillar architecture, an example of which is the main building of the",Paragraph
"University of Ziirich (1914). Its architect, Karl Moser, was a pivotal figure in early 20th-",Paragraph
"century architectural development in Switzerland. During the 1920s, he would become a",Paragraph
"champion of modern architecture, even designing the Church of St. Antonius (1927) in",Paragraph
Basel in reinforcedconcrete construction.,Paragraph
Modernism in Switzerland presents the efforts of architects to transform an imported,Paragraph
style into a nationalized idiom. The machine aestheticism of the International Style,Paragraph
"seemed to complement Switzerland’s propensity to manufacture quality products. Thus,",Paragraph
Swiss architects excelled in adapting modernism and did not need to create a distinct,Paragraph
version. A close contact with the design cultures surrounding the country has always been,Paragraph
a trademark of Swiss architecture. Architects simply experimented with the new,Paragraph
constructional means and materials instead of producing creative transformations.,Paragraph
The Swiss national ethos of sobriety manifested itself as a combination of practical,Paragraph
reason and moral claims in this style. Rational logic was at the heart of this modernism.,Paragraph
"Thus, the International Style became a mirror for the Swiss self-view. This view was",Paragraph
based on values that were identical to the ideological intentions of modernist architecture.,Paragraph
"Buildings were solidly constructed in pure, slick cubical forms with flat roofs. In housing",Paragraph
"settlements, the buildings were differentiated according to typology, and groupings took",Paragraph
"into consideration the exposure to sunlight. Interiors tended to be open and well lit, thus",Paragraph
allowing for grand vistas in rather small spaces. Things inside were placed into the light,Paragraph
"to allow easy orientation. The buildings used setbacks and had balconies, and the plans",Paragraph
are efficiently laid out. The “dwelling for the existence minimum” was a big theme. For,Paragraph
"modernist architects in Switzerland, dwelling almost defined the profession. The best",Paragraph
"modernist work in the 1920s and 1930s is found in housing, either in individual structures",Paragraph
"or in communal settlements. In 1929, the Swiss Werkbund sponsored the Neubihl",Paragraph
"settlement in Ziirich (finished 1932), which continues to be considered a standard.",Paragraph
"Apart from having educated one of the masters of the International Style, Le Corbusier,",Paragraph
who designed a few exemplary houses in La-Chaux-de-Fonds in an attempt at a regional,Paragraph
"version of Art Nouveau, Switzerland also boasts a masterpiece of Expressionist",Paragraph
"architecture, the main alternative to the International Style. Rudolf Steiner’s Goetheanum",Paragraph
"(1928) in Dornach exemplifies this more intuitive, mystical interpretation of the industrial",Paragraph
"age. Its amorphous building mass uses a particular formal language, expressing the shell",Paragraph
that harbors renewal and whose purpose is to find the way to the spirit. William Lescaze,Paragraph
and Sigfried Giedion are two other Swiss names that are synonymous with the,Paragraph
International Style.,Paragraph
The political influence of German Fascism during the 1930s created a strong,Paragraph
opposition to modernism in Switzerland. The contrasting forces fought over stylistic,Paragraph
"choices, particularly in the temporary exhibition structures for the national exhibition of",Paragraph
1939 in Ziirich. This event became a watershed that pitted sobriety against sentimentality.,Paragraph
"Ultimately, the authorities compromised by charging modernist Hans Hoffmann with the",Paragraph
master plan but distributing individual pavilions to members of both camps.,Paragraph
"Consequently, regional Romanticism was side by side with a socialist modernism. Famed",Paragraph
bridge builder Robert Maillart designed a parabolic reinforced-concrete shed for the,Paragraph
"Swiss cement industry, and there was also a nostalgic little village containing examples",Paragraph
of regional houses. The temporary buildings were constructed in wood and had to,Paragraph
represent national contents through associations. Architects were forced to express the,Paragraph
"spiritual program of the exhibition, which had been set along notions of Swiss",Paragraph
"community. Architecturally, these political demands produced a mixed bag. Demands of",Paragraph
representation and symbolism were made of modernist forms that they were not able to,Paragraph
accommodate by their nature. It became clear that soberness was not sufficient as an,Paragraph
"ideological content. Architecture also had to cater to feelings, not just the intellect.",Paragraph
"Consequently, architectural images became conventional. Picturesque groupings replaced",Paragraph
"abstraction, and typological investigations of communal space became important. The",Paragraph
previously mentioned Maillart had opened new horizons in modern reinforcedconcrete,Paragraph
bridge construction. The shape of the supporting arch was used to stabilize the bridge and,Paragraph
also became a trademark icon.,Paragraph
"However, the slowdown in building activity during World War II allowed the nascent",Paragraph
modernist attempts to mature into a competent stylistic expression that provided a solid,Paragraph
"foundation for future architecture. After the war, the characteristics of building materials",Paragraph
"and their impact on structure, proportional systems, high quality of execution, and",Paragraph
"simplicity of form became trademarks of Swiss architecture. Nevertheless, the prewar",Paragraph
"design elements were reorganized. Rationality was now contrasted with sensuality,",Paragraph
"feeling, and emotion. Pragmatism was combined with aesthetic design. Human needs and",Paragraph
"a newly found respect for traditions changed functional design. However, typical Swiss",Paragraph
"character traits—freedom of thought, high standard of living, justice, and neutrality—are",Paragraph
"hard to represent and thus have not had a dramatic effect on architecture. Consequently,",Paragraph
modernist functionalism continued to be the mainstream of architectural development.,Paragraph
Especially the sculptural vehemence of Le Corbusier’s postwar work served as,Paragraph
"inspiration. Atelier 5’s Halen Settlement (1961) in Berne, as well as buildings by Dolf",Caption
"Schneebli, adapted the master’s concepts to local patterns of housing. Halen spread",Paragraph
collective services over a gently sloped site. Such designs experimented with the,Paragraph
sculptural potential of reinforced-concrete construction. Other Swiss architects exploited,Paragraph
sloping sites for terraced housing settlements. The Swiss sense for precision and,Paragraph
refinement came out in luxuriously detailed adaptations of Mies van der Rohe’s steel-,Paragraph
"and-glass boxes. Some architects excelled in designing for the traditional materials, wood",Paragraph
"and brick, and exploited them for interesting spatial explorations. Ernst Gisel’s Park",Paragraph
Theater (1954) in Grenchen is almost a literal copy of Alvar Aalto’s Saynatsalo Civic,Paragraph
Center.,Paragraph
These propitious beginnings would later fizzle out into empty applications of,Paragraph
technology to generate profit. This shoe box architecture was balanced by wildly shaped,Paragraph
concrete buildings that were for the most part trivial. There was also a large number of,Paragraph
"buildings, especially for tourist functions, that used a typical “Heimatstil.” Especially",Paragraph
large hotels in the mountains were shaped like overfed chalets or other farm and,Paragraph
"vernacular buildings. Nevertheless, Swiss architects hardly ever indulged in the historicist",Paragraph
frivolities that Postmodern architects produced in the United States. Good architecture,Paragraph
was still thought to rest on pragmatic principles. Swiss architects chose either to adapt,Paragraph
modernist forms to the topography or to expressively interpret the site. An example of the,Paragraph
former is the megalomaniac Cité du Lignon (1971) in Geneva. This is a huge apartment,Paragraph
"building in the form of a bent, one-kilometer-long slab with smooth facades that lacks",Paragraph
any human scale.,Paragraph
"During the 1960s, urban design in Switzerland was characterized by integrations of",Paragraph
new structures into existing environments. Multifunctional buildings expressed the high,Paragraph
civilization of the country. Housing settlements of sequential units interspersed with open,Paragraph
areas were built. Diversity was felt to be commensurate with the liberal and multicultural,Paragraph
Swiss society. Swiss architects also began building in developing countries. Andre,Paragraph
Studer’s innovative 1954 apartment building in Casablanca is a successful example of the,Paragraph
exportation of such Western standards to developing countries. In the Swiss Ticino,Paragraph
"region, architects such as Luigi Snozzi and Aurelio Galfetti integrated modernist shapes",Paragraph
into the rustic landscape and created a strong regionalist typology. There was a,Paragraph
"rediscovery of primitive architecture, which was praised for its rootedness in topography.",Paragraph
"The Ticino School advocated an architecture of rational technology, displayed in",Paragraph
impeccable details and execution. Their architecture was to focus on its most objective,Paragraph
"features. This, after all, is what the Swiss generally excel in. The main part of Galfetti’s",Paragraph
Communal Swimming Pool (1970) in Bellinzona is a footbridge that allows visitors to,Paragraph
survey the entire complex. The renovations and remodelings of the castle in Bellinzona,Caption
"have served many an architect to excel in combinations of new and old. Nevertheless,",Paragraph
Swiss architects did not advocate taking history only as myth or imagery but also as a,Paragraph
"source of knowledge and continuity. The Collegiate Church (1966) in Sarnen by Naef,",Caption
Studer and Studer embedded references to oval baroque plans into its bulging forms.,Paragraph
"Thus, sculptural shapes on the outside become rich spatial experiences inside.",Paragraph
"The younger generation of Ticinese architects, led by Mario Botta, has fashioned for",Paragraph
"itself an image of craft, even though their buildings are machine built. For these",Paragraph
"architects, architecture represents through abstraction. It intends to continue the",Paragraph
"tendencies inherent in the land and in history, thus the title “Tendenzen” of the 1975",Paragraph
exhibition that put this architecture on the map.,Paragraph
The various movements of the 1970s in one way or another provided updated,Paragraph
"interpretations of modernism. Continuing into the 1980s, Swiss architects produced a",Paragraph
good number of qualitatively excellent high-tech buildings. Theo Hotz’s Tele-phone,Paragraph
Exchange (1980) in Ziirich marks the edge of the city and stands out in its drab,Paragraph
environment as a cathedral to technology. Structure and mass of the building enter into a,Paragraph
mutual dialogue.,Paragraph
Historic preservation became a significant architectural task as well. An example is the,Paragraph
Museum of Contemporary Art (1980) in Basel by K. and W.Steib. The new addition adds,Paragraph
a moment of development to the existing context of warehouse buildings.,Paragraph
Emphasis on pure materiality was transmitted from the Ticino School to Herzog and de,Paragraph
"Meuron and Diener and Diener, two firms that were actively involved in the international",Paragraph
"reevaluation of Swiss architecture during the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, the",Paragraph
globalization of the information age has resulted in an utterly superficial approach to,Paragraph
building materials. Herzog and de Meuron’s buildings use contrasting materials in an,Paragraph
autonomous manner that is no longer structurally determined so that they ultimately lose,Paragraph
all meaning. The materials form simple contrasts without ever reaching a synthesis.,Paragraph
"Together with the abstract forms of their buildings, this produces pure geometry without",Paragraph
"details. None of the materials is allowed to dominate, and there is no effort to integrate",Paragraph
"them. Instead, each part is treated as a separate element, and the viewer is charged with",Paragraph
"their integration. Effects are created only through the materials, not through forms or",Paragraph
"other conventional features. Thus, imagery is purely material. The buildings then become",Paragraph
"spiritual expressions; that is, there is no metaphor, no iconography, no personal manner,",Paragraph
"and no attempt to create a complete, fulfilled form. The buildings present an architecture",Paragraph
"of entropy in which accepted notions and conventions are not applicable. Through this,",Paragraph
"the viewer is given a mere projection, just like reality is condensed on thin film in a",Paragraph
movie.,Paragraph
"However, there is hope yet for Swiss architecture. Successors have taken this aesthetic",Paragraph
level of materiality to a more mundane level and attempted to create beautiful buildings,Paragraph
"with everyday materials, such as wood and brick, and with traditional forms, such as",Paragraph
pitched slate roofs. This contemporary architecture rests on the foundations of modernism,Paragraph
but also considers the properties of materials and construction as well as the,Paragraph
characteristics of the topographical situation. These architects do not see the need to,Paragraph
produce original masterworks. It almost seems as if the current generation of Swiss,Paragraph
architects has learned the lessons that the modernist architects realized and spread after,Paragraph
World War Il. The present generation’s flag bearer is Peter Zumthor. His architecture is,Paragraph
"characterized by a virtuoso treatment of materials, first of wood, later also of stone and",Paragraph
glass. This is a far cry from the blasé materials of the stars of the 1980s. His Chapel Sogn,Paragraph
"Benedetg (1989) at Sumvitg imitates stone masonry, but because it uses wood, it",Paragraph
"reintegrates the building back to the people, making this religious structure look and age",Paragraph
"as the people’s own houses. Wood here gained a layer of symbolism. For Zumthor,",Paragraph
architecture is not what is in the materials but what these materials mean. His is an,Paragraph
architecture of reduction—to the essential forms and constructions without imposed,Paragraph
meanings. It is the building that needs to spark the imagination.,Paragraph

Australian architecture since 1945 has largely been about two architects: Harry Seidler,Paragraph
"(1923-) and Glenn Murcutt (1936—). Both are Sydney architects, and both are committed",Paragraph
"to modern architectural principles, yet they manage to exemplify the two quite different,",Paragraph
"if not opposed, architectural currents: a place-based modernism versus a modernist",Paragraph
internationalism.,Paragraph
Seidler’s career spans 50 years and includes a large number of high-quality houses. In,Paragraph
"the 1960s, he designed the 183-meter-high Australia Square Tower (1967) with Nervi as",Paragraph
"his structural consultant and the 65-story MLC Centre (1978). In the 1980s, Seidler",Paragraph

"and a radical departure from his customary freestanding approach, the Capita Centre",Paragraph
"(1990), which, like the Ford Foundation Headquarters (1968) in New York, was based",Paragraph
around a garden atrium.,Paragraph
"In 1956, Sydney held an international architectural competition for the design of a",Paragraph
performing arts center—a long-needed addition to its musical and theater cultural,Paragraph
"infrastructure. Jorn Utzon, a Dane, won the competition in a field of 230 submissions for",Paragraph
a remarkable design that he set about developing from Hellebaek. After three years of,Paragraph
"intense investigation by his structural consultant, Ove Arup and Partners, for the dramatic",Paragraph
"shell roofs, Utzon proposed a spherical geometry to suit prefabrication of the elements. In",Paragraph
"1966, Utzon withdrew from the project and was replaced by a Sydney consortium led by",Paragraph
Peter Hall that completed the project for its opening in October 1973.,Paragraph
"Utzon employed Australian assistants; of these, Richard Le Plastrier (1939—) has been",Paragraph
"the most faithful follower in terms of an anonymous landscape-based, organic domestic",Paragraph
idiom. The principal legacy of Utzon was the contribution of his Opera House to the city,Paragraph
itself and recognition that as a sculpture it completed and gave the city a climax that,Paragraph

Sydney Opera House remains unchallenged as Australia’s greatest work of architecture,Paragraph

"Glenn Murcutt’s career began with the Marie Short farmhouse (1975) near Kempsey,",Paragraph

"The force behind the Sydney Opera House was Eugene Goossens, who was appointed",Paragraph
conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in 1946 and a year later started an “opera,Paragraph
"house” movement. He was supported by the Labor politician Joseph Cahill (1891-1959),",Paragraph
who held the local government portfolio and subsequently became premier of New South,Paragraph
Wales in 1952.,Paragraph
"The project languished until November 1954, when Cahill sponsored a conference that",Paragraph
led to the establishment of a public committee that later agreed to hold an international,Paragraph
architectural competition in 1956 for which Jorn Utzon’s design was awarded first prize,Paragraph
in a field of 230 entries. Utzon’s scheme was enthusiastically endorsed by a jury,Paragraph
comprising Sir Leslie Martin and Eero Saarinen.,Paragraph
"Conceived in the mid-1950s, the Sydney Opera House project brief was formulated as",Paragraph
"a performing arts center with facilities for opera, concerts, and theater under one roof.",Paragraph
The enterprise was fraught with party politics from the outset. It was seen as a project of,Paragraph
a Labor Party premier who sought to enlarge access to music and theater for all the,Paragraph
citizens of Sydney during a period of acute postwar shortages. Popular opposition arose,Paragraph
"even within his own party, and Cahill cleverly circumvented these arguments by",Paragraph
establishing an Opera House Lottery to pay for the building.,Paragraph
The Opera House supplied Sydney with a much-needed civic climax that recognized,Paragraph
"the concentrating visual effect of its magnificent harbor and that, in the process,",Paragraph
"cemented its identity. Today, it is an international architectural icon and is regarded by",Paragraph
many people as one of the ten greatest architectural works of the 20th century.,Paragraph
"In 1956, when Utzon made his design, there was great interest in shell structures.",Paragraph
Vilhelm Lauritzen had built two remarkable shells in Copenhagen before this: the first,Paragraph
airport terminal in Kastrup (1939) and the Radio Building’s Studio 1 (1945). Utzon’s,Paragraph
Sydney design resembled these in its adoption of an inner acoustic shell suspended from,Paragraph
"a heavier outer shell. Felix Candela in Mexico and Eero Saarinen in the United States, in",Paragraph
"his TWA Terminal (1962), which was designed the same year with a paired arrangement",Paragraph
"of balanced flower-petal shells, are other examples.",Paragraph
"Both Saarinen and Utzon chose “free” structural forms that lacked circular,",Paragraph
"rectangular, or parabolic geometries. Although the TWA Terminal kept its free form,",Paragraph
"Utzon was criticized for his design’s lack of geometry, which was essential to standardize",Paragraph
"the formwork. When, after three years of intense research, Ove Arup and Partners failed",Paragraph
to establish a satisfactory mathematical description of the shell shapes after applying,Paragraph
"parabolic and then elliptical systems, Utzon broke the impasse in mid-1960 by proposing",Paragraph
a spherical geometry.,Paragraph
"In May 1965, there was a change of government. The incoming minister for public",Paragraph
"works placed himself in charge of the Opera House project, withheld permission for",Paragraph
Utzon to proceed with his scheme to use plywood for the interior acoustic shells and,Paragraph
"glass wall mullions, and delayed fee payments. In February 1966, Utzon withdrew and",Paragraph
"was replaced by an Australian team led by Peter Hall, who completed the third stage for",Paragraph
"the interiors in October 1973. Hall attempted to realize the work as Utzon intended, but a",Paragraph
Review of Programme submitted in December 1966 recommended that the Major Hall,Paragraph
"should be a single-purpose hall and that the opera should be transferred to the Minor Hall,",Paragraph
thereby eliminating the latter’s use as a theater on the grounds that the multipurpose hall,Paragraph
would not be functionally satisfactory. The acceptance of this flawed advice resulted in,Paragraph
"the elimination of grand opera and invalidated the composition of the roofs, whose size",Paragraph
had been determined by the volumetric requirements of the interior functions; the,Paragraph
demolition of the stage tower and the stage machinery from the Main Hall permanently,Caption
"crippled the Opera House. Its cost rose from $50 million to $102 million, and the",Paragraph
building’s completion was delayed four years.,Paragraph
The changes to the interiors were attended by a severe aesthetic loss when Peter Hall,Paragraph
"failed to continue in the same spirit as Utzon. Fortunately, the outside was largely",Paragraph
"unaffected, and the fame of the Opera House today rests largely on the brilliance of the",Paragraph
building’s external relationship to its maritime surroundings.,Paragraph
Le Corbusier completed his chapel at Ronchamp in June 1955. It is no accident that the,Paragraph
Ronchamp chapel and Utzon’s Opera House are formidable sculptural achievements: Le,Paragraph
Corbusier reacted to the four horizons and its isolated situation atop a sacred acropolis;,Paragraph
Utzon’s approach was similar: he visualized a promenade from the city to the Opera,Paragraph
House leading to its theaters and heightened its isolation further by pushing it to the end,Paragraph
"of Bennelong Point to increase the surprise of arrival. Like Le Corbusier, who similarly",Paragraph
"applied the idea of a “Promenade Architecturale” to Ronchamp, Utzon incorporated a",Paragraph
promenade into his architecture to enhance the pedestrian experience and increase the,Paragraph
interaction between his building and the site and its surroundings.,Paragraph
Utzon’s great concern was to devise the most dramatic route to approach his work by,Paragraph
entering it from below and moving upward through its interior spaces to reach the opera,Paragraph
and concert and theater halls. The building juts out into the harbor on a platform that he,Paragraph
shaped and extended vertically and that contains all the performance services. At its,Paragraph
"highest, he scooped out a pair of Greek amphitheaters, treating the platform as an",Paragraph
"artificial hill. With the two stages adjoining the south foyers, the two principal halls,",Paragraph
"placed lengthwise side by side, have dual foyers",Caption

"at their north and south ends but are entered along the sides. To reach the halls, patrons",Paragraph
climb a monumental external flight of stairs at the front or use an internal staircase to,Paragraph
reach the southern foyers and then move around the stage backs and up the platform to,Paragraph
"access the halls. The north foyers, used at intervals, face the water. The side spaces are",Paragraph
pressed between the auditoriums and the V-shaped ribs of the precast-concrete roof,Paragraph
vaults.,Paragraph
The glory of the Opera House is its white-tiled roofs surmounting the pink precast-,Paragraph
concrete platform. The Main Hall is straddled by three asymmetrical vaults and the Minor,Caption
"Hall by similar smaller vaults, and a separate vault encloses the restaurant on the",Paragraph
"southwest edge of the platform. Between the two main vault groups, a narrow canyonlike",Caption
"cleavage is formed; below this, a tunnel street gives access to the main under-stage",Paragraph
service areas. The open ends of the original shells were intended to be enclosed by gull-,Paragraph
"wing saddles of suspended glass between hollow plywood tubes, but Utzon’s proposal",Paragraph
was crudely simplified into stiff glass hoods supported on steel trusses.,Paragraph
The sculptural expressiveness and romantic immersion in the harbor setting went,Paragraph
beyond and challenged the prevailing functional ethic of modern architecture in 1957. Its,Paragraph
assertion of humanist values rooted in Gunnar Asplund and Alvar Aalto proclaimed a,Paragraph
new experiential sensibility that sought to soften the image of a machine aesthetic by an,Paragraph
appeal to the simple verities of an anonymous vernacular building. The freshness of the,Paragraph
Opera House has not dimmed with time; it seems as ageless as the Australian bush. Utzon,Paragraph
"was inspired by an anonymous language of technique, the building creating its own style",Paragraph
from the perfection of its means in the same way that a yacht achieves beauty through the,Paragraph
refinement and ultimate perfection of its shape in meeting the challenge of the sea and,Paragraph

SYMBOLISM,Title
"If architecture is as a system of cultural symbols expressing the identity, technology, and",Paragraph
condition of a society—or of one group within a particular class or location—at a specific,Paragraph
"point in time, then the symbolism attributed to individual buildings constitutes one way",Paragraph
"of interpreting cultural context and the built environment. Form, ornamentation, and the",Paragraph
choice of materials are all critical elements articulating symbolic content in architecture.,Paragraph
Symbolism was especially crucial for architecture in the Western world during the 20th,Paragraph
"century, reflecting the tremendous meaningful changes occurring in everyday life, in",Paragraph
"spiritual and political values, and in society. Because these changes were both synchronic",Paragraph
"and diachronic, different styles of architecture were produced and promoted",Paragraph
simultaneously by professionally trained architects as well as amateur builders.,Paragraph
"Sometimes this diversity recorded differences in economics, application, and intention,",Paragraph
but in other instances stylistic distinctions reflected profound oppositions in thinking. For,Paragraph
"example, at the beginning of the century, Beaux-Arts-trained architects produced both",Paragraph
Neoclassical and Arts and Crafts-inspired buildings. The structures following in the,Paragraph
"classical tradition indicated a desire for monumentality, formality, and the continuance of",Paragraph
"traditional values, societal hierarchies, and building typologies, whereas the Arts and",Paragraph
"Crafts-inspired buildings used local materials, changes in building form and plan, and",Paragraph
"motifs selected from medieval vernacular architecture to represent ideals of home,",Paragraph
"handicraft, and the simplicity of a preindustrialized world in reaction to the political,",Paragraph
"economic, and social turbulence of the time.",Paragraph
The beginning of the 20th century is also notable for the work of other architects who,Paragraph
"experimented with form, materials, and ornament to create a new style of architecture",Paragraph
expressive of the Zeitgeist. Art Nouveau was one new aesthetic resulting from this,Paragraph
"exploration exemplified in the organic designs of Victor Horta, Hector Guimard, and",Paragraph
Henry van de Velde. These Euro pean architects and designers sought inspiration in,Paragraph
"nature in the same way that their contemporaries, such as Josef Hoffman, Charles Rennie",Paragraph
"Mackintosh, and Antonio Gaudi, looked to local building traditions for inspiration.",Paragraph
Another new aesthetic celebrated the materials and capabilities of industry. The,Paragraph
exposedaluminum rivets in Otto Wagner’s Post Office Savings Bank (1904-06) in,Paragraph
Vienna and Peter Behrens’ steel stanchions in the AEG factory (1908-09) in Berlin are,Paragraph

building construction and the wider promise and potential of the machine.,Paragraph
"By the 1930s, the machine aesthetic evolved into what came to be called International",Paragraph
Style architecture by Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson in the catalogue,Caption
accompanying the 1932 Museum of Moder Art (New York) exhibition. The machine,Caption
aesthetic was utopian at its core and aimed at improving the lives of the working classes,Paragraph
"through the introduction of affordable, utilitarian, machine-produced goods and economic",Paragraph
"construction. Conventional applied ornamentation, considered a demonstration of the",Paragraph
"class systems and social ambitions that led to World War |, was rejected as historical and",Paragraph
"emblematic of an outmoded way of life. In its place, designers substituted factory-sash",Paragraph

Mendelsohn’s designs were quickly understood by Percival Goodman and formed the,Paragraph

"TAFURI, MANFREDO 1935-94",Title
"Architectural historian and critic, Italy",Title
Manfredo Tafuri was among the more dominant thinkers of architecture and society in,Paragraph
the final third of the 20th century. Tafuri was born in Rome in 1935 to a Jewish mother,Paragraph
and Catholic father. His early interests included painting and philosophy. Trained as an,Paragraph
"architect at the University of Rome, he moved quickly from design to research, becoming",Paragraph
involved in issues of planning and urban organization in the early 1960s. In the late 1960s,Paragraph
"and early 1970s, he wrote a series of penetrating books that became the guides for",Paragraph
"advanced thinking about architecture in the modern world. In the later 1970s, he shifted",Paragraph
"his interests to Renaissance architecture, and though his work in that field did not achieve",Paragraph
"the same following, he became one of its keenest observers.",Paragraph
"Although Tafuri studied architecture at the University of Rome, his was not a",Paragraph
conventional education. His early years were marked by the formation of oppositional,Paragraph
groups. He created seminars and discussion groups and founded a magazine,Paragraph
"(Contropiano) with other disaffected colleagues (notably Alberto Asor Rosa, Mario",Paragraph
"Tronti, and Massimo Cacciari). At one point Tafuri sought to form a union of architects",Paragraph
and architectural students to bring an uncorrupted voice to the discussion of the,Paragraph
regulatory plan for Rome. He was an assistant within the architecture department in,Paragraph
"Rome from 1964 to 1966. From 1966 to 1967, he taught at the University of Palermo. In",Paragraph
1968 he was brought to the University of Venice by Giuseppe Samona.,Paragraph
The key work of Tafuri’s early career was titled Teorie e storia dell’architettura,Paragraph
(Theories and History of Architecture) (1968). There he took a stance against what he,Paragraph
"called “critica operativa” (operative criticism), the instrumentalization of the past to",Paragraph
"justify current actions or, more dangerously, the use of the past to validate the potentials",Paragraph
of future freedom. In this formulation he leaned heavily on the writings of Martin,Paragraph
"Heidegger, but he was also very much interested in the writings of Marc Bloch and",Paragraph
"Lucien Febvre from the French Annales school of history, then little known in Italy.",Paragraph
In 1968 Tafuri took over the leadership of Istituto Universitario di Architettura at the,Paragraph
University of Venice. He used it as a forum to bring together specialists from various,Paragraph
disciplines in the university to study historical issues and gathered there a brilliant group,Paragraph
"of architectural historians, including Giorgio Ciucci, Marco de Michelis, Mario Manieri-",Paragraph
"Elia, and Francesco dal Co. Concerned with practical but fundamental matters of",Paragraph
"scholarly historical method, he also reached out to other disciplines and quickly",Paragraph
"developed a series of initiatives. A conference “Socialism: City, Architecture” (1970), for",Paragraph
"example, examined the nature of urban planning in the 1920s and 1930s in the Soviet",Paragraph
"Union, and a jointly authored book on the American city titled La cittd americana dalla",Paragraph
guerra civile al New Deal (The American City from the Civil War to the New Deal),Title
(1973) took up the nature of development under capitalism. Both were helpful in defining,Paragraph
"Tafuri’s political position in this turbulent period, and he became a significant participant",Paragraph
in debates on the role of the Italian Communist Party.,Paragraph
"At the same time, Tafuri’s work also began to be noticed in the United States. In 1974",Paragraph
"he published his first essay in the periodical Oppositions, which later published more of",Paragraph
"his essays as well as those of his Venetian collaborators, most notably Dal Co and Ciucci.",Paragraph
"He helped to introduce the work of Aldo Rossi in the United States. Tafuri had, naturally,",Paragraph
a particular reception in the United States. North American architects were engaged in the,Paragraph
critique of modernism and intrigued by the revival of history and theory. Tafuri’s first,Paragraph
title that was translated into English was Architecture and Utopia (1976; Italian edition:,Paragraph
"Progetto e utopia: Architettura e sviluppo capitalistico, 1973), a work that, like Teorie e",Paragraph
"storia dell’architettura, attempted to redefine (and limit) the functions of the architect",Paragraph
and historian within contemporary culture. Tafuri brought to American architecture an,Paragraph
"entirely new language of analysis based on “distance,” “alienation,” and “masquerade,”",Paragraph
terms borrowed from European philosophy that presume a tragic view of human history.,Paragraph
"For Americans accustomed to their own optimistic or descriptive readings of architecture,",Paragraph
"Tafuri’s analyses were startling, and the influence of Tafuri has been traced by Ockman",Paragraph
to the work of both Peter Eisenman and John Hejduk. Tafuri’s thoughts on the avantgarde,Paragraph
and on American architecture were collected in La sfera e il labirinto: Avanguardie e,Paragraph
architettura da Piranesi agli anni ‘70 (The Sphere and the Labyrinth: Avant-gardes and,Title
"Architecture from Piranesi to the 1970s) (1980; English edition, 1987).",Paragraph
One of the great difficulties in coming to grips with Tafuri’s writing is his protean,Paragraph
nature. He operated on many fronts simul-taneously and with equal effect. In the same,Paragraph
"year as La citta americana, for example, he published a book on the Via Giulia subtitled",Paragraph
"Una utopia urbanistica del ‘500 (Villa Giulia: An urbanistic utopia of the 1500s) (1973),",Caption
which followed the fate of a single street through the process of its development starting,Paragraph
"with Pope Julius Il in the early 16th century. From the later 1970s, in fact, Tafuri’s",Paragraph
"interests shifted to a deeper past. Venezia e il Rinascimento: Religione, scienza,",Paragraph
"architettura (Venice and the Renaissance: Religion, Science, Architecture} (1985) and",Paragraph
"Ricerca del Rinascimento: Principi, citta, architetti (Renaissance Research: Princes,",Caption
"Cities, Architects) (1992) defined the range of his interests in a total history of the sort",Paragraph
that recalls earlier interest in the Annales school.,Paragraph
Efforts to define the stages of Tafuri’s career tend to fall into the kinds of Hegelian,Paragraph
stylistic categorization that Tafuri himself eschewed. It is true that his later withdrawal,Paragraph
from contemporary issues of architecture entailed a retreat from some of the political,Paragraph
"issues that marked his work in the 1960s. Moreover, his involvement with exhibitions",Paragraph
(notably Giulio Romano and Francesco di Giorgio) gives the impression of a return to,Paragraph
more traditional forms of biography. Tafuri helped sponsor some of the most,Paragraph
conservative scholars of Italian architecture at the University of Venice. All of this has,Paragraph
"led some to define the later, Renaissance-based period of his scholarly activity as",Paragraph
conservative. Yet these decisions were probably strategic and personal rather than,Paragraph
"principled. Tafuri defined himself as an educator and saw exhibitions, even monographic",Paragraph
"exhibitions, as a way to raise historical issues to a broader public. Tafuri modeled his",Paragraph
own scholarly practice on the architectural team and was anxious to have the best,Paragraph
specialists around him.,Paragraph
Tafuri’s scholarship concerning the Renaissance remains buoyantly transgressive.,Paragraph
"Giulio Romano and Francesco di Giorgio, to whom he devoted extensive attention, are",Paragraph
figures whose willingness to run against the academic traditions of their own times,Paragraph
"appealed to him enormously, and he caught their contrary nature very well. He was even",Paragraph

TALIESIN WEST,Title
"Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright; completed 1937 Scottsdale, Arizona",Caption
There were two significant transitional points in Frank Lloyd Wright’s long career.,Paragraph
One is marked by the abandonment of his first practice in Oak Park and the design of his,Paragraph
rural Wisconsin home known as Taliesin (1911-14). The other is marked by his move,Paragraph
beyond Wisconsin to the Arizona desert and the construction of Taliesin West (1937).,Paragraph
"During the early portion of his career, Wright had been engaged with the interior realm of",Paragraph
"the family and its relationship to the larger society beyond, ideas embodied in his “Prairie",Paragraph
house” designs. His move to Taliesin is marked by the study of the relationship of man,Paragraph
"and mind to landscape. Almost 30 years later, Taliesin West marks the fulfillment of that",Paragraph
effort as a giant step forward in Wright’s ability to conceive architectural languages as,Paragraph
expressions of the human condition.,Paragraph
"The “desert compound,” as Taliesin West was originally known, consisted of a loosely",Paragraph
woven group of enclosures divided roughly into four quadrants by two crossing axes. The,Paragraph
"orientation of the primary north-south axis in the plan is about 20 feet west of south,",Paragraph
"facing the afternoon sun. Along with a drafting room, a large room for communal",Paragraph
"gatherings, and Wright’s own study, the compound initially included quarters for the",Paragraph
"families of the architect and his apprentices, sheltered places for dining and kitchen",Paragraph
"duties, fireplaces, pools, and gardens. In its original form, these were not so much rooms",Paragraph
as places for the designated activi-,Paragraph
"Taliesin West, Scottsdale, Arizona (1937)",Caption

ties of the Taliesin Fellowship strewn about the desert in an openly ordered pattern.,Paragraph
Taliesin West was built by Wright and the apprentices of his Taliesin Fellowship with,Paragraph
minimal help from professional builders. Large stones were gathered from the,Paragraph
surrounding land-scape and stacked loosely together in battered wooden forms. A lean,Paragraph
mixture of concrete and desert sand was poured over the rocks. The resulting recumbent,Paragraph
"walls are intermingled with level terraces stretching 300 feet across the desert floor,",Paragraph
"barely protruding above the ground in some cases, in others rising to create cavelike",Paragraph
sanctuaries protected from the searing heat of the desert sun. The large drafting and,Paragraph
"gathering spaces, as well as Wright’s private study, were spanned with redwood trusses.",Paragraph
"These reach across entire sections with skeleton-like repetition, acting as ribs beneath",Paragraph
which were hung canvas stretched frames lapped to shed what little rain there was.,Paragraph
Similar canvas frames added around the sides and under the eaves could be opened to,Paragraph
regulate the presence of sun and wind. The contrast between the heavy raking masonry,Paragraph
"walls and these floating, light-filled canvas panels formed the architectural backdrop for",Paragraph
the activities of the camp.,Paragraph
"In its original form, the entire roof structure was disassembled each spring in",Paragraph
preparation for the Fellowship’s annual move back to Wisconsin. The canvas panels were,Paragraph
"taken down and stored, leaving only the low stone walls and open redwood frames to",Paragraph
"suffer the intense heat of the Arizona summer. In later years, as Wright began to stay",Paragraph
"longer into the summer season, the canvas was replaced by plastic, the open spaces were",Paragraph
"glazed, and the central parts of the building were eventually air conditioned, making it",Paragraph
quite a different place today.,Paragraph
The plan of Taliesin West is organized by the use of two crossing axes that intertwine,Paragraph
distant features of the landscape and its history with the pursuit of daily activities in the,Paragraph
camp. The pattern of movement along these assumes a quartering of space and,Paragraph
experience that was characteristic of Wright’s domestic designs going back to his Prairie,Paragraph
"houses. Here in the desert, the quartered scheme is opened outward in a new way along",Paragraph
axes that emerge from the land to direct attention through the man-made forms to the,Paragraph
stark beauty of the natural world beyond. His own evaluation is perhaps the most,Paragraph
"poignant: “The whole opus looked like something we had been excavating, not building”",Paragraph
"The entry establishes an axis of movement through the compound, from the public",Paragraph
"areas of contact with the city and the automobile to private areas of staff and family,",Paragraph
"cloisters, and walled gardens. The left side of the plan generally contains places of work.",Paragraph
The right side of the plan contains places that contact with the stillness of the desert: the,Paragraph
apprentice quarters and Wright’s own Usonian dwelling. The pathway between these two,Paragraph
"spaces is sunk into the ground of the mesa. This pathway, dominated and sheltered by the",Paragraph
"mountains, brings the viewer into contact with another axis moving downward to the",Paragraph
south. The point of crossing of these axes was originally dramatically marked. As the,Paragraph
"crossing was reached, the earth forced its way through the retaining wall and across a",Paragraph
"small pool of water directly on axis with the 6,000-foot height of Thompson’s Peak in the",Paragraph
distance. Here the architectural forms open to the right under a shaded loggia into which,Paragraph
one is naturally drawn out of the heat of the Arizona sun. It is from this point that the,Paragraph
immensity of the view southward across the desert first becomes apparent. One is drawn,Paragraph
"by this vista, unavoidably, down a few steps and out again into the full force of the sun to",Paragraph
peer upward into the distance.,Paragraph
"This experience is reached by a movement downward in plan, from shelter to exposure,",Paragraph
"from depression in the earth, where you are close to rock and water, to an elevated",Paragraph
position in the full glare of the desert sun with almost infinite vista. The upper portions of,Paragraph
the plan as originally built were left mostly natural and devoid of buildings and offered,Paragraph
controlled views of the wall of mountains to the north. In contrast the lower portions of,Paragraph
the plan offer exposure to the distance and to the desert sun. The first axis had led away,Paragraph
"from civilization into areas of recess, retreat, and privacy. This second movement is more",Paragraph
"elemental in nature. It leads from physical to ethereal, from solid to open, from earth to",Paragraph
"sky. Years earlier at Taliesin, the crest of a hill occupied the center of the architectural",Paragraph
"composition; here in the desert, at Wright’s final home, that center was thrown out across",Paragraph
the landscape in expression of the timeless quest for the bond that exists between the,Paragraph
mind of man and the natural world.,Paragraph

"TANGE, KENZO 1913",Title
"Architect, Japan",Title
"For the quarter century following World War I, Kenzo Tange was among the world’s",Paragraph
leading architects; his work defined post-war modernism in Japan. Tange’s promising,Paragraph
"beginning, after graduating from the University of Tokyo in 1938 and then working for",Paragraph
"Kunio Maekawa for four years, was enhanced by the almost complete disappearance of",Paragraph
architectural practice during the latter days of the war. This absence allowed him to,Paragraph
"return to the University of Tokyo in 1946, and he remained there as a student and",Paragraph
member of the faculty until 1974.,Paragraph
"In his spectacular debut, winning first place in the Far East Greater Coprosperity",Paragraph
"Sphere Competition of 1942, Tange engaged the nationalist spirit of the time, gaining",Paragraph
recognition through the controversy that emerged. His proposal for a monument to,Paragraph
"Japan’s fallen soldiers, to be built on a long axis beginning at the foot of Mount Fuji, was",Paragraph
influenced by Japan’s temple precincts. By blending Japanese traditions with European,Paragraph
"modernism, Tange took a very different position than others of his generation who",Paragraph
wholeheartedly embraced an international style.,Paragraph
For many years Tange’s work was unabashedly regionalist. Through 1960 Tange,Paragraph
"defined a new Japan, infused with tradition and optimistically reflecting the utopian",Paragraph
hopes of the era. He embraced the symbols Japan’s citizens held dear but overlaid them,Paragraph
with an enthusiasm for new technologies. This approach is seen in some of his best built,Paragraph
"works: his first, the Hiroshima Peace Memorial and Museum (1955), was inspired by the",Paragraph
sukiya character of buildings such as Katsura Imperial Villa; the surface treatments of the,Paragraph
facades at both Kagawa Prefectural Offices (1959) and Kurashiki City Hall (1960) drew,Paragraph
"on Japan’s timber traditions, but in concrete used at a monumental scale; and in the later",Paragraph
"Olympic Stadia (1964, Tokyo), Tange’s roofs were structurally remarkable but",Paragraph
"comfortingly close to the form of Japan’s traditional farmhouses. Critics, however,",Paragraph
"tended to disparage buildings with ties to tradition, favoring more sculptural efforts, such",Paragraph
as the Children’s Library (1953) at Hiroshima. Tange began to treat traditional nuances as,Paragraph
"a failing, but today it is those buildings that were initially dismissed by critics that better",Paragraph
"define his reputation. Yet while Tange’s early sculptural works were clumsy, they served",Paragraph
"as the basis for several extraordinary buildings from the 1960s, including not only the",Paragraph
"Olympic Stadia but also St. Mary’s Cathedral (1964, Tokyo) and the Memorial to Fallen",Paragraph
Soldiers (1966).,Paragraph
"From the beginning Tange also emphasized the urban and regional scale, using axiality",Paragraph
"as an ordering device. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Tange drew on an emerging",Paragraph
"political will, reflecting the introduction of democratic ideals through his “mass-human”",Paragraph
spaces dedicated to collective activities. Many of his designs for government institutions,Paragraph
sandwiched offices between publicly accessible roof terraces (the Kagawa Prefectural,Paragraph
Hall had a popular cocktail bar on its rooftop) and an open ground plane slipped through,Paragraph
first-floor pilotis.,Paragraph
"In 1961 Tange founded URTEC, Urbanists and Architects Team, inspired by Gropius’s",Paragraph
The Architects’ Collaborative. His designs from the 1960s tended toward structuralism.,Paragraph
"Complexes were organized into a three-dimensional system made up of service cores,",Paragraph
"circulation paths, and bridgelike blocks or figural units dedicated to programmatic needs,",Paragraph
with opportunities for future additions. The most powerful of these is a 1961 plan for,Paragraph
"Tokyo Bay, developed with students at the University of Tokyo. Participants in this",Paragraph
"design—among them Fumihiko Maki, Arata Isozaki, Kiyonori Kikutake, and Kisho",Paragraph
"Kurokawa—went on to shape Japan’s most exciting architectural movement,",Paragraph
"Metabolism. Although none of Tange’s urban plans were executed, two notable buildings",Paragraph
were completed using similar principles: the Yamanashi Press and Broadcasting Center,Paragraph
(1966) and the Shizuoka Press and Broadcasting Center (1970) in Tokyo. The final,Paragraph
"Metabolist undertaking was Expo ‘70 in Osaka, the first full-scale demonstration of a",Paragraph
Metabolist city. The public received the project more as an entertainment than as a rare,Paragraph
"opportunity to recognize the value of a comprehensive urban proposal, and the movement",Paragraph
collapsed under its failure to be understood.,Paragraph
"At roughly the same time, community resistance scrapped Tange’s proposal for Yerba",Paragraph
"Buena (1969) in San Francisco, which was also based on structuralist principles.",Paragraph
"Suddenly, enormous size was no longer a merit: The architect whose works had deftly",Paragraph
represented the conflicts and ideals of Japan’s postwar boom found himself out of step.,Paragraph
"At first Tange found opportunities to work in Europe, but as the West and Japan began to",Paragraph
"address the ecological fallout of megaprojects, demand for Tange’s work shifted to Arab",Paragraph
"nations and, in the early 1980s, Southeast Asia. At one point 70 to 80 percent of the",Paragraph
"firm’s work came from abroad. His projects from this period often remained unbuilt, and",Paragraph
those that were completed took an average of ten years from basic design through,Paragraph
"execution, making it difficult for Tange to respond to innovations in construction",Paragraph
"technologies. Furthermore, he was less able to develop a language that reflected the",Paragraph
"hopes of these unfamiliar cultures, and buildings from this period seem awkwardly fitted",Paragraph
to their time and place.,Paragraph
Tange’s architecture continued to draw on many earlier themes. He remained,Paragraph
concerned with large-scale complexes organized in response to clear principles. In his,Paragraph
"interiors he often developed a polished monumentality, especially notable in the Akasaka",Paragraph
"Prince Hotel (1982). His architecture from this period is generally less appreciated,",Paragraph
"though, as strategies from his earlier work became formulaic. In the final years of his",Paragraph
"career, however, Tange began again to build symbolically important works in his native",Paragraph
"country, especially the New Tokyo City Hall (1991) and the United Nations University",Paragraph
"Building (1992). These buildings, while not as vigorous as works from his youth, retain a",Paragraph
monumentality and sense of detail that are clearly related to his earlier masterpieces.,Paragraph
"Tange also found a way, in the end, to create a large-scale order in the city of Tokyo—",Paragraph
not through his revisions to the Tokyo Bay Plan (1986) but in his design of two of,Paragraph
Tokyo’s tallest buildings. The New Tokyo City Hall and the nearby Tokyo Park Tower,Paragraph

"gain access. However, this taciturn position is justified by his architecture. Although his",Paragraph
"buildings are certainly photogenic, it is impossible to appreciate their spatial and",Paragraph
contextual strengths without physically experiencing them.,Paragraph
Taniguchi’s maternal grandfather was one of Japan’s earliest architects and later,Paragraph
became the head of the Tokyo branch of a major construction company. Taniguchi’s,Paragraph
"father, Yoshiro Taniguchi, was a contemporary of Kunio Maekawa and a respected",Paragraph
"architect in his own right. Although little known abroad, Yoshiro Taniguchi was",Paragraph
"entrusted with several commissions on behalf of Japan’s royal family, and he also",Paragraph
designed notable religious and commemorative structures. Originally inspired by,Paragraph
"northern European modernism, Taniguchi’s father also designed his own house—a",Paragraph
laboratory for the father and an inspiration to his son. In some ways Yoshio Taniguchi’s,Paragraph
"work is the fruit of two generations; he shares many objectives with his father, especially",Paragraph
an appreciation for serial experience and for compositionally pure organization.,Paragraph
"Yoshio Taniguchi holds fond memories of childhood visits to construction sites, but he",Paragraph
also feared that his father’s reputation stood as too significant a challenge. He initially,Paragraph
"decided to pursue a related field, taking a degree in mechanical engineering from Keio",Paragraph
"University in 1960. His father, however, conspired with Kiyoshi Seike to encourage the",Paragraph
younger Taniguchi to go to the United States; Taniguchi graduated from Harvard,Paragraph
University with a master’s degree in architecture in 1964. He was the first Japanese,Paragraph
architect to receive licensing following an architectural education exclusively gained,Paragraph
"abroad, and he took Japan’s licensing examinations only following some difficulty.",Paragraph
"While at Harvard, Taniguchi met Kenzo Tange, and he joined Tange’s office and his",Paragraph
"Tokyo University research laboratory on his return to Japan in 1965, staying with the",Paragraph
firm until 1972. Taniguchi’s approach from this period closely resembles his mentor’s,Paragraph

"(1991), the Marugame Museum of Contemporary Art (1991), and the Toyota Municipal",Paragraph
Museum of Art (1995).,Paragraph
Taniguchi’s first working experiences were as part of a design team (along with Arata,Paragraph
"Isozaki) working on Tange’s plans for the rebuilding of Skopje, Yugoslavia. Two",Paragraph
"features of this plan, an encircling “City Wall” punctured by prominent “City Gates” at",Paragraph
"crucial locations, seem to have influenced Taniguchi’s work. Embracing protective walls",Paragraph
"with highlighted entry points recur in his exquisite, carefully proportioned plans.",Paragraph
"Amplifying this strategy, boxes nested within boxes establish an increasingly removed",Paragraph

"serene, and understated, often informed by contrast. Movement through his earliest",Paragraph
"buildings juxtaposes centripetal and centrifugal spaces, and in later works, dark alternates",Paragraph
with light.,Paragraph
"Despite the crisp, modernist appearance of his work, Taniguchi strives for a timeless",Paragraph
character and is comfortable embracing Japan’s design traditions. Many of his finest,Paragraph
"works, including the Tsukuba City Theater (1999) and the Tokyo National Museum of",Paragraph
"Horyuji Treasures (1998), are successors to Katsura Imperial Villa: delicate, complex,",Paragraph
and highly refined. His sparing use of exquisitely apt materials demonstrates both artful,Paragraph
"restraint and subdued elegance. Diaphanous screens, slender columns, and tapered",Paragraph
extremities are evident in his frequently published sections and detail drawings and result,Paragraph
"in an exaggerated thinness. These knifelike planes demarcate expansive, fluid spaces.",Paragraph
Buildings extend into their surroundings through the controlled use of shakkei (borrowed,Paragraph
"landscape), and the edge between interior and exterior is often articulated by a stepped",Paragraph
"configuration said to resemble geese flying in formation, further blurring the distinction",Paragraph
between inside and outside.,Paragraph
"With the exception of the Tokyo Sea Life Park Aquarium (1989), Taniguchi’s work is",Paragraph
at its best when it is strictly orthogonal. His architecture is based on movement through,Paragraph
"an uncompromising three-dimensional spatial matrix, determined not only by an",Paragraph
organizing lattice but also by a complex layering of horizontal and vertical planes.,Paragraph
"Sharply drawn lines link contiguous spaces whereas taut, uninterrupted planes extend",Paragraph
from one room to the next. Taniguchi is concerned with the processional character of his,Paragraph
buildings and their spaces; as a consequence the quality of light has become increasingly,Paragraph
important in his designs. Glowing interiors draw one deeper into these buildings through,Paragraph
"bounded, cavelike enclosures. He plays with a notable range of light effects, from single",Paragraph
"beams breaking dim rooms to large, brightly lit volumes. Taniguchi has also",Paragraph
"experimented with varying degrees of translucency, from the extraordinary clarity",Paragraph
resulting from the insubstantial-looking glass cage of the Kasai Rinkai Visitors’ Center,Paragraph

materials are considered and reconsidered right until their final installation.” Taniguchi,Paragraph
"makes a point of acknowledging the contributions of experienced constructors, and he",Paragraph
uses these relationships to exploit the latest material and technological innovations.,Paragraph

Bruno Taut was one of the leading architects in the development of a modem,Paragraph
architecture in Germany. He worked from a traditional historicist style to a colorful,Paragraph
Expressionism before World War | and then helped create a rationalized “New Building”,Paragraph
in which he maintained a sense of color and creativity that transcended the austere,Paragraph
machine aesthetic and objectivity of his International Style peers. His career can best be,Paragraph
"divided into four major phases: training and early works, 1903-12; Expressionist",Paragraph
"experiments, 1912-23; large-scale social housing projects in Berlin, 1924-31; and exile",Paragraph
"in Russia, Japan, and Turkey, 1932-38.",Caption
"Taut was born in K6nigsberg, East Prussia (present-day Kaliningrad, Russia), the son",Paragraph
of a merchant and older brother of prominent architect Max Taut. He was educated at the,Paragraph
local building college and received further training in the offices of leading contemporary,Paragraph
"architects Bruno MGhring in Berlin (1903), Theodor Fischer in Stuttgart (1904—08), and",Paragraph
the urban designer Theodor Goecke at the Technical University in Berlin (1909). In 1909,Paragraph
Taut opened an office in Berlin with Franz Hoffmann and was joined by his brother Max,Paragraph
"in 1914, although they maintained separate design practices. The first commissions were",Paragraph
"for apartment buildings in Berlin in which Taut created abstracted, Secessionist-style",Paragraph
compositions within a traditional framework.,Paragraph
In 1912 Taut was appointed advisory architect to the reform-oriented German Garden,Paragraph
"City Association, which led to commissions for two housing developments: the “Reform”",Paragraph
"Siedlung (housing estate) in Magdeburg, Germany (1913-14, 1921-23), and the",Paragraph
Falkenberg Garden City southeast of Berlin (1913-14). In both developments Taut,Paragraph
"combined traditional garden city ideals and small, plain pitched-roof houses with brightly",Paragraph
"colored facades as an inexpensive, expressive way to enliven architecture without",Paragraph
traditional historicist ornament.,Paragraph
"Beginning in 1912, Taut also received a series of commissions for important",Paragraph
"experimental exhibition pavilions to advertise new construction materials, including the",Paragraph
“Monument to Iron” in Leipzig (1913) and the famous “Glass House” at the Werkbund,Paragraph

"glass industry, contained glass-block floors, a sparkling waterfall, walls lined with",Paragraph
"brightly colored tiles and prism glass, and a multifaceted, colored-glass dome with",Paragraph
"reinforced-concrete ribs. The pavilion was dedicated to the poet Paul Scheerbart, whose",Caption
fantastical writings praised glass as the material of the future. The important critic and,Paragraph
Taut’s friend Adolf Behne championed glass in the popular press as the harbinger of a,Paragraph
"new, modern architecture for the future.",Paragraph
"As a committed pacifist, Taut refused to participate in World War |, but in December",Paragraph
"1918, within days of the German surrender, he and Walter Gropius formed the short-lived",Paragraph
revolutionary Working Council for Art. This was an organization of young artists and,Paragraph
"architects intent on promoting a visionary new architecture of colorful, magical forms",Paragraph
"that were free of all the burdens of past traditions, ornament, and materials. Taut",Paragraph
"publicized his own dreams in several books, including Alpine Architektur (1919; Alpine",Paragraph
"Architecture) and Die Aufldsung der Stddte (1920; The Dissolution of Cities), and a",Paragraph
series of utopian writings circulated among his friends that were later dubbed the “Crystal,Paragraph
"Chain Letters.” All advocated the dissolution of existing cities in favor of a purified,",Paragraph
crystalline architecture of colored glass. Throughout his life Taut used the power of the,Paragraph
"press to circulate his ideas to a larger audience, writing 21 books and nearly 300 articles",Paragraph
over the course of his career.,Paragraph
In 1921 the newly elected socialist government of Magdeburg hired Taut as chief city,Paragraph
"architect, offermg him an opportunity to implement some of his utopian ideas. He",Paragraph
"oversaw the extension of his own colorful Reform Siedlung, built a large concreteframe",Paragraph
"exhibition hall, and initiated a controversial but widely publicized program of colorizing",Paragraph
existing urban facades to enliven the drab cityscape of postwar Magdeburg. Rampant,Paragraph
"inflation and increasing criticism of his avant-garde ideas, however, soon ended his",Paragraph
tenure.,Paragraph
"The most productive phase of Taut’s career began in 1924, when he accepted an offer",Paragraph
to oversee the design of large socialized housing developments in Berlin for the,Paragraph
communal building association GEHAG in cooperation with the chief city planner of,Paragraph
"Berlin, Martin Wagner. In seven very productive years, Taut designed more than 10,000",Paragraph
units of affordable housing that proved to be among the most important achievements in,Paragraph
"public housing of the century. Alongside Wagner, Taut became increasingly committed",Paragraph
"to rationalized, standardized, and largely prefabricated construction systems, and",Paragraph
functional and efficient apartment layouts and furnishings that became models for,Paragraph
"housing all over the world. Large-scale developments, such as the “Horseshoe” Siedlung",Paragraph
"in Berlin-Britz (21,374 units, 1925-31) and Onkel Tom’s Hiitte in Berlin-Zehlendorf",Paragraph
"(1915 units, 1926-31), were built in a radically modern architecture of mostly flat roofs,",Paragraph
"unornamented facades (except for Taut’s trademark color), and plenty of green space that",Paragraph
provided a welcome relief for Berlin’s working class. The developments helped alleviate,Paragraph
"a dire housing shortage and, along with built-in social institutions such as libraries, sports",Paragraph
"fields, communal laundries, dining facilities, and social clubs, helped promote worker",Paragraph
solidarity and the socialist political ideals of Berlin’s city government.,Paragraph
The success of these projects earned Taut a prestigious professorship in housing and,Paragraph
city planning at the Technical University of Berlin from 1930 to 1932 as well as an,Paragraph
honorary membership in the American Institute of Architects. The worldwide economic,Paragraph
"depression and an increasingly conservative and rightwing press and political machinery,",Paragraph

"offers to work in the young Soviet Union, which had been relatively untouched by the",Paragraph

German architects in search of opportunities to implement their dreams of a new,Paragraph
architecture for a new socialist society. Taut moved to Russia in 1932 and began plans for,Paragraph
"a hotel and several institutional buildings as well as a master plan for Moscow. However,",Paragraph
"political pressure soon forced him on the move again, briefly to Germany, where Adolf",Paragraph
"Hitler had started to campaign against all modern architects in 1933, and then on to",Paragraph
Japan.,Paragraph
"Taut stayed in Japan for three years, writing books, designing well-crafted furnishings",Paragraph
"and household objects, and studying the ancient building traditions of Japan, which he",Paragraph
"found surprisingly similar to European modern architecture. He was, however, unable to",Paragraph
"build anything in Japan because of his émigré status. Eager to build, in 1936 Taut once",Paragraph
again followed a number of German colleagues and accepted an offer from the Turkish,Paragraph

Ministry of Education. His attempt to combine local Turkish building traditions with,Paragraph

"TAVORA, FERNANDO 1923-",Title
"Architect, Portugal",Title
Fernando Tavora can be considered one of the most important exponents of,Paragraph
contemporary Portuguese architecture; he symbolizes the deep cultural renewal that has,Paragraph
gradually allowed Portugal to again play an important role in European architecture. His,Paragraph
poetical language is the fine result of a particular cultural background that has led him to,Paragraph
create a new Portuguese architecture based on a careful dialogue between modernity and,Paragraph
tradition. Most of his works show that he has explored new paths to enhance the,Paragraph
"traditional values of rural Portuguese architecture: Each project evokes the past, but his",Paragraph
"designs follow principles of modernity, including functional spaces, accurate details,",Paragraph
"refined shapes, perfect integration to natural sites, and traditional materials. In other",Paragraph
"words, Tavora’s architecture is not “something different, special, sublime, but work made",Paragraph
"for man by man.” Thanks to his long teaching experience (university professor, Faculty",Paragraph
"of Architecture in Oporto and Coimbra), he has become one of the main reference points",Paragraph
for a new generation of Portuguese architects.,Paragraph
"Fully aware of architecture by Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, Tavora sought",Paragraph
ways to blend traditional Portuguese architectural forms with those of the modernists. In,Paragraph
1947 he wrote an essay titled “O problema da casa portuguesa” (The Problem of the,Paragraph
"Portuguese House), in which he explained his point of view for reinvigorating Portuguese",Paragraph
architectural language: “The typical house will provide us with many important lessons,Paragraph
"when properly studied, since it is the most functional and less fanciful; in short it comes",Paragraph
"closest to the new intentions. ...In contemporary architecture, a promising consistency is",Paragraph
"looming on the horizon...with which Portuguese architecture should merge, without fear",Paragraph
of losing its identity... It does not fade away like so much smoke; if we do possess this,Paragraph
"individuality, nothing will be lost by studying foreign architecture.” However, in the",Paragraph
"works of this period (1947-52), Tavora appears not yet to be able to adapt these",Paragraph
principles to his projects.,Paragraph
Tavora’s efforts to combine modernity and tradition show promise in one of his first,Paragraph
"public projects for Oporto, the Municipal Park of Quinta da Conceicao (1960), which",Paragraph
"included the simple Tennis Pavilion, his first masterpiece. The park shows elements of its",Paragraph
"past: an old monastery, founded in the 15th century. In the quiet landscape of the old",Paragraph
"cloister, the chapel and the pools fit well with the elegant design of new modernist",Paragraph
spaces. Tavora himself describes the Tennis Pavilion as the work of “a young architect,Paragraph
"torn between reality and dream, the local and the international, the model and the",Paragraph
history.” The design recalls traditional elements of Portuguese rural architecture and,Paragraph
Japanese religious structures. With its balanced proportions and the use of traditional,Paragraph
"materials (wooden trusses and white concrete), the small pavilion “contains a certain",Paragraph
"remote oriental influence, as does traditional Portuguese architecture from the sixteenth",Paragraph
century onwards.”,Paragraph
"Tavora’s experiments continue to blend different elements, modern and traditional, in",Paragraph
"the Summer House (1958) in Ofir. Placed in a Mediterranean pine grove, the house is",Paragraph
"divided into three functional blocks (living room area, services, and bedroom area)",Paragraph
connected by a large covered passage. The whole building evokes local rural architecture,Paragraph
"with its geometric white surfaces, wooden trusses, red-tiled roof, paved loggias, and",Paragraph
colored chimneys.,Paragraph
"Throughout his career, Tavora has incorporated moder and traditional Portuguese",Paragraph
forms to create simple and clean spaces where various cultural references coexist. His,Paragraph
"literary discussion about architecture carries on and generates other complex works, such",Paragraph
"as the Gondomar Convent (1971), the Convent of Santa Marinha da Costa Inn (1984),",Paragraph
and the Agriculture High School Refoios do Lima (1993). They highlight the evolution of,Paragraph
his thinking about traditional and modern architecture in Portugal.,Paragraph
"The Gondomar Convent is articulated into various blocks, each fulfilling a different",Paragraph
"function (dormitories, chapel, meeting rooms, and refectory). Linking buildings with the",Paragraph
"site, Tavora arranged the blocks to follow the natural slope of the landscape. Materials",Paragraph
"(gray granite, white concrete, and red-tiled roofs) recall local rural architecture and",Paragraph
enhance a critical reuse of Portuguese architectural values. The conversion of the 18th-,Paragraph
century Convent of Santa Marinha da Costa to a pousada (the typical Portuguese inn),Caption
allowed Tavora to further develop his principles. This project is not a mere restoration of,Paragraph
the old walls of the convent but rather a subtle attempt to insert modern structures in an,Paragraph
architectural continuity. The conceptual methodology adopted in the restoration of the,Paragraph
convent is clearly explained by Tavora himself: “The general criterion used was to carry,Paragraph
"on innovating the already long life of the old building, by preserving its most important",Paragraph
areas and creating spaces of quality resulting from the new functional use introduced.”,Paragraph
The new bedroom section is not a simple addition of forms but rather represents the,Paragraph
continuous transformation of the whole building. Popular forms of rural architecture,Paragraph
inspired the design of the new parts of the convent: the integration between the old and,Paragraph
the new suggests continuity more than rupture. A similar conception was successively,Paragraph
adopted for the Refoios do Lima Convent’s conversion to the High School for,Paragraph
"Agriculture (1987). The interior values of the existing structures are unchanged, and the",Paragraph
yellow ancient walls are carefully linked with the new buildings.,Paragraph
"In summing up Tavora’s contribution to 20th-century architecture, it is useful to",Paragraph
conclude with the words of the critic Manuel Mendes. He asserts that “Tavora’s,Paragraph
"architecture is not influenced by any particular architect, by any one particular school or",Paragraph
"period, it encompasses the whole dimension of memory: his work in its apparent",Paragraph
"simplicity, is the most original and erudite stylistic research carried out in recent years in",Paragraph

TEAM X (NETHERLANDS),Title
Team X was an architectural group formed in the early 1950s by a number of young,Paragraph
European architects. The participants were dissatisfied with the mid-20th-century Modern,Paragraph
"movement, particularly with the ideals of CLAM (Congrés Internationaux d’ Architecture",Paragraph
"Moderne), with which they had previously been affiliated. Oscar Newman’s CLAM ‘59 in",Paragraph
Otterlo and Alison Smithson’s The Emergence of Team 10 out of C.LA.M. document,Paragraph
Team X’s official secession from CIAM. Factions that began to appear at the CIAM IX,Paragraph
meeting in Aix-en-Provence in 1953 between the old guard and the younger generation,Paragraph
"anticipated the split. Under that meeting’s theme, “Habitat,” the younger members",Paragraph
"contested the simplistic divisions of living, working, leisure, and circulation that had been",Paragraph
established in the Athens Charter. Alison Smithson contends in Team 10 Meetings:,Paragraph
1953-1984 that the first Team X meeting took place during the meeting at Aix-en-,Paragraph
"Provence. Following the events of CLAM IX, the “youngers” were entrusted with",Paragraph
preparing the subject matter for the CIAM X meeting and from then on were known as,Paragraph
"Team X.Alison and Peter Smithson (England), Aldo van Eyck (Netherlands), Jaap",Caption
"Bakema (Netherlands), Georges Candilis (France), Shadrack Woods (France), John",Paragraph
"Voelcker (England), and William and Jill Howell (England) were the founding members",Paragraph
"of Team X. Participants in Team X altered considerably during the group’s existence, but",Paragraph
in general the group remained small and was defined by its reaction to the inefficiencies,Paragraph
of the large CIAM commissions.,Paragraph
Curtis maintains in Modern Architecture since 1900 that the members of Team X,Paragraph
initially advocated the moral convictions of the early Modern movement but were,Paragraph
discontented with CLAM’s incapacity to respond to growth and change. They felt that,Paragraph
"culture, climate, and context were not being addressed and opposed the modernist",Paragraph
"philosophy of “tabula rasa.” However, Francis Strauven acknowledges in his article “The",Paragraph
Dutch Contribution: Bakema and Van Eyck” that even the method of achieving these,Paragraph
mutual goals was not easily agreed on by the members of the group. Bakema and van,Paragraph
"Eyck, both of whom requested modification of an original draft by the Smithsons of the",Paragraph
"Doom Manifesto (January/February 1954), had their suggestions for the document",Paragraph
"initially ignored. Finally, an appendix to this manifesto, called the “Dutch Supplement,”",Paragraph
was added.,Paragraph
Few similarities generally existed between Team X members. Individual participants,Paragraph
varied in their method of working and in their perception of how a building was,Paragraph
produced. Alison Smithson argues in Team 10 Meetings: 1953-1984 whether even the,Paragraph
group’s function as a forum for the development of individual architectural concerns was,Paragraph
necessary for each architect’s work to have advanced.,Paragraph
"The most influential manifesto produced by Team X is the Team 10 Primer, published",Paragraph
in 1962 and edited by Alison Smithson. It consists of a compilation of quotations from its,Paragraph
members at the time. John Voelcker and William and Jill Howell were no longer listed as,Paragraph
"members in Team 10 Primer, being replaced by Giancarlo de Carlo (Italy), José Antonio",Paragraph
"Coderch y de Sentmenat (Spain), C.Pologni (Hungary), Jerzy Soltan (Poland), and",Paragraph
"S.Wewerka (Germany). Extracts explore issues initiated by the CLAM commissions, such",Paragraph
"as mass housing and urbanism through the multilevel city, including the Smithson’s",Paragraph
proposal for the Golden Lane Housing Competition using the concept of “streets in the,Paragraph
"air.” This proposal was strongly influenced by their relationship with Nigel Henderson, a",Paragraph
"photographer of London’s working-class communities, and their involvement in the art",Paragraph
"collaborative, the Independent Group.",Paragraph
Van Eyck’s elaboration of the doorstep metaphor and his criticism of twin phenomena,Paragraph
is another important contribution found in Team /0 Primer. In the chapter on Van Eyck,Paragraph
"in Modern Architecture: A Critical History, Kenneth Frampton acknowledges how Van",Paragraph
Eyck differed from the other participants of Team X in regard to the severity of his,Paragraph
"critique of the Modern movement. Before his involvement with Team X, Van Eyck had",Paragraph
undertaken extensive studies of anthropological concerns through his personal interest in,Paragraph
“primitive” cultures.,Paragraph
Formal meetings of Team X members were generally held annually. In 1962 a well-,Paragraph
documented Team X meeting occurred at Abbaye Royaumont. Its importance lay in,Paragraph
Team X’s acknowledged independence from CIAM concerns. Once again the listed,Paragraph
participants had changed. Projects presented included the Waterford School in Swaziland,Paragraph
"by Pancho Guedes (South Africa/ Portugal), the Tibro housing project by Ralph Erskine,",Paragraph
"John Voelcker’s Council Offices and proposal for Tilbury House in Maidstone, Peter",Caption
"Smithson’s studies of metropolitan London, José Antonio Coderch y de Sentmenat’s",Paragraph
"studies of slums in Barcelona, Christopher Alexander’s study of Indian villages,",Paragraph
"Kurokawa’s capsules, Aldo van Eyck’s interest in the large-house/ little-city image, Jaap",Paragraph
"Bakema’s gallery housing, Giancarlo de Carlo’s plans for Milan, Christopher Dean and",Paragraph
"Brian Richards’s studies of Euston Station, Shad Woods’s interest in pedestrian avenues,",Paragraph
and Georges Candilis’s Toulouse-le-Mirail. The records of “Team 10 at Royaumont”,Paragraph
differ from those in Team 10 Primer in that they chronicle the interactive discourse by,Paragraph
participants in the projects presented. The contributions of architects of different,Paragraph
"nationalities, speaking English to varying degrees, resulted in frustration with this",Paragraph
meeting’s outcomes.,Paragraph
"In 1982 the final Team X family included Alison and Peter Smithson, Aldo van Eyck,",Paragraph
"Georges Candilis, José Antonio Coderch y de Sentmenat, Giancarlo de Carlo, Jerzy",Caption
"Soltan, Ralph Erskine (Sweden), Manfred Schiedhelm (Germany), Pancho Guedes, and",Paragraph
"Julian de La Fuente (France). No longer driven to respond to CIAM inadequacies, the",Paragraph
group lost effectiveness and was disbanded in 1984.,Paragraph
The contributions made to 20th-century architecture by Team X include the production,Paragraph
of important writings such as Team 10 Primer and their capacity to reassess the existing,Paragraph
canon of the Modern movement. Equally important are the built works and writings of,Paragraph
"Team X members. In his article “Team 10 after the Sex Pistols,” Willem Jan Neutelings",Paragraph
"acknowledges the impact of Team X on the Dutch architecture that followed, citing a link",Paragraph
to Rem Koolhaas’s work. Similarly the Smithsons influenced British architecture through,Paragraph

TECTONICS,Title
The term ¢ectonics alludes to the formally expressive capabilities inherent in architectural,Paragraph
"forms, both as singular components and in relation to the building assembly as a whole.",Paragraph
"This aspect of architectural form has, therefore, a greater meaning than either the",Paragraph
dictionary definition of tectonic as merely “pertaining to building or construction in,Paragraph
"general” or the simple revealing of constructional techniques. Tectonics, in architectural",Paragraph
"discourse, refers to the poetics of construction in the original Greek sense of poesis as an",Paragraph
act of making and revealing.,Paragraph
"The term tectonic derives from Greek word tekton, meaning carpenter or builder, in",Paragraph
"turn borrowed from the Sanskrit taksan, referring to the craft of carpentry and to the use",Paragraph
"of the ax. Remnants of a similar term can also be found in Vedic, where it again refers to",Paragraph
carpentry and to the art of construction in general. This meaning undergoes further,Paragraph
"evolution as the term passes from being something specific and physical, such as",Paragraph
"carpentry, to the more generic notion of construction and later to becoming an aspect of",Paragraph
poetry.,Paragraph
The history of tectonic form has two major theoretical lines divided roughly between,Paragraph
"the German lineage of J.J. Winckelmann, Karl Boetticher, Gottfried Semper, and Karl",Paragraph
"Friedrich Schinkel and the French tradition of Abbé Laugier, Claude Perrault, Jacques-",Paragraph
"Germain Soufflot, Henri Labrouste, and Eugéne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc. Whereas the",Paragraph
German architects and writers focused on the post-Enlightenment dilemma of the,Paragraph
"disjunction between form and spirit as applied to architecture, French thinkers were",Paragraph
preoccupied with the expression of statical logic and the rationality of construction,Paragraph
procedures insofar as they could be revealed with greater clarity than before using the,Paragraph
new materials of iron and concrete informed by the newly developed science of statics.,Paragraph
The first architectural use of the term tectonics in German dates from its appearance in,Paragraph
Karl Otfried Miiller’s Handbuch der Archaologie der Kunst (1878; Handbook of the,Caption
"Archaeology of Art), wherein he defines tektonische as applying to a series of art forms",Paragraph
"“such as utensils, vases, dwellings and meeting places of men.... We call this string of",Paragraph
"mixed activities tectonic; their peak is architecture, which mostly through necessity rises",Paragraph
"high and can be a powerful representation of the deepest feelings.” Karl Boetticher, in his",Paragraph
"Die Tektonik der Hellenen (1874; The Tectonic of the Hellenes), elaborated the concept",Paragraph
of the tectonic in several ways. At one level he described a process of building made of a,Paragraph
series of appropriately interlocking constructional elements. Simultaneously articulated,Paragraph
"and integrated, this series of joints constituted the body-form, or Kérperbilden, of the",Paragraph
building that enabled construction of the building and made such assemblies symbolic,Paragraph
components of an expressive system. At another level Boetticher distinguished between,Paragraph
"the Kernform, or nucleus, and the Kunstform, or decorative cladding, the latter having the",Paragraph
purpose of representing and symbolizing the status of the work.,Paragraph
The German architect Gottfried Semper was particularly influential in the evolution of,Paragraph
tectonics in his work Die vier Elemente der Baukunst (1851; The Four Elements of,Paragraph
"Architecture). Inspired by a Caribbean hut in the Great Exhibition of 1851, Semper",Paragraph
evolved the notion of a paradigmatic primitive hut that embodied the four basic tectonic,Paragraph
"elements of architecture: the earthwork, the hearth, the framework (and roof}, and the",Paragraph
light-weight enclosing membrane. This model was more anthropological and,Paragraph
transcultural than Marc-Antoine Laugier’s well-known proposal in his Essai sur,Paragraph
"Varchitecture (1755; An Essay in Architecture), which presented a framed pedimented",Paragraph
"edifice, adopted as an archetype by neoclassical architects. At the same time, Semper",Paragraph
"divided architectural form into two broader categories: the tectonics of the frame, in",Paragraph
"which lightweight linear components are in a spatial grid, and the stereotomics of the",Paragraph
"earthwork, where mass and volume are formed concurrently through the use of",Paragraph
"heavyweight elements. Stereotomics is derived from the Greek terms stereos, for solid,",Paragraph
"and tomia, to cut. This distinction between light and heavy is reflected in overall material",Paragraph
"differences and construction techniques—wood, steel, and other tensile components for",Paragraph
"the former and brick, stone, reinforced concrete, or their compressive equivalents for the",Paragraph
latter. This opposition between iconic construction typologies and their resultant space-,Paragraph
forms as a basis for an architectural language is borne out in vernacular building,Paragraph
traditions throughout the world. In Semper’s Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen,Paragraph
"Kiinsten, oder praktische Aesthetik (1879; Style in the Technical and Tectonic Arts, or",Paragraph
"Practical Aesthetics), he emphasized the joint or the knot, particularly between the",Paragraph
stereotomic base of a building and its tectonic frame. Transitions between such elements,Paragraph
"provided, for Semper, the most extensive opportunities for expression in architecture.",Paragraph
"With this focus on the joint or knot, he wrote extensively about the nature of the textile",Paragraph
arts as the dominant primordial building element that was often preserved over time,Paragraph
"stylistically in other, more permanent materials, such as stone or wood.",Paragraph
The tectonic in French architectural thought is traceable to Claude Perrault’s,Paragraph
Ordonnance des cing espéces de dolonnes selon la méthode des anciens (Treatise on the,Title
"Five Kinds of Columns after the Method of the Ancients, 1783). Perrault proposed a",Paragraph
theory of positive versus arbitrary beauty in place of the prevailing academic theory,Paragraph
giving the five classical orders precedence over any other aesthetic ideas. He asserted that,Paragraph
"such academic styles belonged to the realm of arbitrary beauty, whereas symmetry,",Paragraph
"richness of materials, and precision of execution were the only means of judging a",Paragraph
"positive or universal form of beauty, qualities that are tectonic insofar as they are based",Paragraph
on material substance and geometric order.,Paragraph
Two Paris masterworks by Henri Labrouste further developed the tectonic with,Paragraph
extraordinary grace and clarity: the Bibliothéque Ste.-Geneviéve (1850) in Paris and the,Paragraph
"Bibliothéque Nationale (1875), with the insertion of a prefabricated, fireproof iron",Paragraph
"framework into an exterior masonry shell, with each element clearly expressed and",Paragraph
articulated. The tectonic aspect of this work lay in its attempt to discredit scenographic,Paragraph
eclecticism and to establish in its place architecture as an art of construction. Concerned,Paragraph
"with the economy of structure, he evolved a system of “iron network vaulting” of his own",Paragraph
devising—an expressive vocabulary of lightweight iron members and articulated joints,Paragraph
that revealed their resistance to gravity in surprising and inventive ways while set within,Paragraph
a more traditional heavy outer masonry shell. This syntax was developed further by his,Paragraph
"pupil Anatole de Baudot in a series of proposals for large-scale, long-span exhibition",Paragraph
"halls. The last French theorist of the Greco-Gothic ideal was Francois Auguste Choisy,",Paragraph
"who, in his Histoire de l’architecture (1899; History of Architecture), suggested that",Paragraph
"great civilizations arrived at their zenith when their essence, subject to geographic and",Paragraph
"material conditions, became expressed collectively in tectonic form. In part because of",Paragraph
"the nature of the renowned isometric drawings illustrating this work, Choisy presented",Paragraph
"the space-form of buildings as inseparable from their mode of construction, thus",Paragraph
anticipating the tectonic possibilities of reinforced concrete in the 20th century.,Paragraph
Certain major architects of the 20th century have pursued tectonics as a determinant of,Paragraph
architectural form in all or part of their work. The pioneering work of Auguste Perret,Paragraph
(1874-1954) was almost exclusively concerned with the expression of the structural,Paragraph
frame in opposition to its in-fill. Utilizing the new vocabulary of architectural reinforced,Paragraph
"concrete, buildings such as the Théatre des Champs-Elysées (1913) in Paris created a",Paragraph
fusion of classical rationalism with the Greco-Gothic ideal. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,Paragraph
"(1886-1969) pursued a tectonic form of intense rigor and precision throughout his career,",Paragraph
first with brick in a series of houses in Germany and later with steel in such buildings as,Paragraph
"the Farnsworth House (1950) in Plano, Illinois, and the campus at the Illinois Institute of",Paragraph
Technology (1939-57) in Chicago. It is likely that Frank Lloyd Wright (1867-1959) was,Paragraph
aware of Semper’s writing and developed paradigms in many projects that included,Paragraph
"Semper’s four elements, particularly in the so-called Usonian houses built mainly",Paragraph
between 1934 and 1944 and the “textile-block” system of concrete block construction,Paragraph
patented in 1923. Louis Kahn (1901-74) gave primacy in his work to understanding the,Paragraph
expressive nature of the joint in architecture and emphasized the tectonic element in,Paragraph
nearly every project of his career.,Paragraph
"In the Kimbell Art Museum (1972) in Fort Worth, Texas, Kahn’s manifestation of the",Paragraph
Semperian earthwork-and-frame opposition utilized the former as a means of integrating,Paragraph
the building into its site and the latter to provide space and reveal light. The work of the,Paragraph
Norwegian architect Jorn Utzon has sought to express structure and construction as a,Paragraph
major determinant of architectural form in both large- and small-scale projects. These,Paragraph
"works nearly always seek inspiration from non-European, often vernacular, models and",Paragraph
"distinguish clearly between the earthwork and roofwork components, the former often",Paragraph
accommodating building services within the site and the latter composed of “floating”,Paragraph
folded plate or shell-roof structures for the honorific habitable space above the podium.,Paragraph
This is clearly manifest in the Sydney Opera House (1973). The tectonic aspect of the,Paragraph
work of Carlo Scarpa (1906-78) lies primarily in the extreme emphasis he placed on the,Paragraph
constructional joint—its rhetorical amplification and subsequent elaboration—regardless,Paragraph
of the building’s program or size.,Paragraph
Other architects who have made tectonics an integral part of their work include the,Paragraph
"Dutch architect H.P. Berlage (1856-1934), who achieved a masterful tectonic synthesis",Paragraph
"in his Amsterdam Stock Exchange (1903), and the late work of Le Corbusier (1887-—",Paragraph
"1965), where expressive structure began to dominate the character of the work beginning",Paragraph
with the Maison Week-End (1935) in St.-Cloud. The Dutch architects Aldo van Eyck and,Paragraph
Herman Hertzberger developed the tectonic potential of the reiteration of singular spatial,Paragraph
units and highly articulated structural form to create an evolved syntax of architectural,Paragraph
"form. In England, Foster Associates and the Richard Rogers Partnership have explored",Paragraph
the potential of structural efficiency and its expression throughout their respective,Paragraph
"practices. In Switzerland the work of the Ticino School, as exemplified by Mario Botta",Paragraph
"and Livio Vacchini, falls easily into this category, as do many late 20th-century Spanish",Paragraph
"architects, among them Alejandro de la Sota and Bonell and Rius. In Greece the",Paragraph
architects Aris Konstantinidis and Dimitris Pikionis worked to successfully unify local,Paragraph
"regional building and craft traditions with a modern tectonic expression. Finally, the work",Paragraph
of Sverre Fehn in Norway as an example of a small practice and that of the Renzo Piano,Paragraph
Building Workshop as a large international firm have been producing work that,Paragraph
"rigorously pursues an architecture rooted in a philosophy of tectonics, work in which the",Paragraph
"poetics of construction is a primary determinant of form, a determinant that invites",Paragraph
adaptation and distortion brought about by exigencies of typological and topographic,Paragraph
circumstance.,Paragraph

TENSILE STRUCTURES,Title
"The most common tensile structure is a tent, which is a thin, saddle-shaped tension",Paragraph
membrane supported by a compression arch or mast. In a tent the fabric carries all or part,Paragraph
"of the tensile forces. Small tents, made entirely of fabric, are typically supported by masts",Paragraph
"(columns) or arches. As the span increases, membrane tension forces increase, and the",Paragraph
surface area must be subdivided by cables that carry the principal tensile loads with fabric,Paragraph
spanning between cables.,Paragraph
"If the edge of a tent is flexible (unattached), it is usually shaped into a concave curve to",Paragraph
"ensure that it remains in tension. Because the edge is a region of high stress, it is usually",Paragraph
reinforced with cable that continues to the anchor point. The anchor point may be,Paragraph
"connected to a guy cable (which transmits tension forces to the foundation), or it may be",Paragraph
supported by a mast or compression strut (which transfers compression loads to the,Paragraph
ground).,Paragraph
Perhaps the best way to develop an intuitive understanding of appropriate shapes for,Paragraph
"tents is to experiment with scale models using a stretchy, lightweight double-knit fabric",Paragraph
"supported by arches, masts, or strings. At the scale of buildings, however, a minimum of",Paragraph
stretch is desired; in fact tent fabrics are selected for their resistance to stretch under load,Paragraph
(among other qualities). The three-dimensional form represented in the model by the,Paragraph
stretched fabric is constructed at full scale by adjusting the shape and location of the,Paragraph
individual panels before assembly. This technique is also used in the design and,Paragraph
construction of boat sails to ensure the correct aerodynamic shape. In contemporary tent,Paragraph
"structures, three-dimensional computer models are used to plan the shape of the tent and",Paragraph
its individual panels and to calculate internal tensile stresses. For wind stability (as well,Paragraph
"as longevity), it is essential that tents be designed as double-curvature structures.",Paragraph
"Tents are most easily supported by central masts, but this may be functionally",Paragraph
undesirable for nonstructural reasons. Catenary cables can be suspended from side masts,Paragraph
"to support the membrane peaks at several points. Where center supports are used, fabric",Paragraph
stress may be reduced by distributing the load over a larger area through the use of a,Paragraph
mushroom-shaped mast capital.,Paragraph
"Traditionally, tents were considered to be suitable only for temporary structures",Paragraph
because of the deterioration of fabrics due to prolonged exposure to sunlight. The,Paragraph
development of improved fabrics (notably fiberglass) and coatings that minimize the,Paragraph
"deterioration due to sunlight (e.g., Dupont Teflon) have increased the useful life of tent",Paragraph
"fabrics to over 20 years, making them suitable for use on permanent structures.",Paragraph

Riyadh Stadium,Title
"Horst Berger, a pioneer in tension structure technology, was the engineer on this graceful",Paragraph
"project (1986; Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Fraser, Roberts, and Partners, architects). The",Paragraph

"The fabric membrane is stretched between ridge cables, valley cables, and catenary",Paragraph
edge cables. The ridge cables are connected to the main mast and are radial in plan. The,Paragraph
valley cables between the ridge cables are connected to the bottom anchor and stabilize,Paragraph
the structure against wind uplift; they are also radial in plan. The outer edge of the ridge,Paragraph
cables and the outer edge of the catenary edge cables are held at a fixed point created by,Paragraph
the sloping mast and the two triangulated guy cables. The inner end of the membrane is,Paragraph
attached to a ring cable that counterbalances the outward thrust of the sloping mast and,Paragraph
"guys. To make the structure erectable and to provide redundancy and additional stiffness,",Paragraph
"an additional cable system was added. This consists of adding a suspension cable, a",Paragraph
"stabilizing cable, and an upper support cable, all aligned with the ridge cable of each",Paragraph
"module. These, together with the masts, the rear support cables, and the ring cable, form a",Paragraph
stable system not requiring the participation of the fabric.,Paragraph
The structure includes a roof-washing system designed to maintain the fabric’s 8,Paragraph
percent daylight transmittance and 75 percent solar reflectance. The high solar,Paragraph
"reflectance, coupled with the natural convection ventilation induced by the openings at",Paragraph
"the peak, helps maintain spectator comfort. Rain drains outward to the lower anchor",Paragraph

TENSIONED MEMBRANE STRUCTURE,Title
"Tensioned structures (from the Latin tendere, “to stretch”) are ones that resist only",Paragraph
"tension forces and pull rather than push. A list would include traditional tents, suspension",Paragraph
"bridges, modern saddle-shaped prestressed membrane and cable roofs, convertible or",Paragraph
"retractable roofs for temporary covers, air-supported or pneumatic constructions, and",Paragraph
"combinations of cables and compression struts, referred to as “tensegrity” structures.",Paragraph
"Some are simply stabilized by their own weight, whereas others resist uplift as well as",Paragraph
gravity loadings by being prestressed and having anticlastic surfaces. The majority are,Paragraph
either linear or surface structures. A tensioned membrane structure is one in which two,Paragraph
"dimensions dominate and loads are resisted in a planar manner, such as occurs in tents,",Paragraph
"membrane, cable-net, and convertible or retractable roofs, and pneumatic constructions.",Paragraph

Frei Otto’s experimental development of fabric structure marked the 1950s departure,Paragraph
from the previous engineering-inspired suspension bridge model and promoted the tent,Paragraph
"model. Otto was anticipated by a Russian engineer, V.G.Shookhov, who in 1896",Paragraph
designed a series of four steel tents for the Exhibition at Nizhni Novgorod. In his early,Paragraph
"projects, Otto concentrated his efforts on finding the most efficient minimal surfaces for",Paragraph
"modest textile pavilions, but when challenged by larger spans in works such as the",Paragraph
"German Pavilion at Expo ‘67 in Montreal, he developed a system of flexible prestressed",Paragraph
wide-rope cable nets on which he hung the fabric-enclosing membrane. A further step,Paragraph
"was taken with the 1972 Munich Olympic Stadium, which was significant for its material",Paragraph
and technological advances that resulted in the application of computer methods of,Paragraph
structural analysis for the first time.,Paragraph
"Parallel with this, Otto developed miniature cable tractors that travel on the supporting",Paragraph
cables and permit the membrane envelope to be fully stretched or retracted or bunched,Paragraph
"for automatic storage. After the Bad Hersfeld (Hesse) centrally retracting roof, Otto",Caption
collaborated on constructing convertible roofs with Roger Taillibert over an open-air,Paragraph

This construction is possible to do without masts and arches entirely in air-supported,Paragraph
"membranes, which use a small airpressure differential to hold up the structure and resist",Paragraph

TENT,Title
"Traditional tents come in two categories: noble tents, which are affiliated with urban",Paragraph
"societies belonging to warriors and kings, and nomad tents, which are the property of",Paragraph
"nomadic and seminomadic pastoralists. Nomad tents are seen in many varieties, including",Paragraph
"conical skin-covered tents of northern Eurasia and North America, cylindrical felt-",Paragraph
"covered trellis tents of central Asia, and the black goats’ hair tents of the Near and",Paragraph
"Middle East and North Africa. There are also species of primitive tents, such as the bone",Paragraph
tent of northeastern Siberia and the skin and mat tents that survive in North Africa among,Paragraph
the Tuareg and others.,Paragraph
"Tents arose gradually, often evolving from existing fixed dwellings and huts that had",Paragraph
been simplified and lightened under the pressure of nomadism to give the tent cloth a,Paragraph
"greater structural role in resisting loads imposed by the wind, snow, and rain and to",Paragraph
increase the ease of erecting and transporting them.,Paragraph
Tents belonging to urban peoples existed in the ancient world well before Mohammed,Paragraph
and are extremely old. Tents are depicted in an Egyptian encampment at the battle of,Paragraph
"Kadesh in 1285 B.C., and twin semicupola skin tents are illustrated in Assyrian bas-",Paragraph
"reliefs from 645 B.C. Images of black tents can be seen in the same Assyrian reliefs, and",Paragraph
it is very probable that they existed before the 11th century B.C.,Paragraph
"Tents come in two basic plan configurations: circular and rectangular. Structurally, the",Paragraph
"division is elementary as well: frame tents have a limp, unstressed membrane that is hung",Paragraph
on a structural supporting frame that carries the imposed loads and is secured by thongs,Paragraph
or straps to prevent the membrane from flying off; frameless tents have a load-bearing,Paragraph
and load-distributing cover that is supported at points or linear arrangements of,Paragraph
"compression members, such as struts or arches. Very few traditional nomad tents have",Paragraph
"wholly, or true, prestressed membranes. The tent cover of the black goats’ hair tent is",Paragraph
"comparatively heavy, and its weight, especially when it is wet, helps stabilize it.",Paragraph
"However, the cloth is stretched and deformed by rope around its edges to improve its",Paragraph
"stability under lateral wind loads. Thus, the tent is partly prestressed and partly weight",Paragraph
"stabilized. Structurally, traditional tents can be divided into unstressed frame tents;",Paragraph
"stressed tents without frames supported by poles, arches, and horizontal bars or tensile",Paragraph
cords or filaments; and any combination of these.,Paragraph
The conical tent fundamentally is a primitive dwelling used by peoples at the hunting,Paragraph
stage. It is a circumpolar trait found in the boreal regions of North America and Eurasia.,Paragraph
The tent is retained as a summer dwelling by many nomadic and seminomadic herdsmen,Paragraph
and even by some sedentary and agricultural tribes. It consists of a conical frame of,Paragraph
"radially inclined poles in a circle, with their slim upper ends secured at the peak. The",Paragraph
pattern of the pole frame and the material used as a cover (but not the basic form) are,Paragraph
"remarkably uniform. Two, three, or four poles make up the foundation for the secondary",Paragraph
"poles, which are laid in the V-fork of the crossing. The conical frame tent belongs to the",Paragraph
"region of northern taiga forest among the Samoyed, Syran, Mansi, Sel’kupi, Ostayak,",Paragraph
"Vogul, Northern Evenki Tungus, Yeniseians, Khanti, Nganasani, and Lapps in Keti,",Paragraph
Upper Yukaghir. Even the Kalmuck of Astrakhan and the Kirghiz use felt-covered,Paragraph
conical tents. The tepee of the Great Plains Indians is a late modification of this,Paragraph
circumpolar type and displays such essential features of the Eurasian conical frame tent,Paragraph
"as the central fire, a smoke hole centering on the crossing of the poles, an eastern",Paragraph
"entrance, and a place of honor opposite the doorway.",Paragraph
"The cylindrical felt-covered trellis tent is a further, highly developed frame tent that is",Paragraph
found in the vast region surrounding the Volga River and the Anatolian plateau in the,Paragraph
west and the Khingan Mountains in the east. The shape and construction of the trellis tent,Paragraph
are surprisingly uniform and have remained unchanged over the past four centuries. The,Paragraph
"two main types are a felt-covered cylindrical walled trellis tent with a conical ribbed roof,",Paragraph
found among the Mongol peoples and some Turkicspeaking tribes of northern central,Paragraph
"Asia, and a convex domical roofed version, found among Turkic-speaking tribes of",Paragraph
"western and southern Siberia, such as the Kirghiz, Uzbek, and Turkoman.",Paragraph
The black tent type is a frameless tent with a partially stressed membrane with an,Paragraph
"anticlastic or flat saddlelike surface supported by ridge, arches, or high points and",Paragraph
"anchored to the ground by long, extended stays. It most resembles the modern prestressed",Paragraph
"tent and uses the least amount of wood of any type, with the possible exception of Inuit",Paragraph
tents. Black tents are distributed in a nearly continuous narrow belt between 25 and 40,Paragraph
"degrees north latitude, extending from Mauritania in northwestern Africa to Afghanistan,",Paragraph
with the Tibetan group forming an isolated island. This distribution approximates the,Paragraph
region of desert vegetation across North Africa and the Middle East and is related to two,Paragraph
"animals: the goat, from whose hair the tent cloth is woven, and the dromedary, which is",Paragraph
used for the tent’s transport.,Paragraph
Notable differences exist between the Arabian black tents and tents on the northern,Paragraph
"fringes of Arabia and North Africa: the cloth tent of the desert Bedouin, the Sba’a and",Paragraph
"Rwala, has three longitudinal rows of poles supporting a rectangular cloth, with the",Paragraph
"central row higher than the remainder, giving its characteristic ridge profile. The tents of",Paragraph
North Africa differ significantly in having two rather than three rows of poles: a front,Paragraph
row and a central row but no back row. The North African black tent was brought to the,Paragraph
region with the Arab expansion in the 11th century B.C. and has a striped awning.,Paragraph
Inuit and Tuareg tents occur in extreme culture-resistance zones and typically are,Paragraph
minimal constructions of considerable ingenuity.,Paragraph
Sumptuous tents were introduced into Western Europe in the 12th century A.D. as a,Paragraph
"result of the Crusades and then spread from France, where their immediate effect was",Paragraph
"great, and quickly became identified with the tournaments, and warfare that were part of",Paragraph
the chivalric tradition in neighboring regions. Tents were symbols for the heavenly city of,Paragraph
Jerusalem and the exotic Near East. Tents influenced the design of pavilions and of turret,Paragraph
"roofs for churches, castles, and palaces (a very fashionable architectural motif) as well as",Paragraph
"the interior design and decoration of palaces, especially the boudoir. Miniature tents, to",Paragraph
"symbolize the Old Testament tabernacle, were frequently adopted for reliquaries and",Paragraph
"monstrances in medieval Christian ritual. Elaborate, fabulously decorated tents were",Paragraph
"revived in the 15th century, reaching a climax under Francis | and Henry VIII in 1520 at",Paragraph
Ardes and later under Emperor Napoleon at the beginning of the 19th century. In the 16th,Paragraph
"century, the word pavillon came to dignify anything likened to a tent—any lightly",Paragraph
constructed ornamental building or pleasure house in a garden. Even more widespread,Paragraph
was the tent roof that was derived from the conical shape of the parasol-roofed tent or the,Paragraph
square pavilion tent with its draped pyramid-shaped canopy.,Paragraph
"Tents generally are identified with nomadism, whether a full-blown nomadism; the",Paragraph
itinerant nomadism of armies and royal progresses; or that of an individual or groups who,Paragraph
"are forced by their lifestyle to move often and who, to this end, require a light, portable",Paragraph
shelter. The relationship between tents and permanent monumental architecture is a,Paragraph
"complex two-way one, with exchanges occurring in both directions, reflecting the",Paragraph
interdependence between sedentary urban and nomadic pastoral cultures. Because of their,Paragraph
"symbolic prestige, tent forms have been imitated and preserved in stone buildings and in",Paragraph
"other durable constructions, resulting in a hybrid class of pseudo-tent buildings, a",Paragraph
phenomenon that is very noticeable in France after the Crusades and that spread to,Paragraph
"Stockholm, Dresden, and Vienna.",Paragraph

TERRA-COTTA,Title
"Terra-cotta (Italian for “baked earth""), a building material with ancient roots, found its",Paragraph
fullest expression in architecture of the first half of the 20th century. Architectural terra-,Paragraph
"cotta is ceramic or fired clay, most often glazed, used primarily in the 20th century for",Paragraph
fireproofing and exterior cladding of buildings. The earliest known use of terra-cotta is in,Paragraph
"early Mesopotamia, where examples are found from as early as 3200 B.C. Terra-cotta",Paragraph
was also used by the ancient Egyptians and the Etruscans as well as the Greeks and the,Paragraph
Romans.,Paragraph
"Lost with the fall of Rome, the art of terra-cotta was rediscovered in 14th-century",Paragraph
"Germany and Italy, as exemplified by the work of Luca della Robbia and his family, who",Paragraph
introduced polychrome techniques on panels and plaques used as architectural,Paragraph
"decoration. The techniques for making terra-cotta found their way to England, where",Paragraph
"unglazed terra-cotta was used as early as the 16th century, mostly as decorative detail on",Paragraph
"brick and stone buildings. During the 18th century, technological advances resulted in a",Paragraph
"steady increase in England in the use of terra-cotta, which was noted for its durability and",Paragraph
resistance to weathering. Terra-cotta was also admired because of the its ability to mimic,Paragraph
the appearance of stone at a fraction of the cost.,Paragraph
"By the 19th century, terra-cotta was widely used in England for architectural",Paragraph
ormamentation. Its popularity grew because it was available in a range of colors and,Paragraph
textures and could be molded with fine detail emulating carved stone. Terra-cotta was,Paragraph
also being produced in North America on a limited basis during this period. Factories in,Paragraph
"New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago produced unglazed terra-cotta for ornamental",Paragraph
"detail for the facades of buildings, including string courses, capitals, and window",Caption
surrounds.,Paragraph
"Despite its early introduction to the United States, architects and builders tended to be",Paragraph
skeptical of the claims for terra-cotta’s durability. This began to change after Chicago's,Paragraph
"Great Fire of 1871. After the devastation of the fire, the emphasis in Chicago and",Paragraph
nationwide was to construct buildings that were as fire resistant as possible. Structural,Paragraph
"terra-cotta provided an extra measure of fireproofing to buildings. At the same time, the",Paragraph
"last quarter of the 19th century, advances in the terra-cotta manufacture and architectural",Paragraph
design that capitalized on the inherent malleability of terra-cotta as a cladding material,Paragraph
spurred the growth of the fledgling American industry.,Paragraph
"As terra-cotta was receiving acceptance as a building material, dramatic changes were",Paragraph
occurring in the technology of building construction. Technological innovations—,Paragraph
notably skeleton-frame construction—led to the development of the modern skyscraper.,Paragraph
The use of structural metal to form a skeleton on which finish materials could be hung,Paragraph
"meant that buildings could rise to heights previously unimagined. At the same time,",Paragraph
architects were anxious to develop new design motifs to celebrate this new building type.,Paragraph
Architectural terra-cotta proved to be the ideal material. Terra-cotta cost 90 percent less,Paragraph
"than a piece of ornamental stone and was one-third the weight. In addition, because terra-",Paragraph
"cotta was molded rather than carved, repeating motifs in a complex design was easily",Paragraph
achieved. Variations in surface texture and colors were also possible. One of the earliest,Paragraph
structures to use terra-cotta as a cladding material was New York’s Flatiron Building,Paragraph
"(built 1901-03, designed by Daniel Burnham). This 22-story building, the tallest building",Paragraph
"in the city when it was built, has a stone base, with brick and terra-cotta finishing up the",Paragraph
floors above.,Paragraph
Louis Sullivan exploited the plasticity of terra-cotta perhaps better than any other,Paragraph
practitioner of his time. The intricate interplay of the design motifs on the facades of,Paragraph
Sullivan’s commercial buildings and skyscrapers exemplifies terra-cotta’s ability to be,Paragraph
"shaped and molded to fit the architect’s design. Because of the material’s malleability,",Paragraph
architects and designers for the terra-cotta manufacturer often cooperated to produce,Paragraph
beautiful systems of wall surfaces and ornament. By the 191 0s skyscrapers were soaring,Paragraph
"to new heights, and terra-cotta was increasingly employed because of its many",Paragraph
"ormmamental and constructional advantages. Both the Woolworth Building in New York,",Paragraph
"designed by Cass Gilbert and completed in 1913, and Chicago’s Wrigley Building of",Paragraph
"1924, by Graham, Anderson, Probst, and White, are important examples of buildings",Paragraph
fully clad in terra-cotta.,Paragraph
"In the early years, the finish color of terra-cotta depended on the color of the clay used.",Paragraph
Most terra-cotta manufactured in the United States was gray or buff in color to emulate,Paragraph
"the stone it was meant to replace. During the early decades of the 20th century, terra-cotta",Paragraph
"was accepted as a material in its own right, and its success depended less on its ability to",Paragraph
"imitate other materials. At the same time, architects began to experiment with colored",Paragraph
glazes to provide another layer of detail to their designs.,Paragraph
Terra-cotta was adapted as the ideal material for the streamlined Art Deco and Art,Paragraph
Moderne styles that became popular after the 1925 Paris Exposition. Improvements in the,Paragraph
manufacture of terra-cotta resulted in the introduction of thinner panels that were lighter,Paragraph
"in weight. Terra-cotta was easily molded into the geometric, stylized, and colorful",Paragraph
decorative elements that are found on a variety of small and large buildings from this era.,Paragraph
"Terra-cotta can be found on myriad commercial structures, small apartment buildings,",Paragraph
"automobile-related buildings such as garages and showrooms, and movie theaters dating",Paragraph
from the early decades of the 20th century.,Paragraph
Terra-cotta was replaced as a structural and as a decorative component by a material,Paragraph
that could be produced even less expensively: concrete. Reinforced concrete initially,Paragraph
provided the structural fireproofing capabilities of terra-cotta at a reduced price.,Paragraph
"Eventually, concrete proved to be better suited to the unadorned architecture that became",Paragraph
popular at midcentury.,Paragraph

"Architect, Italy",Title
Giuseppe Terragni was among the most talented and esteemed of the Italian modernist,Paragraph
architects working in the period between the world wars. His Casa del Fascio (1936) in,Paragraph
Como is generally considered the emblematic modernist building to have been built,Paragraph
"under the Fascist regime, and his Sant’Elia Nursery School (1937), also in Como, ranks",Paragraph
as a tour de force of modern European architecture.,Paragraph
In December 1926 Terragni burst onto the Italian architectural scene with the first of,Paragraph
four magazine articles on which he collaborated with six of his contemporaries. These,Paragraph
"essays, published in the esoteric and unillustrated magazine La Rassegna Italiana, \ater",Paragraph
came to be known as the “Rationalist Manifesto.” Terragni and his friends of the Gruppo,Paragraph
Sette (Group 7) argued in these essays against revivalism in Italian architecture and that,Paragraph
"rationalism must shape all decisions about form, structure, and function. The avant-garde",Paragraph
in Italy were henceforth known as the “rationalists.”,Paragraph
Terragni’s first major building was the Novocomum Apartment House (1927-29) in,Paragraph
"Como. A controversial building from the moment of its unveiling, it was hailed as the",Paragraph
first rationalist work in Italy. Terragni went on to design a total of 26 built works and,Paragraph
numerous unbuilt projects in a 15-year career that was cut short by World War II.,Paragraph
Terragni’s undisputed masterpiece—the Casa del Fascio in Como (a local Fascist Party,Paragraph
headquarters that the architect named the “Glass House of Fascism”)—was begun in,Paragraph
1932 and completed in 1936. The building is a prismatic exercise in modern geometric,Paragraph
"form and structure, with four different facades that nevertheless together possess",Paragraph
compositional coherence and harmony. The building contains a two-story atrium space,Caption
"encased by a system of clerestory windows, one of the first of its kind in Europe and an",Paragraph
influence on post-World War II atria. The play of transparency and opacity created by,Paragraph
"Terragni’s use of materials (glass and marble, respectively) results in fascinating visual",Paragraph
contradictions. The building was initially condemned by the local Fascist Party chief as,Paragraph
"being too ordinary for an important state edifice. To appease his critics, Terragni",Paragraph
"employed an artist and industrial designer, Marcello Nizzoli, to develop a decorative",Paragraph
figural design scheme for the building facade. The ensuing panels were never added as,Paragraph
"envisaged, however.",Paragraph
By 1936 Terragni had built five apartment houses in Milan (in collaboration with,Paragraph
Pietro Lingeri) and had gained recognition in the competition for the National Fascist,Paragraph
Party Headquarters (1934) in Rome. In 1937-38 he built several significant villas,Paragraph
including the Villa Bianca in Seveso and the Sant’Elia Nursery School in Como.,Paragraph
"Terragni’s plan for the nursery school drew on a radical sense of interior transparency,",Paragraph
using glass partitions in the design of the flexible free plan derived from Le Corbusier.,Paragraph
In 1938 Terragni and Lingeri designed the Danteum project for Rome. The building,Paragraph
was to have been an exercise in the,Paragraph

TERRAZZO,Title
"One of the oldest types of flooring, terrazzo was developed by Venetians in the 16th",Paragraph
century and was popularized during the late 19th century. Modern terrazzo flooring is,Paragraph
composed of 70 percent marble or granite chips (or a combination of both) and 30,Paragraph
"percent white, gray, or pigmented Portland cement. After curing, the surface is ground",Paragraph
"smooth, giving the stone chips a polished surface. Terrazzo flooring is very durable and",Paragraph
can be arranged in decorative patterns. During the 1930s terrazzo was very popular for,Paragraph
"commercial buildings, fitting in well with the Art Deco design then so popular. Public",Paragraph
"and commercial buildings such as schools, banks, and hospitals and government",Paragraph
buildings such as post offices incorporate terrazzo into main corridors and lobby areas. A,Paragraph
special type of terrazzo flooring is used in hospital operating rooms.,Paragraph
Terrazzo flooring developed from the first “composition” floors developed by the,Paragraph
ancient Greeks. Over time the rubble and charcoal flooring was held together with,Paragraph
cement mortar and then developed into flooring of lava cement and charcoal set with,Paragraph
marble pieces in imitation of mosaic flooring. This type of flooring was often laid in,Paragraph
service areas and on terraces. The name terrazzo comes from the Italian word for,Paragraph
“terrace.”,Paragraph
"In Venice, Italy, during the 1500s, a finely finished terrazzo flooring was developed",Paragraph
that consisted of the 70-30 marble-to-mortar binder still in use today. After placing the,Paragraph
"marble chips in the binder matrix, the surface was polished smooth. This type of terrazzo",Paragraph
"flooring became very popular for use in Italian villas. During the late 19th century,",Paragraph
travelers to Italy were impressed by the beauty and function of this flooring. Wealthy,Paragraph
"travelers, on returning home from Italian excursions, had terrazzo flooring installed in the",Paragraph
entrance halls of their homes. The use of terrazzo in public buildings soon became,Paragraph
popular as well.,Paragraph
"Because of terrazzo’s strength, durability, and potential to create decorative patterns",Paragraph
"reminiscent of mosaic flooring, it became a popular flooring in public and commercial",Paragraph
buildings. In particular the use of a pigmented binding matrix made the flooring popular,Paragraph
during the Art Deco movement of the 1930s. It is most often used in the same locations,Paragraph
that stone flooring would be. Where appearance and durability are needed in high-traffic,Paragraph
"areas, it is a cost-effective option. Most train stations, movie theaters, fire stations, city",Paragraph
"and state offices, and schools built during the first third of the 20th century include",Paragraph
terrazzo flooring in high-traffic areas.,Caption
The original method for installing terrazzo flooring is cast-in-place. It ranges from 1/4,Paragraph
inch (6 mm) to 3 inches (72 mm) thick placed over a mortar bed or secured to the,Paragraph
substrate floor using direct bonding. A layer of sand 1/4 inch (6 mm) is used as a cushion,Paragraph
when structural movement is anticipated. The sand is covered with a waterproof paper,Paragraph
and wire mesh. A 2-1/8-inch (54 mm) concrete slab is poured over the sand. Divider,Paragraph
strips are embedded in the concrete with 5/8 inch (16 mm) left exposed. These divider,Paragraph
strips help control shrinkage and cracking and allow color changes. They also serve as a,Paragraph
"guide for installing the topping. Bonded floors, used in areas where structural movement",Caption
"is unlikely (such as corridors, walks, and swimming pool decks), have a total thickness of",Paragraph
1-1/8 inches (29 mm). The base slab is coated with Portland cement to ensure a good,Paragraph
bond. The underbase is poured and divider strips are set before the topping is installed.,Paragraph
The terrazzo topping is installed by first coating the underbed with a layer of grout,Paragraph
matching the color of the binding matrix. The topping is placed using the divider strips as,Paragraph
guides. The topping is sprinkled with marble chips matching the color percentages of the,Paragraph
stone in the topping. Heavy rollers compact the topping until most of the water is,Paragraph
removed. The surface is then troweled until the divider strips are exposed. The floor must,Paragraph
cure for at least six days before grinding and polishing the surface smooth. After curing,Paragraph
"and first grinding, a light application of grout cement is used to fill voids. The final",Paragraph
grinding levels the floor and exposes the 70 percent stone composition. The floor is then,Paragraph
"cleaned, sealed, and machine buffed to reveal the color and luster of the marble.",Paragraph
Terrazzo floors can also be installed monolithically with the structural slab. Divider,Paragraph
strips are placed when the slab is poured and 5/8 inch (16 mm) is left for the terrazzo,Paragraph
"topping. Curing, grinding, cleaning, sealing, and buffing follow the same procedure as",Paragraph
with bonded and sand-cushioned cast-in-place terrazzo.,Paragraph
Although modern terrazzo floors include a mixture of stones capable of taking a high,Paragraph
"polish, terrazzo originally stuck to marble and granite chips. The advent of linoleum and",Paragraph
"other durable flooring made the expense of quarrying stone for use in terrazzo, together",Paragraph
"with the effect of terrazzo’s long curing time on tight construction schedules, less",Paragraph
desirable to architects and builders. Cheaper alternatives to both budget and schedule,Paragraph
caused terrazzo to fall out of popularity during the decades of the mid-20th century.,Paragraph
Other disadvantages included the thickness (and thus weight) necessary for terrazzo,Paragraph
"flooring, and the efforts necessary to prevent cracking as buildings shift and settle.",Paragraph
Developments Expand Terrazzo’s Options,Paragraph
Systems for applying thin-set terrazzo and precast terrazzo tiles and products have,Paragraph
"reawakened an interest in terrazzo flooring. During the last decades of the 20th century,",Paragraph
terrazzo flooring in both commercial and residential settings gained popularity.,Paragraph
Thin-set terrazzo reduces the weight of traditional terrazzo by eliminating the,Paragraph
"underbed. The topping, ranging from 1/4 to 5/8 inch (6 to 16 mm) thick, is bonded",Paragraph
"directly to the structural slab. The matrix mix, which includes epoxies, polyesters, or",Paragraph
"latex instead of Portland cement, adds to the adhesion of the topping and shortens the",Paragraph
"curing time to as little as 24 hours. Divider strips are not necessary, except for color",Paragraph
changes and in locations where movement or stress is likely (such as around columns or,Paragraph
over beams).,Paragraph
"Precast terrazzo tiles also open up options for terrazzo flooring; thus, its renewed",Paragraph
popularity. Precast tiles allow easy color changes and patterning and also include,Paragraph
"additional uses for terrazzo, such as stair treads, risers, bases, and shower receptors.",Paragraph
Nonskid finishes are also available. Precast terrazzo products are bonded to surfaces,Paragraph
using epoxies and other adhesives as directed by the specific manufacturer.,Paragraph
Special-Use Terrazzo,Title
Conductive terrazzo is commonly used in hospital operating rooms. Acetylene carbon,Paragraph
black in the matrix binder as well as the underbed provides a path for electrical,Paragraph
conductivity. Static electricity between people and equipment is absorbed by the,Paragraph
acetylene carbon black. This type of terrazzo is also used in some laboratory settings.,Paragraph
Acrylic or vinyl emulsions may also be added to the matrix for thin-set terrazzo. These,Paragraph
"emulsions increase allowable tensile and flexural stresses, allowing the terrazzo topping",Paragraph
to be decreased to as little as 1/4 inch (.6 cm). The Portland cement matrix can also be,Paragraph
"replaced with a plastic matrix, thus expanding use options. Rustic or washed terrazzo",Paragraph
"provides a pebbly finish rather than a smooth and polished finish. Marble, quartz, onyx,",Paragraph
"and granite chips are used in a white or colored matrix. After curing, the floor is washed",Paragraph
"with either water or acid to expose the stone chips, creating the pebble effect.",Paragraph

"TESSENOW, HEINRICH 1876-1950",Title
"Architect, Germany",Title
Heinrich Tessenow was born in Rostock in 1876. He was introduced to the art of,Paragraph
"building by his father, a successful carpenter with whom he worked before studying at",Paragraph
the building schools in Neustadt and Leipzig. In 1900 he enrolled at the Technical,Paragraph
"University in Munich, where he studied architecture under Friedrich von Thiersch.",Paragraph
"However, he left the university after three semesters and joined the office of the",Paragraph
prominent Jugendstil architect Martin Dilfer. Tessenow also worked for Paul Schultze-,Paragraph
Naumburg.,Paragraph
"Despite the sporadic nature of his own education, Tessenow was an accomplished",Paragraph
"teacher. After leaving Dilfer’s office in 1902, he accepted a position at the Building",Paragraph
School in Sternberg. He taught at the Building School in Liichow and the School of,Paragraph
Applied Arts in Trier before accepting a position at the Technical University in Dresden,Paragraph
"as Diilfer’s assistant. From 1913 until 1919, he was a professor at the School of Applied",Paragraph
Arts in Vienna. In 1920 he taught at the Academy of Fine Arts in Dresden. In 1926 he,Paragraph
was selected by Bruno Paul to lead a master class at the School of Fine and Applied Arts,Paragraph
in Berlin. He held a concurrent professorship at the Technical University in the capital.,Paragraph
As an architect Tessenow was fascinated by the problems of mass housing. In 1903 he,Paragraph
"had developed a housing type with roughcast walls, tiled roofs, and carefully detailed",Paragraph
woodwork that was evocative of traditional rural building. Tessenow’s aesthetic,Paragraph
preferences were suggestive of the Heimatstil (vernacular style) advocated by his former,Paragraph
"employer, Schultze-Naumburg. However, Tessenow’s residential designs, as exemplified",Paragraph
"by projects such as his Workers Housing for the Electric Power Station in Trier of 1906,",Paragraph
were not merely copies of traditional rural buildings. His workers’ houses reflected a,Paragraph
pragmatic balance between comfort and affordability. They were carefully designed to,Paragraph
encourage efficient lighting and ventilation and typically included sensible built-in,Paragraph
furnishings and a garden to provide for a measure of self-sufficiency. For Tessenow the,Paragraph
Heimatstil represented a vocabulary of architectural reform. This theme was conveyed in,Paragraph
"his book Der Wohnungsbau (House Building), published in 1909.",Paragraph
"In 1910 Tessenow designed his best-known project, the Dalcroze Institute for",Paragraph
"Rhythmic Dance in the garden city of Hellerau near Dresden. This project, with its severe",Paragraph
"and attenuated neoclassical forms and simple geometries, represented the translation of",Paragraph
the principles of formal abstraction that characterized his houses to a project of,Paragraph
substantial scale. The Dalcroze Institute also illustrated the increasing simplicity o,Paragraph
"Tessenow’s projects, a tendency that was also apparent in the houses he designed for",Paragraph
Hellerau between 1910 and 1911. These small stucco houses combined his sensitive,Paragraph
"detailing with creative features, such as the Patentwand system for the construction o",Paragraph
internally ventilated walls.,Caption
In 1916 Tessenow published Hausbau und Aergleichen (House Building and Such,Paragraph
"Things), in which he reiterated his beliefs concerning industry, craft, and the design o",Paragraph
modern housing. Although he maintained his dedication to the precedent of vernacular,Paragraph
"architecture throughout the years of the Weimar Republic, he was an active member o",Paragraph
the artistic avantgarde. In 1910 he had joined the Werkbund and in 1921 entered the,Paragraph
"radical Novembergruppe, whose architectural section was directed by Ludwig Mies van",Paragraph
der Rohe. He was also one of the founding members of der Ring. His interest in social,Paragraph
"progress extended to his own designs, in which he demonstrated an increasing concern",Paragraph
"for the entire built environment, from furniture through urban planning. In 1925 he",Paragraph
"designed a school at Klotzsche for the government of the land of Saxony, a regular,",Paragraph
symmetrical composition of individual pavilions with pitched tile roofs arranged around,Paragraph
"expansive courtyards. The plan reflected his theories of urban design, which were also",Paragraph
manifested in the residential developments that he composed. The individual building,Paragraph
"masses at Klotzsche were stark and geometric, with Tessenow’s characteristic detailing",Paragraph
limited to the door and window surrounds. The same qualities were apparent in his,Paragraph
"Heinrich-Schitz-Schule in Kassel of 1927. In Kassel, Tessenow dispensed with a pitched",Paragraph
roof and designed a loosely symmetrical composition in which the tradition of antique,Paragraph
typology was apparent only in the regular disposition of fenestration and the elegant,Paragraph
sense of proportion that pervaded the design.,Paragraph
In 1930 Tessenow’s design to rebuild Schinkel’s Neue Wache in Berlin as a memorial,Paragraph
to the fallen of World War | was selected in a competition over submissions by many of,Paragraph
"Germany’s most successful architects, including Peter Behrens, Hans Poelzig, and Mies",Paragraph
"van der Rohe. His plan was notable for its pervasive simplicity. The interior was a stark,",Paragraph
cubic volume lit by a circular oculus placed above a prismatic black stone supporting a,Paragraph
bronze wreath in commemoration of the dead. The exquisitely careful detailing of the,Paragraph
interior provided a counterpoint to its monumental severity. The drum of the oculus,Caption
"maintained a subtle, elegant compound curve in its profile. A complex molding de-fined",Paragraph
the joint between the metal drum and the stucco ceiling. A similar molding elaborated the,Paragraph
joint between the ceiling and the stone veneer of the walls. Tessenow used these,Paragraph
abstracted classical details only where they were functionally justified by a change of,Paragraph
materials or methods of construction. The interface between the stone walls and the stone,Paragraph
pavement was a simple mortar joint. Tessenow’s new interior for the Neue Wache,Paragraph
represented a distillation of the neoclassical tradition to an essential form that existed in a,Paragraph
perfect accord with tectonic and functional requirements.,Paragraph
The nationalistic and racist promotion of the Heimatstil by Paul Schultze-Naumburg,Paragraph
and its subsequent association with the ideology of the Nazi government have until,Paragraph
recently relegated Tessenow to a position of relative insignificance in the standard,Paragraph
"histories of 20th-century design. However, during his lifetime Tessenow was an",Paragraph
"influential author and educator, and his theories were familiar throughout Germany. He",Paragraph
was one of the progenitors of the Modern movement. Throughout the first half of the 20th,Paragraph
"century, his successful solutions to the problem of mass housing in Central Europe served",Paragraph
"as a point of reference for subsequent experiments in the field, and his transformation of",Paragraph
the vocabulary of German neoclassicism as an example of the vitality of traditional forms,Paragraph
within the context of modern design.,Paragraph

"If one had to identify Le Corbusier’s counterpart in 20th-century Latin America,",Paragraph
"Clorindo Testa, a major figure in Argentinean architecture in this period, would almost",Paragraph
"certainly be the choice. He is not referred to here as a “disciple” or “follower,” but as a",Paragraph
"similar personality in terms of his constant innovative and creative capacity, his dialectic",Paragraph
"and changing relationship to the natural and urban surroundings, his passion for painting",Paragraph
"and drawing, and his interpretation of society and history in his artistic production. He",Paragraph
"was the son of an Italian immigrant residing in Argentina, who originated from the town",Paragraph
of Ceppaloni. He was born in Naples in 1923 and maintained a persistent emotional,Paragraph
relationship with Italy (in 1997 he was declared an honorary citizen of Ceppaloni) despite,Paragraph
"his full identification with the city of Buenos Aires. He pursued a career in engineering,",Paragraph
but his artistic vocation (he started drawing at a very early age) led him to the College of,Paragraph
"Architecture and Urbanism, where he graduated in 1947. He worked for one year in the",Paragraph
"Master Plan of the City of Buenos Aires (1948), where he met Ernesto N. Rogers, whose",Paragraph
criticism of the “rationalist” project for a collection of residences that was being built,Paragraph
definitively distanced him from the rigid designs of the Modern movement. With a,Paragraph
"scholarship from the College of Architecture and Urbanism, he traveled to Europe,",Paragraph

Formed in December 1945 by Walter Gropius and a number of graduates from the,Paragraph
"Harvard School of Design, The Architects Collaborative (TAC) was a firm whose output",Paragraph
reflected some of the most cherished and derided aspects of postwar architectural design.,Paragraph
"TAC was a global firm, with offices and projects spanning the globe from Cambridge to",Paragraph

collaborative and democratic principles that guided both the management of the firm and,Paragraph

"corporatization. Also in the Bauhaus tradition, the architects of TAC sought to align",Paragraph
"architecture with the disciplines of art, economics, and sociology. This effort, in theory,",Paragraph
"enabled architects to treat design as a social process, one responsive to the needs of",Paragraph
"individual patrons and sites. In the firm’s later years, however, many critics argued that",Paragraph
TAC simply designed the same solution to any number of different architectural,Paragraph
"problems, falling into a period of modernist repetition. Although TAC was founded on",Paragraph
the notion of challenging the professional tradition of highly individualized firms or,Paragraph
"ateliers led by a single, famous master architect, in fact it was Gropius’s name that was",Paragraph
most often associated with the firm. If the anonymity behind the name The Architects,Paragraph
"Collaborative was supposed to deemphasize Gropius’s role in the firm, it might have",Paragraph
instead helped to keep TAC’s other partners from sharing in both the praise and the,Paragraph
"criticism leveled at the firm. TAC, at various points, included Jean Fletcher, Norman",Paragraph
"Fletcher, John Harkness, Sarah Harkness, Robert McMillan, Louis McMillan, Benjamin",Caption
"Thompson, Richard Brooker, Alex Cvijanovic, Herbert Gallagher, William Geddis,",Caption
"Roland Kluver, Peter Morton, and H. Morse Payne, Jr., many of whom had attended the",Paragraph
Graduate School of Design at Harvard University during Gropius’s tenure there from,Paragraph
"1937 to 1953. In 1963 TAC legally incorporated, becoming TAC, Inc.",Paragraph
Important works from the firm’s early years include the Six Moon Hill development,Paragraph
"(1948) in Lexington, Massachusetts. Eventually home to more than 30 families (and",Paragraph
"seven of the eight partners in TAC at the time), Six Moon Hill was planned along the",Paragraph
"standard (soon to become ubiquitous) suburban cul-de-sac road. However, the effort to",Paragraph
leave large spaces open for communal use and its equal division of land prices and lot,Paragraph
sizes make it an interesting early deviation from the broader trend of postwar suburban,Paragraph
development. Perhaps the most famous project from the first 15 years of its history was,Paragraph
"TAC’s design for the Harvard Graduate Center (1949) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",Paragraph
"Located on a wedge-shaped lot near the northern edge of the Harvard University campus,",Paragraph
"the Graduate Center exemplified Gropius’s (and, by extension, TAC’s) own ambivalent",Paragraph
feelings about the relationship between architecture and history. Although the Graduate,Paragraph
"Center took on the traditional form of the Harvard Yard or academic quad, the",Paragraph
appearance of the individual buildings that made up the center seemed to have little to do,Paragraph
with their surroundings. Another relevant project from this period was the U.S. Embassy,Paragraph
"(1956) in Athens, Greece, whose construction signaled the coming widescale adoption of",Paragraph
modernism as the symbol of post-World War Il American power and prosperity.,Paragraph
"By the late 1950s, TAC had largely abandoned small-scale efforts along the lines of",Paragraph
Six Moon Hill. Instead the firm became increasingly involved with large corporate,Paragraph
commissions. The capitulation of social concerns to the requirements of the market-place,Paragraph
that such a move entailed are strikingly visible in the Pan Am Building (1963) in New,Paragraph
"York City, designed in collaboration with Emery Roth and Sons and Pietro Belluschi.",Paragraph
"With a record 2,350,000 square feet of rentable office space, 64 elevators, and 18",Paragraph
"escalators, the building’s size seemed to obliterate the spaces around it. Responses to the",Paragraph
"Pan Am Building were largely negative, and today it is for many an example of the worst",Paragraph
aspects of an overly programmatic and formal modernist tradition. Critics attacked the,Paragraph
building for destroying the historic vistas of Park Avenue and claimed that it destroyed,Paragraph
"the silhouette of the New York Central Building (Warren and Wetmore, 1929), reducing",Paragraph
it to a mere shadow. Gropius seemed baffled by the criticism and responded that he,Paragraph
thought that the New York Central Building should be torn down to provide the Pan Am,Paragraph
Building with a proper forecourt. The public’s refusal to embrace the objective and,Paragraph
"stylistically neutral design of the Pan Am Building puzzled Gropius, who seemed unable",Paragraph
"to comprehend the attachment that New Yorkers felt for older urban forms and spaces, an",Paragraph
attachment that Gropius considered outdated and archaic.,Paragraph
Significant later commissions undertaken by TAC included the plan for Baghdad,Paragraph
"University (1958) in Iraq, construction of which was often interrupted because of",Paragraph
political instability. The members of TAC had always considered involvement with,Paragraph
"education one of the defining characteristics of the firm, arguing that sensitive design was",Paragraph
"an integral element of the learning process. Efforts such as Baghdad University, however,",Paragraph
seemed at best a pale effort to incorporate faux regional design elements (in this case,Paragraph
Islamic ones) onto a standard steel-framed concrete box. Despite such missteps in 1964,Paragraph
TAC received the Firm Award of the American Institute of Architects (ALA). Eight years,Paragraph
"later TAC designed the national headquarters of the AIA (Washington, D.C.). TAC also",Paragraph
contributed to the massive Boston development known as Government Center with the,Paragraph
design for the JFK Federal Office Building in 1968.,Caption
The demise of the firm was precipitated by the death of Gropius in 1969 and the rising,Paragraph
influence of Postmodernism in the architectural profession and among the public.,Paragraph
Although the reputation of TAC was still quite solid abroad (particularly in the Middle,Paragraph
"East), in the last two decades of its existence the firm seemed to flounder without the",Paragraph
guiding and unifying influence of Gropius. Seemingly unable to adapt or respond to the,Paragraph
"changing milieu of the architectural world, fewer commissions came to the firm, and for",Paragraph
financial reasons the doors finally closed at TAC in 1996.,Paragraph

TIMBER FRAME,Title

"construction—eclipsed by steel, concrete, and lightweight wood framing—maintained",Paragraph
"interest among architects, owners, and builders because of its economy, durability, and",Paragraph
ecology.,Paragraph
"In the United States, timber framing refers to traditional post-and-beam construction",Paragraph
"(known as “heavy timber” at the industrial scale). Internationally, however, descriptions",Paragraph
of timber-frame buildings often include lightweight wood-stud construction. This,Paragraph
discussion considers only the heavier construction—whose columns are usually at least 8,Paragraph
"inches by 8 inches, with beams no less than 6 inches by 10 inches—where significant",Paragraph
advances were made throughout the past 100 years.,Paragraph
"In regions with ready access to timber, vernacular styles of framing with various in-fill",Paragraph
"materials had become established over the centuries. In Europe and England, timber",Paragraph
"frames with brick, rubble, or wattle-and-daub walls were ubiquitous. In North America",Paragraph
colonial buildings often were clad in wood as well as brick. In tropical Asia and the,Paragraph
"Pacific islands, wood or other native materials served as sheathing. Japan and China had",Paragraph

adapted their country’s rustic tradition to create what became known as the National,Paragraph

The English Arts and Crafts movement of the late 19th century continued to influence,Paragraph
architects well into the 20th century. Timber was just one of the natural materials used by,Paragraph
"proponents of the movement. In the United States, California, with its abundance of",Paragraph
"timber and increasing affluence, generated several timber styles. In the United States, the",Paragraph
brothers Charles Sumner Greene (1868-1957) and Henry Mather Greene (1870-1954),Paragraph
ushered in a golden age of timber design with a widely admired series of houses near Los,Paragraph

sprawling masterpiece revealed the architects’ obsessive attention to finishing each,Paragraph
"exposed structural timber, articulating every handcrafted joint, and specifying the finest",Paragraph
wood finishes.,Paragraph
Many architects who worked mostly in other materials used timber to great effect in,Paragraph
combination with those materials. The San Francisco Bay Area’s most prominent,Paragraph

"oldest trees were harvested. Even while steel and concrete increased in popularity, the",Paragraph
economy of wood—plentiful and easy to erect—encouraged technological development,Paragraph
of timber for increasingly demanding structural purposes. Maybeck had experimented,Paragraph
"with a timber arch of smaller pieces of wood strapped together. However, not until",Paragraph
engineers applied the technology of plywood—an early 20th-century innovation whereby,Paragraph
wood veneers were glued together to form a monolithic panel—to heavy timbers did,Paragraph
wood become reestablished as a competitive structural component. Relatively small,Paragraph
sections of solid timber were laminated together with special glues into one large,Paragraph
structural member called a glu-lam (glued-laminated timber).,Paragraph
The economy of laminated timber widened its appeal during the Great Depression of,Paragraph
the 1930s. The shortage of steel for buildings during World War II further encouraged the,Paragraph
use of timber in structures such as hangars and other utilitarian buildings.,Paragraph
"Assembled for beauty as well as structural predictability, glulam beams, girders,",Paragraph
"columns, and trusses began to appear prominently in low-rise, long-span structures, such",Paragraph

buildings. The fact that engineered timber could be prebent and custom shaped allowed,Paragraph
"architects to create dramatic arches, domes, and organic sculptural effects beyond the",Paragraph
capabilities of natural timber. Later technologies introduced high-tech connectors to,Paragraph
enhance the wood’s strength.,Paragraph

variations of which continued to be built throughout the 20th century.,Paragraph

"extravagance was the exception to the rule in Edwardian Toronto, for although the",Paragraph

opulence of Richardsonian Romanesque gave way to more subtle shades of English,Paragraph

recognize two of the city’s most significant neighborhood models: Wychwood Park and,Paragraph
Riverdale Courts.,Paragraph

painter who envisioned an artists’ idyll set amid ten acres of ravine land west of Casa,Paragraph
"Loma. Most of the development dates from after 1907, when the architect Eden Smith, in",Paragraph
"addition to building his own residence, designed a further half dozen houses in the park.",Paragraph
"All were executed in the Lutyens-inspired Cottage style, comprising deceptively simple",Paragraph
"assemblages of sweeping rooflines, stucco walls, and timber de-tailing. Smith employed",Paragraph
this combination throughout other affluent neighborhoods that were then taking shape in,Paragraph
"the city, but it is to his credit that he was able to apply the fruit of this experience to an",Paragraph
altogether different challenge. Riverdale Courts (1914) was the inaugural project of the,Paragraph
"Toronto Housing Company, a coalition of political and philanthropic organizations",Paragraph
concerned with the lack of affordable housing. Set among a solidly middle-class area east,Paragraph
of the city (and soon to be connected across the Don valley by the Prince Edward,Paragraph

"both residents and neighbors. The original phase included 208 units, varying in size from",Paragraph
"one to four bedrooms, in three-story blocks arranged around quadrangles. These courts",Paragraph
had the double advantage of providing every unit with a veranda-level entrance while,Paragraph
maximizing the amount of land set aside for lawn and play space. The careful articulation,Paragraph

The prosperity of Toronto in the early decades of the century was perhaps most clearly,Paragraph
embodied in the head offices of the banks that grew in importance as both domestic and,Paragraph
foreign investment fueled the development of railways and manufacturing and the,Paragraph
exploitation of natural resources. An early example of this is the Traders’ Bank Building,Paragraph
"(1905), designed by the New York firm of Carrére and Hastings, which was later known",Paragraph
"for the design of the New York Public Library (1911), designed in association with John",Caption
M.Lyle. The bank building is composed of a series of layers. A ground level of polished,Paragraph

eight floors of office space are clad in smooth stone and punched windows and crowned,Paragraph

with a richly coffered timber ceiling. Commissioned by Edmund Walker and soaring to,Caption
"34 stories, the Canadian Bank of Commerce Building (1931) remained the tallest",Paragraph

Canadian banks for a quarter century.,Paragraph
"Edmund Walker the banker was also a founding patron of the Royal Ontario Museum,",Paragraph

TRANSPORTATION PLANNING,Title
Transportation planning in the 20th century grew up with the automobile. Only for the,Paragraph
first few years of the century were streetcars able to compete with interest in the,Paragraph
"automobile. Comprehensive plans that included rail transit, such as those for Llewellyn",Paragraph
"Park, New Jersey, and Forest Hills Gardens, New York, quickly proved to be the",Paragraph
"exception. Transportation planning soon became the handmaiden of the automobile,",Paragraph
"taking it where it wanted to go, often regardless of the consequences.",Paragraph
"By the early 1920s, the popularity of the automobile had largely displaced interest in",Paragraph
"planning for public transportation, which faced declining ridership and loss of profits.",Paragraph
"Nationwide, voters turned their backs on public transit investments in referenda,",Paragraph
sometimes influenced by huge contributions by automobile and parts manufacturers. The,Paragraph
automobile quickly became the emblem of the future and national progress. The number,Paragraph
"of electric streetcars peaked for the century in 1917 at 72,911, and total ridership was",Paragraph
"greatest in 1923, when 15.7 billion transit trips were taken. The planners’ preference was",Paragraph
certified at the 1924 National Conference on City Planning when the way of the,Paragraph
“horizontal city of the future” was declared—by the automobile.,Paragraph
The sudden tidal wave of automobility swept over cities throughout the 1920s.,Paragraph
"Suddenly, suburbs began to grow at a much faster rate than cities. As early as 1923, some",Paragraph
cities were debating the banning of cars downtown because of congestion. Commuters by,Paragraph
automobile quickly outnumbered those by transit. In the early years of the meteoric,Paragraph
"ascendance of the automobile, transportation planners raced to facilitate its needs. The",Paragraph
"single answer for congestion was to build more roads, usually in straight radial lines from",Paragraph
the center of the city into territories of developable land at the city’s edge.,Paragraph
The “good roads” movement gained in popularity. Taking advantage of Progressive,Paragraph
"Era sentiment against the monopolistic practices of railroads and toll-road operators, the",Paragraph
good-roads movement advocated for public ownership and construction of roads. The,Paragraph
concept of a continuous national system of highways was instituted in the Federal Aid,Paragraph
Highway Act of 1921 with the adoption of a numbered U.S. highway system composed,Paragraph
"of routes extending across the nation. By the early 1930s, the objective of constructing a",Paragraph
system of two-lane roads connecting the centers of population had been largely,Paragraph
"completed, making it possible to travel across the country on an all-weather highway",Paragraph
system.,Paragraph
"No one was more aggressive at road building than Robert Moses, who, from 1924,",Paragraph
amassed unprecedented power in New York to steamroll thousands of miles of highway,Paragraph
"building projects. Moses’s first parkways were designed for the recreational driver, but",Paragraph
by the early 1930s the wide thoroughfares became conduits for commuters. Moses’s,Paragraph
"massive transportation projects, which combined urban expressways, bridges, and",Paragraph
"tunnels, had an immediate effect of pumping up suburban migration in New York’s",Paragraph
"suburbs, particularly to Westchester and Nassau Counties.",Paragraph
"Moses was many things, but he was only figuratively a planner, as he concentrated on",Paragraph
building a bureaucratic empire. Many of his massive transportation building projects,Paragraph
"found their source in the landmark 1929 Regional Plan of New York, a privately funded",Paragraph
transportation and development plan for the New York metropolitan region. The plan was,Paragraph
"a mix of proposals for decentralizing and “decongesting” New York, calling for the",Paragraph
"expansion of highways and rail links and at the same time recognizing, in Clarence",Paragraph
"Perry’s classic section on neighborhood units, that the automobile was inevitably creating",Paragraph
the cellular city.,Paragraph
"As Moses drew from the Regional Plan of New York, other large-scale plans attempted",Paragraph
to envision and shape the future of automobile transportation. The Regional Plan,Paragraph
"Association of America (RPAA), composed of the era’s most reform-minded planners,",Paragraph
"including Lewis Mumford, Clarence Stein, and Henry Wright, proposed the idea of the",Paragraph
"“townless highway,” thoroughfares that would “encourage the building of real",Paragraph
"communities at definite and favorable points off the main road.” However, without",Paragraph
"Moses to take up the idea, the RPAA’s plan languished as the Great Depression set in.",Paragraph
"With the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1934, Congress authorized funds to state",Paragraph
"governments for surveys, plans, engineering, and economic analyses for future highway",Title
"construction projects. By 1940, all states were participating in this program.",Paragraph
Transportation planning moved into another realm of influence in 1940 with the opening,Paragraph
of the Arroyo Seco Parkway (later the Pasadena Freeway) in Los Angeles (the term,Paragraph
“freeway” had been coined initially in 1928 in a New York Times article by Edward M.,Paragraph
"Bassett, a New York planner). Los Angeles’ first freeway plan, by Lloyd Aldrich, was",Paragraph
"not developed until 1939, and by World War Il Los Angeles had only 11 miles of",Paragraph
"freeway. However, Los Angeles soon became the world model of up-to-the-minute",Paragraph
modernity in its enthusiastic embrace of transportation planning for the automobile.,Paragraph
"The most shining vision of the future of 20th-century transportation, however, was",Paragraph
exhibited at the 1939 World’s Fair in New York. Rarely has a plan of the future city,Paragraph
shown such prescience. The most popular exhibit at the fair was General Motors’,Paragraph
"Futurama, which attracted long lines of visitors who wanted to visit a future envisioned",Paragraph
by America’s most successful automobile manufacturer and that resembled nothing so,Paragraph
"much as the southern California landscape, circa 1955. When Secretary of Defense",Paragraph
Charles Wilson asserted that what was good for General Motors “was also good for the,Paragraph
"country,” no voices were heard in dissent. Eventually, more than five million visitors",Paragraph
came to the Futurama exhibit to wonder at the expanse of miniature elevated freeways,Paragraph
that designer Norman Bel Geddes had created to show the prospects of “modern and,Paragraph
efficient city planning—breath-taking architecture—each city block a complete unit in,Paragraph
"itself [with] broad, one-way thoroughfares—space, sunshine, light and air.”",Paragraph
Although the arrival of World War IL brought a halt to the rise in automobile,Paragraph
"ownership and slowed the momentum of transportation planning, significant efforts were",Paragraph
made that contributed to the huge surge in highway construction afterward. Congress,Paragraph
"passed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1944, financing an interurban system of 32,000",Paragraph
miles that bypassed urban areas. The act immediately created a debate: transportation,Paragraph
"planners, such as Harold Bartholomew, and power broker Robert Moses wanted to use",Paragraph
"new roads to attack “urban blight,” charting expressways through urban residential areas",Paragraph
"to entirely redevelop them. However, initially at least, federal aid focused on intercity",Paragraph
connections.,Paragraph
The increased interest of the federal government in transportation planning and,Paragraph
"highway development soon aroused the in-terest of lobbyists, the most significant of",Paragraph
"which, the American Road Builders Association, established one of the most effective",Paragraph
campaigns in the history of pressure-group politics to advance the cause of federally,Paragraph
supported highway building. Members of the group further set out to systematically,Paragraph
"dismantle municipal streetcar systems in large portions of the country. General Motors,",Paragraph
"Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, and Phillips Petroleum were eventually",Paragraph
"convicted of antitrust violations for setting up an illegal transportation company, National",Paragraph
"City Lines Inc., whose purpose was to obtain control of transit companies throughout the",Paragraph
"Midwest and West and to dismantle streetcars in favor of buses, which were financed by",Paragraph
the same manufacturers and suppliers.,Paragraph
"In 1953, when the highway lobby sponsored a nationwide essay contest on the need for",Paragraph
"more highways, the winner was, aptly enough, Robert Moses, who received a $25,000",Paragraph
prize for his essay “How to Plan and Pay for Better Highways.” The essay proved to be a,Paragraph
preliminary script for more federal funding of highway construction. Although the,Paragraph
Eisenhower administration initially had kept highways separate from its 1954 Urban,Paragraph
"Renewal Act, as had Truman in the original 1949 act, Eisenhower soon became",Paragraph
enamored of the prospects for a large-scale highway transportation project.,Paragraph
"Eisenhower, whose military success during World War Il came on the German",Paragraph
"autobahns, listened carefully to arguments that a massive federal highway-building",Paragraph
"project would benefit national defense and stimulate an economic boom. Once again, the",Paragraph
"debate over “roads fight blight” came to center stage, with many planners insisting that",Paragraph
the new highways must penetrate to the center of urban areas to remove slums and,Paragraph
improve the connection between outlying suburbs and downtown offices and retail areas.,Paragraph
"In June 1956, the Interstate Highway Act was passed with only a single vote in",Paragraph
opposition. The $41 billion bill became the largest public works program in the history of,Paragraph
"the world, setting in place a gigantic imbalance that favored the private automobile over",Paragraph
"public transit. With an effect befitting its size and cost, the Interstate Highway Act did",Paragraph
not by itself create the massive suburbanization that defined the evolution of cities in the,Paragraph
"second half of century, but it abetted it in an extremely consequential fashion.",Paragraph
"By the early 1960s, the automobile was essentially putting other forms of",Paragraph
"transportation out of business. Between 1950 and 1972, transit patronage declined by 62",Paragraph
"percent. Outside of urban areas, it was virtually nonexistent, with only 5 percent of the",Paragraph
nation’s transit patronage available in rural areas and cities with a population less than,Paragraph
"50,000. During the same period, the volume of automobile traffic more than tripled.",Paragraph
It soon became apparent to transportation planners that an undue reliance on the,Paragraph
automobile was creating as many problems as it was eliminating. As each new interstate,Paragraph
"was completed, fresh new problems of disp.",Paragraph
Although an entrenched group of planners con,Paragraph
other voices began to be heard in support o,Paragraph
"acement, pollution, and congestion arose.",Paragraph
"tinued to argue for more highway building,",Paragraph
the idea of “balanced transportation.” In,Paragraph
"1962, for example, the San Francisco Bay Area passed a voters’ referendum for a 71-mile",Paragraph
rail transit system after a prolonged “freeway,Title
with more and more highway building. The ye,Paragraph
"Aid Highway Act, which mandated local trans;",Paragraph
revolt” had voiced popular dissatisfaction,Paragraph
ar 1962 also saw the passage of the Federal,Paragraph
portation planning.,Paragraph
The Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 (UMTA) was the first significant effort of,Paragraph
the century to recognize the need to improve and expand public transit. Expenditures,Paragraph
increased from approximately $100 million in 1964—65 to approximately $1.3 billion at,Paragraph
"the end of the 1970s. Under the program, a type of balance was anticipated against the",Paragraph
huge federal subsidy for highway building by offering matching funds for capital,Paragraph
"acquisitions of local transit, and the principal aim was to attain congestion relief by",Paragraph
making public transit faster and more comfortable.,Paragraph
The immediate effect of the act was to provide new equipment for public transit buses.,Paragraph
"However, the act also promoted plans for new rail transit, such as the Bay Area Rapid",Paragraph
"Transit (BART) in the San Francisco Bay Area. Extensions were funded in New York,",Paragraph
"Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Chicago. New rail systems were built in",Paragraph
"Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Miami, and Atlanta, and planning was begun in Los",Paragraph
Angeles and Honolulu.,Paragraph
"The ironic consequence of most of these public transit efforts, however, was to spread",Paragraph
decentralization of urban downtowns and frequently contribute to the deterioration of,Paragraph
"central city neighborhoods, often increasing racial segregation. Many of the public transit",Paragraph
improvements only facilitated suburban commuting in place of intracity transportation.,Paragraph
"BART, for example, became a high-speed conduit for financial district office workers",Paragraph
from the East Bay suburbs of Contra Costa and Alameda. San Francisco residents were,Paragraph
seldom to be found on the bright futuristic cars that sped beneath the city streets. In city,Paragraph
"after city, the main beneficiaries of the new systems or extensions were suburban",Paragraph
"commuters, not residents of central cities.",Paragraph
The initial presumption of UMTA was that increased expenditures on capital,Paragraph
"improvements would relieve traffic congestion. However, by the mid-1970s, planners",Paragraph
began to realize the need for a more complex approach. Other influences brought about,Paragraph
"experiments in vanpooling, dial-a-ride arrangements, and carpool lanes. The principal",Paragraph
impetus to these revised approaches was the establishment of the Environmental,Paragraph
"Protection Agency (EPA). After 1970, pollution in urban areas became a major federal",Paragraph
"concern, and the EPA sought to develop plans that would diminish traffic in urban areas",Paragraph
"to reduce pollution, although planners generally continued to ignore the automobile’s",Paragraph
contribution to urban sprawl. The shift in focus from reducing congestion to reducing,Paragraph
"pollution brought about certain restrictions on automobiles in central areas, converted",Paragraph
"downtown streets into pedestrian malls, and reduced downtown speed limits.",Paragraph
Although critics continued to argue that the federal role in transportation planning was,Paragraph
only codifying the decentralization of urban areas or providing Band-Aids to the,Paragraph
"problems of automobile pollution, the notion of balanced transportation continued to be",Paragraph
"advanced. In 1975, UMTA and the Federal Highway Administration began to require",Paragraph
transportation system management plans that had to account for an overall balanced,Paragraph
"reckoning of transportation needs as a requirement for federal funding. In 1978,",Paragraph
requirements were added that focused on the needs of disabled transit riders and residents,Paragraph
"of densely populated urban areas. During the 1970s, transit planners experimented with a",Paragraph
number of varied alternatives to the automobile. In addition to the expansion of bus,Paragraph
"services and train services, two new modes of transportation came into consideration. The",Paragraph
"first of these was personal rapid transit, which attempted to answer the mobility of the",Paragraph
"automobile with small independent conveyances. Systems were tried in Tampa, in",Paragraph
"Philadelphia, and at Duke University. The second new mode of transportation was not",Paragraph
"really new at all: light rail vehicles, as they were newly christened, were really a spiffed-",Paragraph
up reinstitution of the old inner-city streetcar systems that had been systematically,Paragraph
removed from most urban areas.,Paragraph
"Increasingly, the federal role in transportation planning grew more inconsistent during",Paragraph
the 1980s. Public transit advocates complained that the government was not doing,Paragraph
"enough, local jurisdictions complained that it was requiring too much, and congressional",Paragraph
representatives increased their opposition to what they termed “big-government intrusion,Paragraph
"into local affairs.” A kind of stalemate ensued throughout the 1980s, with mounting",Paragraph
opposition to freeway building by quality-of-life advocates and suburban home owners,Paragraph
on the one hand and by public transit advocates faced with reduced federal subsidies for,Paragraph
public transit development on the other. Although there were some notable successes of,Paragraph
"locally funded transit programs, such as in San Diego, California, and a number of other",Paragraph
"cities that cobbled together funding for new light rail vehicle systems, congestion and",Paragraph
sprawl continued to increase as a new phenomenon of “edge cities” grew into the,Paragraph
planners’ purview with the most farreaching requirements for automobile commuting yet.,Paragraph
The 1990s saw the influence of numerous state growth-management plans that for the,Paragraph
first time addressed the comprehensive relationship of urban growth to balanced,Paragraph
"transportation principles. States such as Oregon, Florida, Maine, and New Jersey sought",Paragraph
"to link transportation planning with the wider implications of urban sprawl, loss of open",Paragraph
"space, and cost of municipal services. Oregon’s growth-management plan, the oldest and",Paragraph
"most far-reaching, called for the establishment of urban growth boundaries to stave off",Paragraph
urban sprawl while at the same time increasing the use of public transportation within,Paragraph
areas of increased density.,Paragraph
As state growth-management plans began to extend the idea of what balanced,Paragraph
"transportation meant, federal transportation planning was also influenced. Passage of the",Paragraph
Intermodal Surface Transportation Act attempted to put the highway-only approach to,Paragraph
"transportation planning to rest forever. For the first time, federal transportation planning",Paragraph
"included significant provisions to balance local land use planning, the environment,",Paragraph
"historic preservation, and mobility for children, the elderly, and the disabled. Light rail",Caption
"and subway systems, even bicycle and pedestrian travel, were featured as important",Paragraph
components of an overall transportation planning approach.,Paragraph
The notion of what transportation planning is or should be has unequivocally grown,Paragraph
"more complex, increasingly attentive to a wide complex of consequences that flow from",Paragraph
the simple act of traveling from one point to another. The pessimist would point to the,Paragraph
stranglehold of the automobile on everything from the shape of cities to the air we,Paragraph
breathe and conclude that transportation planning has only contributed to the problem.,Paragraph
"Citing the increased congestion in urban areas, the growing number of gas-guzzling",Paragraph
"vehicles, and the rampant path of sprawl, the doubter would have ample evidence.",Paragraph
"The optimist, however, might point to the incremental progress that is apparent in",Paragraph
"transportation planning over time, including the increasing interest in what is often called",Paragraph
“smart growth” legislation that attempts to address the relationship of transportation,Paragraph
"planning and land use, and the increased use of public transportation. As the century",Paragraph
"ended, public transportation ridership was again on the rise, with an equivalent of a",Paragraph
"million new trips of public transportation ridership, increasing by percentages greater",Paragraph
"than any other travel modes, including motor vehicle travel. Significantly, these gains",Paragraph
"were evident in central cities, suburbs, and even rural areas, and the idea of a",Paragraph
comprehensive approach to transportation planning shows evidence of spreading with,Paragraph
increased levels of influence and acceptance.,Paragraph

TRIBUNE TOWER INTERNATIONAL,Title
"COMPETITION (1922), CHICAGO",Caption
On 10 June 1922—the occasion of the newspaper’s diamond (75th) anniversary—the,Paragraph
Chicago Tribune announced a competition for the building of a new headquarters. Given,Paragraph
"the title “The Tribune Tower Competition,” the competition was conceived of as a",Paragraph
vehicle for commemorating the substantial growth and achievements of both the,Paragraph
"newspaper and the city of Chicago. In statements accompanying the program, site, and",Paragraph
"submission requirements, the Tribune Building Corporation—the stated “Owner” in the",Paragraph
competition documents—hoped for something even grander: an architectural,Paragraph
representation of a new time and place befitting the postwar era of limitless and,Paragraph
"boundless opportunity. Viewing the submissions for the competition, Louis I. Sullivan,",Paragraph
"the well-known member of the so-called Chicago School of Architecture, registered his",Paragraph
own messianic hopes for the future of architecture in an issue of Architectural Record.,Paragraph
"Equating architecture with humanity’s redemption, Sullivan gave voice to the highly",Paragraph
"romanticized, Nietzschean spirit of the time:",Paragraph
The craving for beauty thus set forth by The Tribune is imbued with romance;,Paragraph
"both that high Romance which is the essence, the vital impulse, that inheres in",Paragraph
"all the great works of man in all places and all times, that vibrates in his loftiest",Paragraph
"thoughts, his heroic deeds, his otherwise inexplicable sacrifices, and which",Paragraph
"forms the halo of his great compassions, and of the tragedy within the depths of",Paragraph
"his sorrows. So deeply seated, so persistent, so perennial in the heart of",Paragraph
"humanity is this ineffable presence, that, suppressed in us, we decay and die.",Paragraph
"For man is not born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward; he is born to hope and",Paragraph
"to achieve,",Paragraph
"Prominently featured in both trade journals and traditional newspapers, the Tribune",Paragraph
Tower Competition engendered extensive debate among national and international,Paragraph
architects and advocates of architecture. Perhaps exceeding the Tribune Building,Paragraph
"Corporation’s expectations, notice of the competition provided a touchstone for a vital",Paragraph
"discussion of contemporary architecture, resulting in debates that considered not only",Paragraph
"matters of style and taste but social, intellectual, and technological ideals as well. The",Paragraph
competition’s brief was notable for its conscious attempt to elicit an iconic model for the,Paragraph
"future both of architecture and of mankind’s aspirations for the New World, and all this",Paragraph
"was to be represented by the skyscraper. In addition, prominent citizens of the city of",Paragraph
Chicago—always conscious of their competition with cities on the eastern seaboard—,Paragraph
proposed the competition as a challenge to both the city and the world. Appearing with,Paragraph
"great fanfare in the foremost national and international newspapers, the prominence of",Paragraph
the Tribune Building Corporation’s flagship newspaper ensured the competition’s,Paragraph
visibility across the Americas and Europe.,Paragraph
The Tribune Tower Competition brief noted the phenomenal growth of the Tribune by,Paragraph
"chronicling the humble beginnings of the newspaper, growing from a small daily that",Paragraph
began with the printing of 400 copies to a circulation of over four million copies per,Paragraph
week at the time. Mirroring language used by the Tribune’s contemporaries—a list that,Paragraph
included major corporations and civic-minded cultural and educational institutions—the,Paragraph
primary reason for the competition was said to be “the creation of a building that would,Paragraph
enhance civic beauty and pride while at the same time augmenting the profile and,Paragraph
visibility of the newspaper.” As if to downplay the more practical aspects of the,Paragraph
"competition, the actual building program was outlined in rather mundane if relatively",Paragraph
sparse terms: the building was to be “erected on North Michigan Avenue property to,Paragraph
"house its executive and business departments,” with the consideration that the enlarged",Paragraph
(and growing) departments in the plant (production) building would also be,Paragraph
"accommodated. In addition, the building as designed was to provide for the future",Paragraph
adaptation and expansion of all departments.,Paragraph
A more significant component of the competition brief was the Tribune Building,Paragraph
Corporation’s choice of the building site. Underlining the importance of the site—located,Paragraph
between numbers 431 and 439 Michigan Avenue just north of the famous downtown,Paragraph
Loop—the visibility of the building was stated clearly from the outset: It was to be,Paragraph
"“situated at the heart of the business and shopping district of Chicago,” thus ensuring that",Paragraph
the newspaper would be a prominent aspect of the cityscape. By providing an anchor for,Paragraph
"the development of this particular part of the city, the building was to be thought of as a",Paragraph
prominent node in the current and future development of the city and was therefore seen,Paragraph
"as simultaneously benefiting both the corporate institution and the general population, a",Paragraph
"joining of two constituencies in the shared goal of great civic achievement. Accordingly,",Paragraph
"the site appeared to many civic officials and urban planners to be ideal, if not tinged with",Paragraph
"an air of inevitability, as the boulevard on which the property fronted (Michigan Avenue)",Paragraph
had been substantially improved by the city of Chicago to enable the area’s increased,Paragraph
visibility relative to other vital areas of the city. Becoming a central component of,Paragraph
"Chicago’s urban fabric, the site was proposed as both the real and the imaginary central",Paragraph
"node for the financial, social, and political workings of Chicago, a city that many people",Paragraph
"at the time perceived to be the capital city of the industrialized upper Midwest, the fabled",Paragraph
“City of Broad Shoulders.” The design and construction of a new office tower to house,Paragraph
"the region’s most important newspaper would seal Chicago’s fate as a center of visionary,",Paragraph
"albeit practical, significance.",Paragraph
"In the language of its time, the final aim of the Tribune Tower Competition was stated",Paragraph
"in vague aesthetic terms. Accordingly, the successful entrant architect was challenged to",Paragraph
“erect the most beautiful and distinctive office building in the world.” In formulating the,Paragraph
"mission of the competition, the board of the Tribune had sought professional advice,",Paragraph
asserting that “this competition has been instituted [with the guidance of] the American,Paragraph
Institute of Architects.” In recognition of the better-regarded architects of the time and to,Paragraph
"ensure the highest profile among members of the architectural profession, the competition",Paragraph
"issued a special invitation to ten architects of national renown, with the rest of the",Paragraph
submissions garnered from those responding to a published “general invitation.” The,Paragraph
winner of the competition was also given the guarantee of being “engaged by the Owner,Paragraph
[the Tribune Building Corporation] for the commission of the winning entry. Although,Paragraph
"quite specific, the actual submission requirements were relatively minimal: a sketch floor",Paragraph
"plan at the Michigan Avenue level, showing main entrance lobby, stair and elevator",Caption
"distribution, and the connection of the new building with the plant at one-eighth-inch",Paragraph
scale; a typical office floor on a 24-by-36-inch sheet of paper; the Michigan Avenue,Paragraph
(west) elevation; the Austin Avenue (south) elevation; a longitudinal section from west to,Paragraph
east; and a perspective showing the entire building from the southwest.,Paragraph
"The cumulative prize awards for the competition were set at $100,000, an enormous",Paragraph
sum of money at the time. The closing of the competition would occur on 1 November,Paragraph
"1922, with a one-month grace allowed for drawings arriving from foreign “distant",Paragraph
points.” By the time of the “absolute closing date” for competition submissions on 1,Paragraph
"December 1922 (the date the winners of the competition would be announced), 204",Paragraph
"designs had been received by the initial due date, with 49 more designs received “after",Paragraph
"the competition was closed.” In the Tribune’s publication of the competition entries, 260",Paragraph
submissions were eventually included.,Paragraph
"On 23 November 1922, exactly eight days prior to the 1 December closing date, the",Paragraph
"competition jury, made up of selected architects, city officials, several members of the",Paragraph
"newspaper’s board of directors, and other interested parties (a group collectively referred",Paragraph
to as the competition’s “advisory committee”) met to whittle the large number of entrants,Paragraph
"to a small group of 12 semifinalists, apparently leaving open the option of considering",Paragraph

"invitees that included, among others, firms headed by Bertram Goodhue and James",Paragraph
Gamble Rogers; the New York firm Hood and Howells Associates; and two prominent,Paragraph
"Chicago firms, Holabird and Roche and D.H.Burnham and Company.",Paragraph
"At the close of the competition, 23 countries were represented. Announcements of the",Paragraph
winners of the competition and further details regarding the entrants and the nature of,Paragraph
their work were published in metropolitan newspapers throughout the United States.,Paragraph
"Newspapers in Europe, including the Tribune's European edition, highlighted the",Paragraph
outcome of the competition; it also received prominent attention in domestic and,Paragraph
international architectural trade journals of the time. The publication of the competition,Paragraph
results only contributed to the debates surrounding the future of architecture in Europe,Paragraph
and the Americas.,Paragraph
Further recognition of the importance of the Tribune Tower Competition continued for,Paragraph
some time after the announcement of the competition winners. Multiple requests for the,Paragraph
"exhibition of the drawings were fielded by the newspaper’s offices, including requests",Paragraph
"from numerous art institutes, associations, and schools; many chapters of the American",Paragraph
Institute of Architects; and large universities and educational institutions throughout the,Paragraph
United States. In recognition of these requests for a publication or exhibition of the,Paragraph
"entries, the Tribune Building Corporation agreed to a traveling exhibition featuring",Paragraph
"drawings by the competition’s entrants. The exhibition, accompanied by a publication of",Paragraph
"record, specifically addressed the competition’s educational and cultural potential. In",Paragraph
"announcing its response to the flurry of requests from across the country, the Tribune",Paragraph
Building Corporation issued the following statement on | January 1923: “The importance,Paragraph
"of such an exhibit to furthering the advance of architecture, especially in the study of the",Paragraph
"skyscraper, cannot well be exaggerated. The designs in some instances have cost the",Paragraph
"architects competing from 1000 to 10,000 dollars each. With 23 countries represented,",Paragraph
the exhibition will show the ideas of the great architects from all parts of the world.”,Paragraph
"The exhibition consisted of 135 perspective drawings, each drawn on a board",Paragraph
"measuring 36 by 66 inches in accordance with the original, standard competition",Paragraph
"requirement. The first exhibit of the competition took place at the University of Illinois,",Paragraph
both because of its proximity to the city of Chicago and because it happened to have the,Paragraph
largest enrollment of any school of architecture in the country at the time. The program,Paragraph
"for the exhibition was stated to be primarily educational, with the stated benefit of",Paragraph
allowing for the study of the drawings by students and architects. Both the publicity and,Paragraph
the expense of the exhibition were borne by the Tribune.,Paragraph
The Tribune’s accompanying statement about the importance of the original,Paragraph
competition and the reason for the traveling exhibit speaks directly to the perception that,Paragraph
the Tribune Competition was a signal event—sentiments reflected in Louis Sullivan’s,Paragraph
observations in Architectural Record:,Title
There never has been such a contest and it is very doubtful that there ever will,Paragraph
be another.... The greatest architectural contest of history will result not only in,Paragraph
"achievement of what the Tribune announced as its desire, the most beautiful and",Paragraph
"distinctive office building in the world, but it will produce many other beautiful",Paragraph
buildings. It will give Chicago an architecture gem of the first water and it will,Paragraph
add permanently to the resources of the modern architect a mine of new ideas,Paragraph
and suggestions. This was the hope of the Tribune and it has been fully realized.,Paragraph
"With these words, the Tribune Building Corporation reflected the general optimism of the",Paragraph
"new century, an optimism that was reflected in the promotion of the “genius” of",Paragraph
architecture and its makers. Both Louis Sullivan’s and Frank Lloyd Wright’s views on,Paragraph
"architecture, published in popular journal articles and in numerous books, suggest a",Paragraph
"similar point of view promulgated by advocates of the Chicago style, a school of",Paragraph
architecture that viewed architecture as the direct manifestation of the genius of an,Paragraph
"unfettered and un-self-conscious spirit. The city of Chicago, emblematic of the",Paragraph
"burgeoning faith in the American Experiment, comprised a time and place in which",Paragraph
"social, technological, and cultural progress were greeted not only optimistically but also",Paragraph
as above reproach. It was in this sense that architecture and urban planning were almost,Paragraph
"universally—that is, until the spectacular failures of the socially progressive architectural",Paragraph
ideals of the post-World War Il era—regarded as the material revelation of the destiny,Paragraph
and greatness of a new age.,Paragraph

TRUSS SYSTEMS,Title
"Trusses are triangulated frameworks used as spanning or bracing elements in buildings,",Paragraph
"bridges, transmission towers, and other structures. What distinguishes the truss from",Paragraph
"other structural forms is precisely its triangulation, from which two benefits accrue: first,",Paragraph
"the triangular geometry is inherently stable; second, all internal stresses—at least in",Paragraph
“ideal” trusses whose bars are pinned together at the vertices of each triangular panel and,Paragraph
"whose loads are applied only at these pinned joints—are axial, that is, limited to pure",Paragraph
tension and pure compression.,Paragraph
"Aside from its web of triangular panels, the truss has no intrinsic formal identity. Put",Paragraph
"another way, it is the specific pattern of internal diagonal, vertical, or horizontal bars",Paragraph
"(patterns that in many cases bear the names of their 19th-century inventors: Pratt, Howe,",Paragraph
"Town, Warren, etc.) that makes the structure a truss, not its overall shape. One may",Paragraph
"design an arch as a truss, a beam or column as a truss, or any number of tower forms—",Paragraph
essentially beams cantilevered from the ground plane—as trusses. Advantages of truss,Paragraph
construction include the following: (1) large trusses can be assembled from small,Paragraph
"members pinned together, facilitating production, transportation, and erection; (2)",Paragraph
"because all internal stresses are axial, with no bending stresses present, the truss is an",Paragraph
extremely efficient structural form; (3) because trusses are typically assembled from,Paragraph
"individual elements bolted, welded, or nailed together, it is relatively easy to customize",Paragraph
"the overall shape of the truss in relation to external loads and spans, and to adjust the",Paragraph
cross-sectional area of each member in relation to anticipated internal stresses.,Paragraph

Bernard Tschumi’s architectural projects are probably best understood in relation to his,Paragraph
"theoretical writings and ideas, many of which reflect his interest in surrealism and",Paragraph
poststructuralism. His sources range from Georges Bataille’s writings on philosophy and,Paragraph
eroticism to Jacques Derrida’s deconstruction as a methodology. A review of a few,Paragraph
specific adaptations of these ideas for architecture will help us understand the,Paragraph
significantly different way in which Tschumi conceived of the nature and purpose of,Paragraph
"architecture. Three important theoretical concepts include the pleasures of architecture,",Paragraph
"strategies of disjunction, and “cross-programming.”",Paragraph
"The pleasures of architecture, according to Tschumi, are based on the relationships",Paragraph
between the physical (body) and the conceptual (mind) rather than the complete,Paragraph
"absorption of one mode or experience by the other. Two written works, published to",Paragraph
accompany the exhibition of his work at the Museum of Modern Art in New York,Caption
"(Event-Cities, 21 April-5 July 1994), demonstrate this proposition: one text is a",Paragraph
collection of his theoretical essays and the other a book of projects (works from his,Paragraph
architecture practice). Event-Cities establishes the duality of theory and practice that,Paragraph
allows for dialectical movement between the physical and the conceptual.,Paragraph
The experience of duality (or “in-between”) applies to his architecture as well as his,Paragraph
writings. Tschumi relies on the principle of disjunction (a strategy he developed in the,Paragraph
"1970s) to reveal the contradictions that exist in architecture between form and function,",Paragraph
as well as other oppositions and contradictions. Tschumi argued that habits and,Paragraph
conventional assumptions about architecture had to be interrupted or “displaced” in order,Paragraph
to make other experiences possible. He employed strategies of shock and,Paragraph
defamiliarization to radically shift design paradigms and challenge the viewer.,Paragraph
The theory of disjunction is evident in his critique of the modernist precept that form,Paragraph
"must follow function. In his explanation of the design for the Pare de la Villette (Paris,",Paragraph
"1987-91), for example, Tschumi argued that form and function could ignore or even",Paragraph
"conflict, and he proceeded to explore this disjunction or rupture by breaking up the space",Paragraph
as described in the competition program into volumes placed at the intersections of a,Paragraph
"superimposed, non-site-specific grid. The volumes were designed as “folies,” a play on",Paragraph
"the double meaning of the French word folie (madness or mental imbalance) and follies,",Paragraph
small pleasure pavilions or ruins popular in 19th-century landscape design. More,Paragraph
"important, the shape and form of Tschumi’s folies were not determined by specific",Paragraph
functions; but rather were ingeniously designed as formal exercises and then modified,Paragraph
"subsequent to their construction to accommodate specific functions, a process that",Paragraph
demonstrated that function could follow form.,Paragraph
Tschumi’s later work continued to explore other strategies of disjunction through dis-,Paragraph
or cross-programming. The opportunities for new architectural experiences made possible,Paragraph
by these concepts ranged from the “unclassifiable” or “unprogrammed” spaces of his,Paragraph
"later projects such as Kansai Airport (Japan, 1988} and Le Fresnoy National Center for",Paragraph
"the Contemporary Arts (Tourcoing, France, 1992—98) to those heterogeneous projects",Paragraph
"that encompass multiple uses or functions, such as the Rouen Concert Hall and",Paragraph
Exhibition Center in France and the Columbia University Student Center (Alfred Lerner,Title
"Hall, New York City, 1994-99). He defined “in-between spaces” as inherently",Paragraph
ambiguous; they were not dedicated to a single or specific function. This ambiguity,Paragraph
"provoked the uncanny, the strange, and the unfamiliar in architecture. Heterogeneous",Paragraph
"spaces contained several normally unrelated functions simultaneously, such as those he",Paragraph
illustrated in The Manhattan Transcripts (1981): “the quarter-back tangoes on the skating,Paragraph
rink; the battalion skates on the tightrope.” Heterogeneous spaces are not solely,Paragraph
"determined by function because life exceeds architecture, according to Tschumi. These",Paragraph
spaces invited the multiplicity and diversity of a contemporary fragmented culture.,Paragraph

REPUBLIC,Title
Designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe; completed 1930,Caption
"Among the most significant private houses of the 20th century, Ludwig Mies van der",Paragraph
"Rohe’s Tugendhat House represents a material unity of steel, stone, and glass. Situated on",Paragraph
"a slope to provide ample views, the Tugendhat House echoed Mies’ use of continuous",Paragraph
space first realized in the German Pavilion in Barcelona (1929).,Paragraph
"The owners, Grete Weiss L6w-Beer and Fritz Tugendhat, met Mies in Berlin in 1927",Paragraph
before their marriage. They shared a preference for a modern style and an aversion to,Paragraph
"traditional interiors. After viewing several of Mies’ buildings, including the Wolff house",Paragraph
"in Guben, they commissioned the Berlin architect to design their new house.",Paragraph
In September 1928 Mies went to Brno to view the lot on which the house was to be,Paragraph
"built, and on the evening of 31 December 1928, the first sketches were discussed. The",Paragraph
"final design of the house was decided on around July 1929, when work on the",Paragraph
foundations was begun. Several changes were made during construction.,Paragraph
"The house is built on an incline, with the living area on the southern side with a view",Paragraph
"of the garden and the Brno cityscape. On the street, or northern side, the house looks",Paragraph
"unremarkable, presenting a low and closed facade with a wide, covered entry area. The",Paragraph
garage and chauffeur’s quarters are on the right. On the left are the bedrooms and,Paragraph
bathrooms and a terrace with a view of the garden. These private rooms are separated,Paragraph
from the entryway by a vestibule that also contains the stairway to the lower floor. The,Caption
"lower floor contains the servants’ quarters, kitchen, and pantry on the eastern side, but",Caption
"most of the space is taken up with the living room. That living space, which is not visible",Paragraph
"from the street, forms the center of the house and functions as dining room, workroom,",Paragraph
"library, and sitting room. The living area gives access to another terrace on the same",Paragraph
"level, from which a staircase leads into the garden. The cellars, which can be reached",Paragraph
"from the kitchen by means of a circular staircase, contains spaces for the furnace,",Paragraph
"machines to operate the windows, a laundry room, and so on. Originally it also contained",Paragraph
a darkroom because Fritz Tugendhat was an amateur filmmaker.,Paragraph
"The most remarkable section of the house is the living area, spreading over an area of",Paragraph
223 square meters (about 2400 square feet). Instead of designing a series of closed,Paragraph
"spaces, Mies chose to build a single continuous space. This freedom in spatial division",Paragraph
"was made possible by the use of a steel frame, which dispensed with the need for internal",Paragraph
supporting walls. Mies had already experimented with this principle in his houses for the,Paragraph
Weissenhofsiedlung in Stuttgart of 1927. In Brno his use of steel permitted a different,Paragraph
"layout for each level, thus providing an exceptional openness of the living space. This",Paragraph
openness was reinforced by floor-to-ceiling windows on the southern and western sides.,Paragraph
"The windows open up the interior space to the outside, much like the German Pavilion.",Paragraph
"In the living area, the separate functions are structured and suggested by spatial means",Paragraph
"and beautiful, pristine materials. A freestanding onyx wall separates the living room from",Paragraph
the workroom. A semicircular wooden wall with a Macassar veneer defines the dining,Paragraph
"area. The arrangement of the furniture also structures the space, marking places for",Paragraph
various living functions. Moving it would undermine the “zoning” of the space. In the,Paragraph
"living space, most of the furniture was metal, including Mies’ tube chair from Stuttgart",Paragraph
(1927) and his Barcelona armchair (1929). He also designed the sheet-metal “Brno,Paragraph
armchair” and the “Brno dining room chair.”,Paragraph
The technical facilities of the house were exceptional for the time. Central heating was,Paragraph
supplemented in the living area with a forced-hot-air system in the winter that also served,Paragraph
as airconditioning in the summer. In addition the house had built-in humidifiers and air,Paragraph
"purifiers, a hydraulic system that lowered the living-area windows into the ground, and a",Paragraph
light sensor that automatically locked the front door at night.,Paragraph
The house’s high cost and the luxurious interior gave rise to criticism. Modernist,Paragraph
architects of Brno and Prague objected to the project on the basis of their social,Paragraph
convictions. Mies’ German origins and the fact that he had succeeded Hannes Meyer at,Paragraph
the Bauhaus also played a role in the disapproval from his Czech colleagues. As a,Paragraph
consequence Czech architectural circles ignored the house. A different controversy arose,Paragraph
"in Germany, where Die Form asked whether the architectural ideas of Mies determined",Paragraph
the lifestyle of the inhabitants to too great a degree. Fritz and Grete Tugendhat denied this,Paragraph
"in their response, also published in Die Form, but admitted that it was not possible to",Paragraph
change anything in the interior without disturbing the architect’s design.,Paragraph
The inhabitants did not have much time to try out Mies’ living concepts. In 1938 the,Paragraph
family decided to emigrate to Venezuela as a result of the threatened expansion of the,Paragraph
Nazi regime in Germany. The house stood empty for a year before being appropriated by,Paragraph
"the German occupier. After 1945 the house first became a ballet school and then, in 1950,",Paragraph
"part of the Brno children’s hospital, which used the space for physical therapy. In 1970",Paragraph
"the City of Brno took over the house, but renovation on the house did not start until the",Paragraph
"period 1983-86. The building was freed of additions and adaptations, but the original",Paragraph
furniture and equipment were largely lost. In 1995 the restoration of the interior was,Paragraph
"undertaken, with remakes of the original furnishings. Since 1996 the house has been open",Paragraph
to visitors as part of the Bmo City Museum.,Paragraph

TYPOLOGY,Title
"Typology, the study of types or classes of objects, has long served to catalyze debates",Paragraph
about both representation and invention. In architecture the types in question may be,Paragraph
"defined by form (such as central plan churches), by their presumed originary role (such as",Paragraph
"the “primitive hut”), by program or function (schools and museums), or by a historical",Paragraph
"sedimentation of characteristics (for example, English terrace housing). “Types” are",Paragraph
"objects of study, and “typology” is the study of them.",Paragraph
"Typology must be exhaustive concerning its chosen class of objects, and thus its limits",Paragraph
"are as important as its particular content, as when Nikolaus Pevsner opened his Outline of",Paragraph
European Architecture (1943) by excluding the utilitarian “bicycle shed.” Any typology,Paragraph
aims to reduce the potentially infinite variety of objects considered. In the most explicitly,Paragraph
"typological studies of architecture and urban morphology, this gives rise to arrays of",Paragraph
"diagrams depicting variations in plan, section, and elevation, of which a thorough",Paragraph
"German tradition is a useful example (Geist, 1983). Related networks of researchers in",Paragraph
"France, Italy, and the United States continue to work explicitly in a methodological vein",Paragraph
"known as “typomorphology” (see Vernez Moudon, 1994).",Paragraph
Interest in type among architects and theorists can be understood as the search for a,Paragraph
middle ground between the poles of pure invention and blind determinism. Since the,Paragraph
"beginnings of architectural modernity in the 18th and 19th centuries, advocates of type as",Paragraph
a guide or foundation of design have tended to define it by exclusion of these extremes;,Paragraph
"hence A.C. Quatremére de Quincy’s (1755-1849) classic distinction, made in 1829,",Paragraph
"between the “type” and the “model.” The type, for this influential French theoretician, is",Paragraph
"an ideal schema that is reproduced without copying, whereas the model is to be imitated",Paragraph
“as it is.’ Quatremeré’s type is above all not a model and cannot be fully incarnated in,Paragraph
"any single instance; moreover, its various instances might not even resemble one another.",Paragraph
"Leaving as it does a wide terrain open for formal invention, this notion allies architecture",Paragraph
"with fine arts such as painting and sculpture, in which such latitude is important.",Paragraph
Quatremeré’s definition has remained a touchstone for many of the succeeding,Paragraph
reflections on type.,Paragraph
"However, architectural practice, responding to the modern pressure for standardization",Paragraph
"of all sorts, has made other demands on the idea of type. In particular, the pedagogical",Paragraph
"approach traced to J.N.L.Durand (1760-1834), who taught architecture to engineering",Paragraph
"students at the turn of the 19th century, proposes to view the design of a building as a",Paragraph
"combination of preexisting elements—rooms, colonnades, courtyards, and the like—that",Paragraph
"could be cataloged, selected, and distributed in a modular, axial plan arrangement. This",Paragraph
so-called rationalist approach finds strong echoes in the literature of professional manuals,Paragraph
up to the present day.,Paragraph
"At the same time, the structure of architectural commissions has changed under",Paragraph
"industrialization and the modern state. Where once a single patron, at least symbolically,",Paragraph
"would have given the order, clients since the 19th century have been increasingly",Paragraph
collective—mainly governments and commercial consortia—and have formulated new,Paragraph
"and complex needs for spaces of production and administration, recorded in the form of",Paragraph
detailed written programs. As professional attention has concentrated around,Paragraph
"considerations of function, they have come to dominate in many contexts over form as a",Paragraph
basis for classifying what are now called “building types.”,Paragraph
The functional or programmatic type provides a partial answer to Quatremére de,Paragraph
Quincy’s mysterious contention that works stemming from a common type might not,Paragraph
resemble one another. For although the operation of a type must somehow involve a,Paragraph
"direct shaping of matter to produce a family of similar instances, Quatremeré’s argument",Paragraph
"signals a growing distrust of simple resemblance. Such an attitude, surprisingly enough,",Paragraph
is not incompatible with Durand’s impulse to demote the pictorial (and thereby the,Paragraph
"aesthetic) from among architecture’s first principles. Thus, it is easy enough to find",Paragraph
"examples of train stations, hospitals, and town halls that belong to the same functional",Paragraph
"type and yet are dissimilar in plan, elevation, massing, size, or style. If architecture is",Paragraph
"considered to be determined by criteria that can be written and calculated in programs,",Paragraph
"then questions of mimesis—literally, what a building looks like—are of secondary",Paragraph
"importance. On the other hand, the figural characters of the architectural plan and facade",Paragraph
remain critical to evaluating designs. In this sense the functional type and its,Paragraph
"representational or iconic aspects remain intertwined (see Holl, 1980).",Paragraph
Twentieth-century modernism’s abstraction is fertile terrain for typological thinking.,Paragraph
"What unites disparate creations is a negative quality, the exclusion of some aspects in",Paragraph
"order to leave others visible. Canonically, this is seen in the removal of ornament, which",Paragraph
allows the imagination to bracket the building’s material specificity and to see it as an,Paragraph
actual type instead of merely an instance of one. Such a straightforward reduction is quite,Paragraph
close to the basic typological operation of reducing complexity to find the essential traits,Paragraph
of a group. Yet what Anthony Vidler (1998) refers to as questions of ontology (essential,Paragraph
"being), first raised among 18th- and 19th-century theorists, remains heavily implicit in",Paragraph
the modernist context as a tension between an “explanation of origins” and a “principle of,Paragraph
form.”,Paragraph
Hermann Muthesius (1861-1927) argued in the early years of the century that,Paragraph
"architecture strives toward the typical. As if in direct response to this remark, the facade",Paragraph
"of Adolph Loos’s (1870-1933) Steiner House (1910), with its bare punched windows,",Paragraph
eliminates much of the evidence that would allow it to be read in stylistic dialogue with,Paragraph
preceding works. This choice to eliminate historically specific ornament—,Paragraph
"counterbalanced by sensitivity toward materials—is followed through, albeit in otherwise",Paragraph
"diverse ways, in the work of such later architects as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1886—",Paragraph
1969) and Louis Kahn (1901-74). All three develop what might be called an essentialist,Paragraph
"or archetypal dimension, placing particular emphasis on elements that can be argued as",Paragraph
present in any work of architecture and can be recognized in all its manifestations: the,Paragraph
"column, the wall and its openings, the roof, and the ground plane. Such an attitude, tied to",Paragraph
"history but opposed to historicism, can be contrasted with the lively interest in prototypes",Paragraph
displayed by other modern architects.,Paragraph
"Proposing industrial repetition as a substitute for cultural sedimentation, the Modern",Paragraph
movement abounds in prototypes intended to launch a kind of typological revolution.,Paragraph
"These projects are perhaps closer to Quatremeré’s “model” than to his “type,” except",Paragraph
insofar as they embrace the idea of variants and adaptation. Le Corbusier’s (1887-1965),Paragraph
Dom-ino Houses (1915) seek to define a skeletal substructure on which variation can,Paragraph
"happen. In fact a great number of Le Corbusier’s projects, from the Ville Contemporaine",Paragraph
"(1922) to the Unite d’Habitation (Marseilles, 1947-52), employ typological reasoning,",Paragraph
proposing a typical solution across widely varying circumstances. The strategy is pursued,Paragraph
"with even greater rigor and persistence by early contemporaries, such as Ludwig",Paragraph
"Hilbersheimer (1885-1967), who seek to modernize society through architecture of",Paragraph
"repeated, industrially manufactured housing.",Paragraph
"Although these projects rarely continue beyond the level of projects and prototypes, a",Paragraph
"great deal of post-World War II construction, both in the United States and in Europe, is",Paragraph
based on the quasi-industrial repetition of basic types. Issues or considerations of,Paragraph
construction and financing have enforced homogeneity in the service of political and,Paragraph
"financial rather than aesthetic goals. To cite only two well-known cases, the single-family",Paragraph
"suburban house (see Wright, 1981) and the “typical-plan” office building (see Koolhaas",Paragraph
"and Mau, 1995) have achieved an ambiguous hegemony, seemingly omnipresent even",Paragraph
though widely criticized. This situation in turn has created larger and larger markets such,Paragraph
"that, even if whole buildings are only rarely mass-produced (see Herbert, 1984), their",Paragraph
components certainly are.,Paragraph
"Indeed, it is in part this galloping homogeneity and the reliance on top-down or",Paragraph
market-driven solutions that elicited a growing critical reaction among architects,Paragraph
becoming active in the 1950s and 1960s. The reaction is particularly visible in the group,Paragraph
"known as Team X, who organized the last of the Congrés Internationaux d’ Architecture",Paragraph
"Moderne (CIAM) in 1956: Aldo Van Eyck (1918-99), Alison and Peter Smithson (1928—",Paragraph
"93, 1923-}, Shadrach Woods (1923-73), Giancarlo de Carlo (1919-), and others. These",Paragraph
architects view the imposition of a uniform culture of functional planning and faceless,Paragraph
"public and banal private housing as a result, among other things, of modernist",Paragraph
"architecture’s abdication of its proper cultural role. They invoke, another kind of",Paragraph
"typological reasoning whereby, instead of a refined industrial model to be repeated by the",Paragraph
"thousands, the type could be understood as a collective product issuing from local or",Paragraph
"regional culture. These architects, practicing what Manfredo Tafuri has referred to as",Paragraph
"typological criticism, propose an anti-subjective aesthetic, seeing the long collective",Paragraph
refinement of cultural artifacts as superior to the work of the individual intellect or the,Paragraph
technocratic planner.,Paragraph
"However, the debate concerning typology that will be freshest in most English-",Paragraph
speaking readers’ minds is the one that crystallized around a group of Italian architects,Paragraph
"who, beginning in the 1960s, promoted a critical reevaluation of traditional architectural",Paragraph
"and urban form. The group, called La Tendenza (neorationalism), is diverse but has in",Paragraph
common an attachment to the idea that correctly conceived buildings and urban spaces,Paragraph
would show more affinity with history than with the functional reason-ing of the moment,Paragraph
"and might also outlast their current uses to house very different, indeed unforeseeable,",Paragraph
ones in the future.,Paragraph
Neorationalism carries the ambiguous charge that already accrues to the different,Paragraph
forms of rationalism discernible in architecture: it could be seen as anchored in the,Paragraph
"rational, that is, what could be explained or considered reasonable. However, it could also",Paragraph
"be concerned with the exercise of a pure reason, to a point that could in fact be seen as",Paragraph
"irrational. It is indeed this flip side of the rational that the best-known neorationalist, Aldo",Paragraph
"Rossi (1931-96), exploited most heavily, especially the ironic, antihumanist projects of",Paragraph
the 1970s.,Paragraph
"As a representation of the weight of the past on architectural invention, the notion of",Paragraph
"type has been central through two centuries of debate in architecture. Its lack of precision,",Paragraph
"while yet purporting to guide practice, has allowed richly differing uses and has kept the",Paragraph
notion from becoming the intellectual property of any single group. In architectural and,Paragraph
"urban history and theory, the study of building types helps to counter the tendency to",Paragraph
"concentrate on a single building or author. In design practice, type has proven useful both",Paragraph
as a workaday professional category and as a point of departure for debates over,Paragraph
continuity and innovation. Some sort of typological reasoning is practically indispensable,Paragraph
to architecture as an intellectual enterprise.,Paragraph

"Born on 12 July 1926 in Kaiseresch (Eifel), Oswald Mathias Ungers helped shape the",Paragraph
international architectural scene of the second half of the 20th century. He studied at the,Paragraph
"Karlsruhe Technical University from 1947 to 1950 under Egon Eiermann, beginning a",Paragraph
private practice in Cologne in 1950 and in Berlin in 1964. His work can be divided into,Paragraph
three broad categories. His early career saw construction primarily of residences in a,Paragraph
"Modern style, up to the 1960s. This was followed by a theoretical and conceptual phase,",Paragraph
"from approximately 1963 to 1980, focusing on major competitions. The last decades of",Paragraph
the 20th century provided Ungers with the opportunity for a full elaboration of his,Paragraph
"architectural ideas and ethos, based on intellectual and spiritual responsibility and the",Paragraph
"definition of architecture as an autonomous discipline. This commitment, together with",Paragraph
"his daring use of the cube form, situated him firmly as a leading figure in Postmodernism.",Paragraph
"Ungers constructed his early works primarily in the Cologne area, where he opened his",Paragraph
first office in 1950. The influence of Eiermann is unmistakable. The elegant lines of his,Paragraph
single-family house on Oderweg (1951) in Cologne-Diinnwald or his apartment building,Paragraph
on Hiiltzstrasse (1951) in Cologne-Braunsfeld underline a sleek and sober modernism as,Paragraph
regards design and materials. Ungers’s residences from a few years later show an,Paragraph
"influence by the Brutalism movement, inspired by Le Corbusier, including",Paragraph
experimentation with new approaches to space as well as material. The multiple-family,Paragraph
residence on Brambachstrasse (1955-57) in Cologne-Dellbriick employed his material of,Paragraph
"choice, rough brick, and represented a departure from the earlier, simple box form typical",Paragraph
"of modernism. The design of the roof and eaves, situated behind the facade, is a technical",Paragraph
feat that he would return to often in later works.,Paragraph
Ungers’s move toward new architectural forms and representations is clearest in his,Paragraph
"apartment building on Belvederstrasse (1958-59) in Cologne-Miingersdorf, where the",Paragraph
stacked cubes form the basis of a new exploration of space and volume. Although the,Paragraph
"house’s materials and form reference the neighboring buildings, it stands out as a defiant,",Paragraph
new construction. Its expressiveness has caused more than one critic to describe it as part,Paragraph
"of the German Expressionist movement, a development that plunged Ungers into an",Paragraph
"analysis of Expressionist architecture. His essay from this period, presented in 1964 in",Paragraph
"Florence at a symposium on Expressionism, declared his now famous motto",Paragraph
"“Construction is not utopia, but rather battle.” The library “cube house” addition (1989)",Caption
strengthened the interplay of constructed and free spaces within and between the two,Paragraph
"buildings, lending the constellation an association of an urban setting and earning it the",Paragraph
"description of a city in miniature, or a house-city.",Paragraph
"The early 1960s provided Ungers with a few larger projects, including the competitions",Paragraph
for an art museum (1960) in Diisseldorf and a Roman-Germanic museum (1960) in,Paragraph
"Cologne. One of his biggest critical failures stems from this period as well, the residential",Paragraph
construction of the Markisches Viertel (1962-67) in Berlin-Wittenau. Initially designed,Paragraph
"as stacked buildings of 3 to 6 stories, the buildings were actually constructed with 8 to 16",Paragraph
"stories, compromising the original statement of the design. This period represented a",Paragraph
"rupture in Ungers’s career, coinciding with an appointment at the Technical University in",Paragraph
"Berlin, where he taught from 1963 to 1969.",Paragraph
Partly because of a lack of commissions and partly the result of Ungers’s desire to,Paragraph
"reflect on his work, the next years were filled with a “theoretical” construction phase. In",Paragraph
"1965 and 1967, he served as a visiting critic at Cornell University. Three projects from",Paragraph
these years reflect the new conceptual forms that he had found for his architectural ideals:,Paragraph
"the design for the Dutch student dormitory (1964) in Enschede, the design for the Berlin",Paragraph
"museum complex (1965), and the design for the German embassy (1965) in Rome. Using",Paragraph
"the geometric forms of the circle, square, and triangle, Ungers proceeded to create",Paragraph
variations on these basic themes. The result was a harmonious constellation of contrasts,Paragraph
and progressions that would influence his work even decades later.,Paragraph
Although Ungers was unable to build most of the projects he designed during this,Paragraph
"period, usually competition designs, they helped define the possibilities and limits of his",Paragraph
"architectural thought and practice. Until the late 1970s, he produced numerous plans for",Paragraph
"major construction projects, including his design for the Berlin-Tegel airport (1966), with",Paragraph
its flexible plan for updating the construction according to new airplane models and its,Paragraph
emphasis on steel and aluminum. Ungers also entered the competition for Cologne’s,Paragraph
"Wallraf-Richartz Museum (1975), a design that foresaw the building as an extension of",Paragraph
the cathedral area and connected the pedestrian zone with Breslauer Platz. He also began,Paragraph
a time of much professional and academic international movement. In 1969 he became,Paragraph
"chair of the Department of Architecture at Cornell, and he opened an office in New York",Paragraph
"in 1970 after receiving his license there. In 1973 and 1978, he went to Harvard University",Paragraph
"as a visiting professor and was also a visiting professor at the University of California,",Paragraph
"Los Angeles, in 1974-75. In 1976 he opened an office in Frankfurt/Main. He went to the",Paragraph
University for Applied Arts in Vienna from 1978 to 1980 and opened another office in,Paragraph
Karlsruhe in 1983. He began to work at the university in Diisseldorf in 1986.,Paragraph
"The late 1970s heralded a new era of large building projects, including the German",Paragraph
Architectural Museum (1979-84) in Frankfurt and the residential complex on,Paragraph
"Liitzowplatz (1979-83) in Berlin, with its bands of vertical window lines topped by",Paragraph
"triangular gables eliciting the impression of massive, moving arrows punctuating the long",Paragraph
"wall. Ungers’s practice was then inundated with commissions, establishing his signature",Paragraph
OMU as an established but dynamic architectural firm. In this new period of,Paragraph
"construction, Ungers’s commitment to the cube form became the basis of almost all his",Paragraph
"future work. However, despite the reaffirmations of his theoretical plans, Ungers was",Paragraph
forced to recognize that the translation of his designs into reality often resulted in,Paragraph
compromises that weakened the strength of his structures. In this sense his architectural,Paragraph
plans have been in some ways more important than the buildings themselves in elevating,Paragraph
him to international status.,Paragraph
The last two decades of the 20th century offered Ungers the opportunity to realize,Paragraph
"many of his ideas in new forms. In 1990 he exhibited “Kubus,” five three-meter-high",Paragraph
"cubes in a Cologne gallery, demonstrating his mastery of dividing space between",Paragraph
"concrete forms and emptiness. Numerous publications date from these years as well,",Paragraph
"including his thoughtful anthology, Rectangular Houses (1986). His constructions reflect",Paragraph
the near half century of attempts to infuse his designs with uncompromising boldness,Paragraph
"through imposing geometric forms, such as the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar",Paragraph
Research (1980-84) in Bremerhaven.,Paragraph
Ungers ended the 20th century with a personally satisfying commission: the design of,Paragraph
the new Wallraf-Richartz Museum (1996-99) in Cologne. He thereby completed a,Paragraph
project for which he had not been selected nearly two decades earlier. Opened in the first,Paragraph
"month of 2001, the building allowed Ungers to display the many successful techniques he",Paragraph
"developed during his career, in the city where he had first begun to build. The museum’s",Paragraph
design alludes to its historic location between the Giirzenichstrasse and the city hall.,Paragraph
"Here, as in other designs, his building is a massive cube, but it is less imposing than in his",Paragraph
"other constructions, is less rigorous in its dimensions, and has an almost flowing, elegant",Paragraph
"quality. Now the newest home to Germany’s oldest private art collection, the Wallraf-",Paragraph
Richartz Museum is a fitting testimony to Ungers’s determination to address the practical,Paragraph
challenges of construction and tradition while insisting on architecture’s right to self-,Paragraph
determination and a building’s responsibility to fulfill the individual spiritually and,Paragraph
intellectually.,Paragraph

given new powers to clear slums and bomb damage and to expand public investment in,Paragraph
"building housing, schools, new universities, and even new towns. Architecture in Britain",Paragraph
"in the 1950s was earnest and populist, taking its cue from the Festival of Britain style. In",Paragraph
"the eyes of the younger generation, it was condemned as fainthearted.",Paragraph
"The Smithsons, Alison and Peter, were the first representatives of the postwar",Paragraph
"generation. Fiercely critical of the Festival style, they expressed a determination to",Paragraph
remake architecture in the name of ordinary people without ceasing to be radical. Their,Paragraph
design for housing in the Golden Lane Competition (1952) showed how the access decks,Paragraph
"for high-rise housing could become “street decks,” linking different quarters together",Paragraph
with a pedestrian network free from traffic circulation. This was not simply a proposal for,Paragraph
"housing; rather, it was a fundamental reworking of the city and, in theory, a way of",Paragraph
building whole towns. The open-air access deck had been instituted through poor-law,Paragraph
"housing built by the Peabody Estate in the 1890s, and the system was now adopted by",Paragraph
municipalities. The Smithsons provided intellectual leadership for the younger,Paragraph
"generation, addressing themselves to the architectural establishment as would-be",Paragraph
reformers. Their polemic against what they called the “wasteland of the Four Functions”,Paragraph
brought an end to the bureaucratic rationalism of CIAM (Congrés Internationaux,Paragraph
d’Architecture Moderne) and replaced it with the more self-critical although short-lived,Paragraph
meetings of Team X.,Paragraph
Their design for Hunstanton School (1950-54) was broadly Miesian in origin but less,Paragraph
"monumental, reflecting also the influence of Rudolf Wittkower, who had brought the",Paragraph
achievements of Palladio into new focus: if Palladio could create architecture out of farm,Paragraph
"buildings, surely the modern architect could do it with utilitarian sheds. The light steel",Paragraph
"structure was used with an extreme economy, and structural walls, pipes, and services",Paragraph
"were left exposed. The result, in the view of the critic Reyner Banham, was the defining",Paragraph
moment of a new approach—the New Brutalism—seeking an absolute honesty by,Paragraph
"exposing the mechanisms as well as the structure. Although hardly a British invention,",Paragraph
Brutalism dominated British architecture for several decades. It was an important,Paragraph
influence in the formation of the Archigram Group by Peter Cook in 1962 and led on to,Paragraph
"the High-Tech style, which by the 1980s had become the dominant style in Britain.",Paragraph
"In many respects, the Smithsons’ design for the Economist Building (1963-64)",Paragraph
represents their considered view of what an honest architecture “without rhetoric” should,Paragraph
be. This design broke with commercial grandiosity and showed how a building could be,Paragraph
divided into smaller entities that could be more easily absorbed into the city pattern. After,Paragraph
"the Economist Building, the Smithsons were well placed to become a successful practice.",Paragraph
"However, this did not happen, and their public housing at Robin Hood Lane was not well",Paragraph
received.,Paragraph
The architects were not alone to blame for this. Both Labour and Conservative,Paragraph
governments fell into the trap of assessing housing policy in terms of quantity rather than,Paragraph
social effectiveness. Many mistakes were made in terms of both social environment and,Paragraph
"technical construction. In London, the collapse of an apartment block at Ronan Point",Paragraph
"signaled the end of the belief that reconstruction had been successful. Later, this collapse",Paragraph
"took on a symbolic significance, roughly equivalent to the tearing down of the Pruitt Igoe",Paragraph
estate in St. Louis. It marked an end to the supposition that progress was inevitable and,Paragraph
preordained.,Paragraph
"However, this was not just a local phenomenon; it was worldwide in its impact. In the",Paragraph
"United States, the Vietnam War, in which a powerful industrial nation could not prevai",Paragraph
"against a determined people, had introduced doubt about the inevitability of technological",Paragraph
"growth. Europe, too, felt a certain loss of vision after the student events of 1968 and the",Paragraph
oil crisis of 1973. Banham was disappointed in the reception of Brutalism by architects,Paragraph
and accused them of monumentalism. The influence that led to this tendency was that o,Paragraph
"Le Corbusier, but it would not have taken hold so quickly had it not been for the",Paragraph
advocacy of Leslie Martin. As chief architect of the London County Council (LCC) in,Paragraph
"1953, he promoted a rationalized use of the Le Corbusian grid. After the construction o",Paragraph
"miniature Unite d’Habitation at Roehamption (1951-60), the Le Corbusian style was",Paragraph
adopted for much local authority housing in London.,Paragraph
"On resigning from the LCC, Leslie Martin founded a new professional school o",Paragraph
architecture at Cambridge University. Martin’s task was to balance the claims of research,Paragraph
and practice and normalize an architecture that could be seen to fit into the traditional,Paragraph
campus setting. He took a number of young architects with him who shared his,Paragraph
admiration for rational outcomes but who were also able to act with discretion. Among,Paragraph
"these were Colin St. John Wilson, Patrick Hodgkinson, and Ivor Smith. The influence o",Paragraph
"Le Corbusier remained primary, but there was also an influence from Alvar Aalto. In",Paragraph
"Harvey Court (1957-62), a block of student residences for Gonville and Caius College",Paragraph
"designed with Wilson and Hodgkinson, the structure is in reinforced concrete, but the",Paragraph
"facing is in brickwork, so that the appearance is softened and adapted to the Cambridge",Paragraph
scene. The internal court is also softened by stepping back the accommodation in tiers.,Paragraph
Hodgkinson collaborated with Martin in the public housing (1965-73) carried out for,Paragraph
"Camden Council at the Foundling Estate near Russell Square. Here again, we have a",Paragraph
"stepped section, with private balconies facing east and west. Quite remarkable is the",Paragraph
profiling of the service towers: the tops with their carefully detailed vents have more than,Paragraph
"a hint of Sant’ Elia futurism, and the gable ends reveal a powerful sculptural aspect that",Paragraph
comes pretty close to Expressionism.,Paragraph
Another young Cambridge architect heavily influenced by Leslie Martin was Ivor,Paragraph
"Smith. His fame rests on his role as chief designer to J.L. Womersley, the chief architect",Paragraph
"to the city of Sheffield, in the construction of housing (1955-65) at Park Hill and Hyde",Paragraph
"Park, but somewhat problematically it takes on the huge scale of what Banham termed a",Paragraph
“megastructure.” Another influence in the same direction came from the architect Denys,Paragraph
"Lasdun, who further adapted the Le Corbusian model by a confident use of the stepped",Paragraph
section. His mammoth layout (1962-69) for the University of East Anglia and his,Paragraph
"residential extensions (1969-70) to Christ’s College, Cambridge, both use stepped forms",Paragraph
to allow the buildings to melt into the landscape. In another megastructure at Alexandria,Paragraph
"Road, public housing (1969-79) for the London County Council, the architect Neave",Caption
"Brown created yet another project based on the setback section, but with an explicit",Paragraph
ideology not about landscape as such but attempting to recuperate the street as a social,Paragraph
space.,Paragraph
The search for a constructional method more suitable for the British climate led to an,Paragraph
"exploration of brickwork, probably encouraged by Le Corbusier’s design for the Maisons",Paragraph
"Jaoul in Paris. Most visible were the many buildings (1962-75), some using Jaoul-type",Paragraph
"vaults, constructed by Basil Spence for the University of Sussex. Most influential on",Paragraph
other architects was the very precise use of brickwork adopted by the architects Stirling,Paragraph
"and Gowan, first in their flats (1955-58) at Ham Common and then in their building",Paragraph
"(1959-63) for the Engineering Faculty at Leicester University, where it was combined",Paragraph
with large areas of standard glazing to spectacular effect. After the dissolution of the,Paragraph
"partnership, Stirling continued this “red-brick” attack on the ancient universities with his",Paragraph
History Faculty (1964-67) at Cambridge and the Florey Building (1966-71) at Oxford.,Paragraph
"Although he built a major extension of the Tate Gallery in London, Stirling was not fully",Paragraph
appreciated in Britain during his lifetime. He built in the United States for Rice,Paragraph
"University, the University of California, and Harvard University, and his Performing Arts",Paragraph
Center (1983-88) at Cornell University is a gem of a building. He was appreciated as a,Paragraph
master architect in Germany and built there extensively: at Stuttgart (the Neue,Paragraph
"Staatsgalerie and Music School, 1977-94), at Berlin (the Wissenschaftszentrum, 1979—",Paragraph
"87), and at Melsungen (the Braun Pharmaceutical Headquarters, 1989-92}. He is",Paragraph
"arguably the most important and distinctive British architect of his generation, and his",Paragraph
contribution to world architecture has not yet been fully assessed.,Paragraph
"During the 1980s, British architecture was most influential when presented as a",Paragraph
"continuation of the Brutalist tradition founded by the Smithsons, emphasizing structure",Paragraph
and services as principal expression. Important for this outcome were the teaching of,Paragraph
"Peter Cook and the fantasies of the Archigram Group, which he founded in 1962.",Paragraph
Members of this group were employed by Piano and Rogers in making the detailed,Paragraph
"drawings for the Centre Pompidou (1971-77) in Paris, so there is a direct connection.",Paragraph
"Rogers’s design for Lloyds Headquarters (1978-86) in London was in a similar vein, and",Paragraph
"specialized industrial buildings in the United States, Wales, and France have confirmed",Paragraph
"his reputation as a “scientific” architect. More recently, his European Court of Human",Paragraph
Rights (1989-94) at Strasbourg and other projects for France show an increasing interest,Paragraph
in the use of expressive curves as well as in adapting themselves more cogently to their,Paragraph
sites. Designing for buildings in the city center had brought out a need to accommodate to,Paragraph
"context, and Rogers’s commitment to the inner city was confirmed by the publication of",Paragraph
"his Reith Lectures (1995), where he made a strong argument for buildings that will be",Paragraph
part of both a sustainable environment and a dense city fabric.,Paragraph
"More versatile in his use of industrial components, Norman Foster has become the",Paragraph
leading exponent of what is now referred to as the High-Tech style. Originally in,Paragraph
"partnership with Rogers (and both of their wives) as Team Four, they share a similar",Paragraph
approach. He was first recognized for the Willis Faber and Dumas Building (1975) in,Paragraph
Ipswich and the Sainsbury Centre for the Visual Arts (1978) at the University of East,Caption
"Anglia. More recently, the elegance of Stansted Airport (1990-91) has made him known",Paragraph
"to a wider public. The telecommunications tower at Torre di Collserola, near Barcelona,",Caption
"exploits the image of mechanism to great effect, but the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank",Paragraph
"(1979-85) in Hong Kong and the Carré d’Art at Nimes (1984-93) in France, by their",Paragraph
"very differences, indicate that, for all the emphasis on structure, Foster is sensitive to site",Paragraph
conditions and can make appropriate interventions in different contexts. His ability to,Paragraph
adjust to existing conditions was proved in the Sackler Gallery (1985-92) at the Royal,Paragraph
Academy and confirmed by his renovations of the German Reichstag and the British,Paragraph
"Museum, both of which use elegant steel-and-glass structures to modernize classical",Paragraph
buildings.,Paragraph
Younger architects who followed the High-Tech line were Farrell and Grimshaw. A,Paragraph
"partnership at the outset, they split dramatically in 1980, when Terry Farrell adopted a",Paragraph
more variable Postmodern approach. His most conspicuous success is Embankment,Paragraph
"Place, a new commercial construction built above Charing Cross Station and highly",Paragraph
visible from the river. Nicholas Grimshaw stayed loyal to the fixed canon of industrial,Paragraph
"architecture, but his Eurostar Terminal at Waterloo demonstrates great verve in the way it",Paragraph
"exploits the site conditions to make an expressive space. A near contemporary, Michael",Paragraph
"Hopkins, made a sophisticated industrial tent (1985) for Schlumberger at Cambridge but",Paragraph
has shown great sensitivity with his Mound Stand (1987) at Lords Cricket Ground and,Paragraph
the new opera house (1992-94) at Glyndbourne. His new offices for members of,Paragraph
"Parliament, opposite Big Ben, make the exposed ducting for natural ventilation into a sort",Paragraph
"of medieval roof, a strange metamorphosis of Louis Kahn’s idea that the exposed",Paragraph
servicing systems should supply the monumental aspect of a modern building.,Paragraph
"It may be possible to deduce from these examples that, in today’s United Kingdom,",Paragraph
discretion is more important than ideology. Yet the worship of technological know-how,Paragraph
"pervades British architecture, and a still-younger generation bows to it. Will Alsop, of",Paragraph
"Alsop and Stormer, has risen to prominence with his Town Hall for Marseilles (Le Grand",Paragraph
"Bleu), and they have constructed a rail station at North Greenwich, one of the many new",Paragraph
"stations required to service the Jubilee Line, the only completely new Underground line",Paragraph
"to be constructed in London since the war, most of which make expressive use of steel",Paragraph
"and glass. Jan Kaplicky, cofounder with Amanda Levete of the aptly named Future",Caption
"Systems, has so far built little but has received funding from the National Lottery for the",Paragraph
construction of a spectacular Eco-Centre at Doncaster. All these architects employ,Paragraph
industrial components not as rational expedients but with an eye to their expressive,Paragraph
potential. It is possible to speak of a trend that looks to revive the expressive aspects,Paragraph
discovered by the Brutalists in the 1950s.,Paragraph
"Indeed, with the 20th century now safely completed, the drive to attach architecture",Paragraph
firmly to its purely physical determinants seems to have weakened to the point where one,Paragraph
"can discern a movement to revive the concept of architecture as art, as originally",Paragraph
proposed by the Russian Constructivists. This tendency was pronounced in the early,Paragraph
"work of the Office of Metropolitan Architecture, founded in 1975 by Rem Koolhaas,",Paragraph
"Madelon Vriesendorp, and Elia Zenghelis, which at its inception practiced from London.",Paragraph
"From that background, Zaha Hadid has risen to prominence, largely because of the",Paragraph
"rejection of her winning design for the Cardiff Opera House, which led to a sympathetic",Paragraph
"reaction in her favor. She now has important commissions on foot in Germany, Italy, and",Paragraph
"Israel. Her presentations, as distinct from her constructions, are still remarkable insofar as",Paragraph
they imitate the weightless qualities of Malevich’s paintings. When they are transformed,Paragraph
"into actual constructions, as with the Fire Station (1993, with Patrik Schumacher) at Vitea",Paragraph
"in Weil am Rhein, some loss of spirit occurs. Rem Koolhaas, who still maintains an",Paragraph
"office in London, was the originator of this manner; in construction, however, his projects",Paragraph
"take on a distinctly surreal aspect, as with his Villa Dall’Ava in Paris (1985-91) and his",Paragraph
Convention Hall (1991-97) at the International Business Centre at Lille and still more,Caption
with his villa at Bordeaux.,Paragraph
"Even more equivocal, from the rationalist point of view, are the designs proposed in",Paragraph
Britain by the American-Polish architect Daniel Libeskind: an extension to the Victoria,Caption
and Albert Museum in London and the Imperial War Museum for Manchester. In both,Paragraph
"cases, the design arises from a distinctly personal impulse: it is conceptual, indeed, but",Paragraph
"above all it is gestural. These designs are hardly representative of Britain, but the fact that",Paragraph
they have been accepted by British cities is highly significant. Now the traditional forms,Paragraph
"of modernism, supposedly derived from rational procedure and with all the security of an",Paragraph
"objective judgment, suddenly appear as personal expression, which in principle means",Paragraph
"subject to whim and open to question. Britain, it appears, has finally joined the rest of the",Paragraph
world in accepting the fundamental uncertainty of the postmodern condition.,Paragraph

1946 the United Nations Secretariat and General Assembly officially replaced the League,Paragraph

"site had accommodated slaughterhouses, and despite the lack of building space for the",Paragraph
"suborganizations (for example, UNICEF), the Secretariat and General Assembly were",Paragraph
"placed there. Planning began in 1947, and the buildings were finished in 1953.",Paragraph
A planning commission of ten international architects directed by Wallace K.Harrison,Paragraph
had to devise a design that was both significant and functional. Architects and critics,Paragraph
regarded the buildings as important models for postwar political representation through,Paragraph
"architecture. A series of sketches by Le Corbusier, emphatically promoted and refined by",Paragraph

"competition for the League of Nations Building in Geneva, the modernist architect",Caption

"der Rohe had prepared the United States to accept modern architecture, and American",Paragraph
"architectural firms such as Harrison and Abramovitz and Skidmore, Owings and Merrill",Paragraph
were professionally prepared to develop large-scale projects such as the United Nations,Paragraph
buildings. This European-American coproduction was reflected in the design process.,Paragraph
While the basic idea can be traced back to the sketches of Le Corbusier (who felt himself,Paragraph
"betrayed by his American colleagues), it was Wallace K.Harrison who simplified and",Paragraph
"elaborated the concept into a professional design for an administration building, thus",Paragraph
presenting to the international public a prototype for modern office towers.,Paragraph
The building complex includes a high-rise slab (544 feet high and 72 feet thick) for the,Paragraph
"Secretariat offices and, on the northern edge of the site, the curving, low horizontal",Paragraph
"structure of the General Assembly. In 1963 Harrison, Abramovitz and Harris attached a",Paragraph

UNITED STATES,Title
Twentieth-century architecture in the United States exhibits multiple overlapping themes,Paragraph
"that include historicism, regionalism, and various forms of modernism. Although",Paragraph
"architects, historians, and critics throughout the 20th century sought continuities,",Paragraph
disjuncture appeared more frequently. One attempt at constancy involved reliance on,Paragraph
"history as the source for design, as in McKim, Mead and White’s Pennsylvania Station",Paragraph
"(1902-10), New York City, and Robert A.M.Stern’s Darden Business School (1992-96)",Caption
"at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville. An alternative approach lay with the",Paragraph
"regionalists or nativists, who sought a unique American expression based on the local",Paragraph
"vernacular and, often, landscape, such as with Frank Lloyd Wright’s early Prairie style",Paragraph
"houses and Antoine Predock’s abstraction of native American forms. The third theme, a",Paragraph
"quest for a modern architecture, occupied many individuals and includes buildings as",Paragraph
"diverse as R.M.Schindler’s King Road House (Los Angeles, 1921-22), Marcel Breuer’s",Paragraph
"St. John’s Abbey (Collegeville, Minnesota, 1953-61), and I.M.Pei’s Louvre Pyramid",Caption
"(Paris, 1983-93). All three examples paid homage to abstraction and advanced building",Paragraph
materials and techniques. Ideas concerning the American city have ricocheted from grand,Paragraph
"plazas, as with John Bakewell and Arthur Brown’s San Francisco Civic Center and City",Paragraph
"Hall (1912-16, renovations 1995—99); to setback skyscrapers and elevated roads, pictured",Caption
by Hugh Ferris’s Metropolis of Tomorrow (1929); to monolithic towers with little,Paragraph
"connection to the city, exemplified by John Portman’s Renaissance Center (1971-77,",Paragraph
Detroit); and finally the ideas of Duany and Plater-Zyberk (Andrés Duany and Elizabeth,Paragraph
Plater-Zyberk) for new towns that captured the critical discourse of the 1990s and that,Paragraph
"make up a movement termed New Urbanism. Instead of singularity, American",Paragraph
architecture offers a competition of themes and a bewildering variety of expressions.,Paragraph
American Characteristics,Title
Conditioning American architecture is the unprecedented wealth and standard of living of,Paragraph
the country and its emergence as a dominant world power in the 20th century. What,Paragraph
would be the nature of American culture and how it would define itself has been a,Paragraph
perennial problem as the cult of individuality reigns.,Paragraph
Historicism,Title
The strongest and most continuous theme in American architecture remains an,Paragraph
infatuation with history and the employment of imagery from the past. The method of,Paragraph
how this past has been quoted—from fidelity to distortion—and the range of,Paragraph
appropriation from Colonial to European and Oriental has varied. The semiotician,Paragraph
"Umberto Eco observed that the American imagination craves the real thing, and to",Paragraph
"establish that reassurance, Americans fabricate, or reproduce imitations. Architects create",Paragraph
buildings in which the quotation is proudly displayed: the English Georgian country,Paragraph
"houses of David Adler, such as Castle Hill, Ipswich, Massachusetts, (1924-27) or the",Paragraph
"Roman villa as the basis for the J.Paul Getty Museum (1972-74), Malibu, California, by",Caption
"Langdon, Wilson and Garrett, with Norman Neuerberg as consultant.",Paragraph
"The American Renaissance, dominant from, 1890s to the 1930s and led by the firm of",Paragraph
"McKim, Mead and White and others, posited that American architecture and art could not",Paragraph
"be invented but, rather, that it should draw upon the classical past of Europe and",Paragraph
America. Out of this approach came the great courts of honor at the various American,Paragraph
fairs from Buffalo (1901) to Philadelphia (1926). These courts of honor provided a model,Paragraph
of civic architecture and led directly to the City Beautiful Movement and civic centers,Paragraph
such as Arthur Brown’s in San Francisco and state capitols that lasted well into the,Paragraph
"Depression, as for example with Cass Gilbert’s West Virginia Capitol (Charleston, 1930—",Paragraph
"32) and John Russell Pope’s National Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C., 1936-41).",Caption
"Opposed to this classicism stood the medieval revival led by Ralph Adams Cram, who",Paragraph
argued for the validity of the Gothic and designed over a hundred churches and,Paragraph
significant portions of university campuses between 1900 and 1940. Cram succeeded in,Paragraph
creating a Boston-based Gothic School that affected thousands of churches across the,Paragraph
"country, such as Frohman, Robb and Little’s (and others) National Cathedral (1906-90)",Paragraph
"in Washington, D.C.",Paragraph
"Colonial Revival, whether Spanish, English, or other nationalities, has proved to be the",Paragraph
"most lasting historicist approach. The myth of Colonial as the truest, and the earliest,",Paragraph
American style had an effect on others that appear to be far removed. The restoration of,Paragraph
Colonial Williamsburg (1927—) gave great impetus to Colonial Revival and made the,Paragraph
"brick Virginia Tidewater Georgian house a national image. In Florida and the Southwest,",Paragraph
a Mission and then a Spanish Colonial Revival developed as a localized colonial revival,Paragraph

Regionalism and Nativism,Title
The search for a native American architecture that could be based on the local vernacular,Paragraph
or nature has animated many architects. A recognition of localized conditions of,Paragraph
"environment can be traced far back in American history, but regionalism as a coherent",Paragraph
architectural approach owes a debt to the Arts and Crafts philosophy of William Morris,Paragraph
and his followers that reached America from the 1870s onward. Simple overall form and,Paragraph
"complex details became a trademark of both furniture and buildings, which often had",Paragraph
wood peg joints and leaded glass windows contrasted with plain woodwork. In England,Paragraph
"one of the fundamental touchstones was an antimachine, anti-industry attitude and a",Paragraph
return of artisans to the production of objects and buildings. Some Americans did adopt a,Paragraph
handicraft ethic—especially decorative arts artisans—but overall Americans remained,Paragraph
"tied to the machine, and the Arts and Crafts aesthetic was widely commercialized in",Paragraph
"America. Frank Lloyd Wright’s 1901 talk, “The Art and Craft of the Machine,” noted",Paragraph
that the machine could better provide the aesthetic qualities of simplicity and,Paragraph
rectilinearity than the hand.,Paragraph
The Arts and Crafts movement in America persisted into the 1920s. Although the,Paragraph
"overall intention was for a regional response, the movement existed at the national level",Paragraph
through the writings of publicists like Gustav Stickley and The Crafisman magazine.,Paragraph
"Stickley and others popularized the concept of the bungalow, the low-rising story- to-",Paragraph
story-and-a-half house that fit easily into the landscape of suburbia and nature.,Paragraph
Bungalows appeared from coast to coast and became the archetypal nativist house for the,Paragraph

"series of layers that move upward and outward, pinned to the earth by a large chimney",Paragraph
"core, and that shelter a continuous living-dining space. Out of Wright’s Oak Park Studio",Paragraph
"came a group of architects such as Walter Burley Griffin, Marion Mahony, and others",Paragraph
who elaborated Wright’s ideas and helped spread them not only nationwide but,Paragraph
internationally.,Paragraph
Wright’s career in the United States went into an eclipse between 1914 and 1936; he,Paragraph
built little except for works in Tokyo and southern California. This work moves beyond,Paragraph

"City, 1943-59) were attempts to forge an American architecture free of either historical",Paragraph
or European modern prototypes.,Paragraph
Later followers of Wright in this quest for a nativist American design would include,Paragraph
"his Taliesin Fellowship, a few of his students, E.Fay Jones, and at some removal,",Paragraph

"Goff s work, is unsettling in its unconventionality and exhilarating in its expansiveness.",Paragraph
"Another branch of regionalism, more historically based, continued in the 1920s and",Paragraph
"1930s with architects such as John Gaw Meem in New Mexico, Robert McGoodwin in",Paragraph
"Pennsylvania, and Royal Barry Wills in Massachusetts. They designed buildings that",Paragraph
eclectically drew on the local vernacular imagery and met modern requirements. The,Paragraph
work of these regionalists was accomplished and in many cases distinguished; Wills’s,Paragraph
work was especially influential because he publicized it through a series of books for,Paragraph
"homeowners, whereas Meem created an image for an entire region.",Paragraph
"Beginning in the 1930s, a new school of abstract regionalism developed in the far west,",Paragraph
"where architects in southern California (Harwell Hamilton Harris), in the Bay Area",Paragraph

forms exude an air of nativist mystery in the harsh sunlight.,Paragraph
Modernism,Title
The quest for a new or modern architecture dominated much of 20th-century American,Paragraph
architectural thought. A polemical warfare existed between factions who attempted to,Paragraph
"define modern architecture by rigid stylistic criteria. With historical perspective,",Paragraph
"however, one can see modernism as a broad theme that contains—and continues to",Paragraph
"have—a number of different thrusts and styles or idioms, which might be labeled",Paragraph
"decorative, constructive, abstract, and Postmodern. Common to all approaches was a",Paragraph
"belief that reliance on older historical styles was intellectually bankrupt, given the",Paragraph
"tremendous social and technological changes that had occurred. A zeitgeist, or a new",Paragraph
"spirit, had arisen, brought into being by the machine or other technological advances.",Paragraph
"Architects would be avant-garde, and like painters they should create a new expression.",Paragraph
"All architectural modernists paid at least lip service to the notion of functionalism, but",Paragraph
how it was interpreted differed widely. Few architects belonged exclusively to the,Paragraph
"decorative, constructive, abstract, or Postmodern approach. Mies van der Rohe argued",Paragraph
"that his buildings were reflective of their structure with their revealed frame, as with the",Paragraph
"apartment towers on Lake Shore Drive (Chicago, 1948-51). However, Mies was equally",Paragraph
"concerned with creating elegant abstract objects irrespective of the revealed frame, as in",Paragraph
"his Seagram Building (New York City, 1954-58). Similarly, Henry-Russell Hitchcock",Paragraph
and Philip Johnson noted the new methods of construction as a basis for The,Paragraph
"international Style (1932), a book they wrote in conjunction with an exhibition at the",Paragraph
"Museum of Modern Art. However, they argued that the International Style existed",Paragraph
"irrespective of technology, with its own abstract principles that included the avoidance of",Paragraph
"applied decoration, volume rather than mass, and regularity rather than symmetry. The",Paragraph
International Style is similar to the American Renaissance in the attempt to fix a single,Paragraph
"national architecture for all purposes. In this concern for a new universal style, some",Paragraph
modernists stand out. Mies van der Rohe created forms that could be—and were—built,Paragraph
everywhere.,Paragraph
The decorative modernist approach first emerged in the 1920s and 1930s and,Paragraph
frequently goes under the name of Art Deco or Art Moderne. Some American,Paragraph
"architecture was directly influenced by the International Exhibition of Decorative Arts,",Paragraph
"Paris (1925), and also by the European Secessionist movement. This comes forth most",Paragraph
obviously in the ornamental appliqué Eliel Saarinen placed on his Chicago Tribune,Caption
Tower entry (1922) or in Parkinson and Parkinson’s Bullocks-Wilshire Department Store,Caption
"(Los Angeles, 1928). Saarinen’s later work remains within the decorative tradition seen",Paragraph
"especially in his highly colorful Kingswood School (Cranbrook, Michigan, 1929-31). In",Paragraph
"the later 1930s and 1940s, he evolved a more reticent and simpler modernism, though it",Paragraph
was tied to the ornamental texture of materials.,Paragraph
An aspect of the Art Deco was geometrical elements in a setback form with,Paragraph
"appropriate ornament, which appeared in Bertram Goodhue’s Nebraska State Capitol",Paragraph
"(Lincoln, 1921-31) and then in skyscrapers by Ralph Walker, Raymond Hood, and",Paragraph
William Van Alen. The 1916 New York zoning regulations helped in this development,Paragraph
"because they mandated setbacks in high-rise buildings, and architects across the country",Paragraph
"imitated the form, irrespective of local zoning regulations. Hugh Ferris, an architectural",Paragraph
"renderer, showed architects how the setbacks of the tall masses could be molded. Van",Paragraph
"Alen’s Chrysler Building (New York City, 1928-31) combined setbacks with a stainless",Paragraph
"steel radiating crest. At an urban scale, Raymond Hood, as the leader of a team of",Paragraph
"architects, planned Rockefeller Center (New York City, 1928-38)—a group of",Paragraph
extravagantly decorated setback buildings.,Paragraph
A new decorative approach appeared in the 1950s and 1960s in some works by Philip,Paragraph
"Johnson, Wallace K.Harrison, Minoru Yamasaki, and Edward Durell Stone. They",Paragraph
"introduced patterned blocks and screens and also created forms that recalled classicism,",Paragraph
"as in Stone’s United States Embassy (1954) in New Delhi, India. Johnson’s Sheldon",Paragraph
"Museum (1960-63), University of Nebraska, is bounded by decorative, ahistorical",Paragraph
pilasters and arches with subtle curves and profiles that are perhaps too graceful.,Paragraph
The Constructivist approach takes as its premise that technology and construction are,Paragraph
the major design determinants and should be reflected in the final product. The 19th-,Paragraph
"century Chicago School, with its emphasis on the revealed frame, was a major influence",Paragraph
on American architecture from the 1930s onward. Construction as the form determinant,Paragraph
"can be seen most prominently in the work of Albert Kahn, a leading factory designer in",Paragraph
"the first half of the 20th century. He produced large, elegant factories of curtain walls",Paragraph
"enclosing trusses, columns, and open interior spaces. In California the Case Study",Paragraph
"housing program of the 1940s and 1950s, led by designers such as Charles Eames and",Paragraph
"Craig Ellwood, created steel-framed houses out of industrial components. A High-Tech",Paragraph
"sensibility emerged in which great prominence was given to industrial materials, the",Paragraph
"structure, and the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. The later work of",Paragraph
"Ellwood (Art Center College of Design, Pasadena, California, 1977), the early work of",Paragraph
"Hardy, Holtzman and Pfeiffer (Orchestra Hall, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 1974), and the",Caption
"work of Helmut Jahn (Michigan City, Indiana, Public Library, 1977) all exploited",Caption
technology both as the basic expression of the building and as ornament.,Paragraph
"Far different is the Brutalist approach of Louis Kahn, who saw technology and",Paragraph
"structure as elements to emphasize, as with the giant laboratory exhausts and reinforced-",Paragraph
"concrete, prestressed, posttensioned framing elements in the Richards Medical",Caption
"Laboratory (Philadelphia, 1957-61). Kahn acted as a father figure to a group of",Paragraph
"Philadelphia-based architects such as Romaldo Giurgola. Kahn’s work, however, is more",Paragraph
than just construction; it is also a concern for light and an employment of abstract,Paragraph
references to historical prototypes such as the Italian hill town towers at the Richards,Paragraph
"Laboratory; the Romanesque barrel vaults at the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth,",Caption
Texas; or the tapering Egyptian pylons and Renaissance palazzos at the Phillips Exeter,Paragraph
"Library (Exeter, New Hampshire, 1965-71). As with many creative architects, Kahn",Paragraph
escapes any precise classification.,Paragraph
"Abstract modernism, the third major direction, is a radical ahistoricism in which all",Paragraph
traditional imagery is absent. It first appeared in the work of émigrés such as,Paragraph
R.M.Schindler and Richard Neutra. Schindler wanted an architecture that bore no relation,Paragraph
to anything of the past and equally avoided contemporary stylisms. His Lovell Beach,Paragraph
"House (Newport Beach, California, 1924-26) was a series of stacked trays held aloft by a",Paragraph
"concrete frame and his later houses were exploded boxes of “Space Architecture,” as he",Paragraph
"claimed, perched precariously on hillsides. Schindler fits in no stylistic categories,",Paragraph
whereas Richard Neutra was more derivative of the Europe-based International Style. His,Paragraph
"Lovell Health House (Los Angeles, 1927-29), with its white gunite skin and steel frame,",Paragraph
was actually more advanced technologically than its European contemporaries.,Paragraph
"Technology was always an important element of abstract modernism, but never a",Paragraph
determinant. The arrival in the later 1930s of another group of European émigrés such as,Paragraph
"Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, and Mies van der Rohe helped to make abstract",Paragraph
modernism into the dominant American expression. Mies was the more important form-,Paragraph
"giver, and through his teaching in the College of Architecture at the Illinois Institute of",Paragraph
"Technology, Chicago—his campus design served as a demonstration—his steel-and-glass",Paragraph
expression came to dominate American cities.,Paragraph
"American followers of the International Style included George Howe, who with the",Paragraph
"Swiss émigré William Lescaze designed the PSFS Building (Philadelphia, 1929-32). The",Paragraph

"World War Il phenomenon—the large, aggressively modern corporate headquarters.",Paragraph
"Instead of the safety of history as an image to be associated with, corporation presidents",Paragraph
"now sought the novel and modern. The American firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill",Paragraph
became the acknowledged leaders of this building type. Under the guidance of designers,Paragraph
"Gordon Bunshaft and Bruce Graham, Skidmore, Owings and Merrill created crisp and",Paragraph
"elegant skyscrapers including the Lever House (New York City, 1949-52) and the Sears",Paragraph
"Tower (Chicago, 1974-76), as well as suburban headquarters such as Connecticut",Paragraph

Eero Saarinen provided a challenging pluralism of a different style for each,Paragraph
commission in contrast to the single-minded steeland-glass approach. His General Motors,Paragraph
"Technical Center (Warren, Michigan, 1948-56) suggested a Miesian aesthetic, but he",Paragraph
increasingly recognized that form knew no boundaries. In his later works such as the,Paragraph
"TWA Airport Terminal (1956-62) at New York’s John F.Kennedy Airport, or the Dulles",Paragraph

"dynamic forms. He also explored a historical contextualism in Morse and Stiles Colleges,",Paragraph

A roughness of concrete and dramatic sculptural form similar to Le Corbusier’s late,Paragraph

Contradiction in Architecture (1966) and his later (with Denise Scott Brown and Steven,Paragraph

"Influenced by the contemporaneous pop art movement, Venturi argued that architects",Paragraph
should look to the roadside “strip” and that buildings were primarily “signs” with,Paragraph
communicative systems involving nonfunctional elements such as ornament. Symbolism,Paragraph
treated with irony became his firm’s trademark. Venturi’s mother’s house (Vanna Venturi,Paragraph

Moore also showed a sensibility to history and used ornament in an unorthodox and even,Paragraph

"lurking figurative molding of space and form. Similarly, his Den-ver Public Library",Paragraph
(1995) has a relation to the particularized western mining context but contains its own,Paragraph
individuality. Postmodernism’s critique of the failure of modernism included its lack of,Paragraph

Unity Temple is the building for what was originally Unity Church (since 1961 known,Paragraph
as the Unitarian-Universalist Church) at 875 Lake Street in the west Chicago suburb of,Paragraph
"Oak Park, Illinois, designed and built by Frank Lloyd Wright from 1905 to 1909. The",Paragraph
structure was Wright’s first church and his first building wholly of concrete. Its stark,Paragraph
geometry and new material marked it to contemporaries as a work of modern,Paragraph
architecture. It is among the most well-known modernist church buildings of the 20th,Paragraph
century. Unity Temple is one of Wright’s two outstanding nonresidential works of his,Paragraph
"first mature period before 1910, the other being the Larkin Company Administration",Paragraph
"Building in Buffalo, New York, designed and built in 1902-06. In his autobiography,",Paragraph
Wright wrote of Unity Temple as one of the works that best exemplified his method of,Paragraph
design.,Paragraph
Unity Church in Oak Park had previously worshiped in a traditional neo-Gothic wood,Paragraph
"building with a tall frontal steeple, which was destroyed by fire in a lightning storm in",Paragraph
"June 1905, just after Wright had returned from his first trip abroad to Japan. Wright had",Paragraph
been raised as a Unitarian and was a member of Unity Church during his residence in,Paragraph
"Oak Park from 1887 to 1909. After the destruction of its older building, Unity Church",Paragraph
"acquired a more centrally located site and appointed a committee, headed by Rev.",Paragraph
"Rodney Johonnot, that chose Wright as architect for a new building by September 1905.",Paragraph
"After much discussion, Unity Church approved Wright’s design for Unity Temple in",Paragraph
April 1906 for the new site on Oak Park’s Lake Street amid the expensive monumental,Caption
"stone buildings of other Protestant churches. In the spring of 1906, construction began on",Paragraph
"Unity House, the lower rectangular southern part of the building used as a parish hall for",Paragraph
"social events, and it opened in September 1907. Unity Temple proper, the higher cubic",Paragraph
"auditorium for worship services on the site’s north side, was opened for its first service in",Paragraph
"October 1908, although work continued into 1909.",Paragraph
"Working within a tight site and a minimal budget, Wright planned Unity Temple and",Paragraph
Unity House as two semi-independently built volumes with a common central entrance,Paragraph
"hall between them set back from Lake Street. From this street, paths along either side of",Paragraph
Unity Temple lead back and up steps to raised outdoor terraces on the east and west sides,Paragraph
of the entrance hall. Above the doors on both sides of the hall is a Unitarian motto of the,Paragraph

"west sides. These galleries, as well as the pews on the main floor level, address the pulpit",Paragraph
"in the center of the auditorium’s south side, behind which rises the tall organ screen",Caption
covering the room’s central south wall. Worshipers at all levels were to exit the,Paragraph
"auditorium by filing to either side of the pulpit, where they could greet the minister, and",Paragraph
then descend steps back down to the entrance hall.,Paragraph
Unity Temple’s auditorium has clerestory windows of mostly clear glass around all,Paragraph
four sides and a coffered ceiling of concrete beams filled with panes of colored art glass.,Caption
The combination of the fully skylit central ceiling and the continuous clerestory windows,Paragraph
around all four sides of the space makes Unity Temple’s interior consistently bright with,Paragraph
daylight. Yet because of the depth of the ceiling coffers and the deep overhang of the roof,Paragraph
"slabs beyond the clerestory windows, the ambient daylight is even, unlike unmodulated",Paragraph
direct sunlight. The overall luminosity of the temple contrasts with the darkness of the,Paragraph
"low side access “cloisters” so that on entering the temple, one passes through darkness to",Paragraph
"light. The linear designs for both the clerestory and the skylight glass, like the designs for",Paragraph
"squared lamps that descend from the central ceiling’s four corners, are related to the",Paragraph
"room’s overall square and rectilinear geometry. The whole structure is of concrete, either",Paragraph
"reinforced with steel rods or encasing steel beams or trusses. Practically, the choice of",Paragraph
"concrete created a fireproof church. Symbolically, the monolithic construction conveyed",Paragraph
"the Unitarian ideal of unity, just as the liberal religious concept of divinity residing in",Paragraph
humanity was conveyed in the auditorium’s volume (which accommodated 450,Paragraph
worshipers who face one another in a room only 35 feet wide between balcony fronts).,Paragraph
Wright used narrow dark-stained oak strips to define the variably tinted planar surfaces of,Paragraph
plastered and plain concrete. The colored planes and wood lines create the room’s,Paragraph
"abstract aesthetic with minimal means. In 1984, Unity Temple’s original interior colors",Paragraph
"were restored, as were those of the entrance hall. Outside, Wright used repeated wood",Caption
"formwork for pouring walls, roof slabs, corner stair blocks, and ornamentally cast",Caption
columns. The original exterior revealed the lines of this wood formwork and the pour,Paragraph
"layers of the concrete, whose surface featured an aggregate of bird’s-eye gravel. In 1973—",Paragraph
"74, the building’s exterior was almost entirely recoated to approximate the original",Paragraph
"surface, which was retained on the ornamental columns and roof slab soffits.",Paragraph
"Although highly original as a design for a church building, Unity Temple might",Paragraph

of Unity Temple and Unity House joined by the entrance hall recalls that of,Paragraph

"Designed by Eric Mendelsohn; completed 1928 (Schaubitihne am Lehninerplatz,",Caption
"reconstruction by Jiirgen Sawade, 1978-81)",Caption
The Universum Cinema and the WOGA (Wohnhaus-Grundstiicks-Verwertungs-,Title
Aktien-Gesellschaft) housing complex—Mendelsohn’s sole realized urban project—was,Paragraph
conceived and built in various phases between 1925 and 1931 on the last undeveloped,Paragraph
block along the western section of the Kurfiirstendamm in Berlin. The genesis of the,Paragraph
project was made difficult by the evolving program and the rivalry with Jiirgen,Paragraph
"Bachmann, another architect hired for his experience in speculative development by the",Paragraph
site owner Mosse.,Paragraph
Mendelsohn’s first scheme (1925) for a large residential program was quite,Paragraph
"revolutionary in the context of the bourgeois district, as it integrated the typological",Paragraph
advances of the urban (Paul Mebes in Berlin-Stieglitz) and suburban housing reform,Paragraph
movement (Taut and Wagner at Berlin Britz). The thin bars of cross-ventilated,Paragraph
apartments with common green areas at the back contrasted with the lot-based character,Paragraph
of the neighborhood. As construction proceeded at Paulsborner and Albrecht-Achilles,Paragraph
streets according to Bachmann’s plans (they showed a similar housing layout and interior,Paragraph
"residential street), Mendelsohn redesigned his scheme.",Paragraph
The motion picture theater and its characteristic semicircular volume on the Kudamm,Paragraph
"appeared in the second version of 1926. Lined with shops, the “streamlined” interior",Paragraph
street or “Basarstrasse” opened on the boulevard; the other end terminated into an ellipse-,Paragraph
"shaped Revuetheater. In the definitive layout of 1928, Mendelsohn shortened the inner",Paragraph
street and framed it with a seven-story 300-room hotel. To the left the circular Kabarett,Caption
"der Komiker was placed behind a restaurant, whereas on the other side, the interior axis",Paragraph
of the 1800-seat Universum Cinema was now asymmetrically shifted to accommodate a,Paragraph
ring of shops. A long five-story housing bar closed the site along Cicerostrasse (rebuilt in,Paragraph
1980-81). Its multiple entrances servicing two large apartments per floor were marked by,Paragraph
"slightly projecting curved balconies. Bands of brick-clad walls connected them, thus",Paragraph
creating strong horizontal accents terminated by returning semicircular balconies. The,Paragraph
half-cylindrical and glazed staircases rhythmically accentuated the garden facade.,Caption
Mendelsohn rejected the urban-utopian component of the Expressionist movement as,Paragraph
well as advocates of an International Style that espoused purity of aesthetic means over,Paragraph
"context. He studied in Munich with Theodor Fischer (1862—1938) along with Bruno Taut,",Paragraph
"Hannes Meyer, J.J.P.Oud, and Ernst May. Under Fischer’s tutelage these architects",Paragraph
"assimilated the lessons of Camillo Sitte, and further kept the street, albeit reinvented, as",Paragraph
the primary element of their urban design strategy.,Paragraph
"At the WOGA complex, Mendelsohn attempted to interpret the collective memory of",Paragraph
"the city. His final and genuinely tridimensional arrangement of masses—elevator shafts,",Paragraph
"stage tower above the screen, vertical hotel—achieved quasi-medieval spatial effects. The",Caption
"bridgelike structure of the hotel brings to mind the Torhaus or gatehouse, a centuries-old",Paragraph
sight of the German city and a popular building type that Walter Gropius used at the,Paragraph
"Bauhaus-Dessau, and Bruno Taut and Otto Salvisberg in their Berlin housing projects.",Paragraph
For Mendelsohn it became a recurrent device as seen in his first project for the Deutsche,Paragraph
Metallarbeiter-Verbandshaus (1929-30) or in his design for the Alexanderplatz (1931—,Paragraph
32). The shape of the Universum also recalled Friedrich Gilly’s sketches for a modern,Paragraph
theater (1798) inspired by the Théatre Feydeau in Paris. Mendelsohn’s brickclad volume,Paragraph
"did not reveal the theater itself as in Gotfried Semper’s Opera House in Dresden (1878),",Paragraph
but the dramatic foyer was accessed through a recessed entrance between the shops.,Paragraph
The WOGA complex became the point of reference for Martin Wagner’s redesign of,Paragraph
"central Berlin, where the “flow lines” of motorized traffic and the “walking lines” of the",Paragraph
pedestrians would smoothly guide the steps of the modern flaneur. This commercial,Paragraph
Grossstadtarchitektur had to be inexpensive yet striking to capture the buying power of,Paragraph
the “distracted” Berliner. From 1924 (Metropolis) the facades of the Ufa-Palast and other,Paragraph
theaters in Berlin became brilliantly lighted billboards. Mendelsohn made them into,Paragraph
"architecture (Reklamearchitektur, according to Adolf Behne). It was so “cinematic” that",Paragraph
"its glass walls and rounded corners became the background of Sunrise, the first",Paragraph
Hollywood film by Murnau in 1927.,Paragraph
"Color, form, and light were the ingredients of Mendelsohn’s architectural version of",Paragraph
"Nietzsche’s The Birth of Tragedy, where “the music of masses in motion was contrasted",Paragraph
"with the spirit of gravity” (Neumeyer, 1999). The luminous blue of the ceiling dominated",Paragraph
"the double-height entrance hall, with the futurist glass-enclosed ticket office in the center.",Caption
The mahogany-red cinema followed Mendelsohn’s sketches quite closely: the bright,Paragraph
balcony and the ceiling lights made the eyes converge toward the flat screen. For all its,Paragraph
"modernity, the cinema was still conceived of as a theater, with an orchestra pit and a",Paragraph
small fly tower above the screen and its curtain.,Caption
The Universum influenced an entire generation of theaters around the world: from,Paragraph
"Argentina to England (the Odeon cinemas by Harry Weedon) and Tel Aviv, where I.",Paragraph
Megidovitch’s curved volume of the Kino Esther Cinema at Dizengoff Circle (1938-39),Caption
"matched Mendelsohn’s urban statement. In the United States, two Manhattan interiors",Paragraph
prolonged Mendelsohn’s experiment in conciseness. Frederick Kiesler’s (1890-1965),Paragraph
Film Guild Cinema (1928-30) had a megaphone-shaped auditorium and a curtainless,Paragraph
screen in the center of a painted circle; in the New School for Social Research (1929-31),Caption
"by Joseph Urban (1872-1933), the egg-shaped auditorium displayed a bold set of red and",Paragraph

URBAN PLANNING,Title
"Cities are mankind’s most universal contribution on earth. Throughout human history, it",Paragraph
is within cities that mankind has explored all counterpoints of himself in relation to his,Paragraph
"physical world: man within architecture, man within nature, man as individual and",Title
"communal being, man and machine, mankind within temple and shelter. From the ancient",Paragraph
"urbs of Rome to the modernity of downtown America, the historical aim of urban",Paragraph
planning has been to impose physical order on things that by nature are chaotic. For two,Paragraph
"millennia, cities have been formed by the seemingly omniscient hand of urban planning",Paragraph
"or, less fortunately, by the lack thereof. Herein lies the virtually impossible meaning of",Paragraph
urban planning.,Paragraph
Defining Urban Planning,Title
"Urban planning is both art and social science. It encompasses the contemporary city, the",Paragraph
"historical site, architecture, the environment, economics, and social interaction. Urban",Caption
planning constructs the city of today while creating the model of the city that will exist in,Paragraph
"the next decades. Unlike architecture, urban planning is a public profession dedicated not",Paragraph
"to individual clients but to the common good, which is a weighty responsibility. Even for",Paragraph
"an urban planner, it is difficult to define the obligations and limits of the profession. To",Paragraph
"attempt to define urban planning, this article will limit itself to physical planning, to",Paragraph
"major Western cities, and to the most influential threads in the history and theory of",Paragraph
planning.,Paragraph
"Parameters of the subject of physical planning include facilities for housing,",Paragraph
"transportation, education, health care, and basic urban infrastructure, such as streets,",Paragraph
"sidewalks, and water supply, down to the most mundane enterprises of sewers and waste",Paragraph
"disposal. Urban planning, although often unobserved, is operating on the micro- and the",Paragraph
"macroscale. The city, as we experience its immediate urban form, is composed of street",Paragraph
"pattern, skyline, vista, and details such as streetscape, signage, and building setbacks.",Paragraph
Urban planning must also deal with the larger issues of city form and the distribution of,Paragraph
"urban land resources through zoning, land use controls, density, and neighborhood",Paragraph
"considerations. In the urban environment, open space, greenery, and parks are integral to",Paragraph
"urban planning, and public art enlivens the city; the arts and nature are fundamental to",Paragraph
"urban design. The context of buildings is an important design element of cities; hence, the",Paragraph
relationships of new architecture to existing urban fabric and to historical districts must,Paragraph
be respected by the planner. The city must further be considered not in isolation but in its,Paragraph
larger regional context. These parameters only begin to define the minimum functional,Paragraph
city.,Paragraph
"In the greatest of cities, function is only a starting point for urbanism, and urban design",Paragraph
"reaches higher toward monumentality, achieved through the symbolic meaning of visual",Paragraph
configurations and architectural landmarks. We can observe historical examples of,Paragraph
planned cities that have exceeded the expectations of function to become symbolic urban,Paragraph
"spaces in New York, London, Paris, and Rome.",Paragraph
A Brief History of Urban Planning,Title
"Modern Western urban planning has its origins in the Roman concept of the castrum city,",Paragraph
"the infinitely logical encampment created in a coherent grid in the Roman provinces, still",Paragraph
"visible in the antique sections of European towns, such as the City section of London, in",Paragraph
"the Ile de la Cité of Paris, or in Tuscan squares. Thus, the contemporary idea of a city as",Paragraph
"an entity that can be envisioned, designed, constructed, and administered by a thinking",Paragraph
"authority, a kind of bureaucratic but benevolent despot (which might be thought of as the",Paragraph
"theoretical basis of modern city planning), is really quite an ancient concept. After the",Paragraph
"decline of the Roman Empire, the concept of the ordered city declined as well, as order",Paragraph
was more often relegated to the sacred space of the cathedral than to the secular space of,Paragraph
"the city. In the French town of Chartres, for example, one finds the chaos of the medieval",Paragraph
city’s streets pushing up against the organized mass of the divinely ordered architectural,Paragraph
universe of the cathedral.,Paragraph
"The Renaissance, with its rebirth of ancient forms, derived and ultimately",Paragraph
monumentalized the Roman ideal of city planning. Michelangelo’s plan for the Roman,Paragraph
"Campidoglio is one of the most complete and perfectly executed plans for a city sector,",Paragraph
constructed to front a medieval agglomeration of buildings that themselves had grown up,Paragraph
on the edge of the once highly ordered Roman Forum. Although the Campidoglio was,Paragraph
"intended not as an inhabitable city but as a symbolic urban space, it followed the Roman",Paragraph
ideal of the imposition of physical order on chaos. Based on Michelangelo’s ingenious,Paragraph
"geometric patterning and centered on the Roman statue of Marcus Aurelius, this",Paragraph
Renaissance masterpiece recalls the order and majesty of ancient Roman planning.,Paragraph
Great baroque urban schemes dwarfed even these Renaissance plans. Bernini’s,Paragraph
extension of St. Peter’s exterior space into Rome via his colonnade set the stage for,Paragraph
"sweeping baroque urban-planning schemes, with their spatial command and shaping of",Paragraph
urban space. Cities extended themselves as medieval city walls were torn down and,Paragraph
replaced with dynamic baroque schemes throughout Europe. Whole cities became works,Paragraph
of art as urban planning reached its dramatic heights in the 16th and 17th centuries.,Paragraph
"The greatest sweep of urban planning, however, was yet to come in the deconstruction",Paragraph
and reassemblage of Paris in the 19th century. Paris saw the massive imposition of,Paragraph
"planning on a chaotic, medieval city with the fervor of Baron von Haussmann’s straight,",Paragraph
"grand éfoile, or star, of boulevards, with bridges and Napoleonic monuments highlighted.",Paragraph
The grand radiating boulevards of Paris created vistas and promenade spaces through the,Paragraph
"city that we now identify with the French Enlightenment, with clarity and reason in urban",Paragraph
design. The influence of French planning can be felt in the United States in L’Enfant’s,Paragraph
"radiating plan for Washington, D.C.",Caption
"Urban planning in London is quite a contrast to Paris, for London never experienced an",Paragraph
overlaid unifying design but remained instead a kind of crazy quilt city of interconnected,Paragraph
"sectors, some of which have within them their own individual internal order. In the",Paragraph
"United States, Boston is the closest analogy to London in form: antique, irrational street",Paragraph
patterns contrasting with 19th-century planned sectors. Geometric classicism in urban,Paragraph
design had enlightened London from the 18th through the early 19th century in the,Paragraph
"planning of the west end. London’s Bloomsbury, in particular, was developed with order",Paragraph
imposed via gridded streets and squares and by the graceful repetition of building forms,Paragraph
in the standardized 18th-century row houses.,Paragraph
"In opposition to the urbane geometric order of Bloomsbury, however, British urban",Paragraph
planning likewise produced plans that were decidedly antiurban and picturesque. The late,Paragraph
"19th century in England felt a schism between city and town, urban life and suburban,",Paragraph
that developed as a reaction to the tragic consequences of industrialization. Picturesque,Paragraph
"inventions in urban planning, the schemes for garden cities and suburbs for the",Paragraph
"amelioration of slums, such as Ebenezer Howard’s Garden Cities of To-morrow (1902),",Paragraph
"were alternatives to cities. In the United States, the City Beautiful movement, epitomized",Paragraph
"by Daniel Burnham’s Chicago and San Francisco plans, with their romanticized",Paragraph
"picturesque curvilinear lines, can be traced to this aesthetic.",Paragraph
"Thus, the ideal of the planned city has been seen to move over two millennia from",Paragraph
"encampment to éoile, from geometric griddedness to picturesqueness, and now again",Paragraph
"will return to the enduring grid, for the most profoundly influential imposition in history",Paragraph
of plan on a city is certainly the grid configuration on New York City. The grid of,Paragraph
"Manhattan, the consummate city, in conjunction with Central Park, created the city plan",Paragraph
by which all other cities are judged. The configuration dictates the lives of millions who,Paragraph
"define their physical space by the plan: “uptown, downtown, east side, west side.” The",Paragraph
significance of urban planning is demonstrated every day on the streets of New York,Paragraph
"City, for the concrete canyons of Manhattan, so often romantically sung, are in fact more",Paragraph
"prosaically the product of New York City’s 1811 grid city plan, its 1860s Olmsted park",Paragraph
"plan, and its 1916 skyscraper zoning laws.",Paragraph
Modern Urban Planning,Title
"In the 20th century, there was a tremendous shift in the historical concept of urban",Paragraph
planning from art to technics. The practice of urban planning from the mid- to late 20th,Paragraph
century had little to do with the artistic grandeur of earlier times and more to do with the,Paragraph
"technician’s approach to the city as a functional entity. Massive urban population growth,",Paragraph
"the movement from rural to urban areas, two major world wars, the machine economy,",Paragraph
"the automobile, and the triumph of Marx over monarchy meant that the burden of urban",Paragraph
planning became more about the amelioration of living conditions for the masses and less,Paragraph
about a carriage ride through the park for those who could afford a carriage.,Paragraph
"As urban planning took on the life of the masses, it acquired a new urgency. In the 20th",Paragraph
"century, theories of urban planning swung in wide and contradictory arcs—with very",Paragraph
concrete consequences for cities. From the broad-stroke city plans of Le Corbusier to the,Paragraph
"curbside observations of Jane Jacobs, the city in the 20th century had seemingly every",Paragraph
perceptive perspective and every evil visited on it. There actually exist American cities,Paragraph
where one can trace the theoretical swings in urban planning simply by riding a bus,Paragraph
"across town, seeing the once bright future and the dashed hopes of urban occupants",Paragraph
"strewn in planned fervor on the landscape. In the East New York section of Brooklyn,",Paragraph
where the federally funded Model Cities program collapsed before completion (but not,Paragraph
"before tearing down all existing buildings), the scarred urban land was left vacant for",Paragraph
decades. Urban planning acquired a checkered history in the 20th century. Let us next,Paragraph
"investigate how this came to be in our times. If good intentions really did make paving,",Paragraph
we could put an end to asphalt.,Paragraph
Early 20th-Century Planning,Title
The early 20th century tended toward a utopianism in urban planning that we find bizarre,Paragraph
"today, exemplified in the metaphorical crystalline city depicted in Fritz Lang’s film",Paragraph
"Metropolis. These early utopian planners survived one world war, lived in urban",Paragraph
"devastation, and were trying to create new cities from the depths of disillusionment with",Paragraph
"their European past. Certain of the early utopian modernists, such as Walter Gropius and",Paragraph
"the German Bauhaus designers, had humane aspirations underlying their metaphors, and",Paragraph
"they tried to bring analysis to tragedy. Empathizing with the proletariat, Gropius sought",Paragraph
"through planning to bring them the most basic necessities—in his words,",Paragraph
"“Existenzminimum,” or minimum standards for living. He brought to his compassionate",Paragraph
"stance for the disenfranchised a new scientific standard, attempting for the first time to",Paragraph
"quantify quality-of-life issues: minimal space requirements, standards of health and",Paragraph
"hygiene, and light and fresh air in the city.",Paragraph
"With their methodological approach, the planners of Germany reconstructed their war-",Paragraph
ravaged cities and built some of the largest housing projects for the urban masses ever,Paragraph
"attempted, the Sied/ungen, or housing projects, of the 1920s to 1930s. Although perhaps",Paragraph
"oppressive and mechanistic by today’s values, these repetitive plans were humanely",Paragraph
intentioned. The modern European ideals of urban planning became international through,Paragraph
"the meetings of CIAM (Congrés Internationaux d’ Architecture Moderne), held in Europe",Paragraph
"from the 1920s to the 1950s, and were disseminated by J.L. Sert in his prophetically titled",Paragraph
Can Our Cities Survive? (1942).,Paragraph
"The most powerful, although perhaps not the most prudent, voice of CLAM and of",Paragraph
"20th-century urbanism in general was, of course, Le Corbusier. Following in the French",Paragraph
"tradition of Haussmann, through his sweeping unbuilt Parisian plans on paper—the",Paragraph
Contemporary City (1922) and the Ville Radieuse (1935)—Le Corbusier reinvented,Paragraph
French creative urban design. Although his urban designs were brilliant aesthetic,Paragraph
"exercises, they were frightening living environments. Le Corbusier’s plans are grandiose",Paragraph
"and potentially destructive of cities that, unlike the German, were not even destroyed by",Paragraph
war. Le Corbusier introduced into modern urban planning the fallacy of viewing the city,Paragraph
"solely as a spatial pattern seen metaphorically and visually from above, forgetting that",Paragraph
"below, humans seek to live out their sometimes irrational, unpatterned urban lives.",Paragraph
If one were to compare the long-term influence on urban planning of Gropius’s,Paragraph
"Bauhaus functionalism and Le Corbusier’s French aestheticism, one might conclude that",Paragraph
the derivations of both were harmful to the urban fabric of the 20th century. What,Paragraph
"differentiates them, however, is intention: the city for the common man or the city for",Paragraph
self? While in the history of urban planning we can trace Gropius’s methodical study of,Paragraph
"the angle of the sun as it hit the windows of his Sied/ungen, we are likewise told the",Paragraph
"anecdote of Le Corbusier’s designing the city of Brasilia while sitting in a restaurant,",Paragraph
cavalierly scrawling crossed lines on a cocktail napkin. Although there is ample room for,Paragraph
"ego and self-aggrandizement in architecture, it should have no place in the discipline of",Paragraph
urban planning.,Paragraph
Against the European background of the planning debates of CLAM came the work of,Paragraph
"the most famous American architect of the 20th century, Frank Lloyd Wright, who",Paragraph
designed but never built his theoretical Broadacre City in 1938. The “Broadacre” of the,Paragraph
"title was accurate, for the design allowed each resident one acre of land for subsistence",Paragraph
"farming, but the word “City” was certainly a misnomer, for Wright’s utopia was the very",Paragraph
"antithesis of the concept of city. It was antiurban in every sense, isolationist in its vision,",Paragraph
"and totally automobile dependent, so much so that we may credit Broadacre City with",Paragraph
spreading the concept of the suburb and inadvertently its concomitant sprawl all over the,Paragraph
"United States. Wright’s vision, born of his agrarian American roots and of the",Paragraph
"Depression, was not to ameliorate urban problems but to offer an American alternative",Paragraph
that would render the city a nasty anachronism of the preautomobile age.,Paragraph
Critiques of Urban Planning,Title
"Without question, by the early 20th century, cities in Europe and the United States",Paragraph
"needed fixing. By necessity, the rise of urban planning as a profession distinct from",Paragraph
"architecture, economics, and urban sociology was taking root with such major",Paragraph
constituents as the New York Regional Planning Association. After utopianism took its,Paragraph
"last gasp through the planners of the 1939 New York World’s Fair, cynicism about cities",Paragraph
replaced beliefs in beauty and human aspiration in urban planning. As planning moved,Paragraph
"away from beauty and toward technology as its goal, it lost its soul. A nadir of urban",Paragraph
planning was reached in the mid-20th century with the advent of statistical and,Paragraph
"technological planning severed from all humanitarian concerns, as Cold War thinking",Paragraph
marked city plans destructively with the introduction of military-industrial planning,Paragraph
applied to city planning. Cities lost their individual realities as new planners were,Paragraph
schooled only in applications of generic models without human content and taught to,Paragraph
substitute mindless formulas invented for the design of complex nuclear war machines.,Paragraph
"Cities, however, are not submarines, and humans are not mathematical models. With the",Paragraph
"desperation of those who felt inferior to the technologists, urban planners repressed their",Paragraph
"innate social motivations. Disastrous results, such as the wholesale destruction of",Paragraph
"neighborhoods as “slum clearance,” were often compounded by highspeed freeways",Paragraph
cutting through neighborhoods. Worst-case examples left acres of urban land looking,Paragraph
bombed.,Paragraph
"By the mid-20th century, thoughtful critical voices were emerging as a counterpoint to",Paragraph
the grandiose schemes of the utopian 1920s and 1930s and the cynical 1950s and 1960s.,Paragraph
Primary among those voices were those of two American planners and their texts of,Paragraph
"simple messages, Kevin Lynch’s The Image of the City (1960) and Jane Jacobs’s The",Paragraph
"Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961), which together helped turn the tide of",Paragraph
city planning toward a closer examination of the existing urban fabric and to the patterns,Paragraph
of behavior of its inhabitants. Both had a kind of folksy style that appealed to urban,Paragraph
"planners, architects, sociologists, and even the general public, so often the enemy of",Paragraph
"urban planning, and thus both books have continued to be influential for decades.",Paragraph
"Lynch was observational and insightful. On the one hand, he explained the nature of",Paragraph
"cities with a rational model, defining the city as a hierarchy of spaces; on the other hand,",Paragraph
he simultaneously presented the irrational side of urban patterns based on humans’,Paragraph
uncanny ability to navigate urban space in relation to memory and landmarks. What,Paragraph
makes Lynch’s approach so novel is that it was based not on a preconceived or imposed,Paragraph
model but on actually asking city dwellers how they moved within their physical,Paragraph
"environment. Jacobs, who wrote literally from the perspective of her own window on her",Paragraph
"street in lower Manhattan, showed that the social interactions of an active pedestrian",Paragraph
street life of a city are the essence of the urban place. She defended the life not only of,Paragraph
"city people but of city buildings as well, pointing out cogently the significance of",Paragraph
retaining old buildings within cities. The Death and Life of Great American Cities,Paragraph
remains a memorable David-versus-Goliath of wrong-headed urban planning.,Paragraph
"Perhaps the quietly successful revolution of Lynch, Jacobs, and others of this bent now",Paragraph
"needs reexamination, for it is spurring on movements in urban planning that are actually",Paragraph
antiurban. Jacobs wanted to preserve old buildings not as historical artifacts or self-,Paragraph
"consciously arty edifices but as low-rent generators of urban innovation. Instead, we are",Paragraph
"today boutiqueing our cities out of existence, falsifying the urban fabric. Further,",Paragraph
nostalgic but inauthentic new towns spring forth on former desert- and farmland all over,Paragraph
"the United States, and these false places are controlled by restrictive covenants that are",Paragraph
"the antithesis of urban life. Beware planners bearing faux cities that, although certainly",Paragraph
"pretty, by definition cannot ever be real urban environments.",Paragraph
The Future of Urban Planning,Title
The point of urban planning is to encompass the complexity of human experience and to,Paragraph
formulate for that experience a physical environment that will be ever self-renewing.,Paragraph
"Authentic urban places existed in the 20th century, and they give us hope for the life of",Paragraph
"the city in the 21 st century. In London, a supreme example of urbane living is still found",Paragraph
in Bloomsbury’s squares of parks and row houses and in the 20th-century revival of 17th-,Paragraph
"century Covent Garden. In Paris, a zenith of 20th-century urban design was achieved by",Paragraph

one that is often criticized by the very communities that it was intended to improve. The,Paragraph
"central impulse behind urban renewal, and certainly the publicly stated purpose behind all",Paragraph
"such efforts, is to make a place (a neighborhood or a whole city) better than it was before.",Paragraph
It is the method or approach taken to such improvement that lies behind most conflicts,Paragraph
over urban renewal.,Paragraph
"In the early 20th century, urban renewal was often inspired by an earnest desire to help",Paragraph
"the poor by improving the conditions in which they labored and lived. A desire to help,",Paragraph

"reorganization of Paris under Napoleon I[l—was the City Beautiful movement, the",Paragraph
principles of which are expressed vividly in Daniel Burnham and Edward H. Bennett’s,Paragraph
Chicago Plan of 1909. Their plan sought to restore a lost (in the eyes of the city’s elite),Paragraph
harmonious social order by establishing a dominant neobaroque and Beaux-Arts aesthetic,Paragraph
that would dominate not only the design of individual buildings but also the layout of the,Paragraph
city as a whole. This City Beautiful design conspicuously embraced hierarchies of race,Paragraph
"and class, subordinating the pressing need for housing, schools, and sanitation, and",Paragraph
instead imagined a future for Chicago in which immigrant machine politics had been,Paragraph
expelled and proper Anglo-Saxon order restored. The City Beautiful movement spread,Paragraph
"both throughout Europe and, under the British raj, to New Delhi, India, with a plan",Paragraph
designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker.,Caption

Jorn Utzon occupies a special position in 20th-century architecture that defies simple,Paragraph
"categorization. As a Dane, he invites com-parison with German Expressionism,",Paragraph
"especially Hans Scharoun; his greatest works are in Australia, Kuwait, and Mallorca; and",Paragraph
"although he gave Gunnar Asplund, Alvar Aalto, and the Dane Kay Fisker as his mentors,",Paragraph
"his casual spontaneity, his daring, and the absence of a fastidious refinement go against",Paragraph
the grain of Danish tradition in much the same way as Asger Jorn’s paintings. His,Paragraph
"architecture is self-consciously sculptural in its appeal, making Utzon more Finnish and",Paragraph
European than Danish. Instead of intensely focusing inward in the way that Arne,Paragraph
"Jacobsen did, Utzon relocated his vision outside Denmark, taking his models from within",Paragraph
"the modern Scandinavian tradition and from Le Corbusier; this was, at the same time,",Paragraph
allied to a new interest in an anonymous vernacular building aesthetic.,Paragraph
His outstanding contribution was the application of an anonymous vernacular,Paragraph
expression to repetitive industrial building production disciplined by geometry to create a,Paragraph
"more varied, flexible, romantic building form that responds to changing human",Paragraph
requirements.,Paragraph
"Jorn Utzon was born in Copenhagen in 1918 but spent his childhood at Alborg, where",Paragraph
"his father, Aage Utzon, was engineering director of the local shipyard. He completed his",Paragraph
schooling at the Alborg Katedralskole in 1936 and was accepted at the Kunstakademiets,Paragraph
"Arkitektskole in Copenhagen, from which he graduated in 1942. While living in",Paragraph
"Stockholm, where he stayed for the remainder of the German occupation, he was",Paragraph
awarded a minor Royal Academy Gold Medal (1944) for his design for a music academy,Paragraph
"in Copenhagen. In 1950, Utzon returned to Denmark and started in private practice.",Paragraph
"At the Royal Academy, Utzon was exposed to Kay Fisker and to the historian and",Paragraph
"planner Steen Eiler Rasmussen, whose experiential theory of architecture in his small",Paragraph
"book Experiencing Architecture, published in 1959, Utzon seems subsequently to have",Paragraph
adopted.,Paragraph
"Utzon traveled extensively in the early years after the war, first a short stint in Alvar",Paragraph
"Aalto’s Munkkiniemi office in 1946, followed by trips to Morocco in 1947 and to the",Paragraph
United States and Mexico in 1949. These travel experiences helped solidify his maturing,Paragraph
"organic approach. From 1945 to 1957, he vigorously participated in many competitions",Paragraph
"that he combined with extensive travel, absorbing influences from Islamic, Chinese, and",Paragraph
Mayan architecture.,Paragraph
"He worked alone and with others, including such Danish contemporaries as Tobias",Paragraph
"Faber and Mogens Irming; however, the most important collaborator was the Norwegian",Paragraph
modernist Amme Korsmo. Other influences were Gunnar Asplund (from his time in,Paragraph
"Sweden) and the organic architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, Alvar Aalto, and Le",Paragraph
"Corbusier, whom he met in 1948.",Paragraph
Utzon adopted the additive composition principle of combining standard industrial,Paragraph
"components that could be augmented by adding extra elements, so that his buildings",Paragraph
appear to grow in a manner that crudely mimics the replication of cellular organisms.,Paragraph
"Utzon was inspired in his architecture by natural phenomena, such as clouds, beech",Paragraph
"forests, and breaking waves, that he adopted in the early conceptual stage in developing",Paragraph
his ideas.,Paragraph
"A number of architectural ideas recur in Utzon, the courtyard house being one and the",Paragraph
"motif of the platform as a technique for relating group forms another. In 1953, with Ib",Paragraph
"Molegelvang, he won the Skaanske low-cost housing competition for “Scania” house",Paragraph
"types. His scheme was based on the ancient Chinese courtyard house, and although it was",Paragraph

"principle. Although these are less known than Sydney’s Opera House, they are no less",Paragraph
"significant, and they demonstrate Utzon’s humanitarian commitment to housing",Paragraph
innovation. The timber-component house system known as “Espansiva” (1969) took this,Paragraph
a step further and attempted to simplify and adapt housing to exploit simple industrial,Paragraph
materials and methods. The same concern is apparent in his Utsep Mobler Flexible,Paragraph
"Furniture (1968) system, which also applied the same additive architecture principle.",Paragraph
Jorn Utzon’s world fame rests largely on one work: the Sydney Opera House. Winning,Paragraph
the international competition in 1957 thrust him overnight into the international,Paragraph
architectural spotlight. Its completion in October 1973 made Sydney instantly,Paragraph
recognizable and provided it with an architectural symbol that emphasized the,Paragraph
importance of its harbor.,Paragraph
Utzon’s Sydney Opera House scheme coincided with Le Corbusier’s break with the,Paragraph
"1920s cubist aesthetic for the Ronchamp chapel, Notre-Dame-du-Haut, completed in June",Caption
1955. Both emphasized the organic quality of their forms inspired by exceptional,Paragraph
landscapes: the small plateau and acropolis at Ronchamp and a low-lying sandstone,Paragraph
peninsula jutting out into and surrounded on three sides by the harbor in Sydney.,Paragraph
A number of factors help explain the Sydney Opera House’s unprecedented originality,Paragraph
and use of shell-concrete roofs. The 1930s in Copenhagen witnessed the early,Paragraph
development of shell concrete for the Kastrup Airport Terminal (1939) and the Radiohus,Paragraph
"Building (1946) by Vilhelm Lauritzen. In 1946, Utzon collaborated on a submission in",Paragraph
the Crystal Palace International Competition that introduced the identical theme of,Paragraph
concert halls with sculptural shell roofs mounted on a common platform.,Paragraph
Although the accusation was justified that progress on the Sydney Opera House was,Paragraph
"unacceptably slow, it is unlikely that this fact would have provoked the extreme reaction",Paragraph
in Europe that it did in Sydney in 1966. The intransigence of Utzon’s new political,Paragraph
"master convinced him that he was no longer trusted, and this caused his withdrawal from",Paragraph
"the project. At the time this happened, Utzon had overcome the last remaining problems",Paragraph
of acoustics and construction in the interiors and was in a position to complete the work,Paragraph
"in a reasonable time and cost. The client, Davis Hughes, and party politics prevented him",Paragraph
from doing so.,Paragraph
"The interiors and glass walls enclosing the open ends of the concrete vault roofs,",Paragraph
"completed by his replacement, Hall Todd and Littlemore, are neither as original nor as",Paragraph
daring as Utzon’s. The Opera House function was emasculated by relegating opera to the,Paragraph
"smaller hall, which could no longer function as a drama theater. Acoustic problems have",Paragraph
"dogged the concert hall and will be expensive, if impossible, to remedy. Despite these",Paragraph
"shortcomings, the outside is clear proof of Utzon’s sculptural genius. It stands as a",Paragraph
"monument to the human imagination, shared by an entire city, on an extraordinarily",Paragraph
"sensitive site on the edge of the city where it thrusts into the harbor. Not surprisingly, it",Paragraph
has since become the foremost symbol of Sydney around the world.,Paragraph
Of his later works the Bagsvaerd Church (1976) in Copenhagen and the Kuwait,Paragraph
"National Assembly Building (1983), Kuwait City, Kuwait, provide further evidence of",Caption
his determination to seek a new anonymous industrial aesthetic using standardized,Paragraph

the landscape.,Paragraph
The State Theater complex for Zurich embodied the same’ lessons of geometry and,Paragraph
"standardization that Utzon learned in Sydney and that were transferred to Kuwait and, to",Paragraph
"a lesser extent, to Bagsvaerd Church. At Kuwait, Utzon introduced simply draped",Paragraph
concrete sheets similar to Eero Saarinen’s Dulles Airport Terminal (1963) but gave them,Paragraph
additional sculptural complexity by folding them laterally so that they echo the folds of,Paragraph
the Bedouin black tent. The National Assembly Building is an elaborate mix of standard,Paragraph
precast-concrete units that Utzon contrasted with his hanging tent roofs looking out,Paragraph
across the Persian Gulf and backed by the desert.,Paragraph
The Bagsvaerd Church incorporates a freely unfolding shell of sprayed concrete that is,Paragraph
"used to support the outer metal roof and that admits a soft, muted, indirect light into the",Paragraph
"nave. Inspired in part by medieval stave churches, stacked standard precast elements are",Paragraph

The city of Vancouver is truly of the 20th century. When the small town of Granville was,Paragraph
"incorporated as the city of Vancouver in 1886, it had more in common with American",Paragraph
cities west of the Rocky Mountains than with the rest of Canada. San Francisco had,Paragraph
served as Vancouver’s main link to the east before the completion of Canada’s,Paragraph
transcontinental railway in 1887. Within five years the community of 1000 had grown to,Paragraph
"nearly 14,000 and the young city became a supply depot and investment center for the",Paragraph
"Klondike gold rush of 1897-98. From these boomtown beginnings, metropolitan",Paragraph
Vancouver is now home to more than 1.8 million people.,Paragraph
"During the early 20th century, rapid growth fueled construction of neighborhoods",Paragraph
along the street railway and interurban lines. Before 1910 many homes were constructed,Paragraph
"of a prefabricated, insulated, four-foot modular system, designed and manufactured by",Paragraph
"the B.C.Mills, Timber, and Trading Company. Known as Vancouver Boxes, these",Paragraph
efficient and economical houses were characterized by a single story set on a high,Paragraph
"foundation, a hip roof with dormer windows, and a broad front veranda. From 1910 until",Caption
"the mid-1920s, the most popular house for middle- and lower-class families was a variant",Paragraph
"of the California bungalow, typified by front gables, exposed rafter ends, and wall",Paragraph
"brackets, and often chimneys, porch piers, and foundations of rough brick or stone. These",Paragraph
"Craftsman homes, a small-scale version of the Queen Anne style, were popular amongst",Paragraph
the suburban working classes. At one point South Vancouver was expanding at a rate of,Paragraph
"200 families per month, all housed in California bungalows.",Paragraph
In contrast the region’s affluent families required large formal estates for entertaining.,Paragraph
"British expatriates had a fondness for Tudor revivals, English country manors, or Arts",Paragraph
"and Crafts-style homes. In Point Grey and Shaughnessy Heights, abundantly timbered",Paragraph
"properties were developed according to the tenets of the City Beautiful movement,",Paragraph
creating elegant neighborhoods of parks and scenic drives. In both Victoria (the,Paragraph
"provincial capital) and Vancouver, one of the most sought-after architects of this era was",Paragraph
"Samuel Maclure, whose early bungalows were modest versions of the California style—",Paragraph
"single-storied, wood-framed buildings with cross-axial plans and wood-shingle cladding.",Caption
"Influenced by the art and architecture of Charles F.A.Voysey and Frank Lloyd Wright,",Paragraph
Maclure often used Tudor-revival facades to mollify his clients while creating modern,Paragraph
designs that maximized the potential of the site and locally available materials.,Paragraph
Thriving business concerns led to the importation of New York and Chicago,Paragraph
skyscraper technologies. In 1908 David Spencer and Company built a nine-story,Paragraph
"department store that was followed by the 13-story Dominion Trust Building in 1910,",Paragraph
touted as the most modern and tallest office building in Canada. Originally designed for,Paragraph
the Imperial Trust Company by the English-trained architect J.S.Helyer and his son,Paragraph
"Maurice, the Dominion Trust Building had a brick exterior with yellow terracotta features",Paragraph
emulating the detailing of classical orders and was capped by a lofty Second Empire-style,Paragraph
"roof. Others followed, including the W.T.Whiteway’s World Building (1912), now",Paragraph
"known as the Old Sun Tower, whose 17-story corner hexagonal office tower eclipsed the",Paragraph

now known as the Standard Building. The Credit Foncier Franco-Canadien (1914) by,Caption
H.L.Stevens and Company offers the most faithful emulation of neoclassical detailing.,Paragraph
In 1914 architect Francis Swales was commissioned to design the Hotel Vancouver to,Paragraph
accommodate business travelers and tourists who used the Canadian Pacific Railway.,Paragraph
This impressive assembly of cubic forms with intricate Italianate detailing and,Paragraph
overhanging roofs dominated the Vancouver skyline until its controversial demolition in,Paragraph
"1949. To serve the competing Canadian National Railway, another Hotel Vancouver was",Paragraph
built in the Chateau style by Archibald and Schofield. Although construction had begun,Paragraph
"in 1929, it was abandoned during the Great Depression, and the hotel was only completed",Paragraph
in time for the 1939 Royal Tour. This building’s facade was an elegant expression of the,Paragraph
restrained modern classicism in vogue at the time. Another example was the new,Paragraph
"Vancouver City Hall (1936), constructed near recently annexed South Vancouver. The",Paragraph
"architects, Townley and Matheson, adhered to the modern classical precedents",Paragraph
established by other government architecture of the time by stepping down a series of,Paragraph
symmetrically arranged cubic forms on opposing sides of a large central tower.,Paragraph
"After World War I, Vancouver's thriving port facilities had fostered development of",Paragraph
"the waterfront and the commercial heart of the city, even during the Depression. The",Paragraph
most noteworthy building of this period was J.Y.McCarter and George C. Nairme’s,Paragraph
Marine Building (1930). Both the 20-story tower and a 10-story wing have richly,Paragraph
"decorated parapets, executed in pink and green terra-cotta, which contrast with the pale-",Paragraph
red brick walls. The striking Art Deco ornamentation incorporates terracotta panels,Caption
illustrating histories of transportation and the Pacific coast.,Paragraph
Economic restraints during World War IJ limited construction to essential projects.,Paragraph
"Afterward, however, Vancouver thrived, as veterans returned to the city and foreign",Paragraph
demand for Canada’s natural resources escalated. The immigration of British-trained,Paragraph
"architects and the influence of Walter Gropius, Richard Neutra, and Marcel Breuer",Paragraph
encouraged the development of modernist building. In 1946 a department of architecture,Paragraph
was established at the University of British Columbia under Frederick Lasserre that,Paragraph
"began to attract international attention. Efforts of early modernists, such as C.B.K.Van",Paragraph
"Norman, Robert A.D.Berwick, Bertram C.Binning, and Peter Thornton, were quickly",Paragraph
"overtaken by younger designers like Charles E. Pratt, Ron Thom, and Fred",Paragraph

The 1963 competition for a new university in the adjacent city of Burnaby relieved the,Paragraph
slow pace of local construction. The successful entry by the Vancouver partnership of,Paragraph
Arthur Erickson and Geoffrey Massey proved to be the springboard for Arthur Erickson’s,Paragraph
international career. His scheme for Simon Fraser University revolved around a strong,Paragraph
central axis linking all campus buildings and incorporating contemporary approaches to,Paragraph
"pedagogy. In addition to the campus plan, Erickson and Massey designed the",Paragraph
"Transportation Centre (1965) and Central Mall (1965), in which massive girders of",Paragraph
douglas fir and steel supported a glass canopy. The campus has continued to expand;,Paragraph
Erickson also designed a university extension to the West Mall (1994) that remains,Paragraph

The phenomenal growth of Vancouver forced developers to build vertically. High-rise,Paragraph
"residential buildings, including Rix Reinecke’s Ocean Towers (1958), began to dominate",Paragraph
the West End skyline following a permissive 1956 zoning amendment. The consequences,Paragraph

"VAN DE VELDE, HENRI 1863-1957",Title
"Architect and interior designer, Belgium",Title
Henri van de Velde was a leading figure of Belgian Art Nouveau. He was born in,Paragraph
Antwerp into a family with strong interest in the arts. His father was a pharmacist and a,Paragraph
"director of the local arts festival. After having contemplated a career as a composer, van",Paragraph
de Velde chose to become a painter instead. He studied at the Antwerp Art Academy,Paragraph
(1880-83) and at the atelier of Carolys Duran in Paris (1884-85). On his return from,Paragraph
"Paris in 1886, van de Velde moved to the Belgian countryside, where he started to",Paragraph
"develop a more holistic approach toward art and environment. In 1887, he discovered",Paragraph
"pointillism, which allowed him to develop a more analytic approach to painting and form,",Paragraph
"and from 1890 on, he started to broaden his artistic production to the realm of applied",Paragraph
"arts, then to interior design, and finally to architecture.",Paragraph
"At the same time, van de Velde established himself as a theorist and propagandist. In",Paragraph
"1894, he started a series of lectures that promoted the revival of architecture and",Paragraph
decorative arts by combining the moral principles of the English Arts and Crafts,Paragraph
movement with the acceptance of machine production and social changes. These lectures,Paragraph
were published in 1901 under the title Die Renaissance im Kunstgewerbe (The,Paragraph
Renaissance of Applied Arts). Van de Velde’s theoretical position was informed by,Paragraph
"readings of William Morris, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Leo Tolstoy, in which art and",Paragraph
beauty were understood as a significant force for social advancement and cultural,Paragraph
renewal.,Paragraph
"His first venture into architecture came with his own house, Bloemenwerf (1895-96),",Paragraph
"in Uccle, near Brussels, where van de Velde, who had no architectural training,",Paragraph
collaborated with local craftsmen in a design that is somewhat a combination of a,Paragraph
traditional farmhouse and an urban villa. It was van de Velde’s first attempt to create a,Paragraph
"total work of art in which furniture, wallpaper, and even his wife’s reform dress are",Paragraph
understood as an integral part of architecture.,Paragraph
Van de Velde’s reputation spread rapidly in the mid-1890s. The reception was,Paragraph
"particularly favorable in Germany, and in 1895 the German art dealer Samuel Bing and",Paragraph
art critic Julius Meier-Graefe commissioned him to design three room interiors. First,Paragraph
exhibited in the Salon Art Nouveau in Paris the same year (and further in 1897 in,Paragraph
"Dresden), these interiors, characterized by dynamic, curved forms, launched van de",Paragraph
Velde’s career as a furniture maker and interior designer while also launching a new,Paragraph
style: Art Nouveau. Bing and Meier-Graefe played an important part in van de Velde’s,Paragraph
"career, the former becoming van de Velde’s dealer in Paris and the latter the first critic to",Paragraph
write about his work.,Paragraph
In 1900 Karl Emst Osthaus invited van de Velde to design the interiors for the,Paragraph
"Folkwang Museum (1901-04) in Hagen, Germany. Only five years after the completion",Paragraph
"of their own house, the family moved to Berlin. Contrary to his hopes, Berlin did not",Paragraph
"offer a breakthrough for other larger projects, and in 1902 he accepted the offer of the",Paragraph
duke of Sachsen-Weimar to become the director of the Weimar Kunstgewerblicher,Paragraph
Institut. The duke also commissioned van de Velde to design the new school buildings:,Paragraph
"the Kunstgewerbeschule (school of applied arts, 1904) and the Kunstschule (art school,",Paragraph
"1906), which became his first major architectural commissions. During his 12-year tenure",Paragraph
"at Weimar, van de Velde embraced and inspired the future generation and developed a",Paragraph
successful architectural practice. The most notable works from this period include several,Paragraph
"private villas for Weimar’s cultural elite; van de Velde’s own second house, called Hohe",Paragraph
Pappels (1908); a Tennis Club (1908) in Chemnitz; an interior design of the Nietzsche,Paragraph
Archive (1911); and most notably the theater for the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition in,Paragraph
Cologne.,Paragraph
Van de Velde’s resignation in 1914 came right after the 1914 Werkbund meeting in,Paragraph
"Cologne, where he came under a fierce attack by Hermann Muthesius (1861-1927) for",Paragraph
representing a reactionary and outdated individualist position and resisting the need for,Paragraph
standardized production and typification. Van de Velde recommended Walter Gropius as,Paragraph
"his successor, thus laying the foundation for the future Bauhaus.",Paragraph
This so-called Werkbund debate is indicative of why many other members of the first,Paragraph
"generation of the Modern movement, such as Peter Behrens and Frank Lloyd Wright,",Paragraph
came to surpass van de Velde in their historical significance as pioneers of 20th-century,Paragraph
"architecture. However, van de Velde was one of the seminal thinkers around 1890, when",Paragraph
19th-century architectural historicism came into a crisis. Informed by FLinfiihlung,Paragraph
"(empathy) theory, van de Velde believed that line was the fundamental element of art.",Paragraph
"According to his motto “a line is a force” (Kunstgewerbliche Laienpredigten, 1902), form",Paragraph
"is an outcome of spontaneous, creative expression based on inner necessity, both",Paragraph
structural and emotional. This led to a design strategy based on the combination of,Paragraph
constructive and functional logic and dynamic formal expression.,Paragraph
"Van de Velde’s life after leaving Weimar in 1917 was divided among Switzerland,",Paragraph
"Holland, and Belgium, where in 1925-47 he held a professorship at the University of",Paragraph
Ghent. His mature work includes the Belgian Pavilions for the Paris (1937} and New,Paragraph

VERNACULAR ARCHITECTURE,Title
"Although it had been in use among specialists for well over a century, the term",Paragraph
“vernacular architecture” became widely accepted only with its adoption in 1976 by the,Paragraph
"International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS). Other terms persist, such as",Paragraph
"“traditional,” “rural,” “regional,” “local,” “peasant,” “folk,” and “indigenous”",Paragraph
"architecture, serving collectively to identify the field of building encompassed by the",Paragraph
"vernacular. Its original meaning (from the Latin), “the language of the people,” is",Paragraph
applicable to architecture as an extension of the commonly employed idea of,Paragraph
"“architecture as language,” in which styles of design are analogous to grammar or syntax.",Paragraph
"“Arquitectura popular,” used in both Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries,",Paragraph
corresponds to the increasingly prevalent definition of the vernacular as “the architecture,Paragraph
"of, and by, the people.” With the wider acceptance of the term “vernacular architecture,”",Paragraph
a distinction is made between buildings that are self-built or community built and used,Paragraph
"and those that are designed for the people, such as fast-food outlets, chain stores, filling",Paragraph
"stations, and strip malls. Including mobile homes, these latter types, as professionally",Paragraph
"designed structures for general use, are regarded as popular architecture. As such, they",Paragraph
"are distinguished from the vernacular, which broadly corresponds to the building",Paragraph

"Architects (1964) at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. The exhibition emphasized",Paragraph
the aesthetic merits of vernacular traditions from nearly 30 countries that had been an,Paragraph

"As early as 1910, Frank Lloyd Wright applauded “folk building[s] growing in response",Paragraph
"to actual needs, fitted into environment by people who knew no better than to fit them to",Paragraph
"it with native feeling,” which were “for us better worth study than all the highly self-",Paragraph

"Michel de Klerk in the Netherlands, and later Luis Barragan in Mexico were among the",Paragraph
"many architects who drew on regional building for inspiration. In such cases, the",Paragraph
vernacular was a source of stimulation for some and a justification of their design,Paragraph
aesthetic for others. Simplicity of form and structure and the moral value of the,Paragraph
Miesinspired truth to materials and economy of means were increasingly established as,Paragraph
the modernist architecture par excellence. Following the legacy of Adolf Loos’s essay,Paragraph
"“Ornament and Crime” (1908), vernacular traditions that employed decoration were",Paragraph
generally disregarded in favor of reductivism. Vernacular examples offered less to,Paragraph
"architects who were seeking models of varied spatial experience, but their “fitness for",Paragraph
"purpose” and, above all, their functionality were seen as paradigms of modern approaches",Paragraph
to architectural design.,Paragraph
"Undoubtedly, all these qualities could be seen in a wide range of vernacular buildings,",Paragraph
"from farmhouses to workshops, granaries to cow barns, and lime kilns to windmills that",Paragraph
not only helped clarify design objectives in the minds of many architects but also served,Paragraph
"to reinforce modernist principles. However, although some followed Wright’s advice to",Paragraph
"study “folk building,” his somewhat patronizing view of its builders was echoed by many",Paragraph
"architects and writers who referred to the “spontaneous,” “unconscious,” or “intuitive”",Paragraph
building processes. Professional architects studied the vernacular more for their own,Paragraph
benefit than for any that might accrue for the survival or protection of the traditions,Paragraph
"themselves, which in the years following World War II were threatened. The ravages of",Paragraph
"war, industrialization of building processes, need for mass housing, and universal",Paragraph
adoption of Le Corbusian “tower blocks” and “slab blocks” marked the international,Paragraph
"success of modernism and, in many instances, the imminent demise of many vernacular",Paragraph

Decline in the vernacular in many Western countries had been evident since the,Paragraph
"beginning of the 20th century. Largely through voluntary effort, examples of folk and",Paragraph
traditional building were salvaged in many countries and displayed in open-air,Paragraph

"none, until the 1980s, opened in Spain, France, or Italy. Although such enterprises did",Paragraph
"much to conserve specific vernacular buildings, the unfurnished interiors could appear",Paragraph
bleak. Many curators solved this problem by depicting a historic period with appropriate,Paragraph
"artifacts and furniture, or with reenactments of daily life in the form of dioramas. Such",Paragraph
"methods were instructive, if nostalgic, ensuring the popular success of these museums but",Paragraph
"associating the vernacular only with past ways of life, having little relevance to the",Paragraph
"present or the future. Unfortunately, in most European countries, relatively little",Paragraph
"continuity of vernacular building was seen in the second half of the 20th century, as the",Paragraph

"of the 20th century, the world’s population was estimated at 3.5 billion; by the end of the",Paragraph

"schemes have failed to make a significant impression on the demand for dwellings, as the",Paragraph

"migrants to the cities; however, lacking in expression of skills or tradition and meeting no",Paragraph

"materials, building construction methods, and domestic space use were examined and",Paragraph
recorded. Preoccupations with typologies or historic derivation were shown to be largely,Paragraph
"irrelevant in such contexts, where the respective economies, material resources, and",Paragraph

"In the ensuing years, a number of important studies were made of specific vernacular",Paragraph
"traditions in parts of Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, North America, and to a",Paragraph
"lesser extent, Latin America. Often these were local, and researchers had problems",Paragraph
developing appropriate methods for comparative studies. Historical resources such as,Paragraph
"wills, deeds, or parish records used in European research were seldom available, and",Paragraph
"conventional orthographic techniques were unsuitable for recording cave dwellings, tents,",Paragraph
"or molded, nontrabeated structures. Comparison of building traditions or the",Paragraph
identification of the distribution or diffusion of structural systems or details was hindered,Paragraph
by lacunae in research and the lack of comprehensive reference works. Many former,Paragraph
"studies, although useful in indicating constancy or change in buildings, were superficial",Paragraph
"visual records. Researchers encountered techniques of, for example, earth construction,",Paragraph
which previously had not been subject to scrutiny; craft skills in the working of different,Paragraph
"kinds of stone, timbers, palms, and fibrous plant materials involved tools and methods of",Paragraph
"assembly, jointing, and cladding that were largely unclassified or undocumented.",Paragraph
Classification of building forms seemed necessary so that the vast range of vernacular,Paragraph
structures could be comprehended. From the domes of the Zulu (southern Africa) to the,Paragraph
"ring-walled multiple dwellings of the Keijia (southeastern China), they demonstrated",Paragraph
both the persistence of systems transmitted over generations and the variety to be found,Paragraph
within every tradition. Although the fundamental rectangular prism of trabeated,Paragraph
"structures and mass-walled stone and adobe and brick structures was widespread, so too",Paragraph
"were the rondavels, or cylindrical units, whose diversity was evident in their compound",Paragraph
"clusters. Roof forms displayed even greater variety, with gabled, hipped, and half-hipped",Paragraph
"roofs of diverse pitches evident throughout Europe, from Scotland to Moldavia. Upswept",Paragraph
"gables that were dispersed throughout insular Southeast Asia, from the Batak of Sumatra",Paragraph
"to the great saddle roofs of the Toraja of Celebes, were perceived as characteristic of",Paragraph
indigenous “styles.”,Paragraph

"indigenous methods of climate modification, such as the Egyptian mashrabivah, or",Paragraph
"balconied window screens, and the “wind scoops,” found in hot, arid climates in the",Paragraph
"Middle East, that transmit cool air to rooms. Hot and humid or monsoon climates require",Paragraph
"cross ventilation and protection from seasonal precipitation, whereas hurricanes",Paragraph
"necessitate shallow roof pitches and light construction. In temperate climates, protection",Paragraph
"is required against heavy rainfall and strong winds, whereas insulation and safeguards",Paragraph
against snow loading are necessary in cold conditions. Such means of adaptation led to,Paragraph
"theories of climatic determinism, with broad principles being defined for settlement",Paragraph
"forms and building types in certain environments, including desert, savanna, forest,",Paragraph
"coastal, and insular locations. Exceptions arising from the demands of different",Paragraph
"economies, whether nomadic or sedentary, pastoral or agricultural, emphasized, as Forde",Paragraph

The publication in 1969 of House Form and Culture by Amos Rapoport and of the,Paragraph
edited collection of case studies Shelter and Society marked a new stage in vernacular,Paragraph
studies. Although anthropologists such as Lewis H.Morgan and Victor Mindeleff in their,Paragraph
researches among Native American tribes in the 1880s had demonstrated the significance,Paragraph
"of culture in defining building form, their work had been neglected. Now the cultural and",Paragraph
anthropological aspects of building were given as much attention as their structural and,Paragraph
architectural characteristics. The writings of anthropologists such as Griaule on the,Paragraph
"Dogon (Mali) and Bourdier on the Kabyle (Algeria), among many others, revealed the",Paragraph
"importance of kinship, social structures, belief systems, ritual, and symbolism in the",Paragraph
vernacular architecture of cultures the world over. Features formerly regarded as styles,Paragraph
were now revealed as signifiers of values and expressions of collective identity and were,Paragraph
"elucidated in, for example, the work of Hugh-Jones (Amazonia), Nabokov and Easton",Paragraph
"(Native America), and Bourdier and Minh-ha (West Africa).",Paragraph
Anthropologists brought a cultural awareness to the study of vernacular but were,Paragraph
seldom familiar with building principles and processes. The need for interdisciplinary,Paragraph
dialogue and research inspired in the 1980s the biennial “Built Form and Culture,Paragraph
Research” conferences alternating with those of the International Association for the,Paragraph
"Study of Traditional Environments ([ASTE). Both emanated from the United States, but",Paragraph
"IASTE meetings were also held in Europe and North Africa. Both published proceedings,",Paragraph
and books on local vernacular architecture proliferated. Some of these were written by,Paragraph
"non-Western authors, with the publications of the Aga Khan Award for Architecture",Paragraph
(AKAA) providing a forum for Islamic and development studies.,Paragraph
"For some years, there had been a growing awareness of the vernacular on the part of",Paragraph
architects in the Middle East and Asia. Several endeavored to relate their buildings to,Paragraph
"local traditions, notably the Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy, whose village of New",Paragraph
Gourna in West Luxor used the vault construction skills of Sudanese mud builders. In,Paragraph
"Turkey, Sedad Hakki Eldem interpreted traditional models. More widely recognized was",Paragraph
"the work of the Indian architects Charles Correa and Balkrishna Doshi, whose large-scale",Paragraph
projects were modernist in approach but who also designed more modest projects,Paragraph
"compatible with the local vernacular. Geoffrey Bawa in Sri Lanka, Robi Sularto in",Paragraph
"Indonesia, and Andre Ravereau in Africa were among the architects who respected",Paragraph
regional traditions.,Paragraph
"Despite the extent of research, the lack of informed awareness among architects and",Paragraph
"their clients, whether public or private, of the significance of vernacular traditions has led",Paragraph
"to disparagement, disregard, and often demolition. By the late 1980s, the need for a",Paragraph
comprehensive reference work that could inform both anthropologists and architects and,Paragraph
professionals and politicians became increasingly apparent. A ten-year project led,Paragraph
eventually to the publication in 1997 of the Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of,Paragraph
"the World, to which researchers from more than 80 countries contributed. Organized on a",Paragraph
"cultural rather than a national basis, it was unprecedented in bringing together research on",Paragraph

"functions, meaning, symbolism, and motifs are considered in relation to societal systems",Paragraph
"and building needs. However, attention is drawn to the deficiencies of certain vernacular",Paragraph
"traditions with regard to services, sanitation, and health.",Paragraph
"Much remains to be done, but the question of why such work should be undertaken and",Paragraph
acted on must be addressed. Vernacular architecture not only accounted for the vast,Paragraph
majority of all buildings up to the 1950s but also met immense housing demands as the,Paragraph
world population doubled in the second half of the 20th century. Yet this achievement,Paragraph
"has never been measured, and neither has the effort in human endeavor or the use of",Paragraph
"available or renewable resources in building or land. By comparison, officially",Paragraph
"sanctioned housing, whether government promoted or commercially developed, is",Paragraph
minimal in its effect and produced at costs that would be beyond the capacity of most,Paragraph
national economies in attempting to meet the demands of the next half century. Although,Paragraph
"neither acknowledged nor budgeted, vernacular architecture will be essential to meet the",Paragraph
housing needs of the projected further doubling of the population. Recognizing this and,Paragraph
providing adequate support in services while planning the economic survival of rural,Paragraph
"communities, developing nations could ensure that appropriate housing can be achieved",Paragraph

"VESNIN, ALEXANDER, LEONID VESNIN,",Title
AND VIKTOR VESNIN,Title
"Architects, Russia",Title
"Among the many architects whose work adhered to the principles of Constructivism,",Paragraph
perhaps the most stalwart and productive proponents of the movement were the Vesnin,Paragraph
"brothers: Leonid (1880-1933), Viktor (1882-1950), and Alexander (1883-1959), all of",Paragraph
whom were raised in the town of lurevets on the Volga River.,Paragraph
Although the brothers went to St. Petersburg at the beginning of the century for their,Paragraph
professional education (Leonid graduated from the architectural program at the Academy,Paragraph
of Arts in 1909 and Viktor and Alexander from the Institute of Civil Engineering in,Paragraph
"1912), their careers were largely connected with Moscow both before and after their",Paragraph
"graduation. For example, in 1905-07 they worked as assistants to such leading Moscow",Paragraph
"proponents of the neoclassical revival as Ilarion Ivanov-Schitz and Roman Klein, and in",Paragraph
1909 Leonid worked with the artist V.A. Simonov in designing a large Arts and Crafts-,Paragraph
"style house for V.A. Nosenkov in the Moscow suburbs. Alexander, the most artistically",Paragraph
"gifted of the three, worked in Vladimir Tatlin’s studio between 1912 and 1914 and also",Paragraph
revealed a considerable talent as a stage designer.,Paragraph
"During the material restrictions of the early postrevolutionary years, the theater stage",Paragraph
provided the Vesnins—Alexander in particular—with a means for exploring methods of,Paragraph
"dynamic construction in space, under the obvious influence of Tatlin. The most",Paragraph
remarkable product of this phase was Alexander Vesnin’s set design in 1922 for,Paragraph
Alexander Tairov’s production of The Man Who Was Thursday at the Moscow Chamber,Caption
"(Kamernyi) Theater. With its intersecting planes and ramps, the set not only emphasized",Paragraph
the dynamic of the actors’ motion but also bridged the gap between the theoretical,Paragraph
"constructions of artists such as El Lissitzky, Kazimir Malevich, and Antoine Pevsner and",Paragraph
the practical design of large structures.,Paragraph
"The Vesnins’ progression from dynamic, avant-garde set constructions to the much",Paragraph
larger scale of major architectural projects was soon evident in their 1923 design for the,Paragraph
"Palace of Labor competition. Although their submission was awarded only third prize, it",Paragraph
"served as a programmatic statement in the development of a Constructivist aesthetic,",Paragraph
combining both monumentality and severe functionalism in the massing of simple,Paragraph
geometric shapes in a complex balance. The center of the plan was the oval meeting hall,Paragraph
"in the form of an amphitheater, 75 by 67 meters in size. The array of radio masts and",Paragraph
docking ports for airships around the top was functionally justified despite its futuristic,Paragraph
appearance in the context of a war-ravaged country reestablishing a modicum of civilized,Paragraph
existence.,Paragraph
"In 1925 Alexander and Viktor Vesnin, together with Moisei Ginzburg, founded the",Paragraph
"Constructivist organization OSA (Organization of Contemporary Architecture). Indeed,",Paragraph
the preceding year Alexander had designed the book jacket for Ginzburg’s programmatic,Paragraph
work Style and Epoch. With the quickening tempo of state construction during the late,Paragraph
"1920s, all three brothers were actively engaged in projects extending from the Caucasus",Paragraph
"to the colossal hydroelectric dam across the Dnieper River, the DneproGES, designed by",Paragraph
Viktor Vesnin in collaboration with Nikolai Kolli and others. Although each brother,Paragraph
"maintained a separate, distinct practice, they are best known for the projects they did",Paragraph
together.,Paragraph
The brief flourishing of private commerce toward the end of the New Economic Policy,Title
(NEP) period is represented in the Vesnins’ design of the Mostorg retail department store,Paragraph
(1927-29) in central Moscow. Located on an awkward trapezoidal lot in the Krasnaia,Caption
"Presnia working-class district, the store, with its double-glazed facade framed by a",Paragraph
"ferroconcrete structure, appeared strikingly modern when first constructed in its context",Paragraph
of 19th-century brick buildings. It has since suffered by the addition of another story and,Paragraph
by a lack of proper maintenance.,Paragraph
"Like other major architects of the late 1920s, the Vesnins were much concerned with",Paragraph
the creation of institutions for social communication. One of the most modernistic of such,Paragraph
designs—and one of the last Constructivist buildings in Moscow—was the club for the,Paragraph
"Society of Tsarist Political Prisoners, begun in 1931. In addition to meeting rooms and a",Paragraph
"theater hall, the extensive complex was to contain a museum. In 1934, however, the",Paragraph
"society was disbanded (an ominous prelude to the Stalinist purges, which would create an",Paragraph
"altogether new society of political prisoners), and the larger plans for a museum were",Paragraph
"eliminated. Even in this truncated and deformed version, the harmony of the pure,",Paragraph
"undecorated volumetric forms is evident and reflects, if coincidentally, some of the oldest",Paragraph
formal traditions in Russian architecture.,Paragraph
The culminating project in the Vesnins’ Constructivist oeuvre was an outgrowth of the,Paragraph
"concept of the workers’ club. In order to serve the social needs of the Proletarian district,",Paragraph
"which contained an automobile factory and workers’ settlement in southeast Moscow, the",Paragraph
Vesnins designed a large complex of three buildings. The site overlooked the Moscow,Paragraph
"River and was adjacent to the Simonov Monastery, part of whose walls were razed in the",Paragraph
"course of constructing the project. Yet the largest part of the ensemble, a theater with a",Paragraph
"circular hall designed to seat 4000, was never built, nor was the projected sports building.",Paragraph
"The central element, however—the club building itself—was built between 1931 and",Paragraph
1937. This period was marred by the death of Leonid in 1933 and by the brothers’,Paragraph
increasing need to defend their Constructivist designs.,Paragraph
"Nonetheless, the Vesnins persevered to a remarkable degree, bending to the system",Paragraph
without rejecting the work that stood at the center of the Constructivist movement. In,Paragraph
their writings it is clear that Viktor and Alexander Vesnin considered the Proletarian,Paragraph
"Region Club one of their most significant works, not only for its union of functions—a",Paragraph
"1000-seat theater, ballroom, meeting halls, and exhibition space—but also for the way in",Paragraph
which form followed function and space flowed effortlessly from one component to,Paragraph
another.,Paragraph
The manner in which the design combined an acute aesthetic sensibility with function,Paragraph
was particularly important at a time when Constructivism was under attack for its,Paragraph
"purported inability to recognize the people’s aesthetic needs. In the club building, the",Paragraph
Vesnins’ fluency was reflected on the exterior in such details as the contours of the large,Paragraph
rounded bay window over the entrance to the auditorium and a semicircular conservatory,Caption
"extending from the river facade. The club also included a small astronomy observatory,",Paragraph
"which created an additional visual component for the upper structure. Unfortunately, the",Paragraph
interior of the building has been considerably modified since the Vesnins’ original,Paragraph
"design, but the structure itself is still relatively well maintained.",Paragraph
In 1935 the Vesnin brothers attempted a reply to the growing retrospectivist tendency,Paragraph
"in Stalinist architecture by stating that “the canonization of an old form, however",Paragraph
"excellent, is a brake on the development of content.” At the same time, Viktor and",Paragraph
"Alexander remained active in the architectural profession, were awarded high state",Paragraph
"honors, and participated in major competitions, such as the design for the People’s",Paragraph
Commissariat of Heavy Industry (unrealized). Although structural concepts of the,Paragraph
"classical revival with which they began their careers appeared in their later designs, they",Paragraph
continued to reject the role of monumental painting and sculpture that became so,Paragraph
prominent in architecture of the late Stalinist period. To the end they adhered to their,Paragraph
belief in the integrity of structure as the determining principle in architectural design.,Paragraph

VIDHAN BHAVAN (STATE ASSEMBLY,Title
BHOPAL),Title
"Designed by Charles Correa, completed 1986 Bhopal, India",Caption
"The Vidhan Bhavan (1980-86), designed by Charles Correa, sits on a crest that offers",Paragraph
"magnificent views of the city of Bhopal, the capital of the state of Madhya Pradesh. It",Paragraph
"houses the state assembly (the lower house with 366 members, the upper house with 75),",Paragraph
"the offices of the chief minister and other ministers of the cabinet, the speaker, the chief",Paragraph
"secretary, various committee rooms, and rooms for the supporting staff.",Paragraph
The design is conceived in terms of the circular fortified enclosure within which are,Paragraph
housed various buildings that can be accessed from three directions. The formal,Paragraph
organization of this complex follows a nine-part layout that the architect attributes to the,Paragraph
"mandala diagram. Each of the nine parts is distinct, partly because of the function that",Paragraph
"each section houses and partly because of the iconographic scheme. For example, the",Paragraph
Vidhan Sabha (Lower House} is located at the southwest corner within the form of a,Paragraph
"stupa, representing the stupa at Sanchi, a major architectural monument in the state. The",Paragraph
"focus of movement is invested in the two axes, whereas the places of congregation—the",Paragraph
"“Combined Hall,” the Vidhan Sabha, the Vidhan Parishad (Upper House), and the",Paragraph
library—are located at the four outer corners. The three main entrances are situated on,Paragraph
"the two axes, with the legislators’ entrance and the VIP entrance for the speaker opposite",Paragraph
each other and the public entrance on the southwest axis.,Paragraph
The legislative axis takes one from the legislators’ entrance through the foyer and,Paragraph
central hall and ends at the legislators’ foyer adjacent to the VIP entrance. The Vidhan,Paragraph
"Sabha and Vidhan Parishad sit on either side at the end. In contrast to this axis, if one",Paragraph
"follows the more dominant axis of movement, which is supposed to be for public",Paragraph
"entrance, it seems to have more of a symbolic aspect incorporated into the sequence of",Paragraph
"movement. It can be compared to the Indian temple, wherein the most sacred element is",Paragraph
"situated at the very end of the axis—in this case, the cabinet room and the chief",Paragraph
minister’s office. The architect engages with the images associated with land and water,Paragraph
and reverses the traditionally received conceptions along this axis. Here the entrance area,Paragraph
"is paved in a pattern of waves and has the map of the state on one side, which marks the",Paragraph
"water body. This entrance plaza leads to the court of the people, which is in the form of a",Paragraph
traditional Awnd (water tank). The images associated with the sea are repeatedly,Paragraph
"employed within the complex, such as the conchlike shapes for the combined hall and the",Paragraph
undulating wavelike form for the roofs.,Paragraph
The uniqueness of the project is its use of mythical and historic symbols not only in its,Paragraph
"organizational scheme but also in its decorative scheme, although the manner in which",Paragraph
these symbols are employed in both cases is strictly figurative. The use of folk art in the,Paragraph
murals and other artwork in this complex contributes to the revival of traditional art and,Paragraph
motifs without an excessive feeling of pastiche. The large murals covering the walls,Paragraph
"around the Aund (painted by the finest folk artists of the Bastar region), sculptures such as",Paragraph
the green-marbled sculpture of the Goddess of the Narmada River floating above the,Caption
"reflecting pool, and paintings and other artwork found throughout the building are",Paragraph
"distinct examples of the rich artistic traditions of the state. At the same time, the building",Paragraph
"is replete with iconic elements, such as the gateway of the Sanchi stupa, which is",Paragraph
replicated at the entrance of the Vidhan Sabha.,Caption
"Although the building has a monumental character, because of the use of a fortified",Paragraph
"citadel-like enclosure, the architect manages to break down the feeling of a monolithic",Paragraph
"whole by the use of a series of courtyards, pathways, and halls, thereby creating the",Paragraph
"feeling of a city within a city. Formally expressed as a unified assembly building, the",Paragraph
complex is not so much of the country as it is of the diverse nature of the state of Madhya,Paragraph
Pradesh through the use of iconographic elements that are supposed to be emblematic of,Paragraph
different aspects of the state.,Paragraph
This project received the Aga Khan Award in 1998 and has been commended by critics,Paragraph
"for its “heroic scale,” “the wide range of spatial experiences that it offers,” and its “use of",Paragraph
mythical and historical symbols.” Although much has been written about the “ritualistic,Paragraph
"pathway” and the building’s being a veritable temple to democracy, the success of these",Paragraph
aspects of the building might be overstated. The complex can be seen as one more,Paragraph
exploration of what has often been referred to as the “architecture of horizontal planes—,Paragraph
"of roofs and platforms, open colonnades, verandahs and courtyards,” a characteristic seen",Paragraph

VIENNA SECESSION,Title
The Vienna Secession has attained such an exalted role in the saga of early modern,Paragraph
architecture and design that its origins as a society composed mostly of easel painters has,Paragraph
"been almost forgotten. Like the Munich and Berlin Secessions, which were also formed",Paragraph
"in the 1890s, the organization—whose official title was the Vereinigung Bildender",Paragraph
Kiinstler Osterreichs (Secession) (Association of Austrian Fine Artists [Secession])—was,Paragraph
"born of a revolt against the artistic establishment, but its objectives were initially as much",Paragraph
"commercial as ideological. However, it soon emerged at the forefront of the efforts to",Paragraph
"reform art and architecture, and until the split of the Klimt faction in 1905, it became",Paragraph
virtually synonymous with the Vienna Moderne.,Paragraph
The target of the young revolfés in Vienna was the Kiinstlerge-nossenschaft (Artists’,Paragraph
"Association), or as it was more commonly known, the Kiinstlerhaus, a private artists’",Paragraph
"alliance that, in the absence of a well-developed gallery system, exercised nearly",Paragraph
complete control of exhibitions and sales of art. The proximate cause of the rebellion was,Paragraph
the reelection of the archconservative Eugen Felix to the presidency of the Kiinstlerhaus,Paragraph
"in November 1896. Many of the more radical members, including the painters Josef",Paragraph
"Engelhart, Carl Moll, and Gustav Klimt and the young architect Joseph Maria Olbrich,",Paragraph
"already angered by the treatment of impressionists and plein air painters, formed a new,",Paragraph
"alternate exhibiting society at the beginning of April 1897, and in late May, Klimt and 12",Paragraph
others artists formally resigned from the Kiinstlerhaus. They were eventually joined by,Paragraph
"many of the city’s other progressive artists, designers, and architects, including Josef",Paragraph
"Hoffmann and, in November 1899, Otto Wagner.",Paragraph
"From the start, the Secession espoused no single artistic philosophy or style. What",Paragraph
united its members instead was a shared rejection of historical realism in painting and,Paragraph
"revivalism in architecture, and although the Secessionist movement subsequently became",Paragraph
"closely associated with the Austrian Art Nouveau or Jugendstil (or, as it was often",Paragraph
"referred to at the time, the Secessionsstil), the association’s membership represented a",Paragraph
"wide array of modernist influences and ideas, from naturalism and impressionism to Art",Paragraph
Nouveau and protofunctionalism. The Secession also brought together artists working in,Paragraph
"a variety of media: painters, sculptors, graphic artists, typographers, and designers, as",Paragraph
well as architects. The aims of the group were similarly broad. The formation of the,Paragraph
"Secession developed, as Klimt expressed in a protest letter to the leadership of the",Paragraph
"Kiinstlerhaus,",Caption
out of a recognition of the necessity of bringing artistic life in Vienna into more,Paragraph
"lively contact with the continuing development of art abroad, and of putting",Paragraph
"exhibitions on a purely artistic footing, free from any commercial",Paragraph
"considerations; of thereby awakening in wider circles a purified, modern view of",Paragraph
"art; and lastly, of inducing a heightened concern for art in official circles.",Paragraph
"(quoted in Vergo, 1975)",Caption
"To realize these aspirations, the Secessionists launched their own journal, Ver Sacrum",Paragraph
"(Sacred Spring), in 1898. The title of the journal was drawn from the Roman ritual of",Paragraph
"consecration of youth in times of national peril, a reflection of the Secessionists’ goal of",Paragraph
"aesthetic and cultural regeneration. Lavishly produced in its early years, Ver Sacrum",Paragraph
encapsulated the desire of the Secessionists not only to elevate the standards of Austrian,Paragraph
artistic production and to embrace the new but also to bring together all the arts. In,Paragraph
"addition to reproductions of paintings, drawings, graphic design, and architecture, the",Paragraph
"journal featured music, poetry, and essays by leading Austrian and foreign modernists.",Paragraph
Even more central to this program was the series of exhibitions that the Secessionists,Paragraph
organized just before and after the turn of the century. The first of these exhibitions,Paragraph
"opened in late March 1898. It featured, along with works by the Austrian members of the",Paragraph
"association, paintings, lithographs, and drawings by Fernand Khnopff, Alphonse Mucha,",Caption
"Auguste Rodin, Giovanni Segatini, James McNeill Whistler, and others. The",Paragraph
responsibility for the design and arrangement of the exhibition (held in rented rooms of,Paragraph
the Horticultural Society Building on the Parkring) was accorded to Hoffmann and,Paragraph
"Olbrich, who also outfitted a “Ver Sacrum room,” the first of a series of spaces combining",Paragraph
the newest ideas in the applied arts and interior design. The inaugural exhibition proved to,Paragraph
be a huge financial success (despite Klimt and his colleagues’ vociferous disavowal of the,Paragraph
"rampant commercialism of the Kiinstlerhaus), but it also underscored the need for a",Paragraph
"permanent exhibition hall. Through various connections with the Vienna city government,",Paragraph
the Secessionists succeeded in securing a long-term lease on a parcel of land on the,Paragraph
"Karlplatz adjacent to the Academy of Fine Arts, and the task of designing the new",Paragraph
building was given over to Olbrich.,Paragraph
"Olbrich’s gallery, which was completed in time for the second exhibition in November",Paragraph
"1898, has become the most recognized architectural symbol of the Secession.",Paragraph
Emblazoned over its portal are the words of the critic and supporter of the Secession,Paragraph

"Freedom). It was the building’s golden dome—an open, gilded ironwork sphere of laurel",Paragraph
"leaves and berries—however, that drew the immediate attention, as well as the sarcasm,",Paragraph
"of the Viennese public, who mockingly christened it “the golden cabbage” and “the",Paragraph
"Mahdi’s tomb.” However, the revolutionary nature of Olbrich’s creation extended beyond",Paragraph
"its gleaming dome, chaste white walls, and sinuous vegetal graffiti. By relying on a light",Paragraph
"steel truss and glass roofing system supported by thin columns, Olbrich provided a",Paragraph
"remarkably open and adaptable space, one that suited perfectly the Secession’s ambitious",Paragraph
and varied exhibition program.,Paragraph
"The second exhibition, like its predecessor, again featured easel art by Viennese and",Paragraph
"foreign artists. A large area, however, was given over to a group of architectural drawings",Paragraph
"by Otto Wagner and his students, and an entire room was devoted to a display of applied",Paragraph
"arts by Olbrich, Hoffmann, Koloman Moser, and others. The emphasis on architecture",Paragraph
and the applied arts reflected a conviction within most of the Secession’s confraternity of,Paragraph
a changing relationship of art and design. Painting and sculpture—previously regarded as,Paragraph
"a higher form of artistic work—were now displayed on an equal basis with furniture,",Paragraph
"metal- and glasswork, textiles, and graphic design. Although this trend was evident in",Paragraph
"avant-garde circles throughout Europe, in Vienna the striving toward a unification of the",Paragraph
"arts was even more pronounced, and it accounted for the special character of many of the",Paragraph
Secession’s subsequent exhibits.,Paragraph
"The idea of the Gesamtkunstwerk, or total work of art, reached its apotheosis in the",Paragraph
"14th exhibition, held from April to June 1902. It featured a single work, a statue of a",Paragraph
"seated Beethoven by Leipzig artist Max Klinger, which was placed on a carefully framed",Paragraph
"platform at the far end of the gallery. Surrounding it were murals by Klimt, Roller, and",Caption
"others. Klimt’s Beethoven frieze, recently permanently reinstalled in the Secession",Caption
"Building, constituted a visual representation of ideas of the music and ideas of",Paragraph
"Beethoven’s music—perhaps, as some historians have argued, the final, choral movement",Paragraph
"of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, which was performed at the exhibit’s opening. The",Paragraph
"installation also included an abstract relief by Hoffmann, one that likewise merged the",Paragraph
newest ideas in painting and the decorative arts.,Paragraph
Many of the Secession’s early exhibitions also included the works of some of the,Paragraph
foremost modernist designers in Europe. The eighth exhibition presented objects by,Paragraph
"Charles Robert Ashbee, Henri van de Velde, and Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his",Title
"wife, Margaret Macdonald. Later exhibitions introduced many of the leading young",Paragraph

The decline in standards was in part the result of a growing rift within the Secession,Paragraph

"groups continued to coexist, but in 1905 Klimt and most of the other prominent artists,",Paragraph
"architects, and designers resigned over an argument concerning the Klimt faction’s",Paragraph
"affiliation with a local gallery, leaving the more traditional painters in control. Although",Paragraph

"famous for his International Style buildings, such as the Tuberculosis Sanitorium in",Paragraph
"Paimio, Finland. The International Style aesthetic of whiteness and abstraction, with an",Paragraph
"emphasis on industrial production, was and is fundamentally at odds with the strong",Paragraph
"traditions of handcraft in Finland. As a result, the Villa Mairea is never quite what it",Paragraph
"appears to be. Early on, the house was received as a masterpiece but, because of the many",Paragraph
"apparently contradictory elements, remained problematic as to its meaning and",Paragraph
significance.,Paragraph
The first glimpse of its dominant white volume amid pine trees suggests a rigorous,Paragraph
"modern composition of clear geometries. As one approaches more closely, the free-form",Paragraph
"entry canopy is the first surprise, contrasting with the “pure” white volume behind. More",Paragraph
"surprising still, this irregular canopy is screened and supported by lashed bamboolike",Paragraph
"poles, suggesting primitive, perhaps even Japanese, construction. Here, at the entry, Aalto",Paragraph
has announced a dialectic between traditional and modern that is sustained throughout.,Paragraph
"Once inside, one’s attention is pulled diagonally to the left by the fireplace in the far",Paragraph
"corner of the living room. Aalto takes the traditional Finnish corner stove, with its extra",Caption
"children’s bunk above, and transforms it into something uniquely modern by converting",Paragraph
the stair opening leading to the bunk into a hollowed sculptural profile at the side.,Caption
Perhaps the most memorable aspect of the living room is a modern stair of open risers,Caption
that is elaborately supported and intricately joined to vertical wooden poles. The whole,Paragraph
"ensemble is adjacent to a large, sliding glass panel leading outside to the rear courtyard.",Caption
The juxtaposition of stair and glass produces an unexpected result; the view through the,Paragraph
stair to the courtyard is reminiscent of looking out through the forest’s edge into a,Paragraph
landscape beyond. The blurring of the distinction between inside and outside is enhanced,Paragraph
by the extensive use of wood in the ceiling and occasional interior columns wrapped in,Paragraph
rattan.,Paragraph
"At this remove, it is generally accepted that one of Aalto’s most significant",Paragraph
achievements is this creation of a “forest space.” This metaphorical experience of a forest,Paragraph
inside his buildings is a reference to the primary experience of his beloved Finland. The,Paragraph
living room at the Villa Mairea is the one of the clearest statements of this idea.,Paragraph
"Despite the abundant stylistic contradictions, the house is a comfortable, livable home.",Paragraph
The interior unfolds as a succession of controlled vistas and carefully formed spaces.,Paragraph
"Much of this ease results from the L-shaped plan, which is divided into a kitchen-",Paragraph
servants’ wing and a family-living area. This organization is probably derived from plans,Paragraph
"of 19th-century aristocratic Scandinavian manor houses, with which Aalto would have",Paragraph
"been familiar. Meanwhile, the “L” also forms a courtyard that is reminiscent of much",Paragraph
"older Finnish peasant farms and faintly of Italian courtyards. Thus, even in the plan,",Paragraph
Aalto makes references to other architectures and other places and resolves complex,Paragraph
programmatic issues. The combination of conflicting references continues within the,Paragraph
"courtyard, where there is a traditional sauna combined with a free-form plunge pool.",Paragraph
"Although the pool is an unfamiliar farm element, the larger reference is to the Finnish",Paragraph
"landscape with its many lakes. The wooden sauna with its turf roof is a rustic, vernacular",Paragraph
"structure, and it is connected to the house by a turf-covered breezeway supported by",Paragraph
"metal pipe columns and a single concrete pier. Countering the sauna, diagonally across",Caption
"the courtyard, is Maire Gullichsen’s second-floor study, which is collaged onto the main,",Paragraph
"white volume of the house. The ambiguous form of the study, sheathed with vertical",Paragraph
"wood strips, is a combination of crafted material with abstract modern form. Despite the",Paragraph
"modern elements, the overall effect is to integrate the building with its place. Such an",Paragraph
"integration is unusual for modern buildings of this period, which usually were treated as",Paragraph
objects distinct from their sites.,Paragraph
"In all these examples and in the whole of this project, Aalto successfully brought",Paragraph
together the opposed worlds of Finnish vernacular and International Style modernism. In,Paragraph
"so doing, he produced a work that has had a substantial and lasting influence on the",Paragraph
"history and development of modern architecture. Here, he provided one of the few",Paragraph
examples of a “humanized modernism” that recognized the significance and experience,Paragraph
of the individual as opposed to focusing on the often dehumanizing effects of industrial,Paragraph
technique.,Paragraph
"In recent years, the Villa Mairea, with its references to other architectures, times, and",Paragraph
"traditions, has been a significant touchstone for Postmodernism, whose practitioners see",Paragraph
in Aalto’s work useful examples of referential and metaphorical design strategies. In,Paragraph
"particular, various critics have remarked on Aalto’s design method as being",Paragraph
"fundamentally “typological”; that is, designing in plan, elevation, and detail with specific",Paragraph
references to historic and basic “types” of architecture. It was Aalto’s genius that,Paragraph
"constantly transformed and mixed those types to produce complex works whose richness,",Paragraph
"subtlety, and variety set a new standard for architecture.",Paragraph
"Despite all the referential games that he played in his buildings, Aalto awakens the",Paragraph
viewer to the deep and fundamental connection between humans and the natural world. It,Paragraph
is this awareness that remains the moving and transforming core of the Villa Mairea.,Paragraph

The villa occupied an extensive field surrounded by a belt of trees. Le Corbusier placed it,Paragraph

"obligatory. Instead of directly approaching a front porch, the visitor drives under the",Paragraph

narrow ramp that dives deep into the house before bending back at the half landing.,Paragraph

"centerline of the house, this axis is also occupied by a row of columns, and on the hal",Paragraph
landing one crosses this line.,Paragraph
"The space of the ramp is fully glazed above, so that it attracts the visitor upward",Paragraph
"toward the light. Once on the second level, it can be seen that it continues farther upward,",Paragraph
"on the outside, providing access to the solarium on the roof. The house now appears like",Paragraph
"an apartment, with all the family accommodations on the raised level, the ground leve.",Paragraph
"reserved for the servants’ quarters. However, a good slice of this upper level is given to",Paragraph
"an extensive roof terrace, onto which the living room looks, with large sliding windows",Paragraph

The term and concept of “visitor center” were brought into widespread use by the,Paragraph
National Park Service during its “Mission 66“building improvement program (1956-66).,Paragraph
Under Mission 66 the Park Service promoted 100 newly created visitor centers as the hub,Paragraph

basic conveniences such as air-conditioning or indoor rest rooms.,Paragraph
"Under Mission 66, Park Service planners created a prototype design for a new building",Paragraph

requirements of each site. The prototypical visitor center consisted of a compact building,Paragraph

"popular parks might include an auditorium with regularly scheduled orientation films, a",Paragraph
"cafeteria, a research room, and a library. A convenient parking area nearby",Paragraph
accommodated visitors’ automobiles and trailers. These basic elements remain at the core,Paragraph
of visitor center planning today.,Paragraph
"As the first stop for tourists, the visitor center created a transition zone between the",Paragraph
environment outside the park and the natural and cultural features inside. Park planners,Paragraph
sited the buildings at strategic points in an effort to funnel tourists through an orientation,Paragraph
"process, a critical component of the Mission 66 visitor center campaign. Once inside the",Paragraph

VOISIN PLAN FOR PARIS (1925),Caption
Designed by Le Corbusier,Caption
"In the Voisin Plan, Le Corbusier adapted the principles of his Contemporary City for",Paragraph
Three Million Inhabitants (1922) to the specific situation of Paris. In 1922 a sketch,Paragraph
accompanying the Contemporary City demonstrated an adaptation of the plan to the,Paragraph
historic center of Paris. In 1925 the renovation of Paris became the main issue. The plan,Paragraph
was exhibited at the Pavilion of Esprit Nouveau at the International Decorative Arts,Paragraph
Exhibition of 1925. The pavilion was an architectural manifesto that showcased two,Paragraph
projects: a residence type that systematically used standard elements and a study of the,Paragraph
principles of standardization in their urban and interurban context. The former was,Paragraph
"represented by a full-scale model of a unit from the Immeuble Villas block. The latter,",Paragraph
"the Voisin Plan and the Contemporary City, were featured in an annex of the pavilion.",Caption
"Although a theoretical exercise, the plan was also a concrete proposal aimed at the",Paragraph
transformation of Paris and marked the first of Le Corbusier’s numerous proposals for,Paragraph
"Paris, including the Ville Radieuse (Radiant City; ca. 1930) and Le Destin de Paris (The",Paragraph
Destiny of Paris; 1941). Eugéne Hénard’s Etudes sur les transformations de Paris,Caption
(Studies on the Transformations of Paris; 1903-06) was an influential precedent.,Paragraph
"Somewhat sensational, the radical Voisin Plan was severely denigrated by critics who",Paragraph
accused Le Corbusier of wanting to destroy Paris.,Paragraph
"The plan addressed the urgent problems facing Paris: overcrowding, traffic congestion,",Paragraph
and the lack of office space. Central to the plan was Le Corbusier’s conception of the,Paragraph
"relationship between skyscrapers and traffic routes, based on the principles of high",Paragraph
"density, open space, and speed. Le Corbusier wrote in Urbanisme (City of Tomorrow,",Paragraph
1925) that the plan did not provide definitive solutions to the problems of Paris but that,Paragraph
"its primary aim was to cut through small, uncoordinated efforts at renovation and raise",Paragraph
the level of discussion to large-scale reforms that would incorporate contemporary issues.,Paragraph
"To transform Paris into a modem city, Le Corbusier invoked the tradition of urban",Paragraph
"planning. Facing the dilemma of medicine or surgery, he referred to the tradition of",Paragraph
applying both and chose surgery for the historical center. The projected site was an L-,Paragraph
shaped area of 240 hectares located northeast of the Louvre on the Right Bank. Most,Paragraph
buildings and streets were to be demolished for the area to be built anew in a rigorous,Paragraph
"geometric pattern. Only a few isolated, historic buildings were to be preserved: the",Paragraph
"Louvre, Palais Royal, Place Vendéme, Place de la Concorde, Arc de Triomphe, Opera,",Caption
and a few churches and town houses.,Paragraph
"In the business district on the eastern half of the area facing the Ile de la Cité, 18",Caption
"cruciform office towers, surrounded by open, green space, were to be built along the axis",Paragraph
"of the Boulevard Sébastopol. In the western, residential district were to be the setback, or",Paragraph
"redent, blocks, either of the Immeuble-Villas type that form large blocks or covered with",Paragraph
"immense sheets of glass. Streets were replaced by elevated terraces with shops, cafes, and",Paragraph
restaurants for social and commercial functions. Underlying the ideology of creating,Paragraph
well-being and happiness through large-scale planning was the political notion that the,Paragraph
problems of social disorder could be resolved by the provision of the essential joys of,Paragraph
"sunlight, greenery, and leisure.",Paragraph
Another essential component of the plan was hygienic and comfortable dwellings. The,Paragraph
"exhibited full-scale model unit was a standardized modern duplex that, superimposed",Paragraph
"with other duplexes, formed the apartment block. This seminal building type marked a",Paragraph
"new approach to architecture. Built in reinforced concrete and Cubist in form, its design",Paragraph
centered around spatial proportions and volumes rather than around a two-dimensional,Paragraph
facade. Its double-height living area and garden terrace would recur in Le Corbusier’s,Paragraph
designs. The unit was furnished according to the purist canon of objets-types that,Paragraph
"balanced folk, craft, and machine-made objects.",Paragraph
The name Voisin points to one of the essential aims of the project: the creation of a,Paragraph
wide east—west artery parallel to the rue de Rivoli for fast automobile traffic. To finance,Paragraph
"the Pavilion of Esprit Nouveau, Le Corbusier sent out letters to the biggest names in the",Paragraph
"automobile industry—Voisin, Michelin, and Citroén—asking them to contribute funds in",Paragraph
"exchange for publicity. The Voisin car and airplane cartel, which was interested in mass-",Paragraph
"produced housing, supported the project. Le Corbusier regarded locomotion",Paragraph
simultaneously as a modern influence threatening Paris that required reorganization and,Paragraph
"also as one of the fundamental sources of power for the modern commercial city, as is",Paragraph
illustrated by his entrepreneurial aphorism “A city made for speed is a city made for,Paragraph
"success.” Financially, however, as with other aspects of the plan, the construction of the",Paragraph
"artery was not a viable idea. If enacted, it would have been one of the most costly as well",Paragraph
"as destructive projects to be carried out in Paris. Financially and politically, the plan was",Paragraph
unrealistic.,Paragraph
"In the history of urban planning, the Voisin Plan has often been singled out as a",Paragraph
"symbol of the Modern movement’s disregard for the past. However, Le Corbusier’s own",Paragraph
view was that through the plan the prestigious vestiges of Paris were not only preserved,Paragraph
"but rescued as well. By opening up the area around the monuments, they were to be",Paragraph
"protected from the daily urban activities that endangered them. According to this logic,",Paragraph
the buildings now became monuments to be conserved and thus were reintegrated into,Paragraph
the fabric of the modern city. In this way Le Corbusier’s dogmatic project nonetheless,Paragraph
"underlined the dynamic between renovation and conservation. Moreover, in later plans",Paragraph
some of the most radical features of the plan were modified. In 1933 the cruciform,Paragraph
"skyscraper was replaced with a smaller, Y-shaped type that allowed in more sunlight. In",Paragraph
"the later plans, these skyscrapers were to be built far from the existing center. Although it",Paragraph
"was the earlier, cruciform towers that were enthusiastically adopted by planners through",Paragraph

the emergence of a new modern architecture. From the mid-1890s to the time of his death,Paragraph

"Wagner never wholly shed traditional notions of style and beauty, and his lifelong",Paragraph

"Friedrich Schinkel. However, it was at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, which",Paragraph
"Wagner entered in October 1861, where he encountered the two figures who would form",Paragraph
his architectural outlook: August Sicardsburg and Eduard van der Nill. Sicardsburg and,Paragraph
"van der Niill, designers of the Vienna Opera House, had long advocated the necessity of",Paragraph
"finding a “rational expression for modern architecture” (quoted in Graf, 1987). Wagner’s",Paragraph
later appreciation of utility and his search for a new language of construction arose from,Paragraph
"their teachings, and it was to van der Nill that he attributed his refined facility for",Paragraph
drawing.,Paragraph
"After completing his education at the Academy in 1863, Wagner embarked on his",Paragraph
"architectural career. Early on, however, he found few commissions for public projects,",Paragraph
"and he worked instead on a series of apartment houses, a number of which he financed",Paragraph
himself as speculative ventures. Many of these buildings were executed in a “free,Paragraph
"Renaissance” style, and this new astringent and innovative classicism became the young",Paragraph
"Wagner’s hallmark. By the late 1880s, Wagner was considered the preeminent builder of",Paragraph
"tenement houses in Vienna, but his attempts to secure more prestigious works remained",Paragraph
mostly fruitless. Among the notable exceptions were his Orthodox Synagogue (1871-76),Paragraph
in Budapest and the Osterreichische Landerbank (1882-84) in Vienna. The former was,Paragraph
executed in a neo-Moorish idiom and the latter in Wagner’s more characteristic,Paragraph
"Renaissance style, but in both buildings the outer historicist skin concealed what were—",Paragraph
"in material, constructional, and spatial terms—already remarkably modern buildings.",Paragraph
"Wagner, however, continued to experiment with more conventional ideas of",Paragraph

"widespread praise, and as a consequence, he was named chief architect of the municipal",Paragraph
"railway system in 1894. The work, which continued until 1901, not only required Wagner",Paragraph
to design more than 30 stations but also involved the siting and design of a series of,Paragraph
"bridges, tunnels, and viaducts. Wagner’s first stations, executed in brick and stucco with",Paragraph
"pronounced classical detailing, reflected traditional ideas of building “art.” However, as",Paragraph
"construction progressed, he began to explore a more stripped and utilitarian idiom. After",Paragraph
"1897, Wagner also investigated the possibilities of the new Jugendstil language, which he",Paragraph

as the twin stations on the Karlsplatz that he produced in collaboration with his younger,Paragraph

"previously occupied by the noted Ringstrasse architect Carl von Hasenauer, was reserved",Paragraph
"for a “convinced representative of classical Renaissance,” Wagner in his inaugural",Paragraph

"insistence on pragmatism, like his chosen motto for the Stadtbahn project (borrowed",Paragraph
"from Gottfried Semper), artis sola domina necessitas (Necessity is the only master of",Paragraph

mission of the architect was to find a means of reconciling the realistic and utilitarian,Paragraph
with the forms of artistic expression and that it was only through this mediation that mere,Paragraph
building could be elevated to Baukunst (building art).,Paragraph
Wagner sought to communicate these ideas not only through his works but also in his,Paragraph
"teachings. Between 1894 and 1912, he devoted a significant portion of his time and",Paragraph
"energy to his “Special class”—the so-called Wagnerschule, or Wagner School—at the",Paragraph
"Academy; and his students, who included Josef Hoffmann, Joze Plecnik, Jan Kotera,",Paragraph
"Pavel Janak, Rudolf Perco, Karl Ehn, and Hubert and Franz Gessner, among others,",Paragraph
subsequently assumed a central position in the avant-garde in Central Europe. Despite,Paragraph
Wagner’s stated conviction that truthful and logical construction should constitute the,Paragraph
"basis for architecture’s renewal, however, many of his students were more taken with his",Paragraph
"language of form, which emphasized the importance of masking or wrapping the internal",Paragraph
"structure in an outer aesthetic veil. This idea, adapted by Wagner from Semper’s theory",Paragraph
"of Bekleidung, or “dressing,” emphasized the use of poetic forms or symbols to represent",Paragraph
themes that could not be expressed through structure alone. Such an approach stood in,Paragraph
"direct opposition to later concepts of modernism, which advocated clarity and rationality,",Paragraph
yet it had a profound and lasting impact on a whole range of younger Central European,Paragraph
"architects and designers, who reshaped it to articulate a wide array of social, cultural, and",Paragraph
economic messages.,Paragraph
"In Wagner’s own work, this tactic of Bekleidung assumed various guises. In 1898-99,",Paragraph
"in a pair of adjacent buildings on the Linke Wienzeile, it appeared in the form of a florid",Paragraph
"Jugendstil idiom, the ornament often reduced to two-dimensional graphics or low-relief",Paragraph
"appliqué. By the early years of the 20th century, however, Wagner had abandoned this",Paragraph
"language in favor of a stripped, utilitarian classicism, which he combined with geometric",Paragraph
"forms. His Postal Savings Bank (1904-06, 1910-12), for example, still observed the",Paragraph
"conventions of a rusticated base and elaborate cornice, but he added to it elements of the",Paragraph
new rectilinear Jugendstil. Consistent with his belief in the necessity of adopting new,Paragraph
"forms of construction, Wagner employed reinforced concrete for the floors of this large",Paragraph
"office block and made extensive use of aluminum, which he exploited both for its",Paragraph
structural qualities and for its aesthetic values. Yet the most dramatic feature of its,Paragraph
"exterior, the aluminum-headed pins that appear to affix the thin stone panels to the walls",Paragraph
"while reinforcing the impression of tectonic play, were as much symbolic as structural.",Paragraph
Although the pins (which were actually iron but clad in lead with polished aluminum,Paragraph
caps so that they would not discolor the marble) served a purpose—to support the,Paragraph
underlying mortar—they were also intended to express solidity and stability and thus to,Paragraph
reinforce the idea of the building’s “dress.”,Paragraph
"If the Postal Savings Bank betokened a new Nuizstil, or utilitarian style, Wagner’s",Paragraph
unrealized designs for the Franz Josef-Stadtmuseum (city museum) suggested how past,Paragraph
and new forms might be fused to fashion a modern monumentality. Wagner labored on,Paragraph
"the project for more than a decade, from 1900 to 1912, producing a number of variant",Paragraph
"designs. However, despite his efforts to forge a “modern way of building” that retained",Paragraph
"the monumental grandeur associated with 19th-century architecture, his building failed to",Paragraph
find official or public acceptance—a telling reminder of how strongly Wagner’s,Paragraph
"aesthetic, even in its most traditional form, ran counter to the contemporary taste.",Paragraph
"Around 1905, Wagner produced two further examples of the stone-panel-and-",Paragraph
aluminum-pin idiom he had announced in the Postal Savings Bank: the Church of St.,Paragraph
Leopold am Steinhof (1905-07) and the Kaiserbad Control House (1904-05) on the,Paragraph
"Danube Canal. However, in his subsequent designs he returned to a highly simplified,",Paragraph
functional language. This last phase of his work is perhaps best exemplified by the,Paragraph
"residential apartment building (1909-10) at Neustiftgasse 40, which, with its clear,",Paragraph
"blocklike form and regular fenestration, pointed firmly in the direction of a developing",Paragraph
modularity.,Paragraph
This gesture toward a new practical aesthetic similarly informed the design of the,Paragraph
housing blocks depicted in Wagner’s Project for the Future Twenty-second District of,Paragraph
"Vienna, published in his work Die Grossstadt (1911; The Metropolis). The 23-page",Paragraph
"pamphlet laid out Wagner’s mature ideas on city planning, describing in precise terms",Paragraph
both an architectural and an economic solution to the problem of the expanding city. He,Paragraph
argued that future growth could be financed through municipal control of public utilities,Paragraph
and by permitting the city authorities to buy and sell properties. To enable the city to,Paragraph
"grow, he called for new urban districts of 100,000 to 150,000 inhabitants, with both",Paragraph
dwellings and places of work in close proximity to allow residents to work and reside in,Paragraph
the same area. Each district would have a formal “air center” for its public and cultural,Paragraph
institutions surrounded by uniform apartment buildings. The basic street system would,Paragraph
"follow a grid, and radial arteries and circular belts of roads and rail would provide",Paragraph
connections with the center and other districts. Monumentality would not be achieved by,Paragraph
the individual residential blocks but would arise out of their regularity and repetition.,Paragraph
"Die Grossstadt was by turns both practical and utopian, but in its advocacy of rational",Paragraph
"approaches to the problem of the modern city, it was consistent with Wagner’s",Paragraph
fundamental belief that purpose should be a primary determinant of form. Wagner’s,Paragraph

WAREHOUSE,Title
"Warehouses, buildings that provide storage for commercial gain, have had two primary",Paragraph
functional mandates—the provision of storage space on floors with a high load capacity,Paragraph
and the facilitation of the movement of goods and freight with materials-handling,Paragraph
"equipment—since the mid-19th century, when the building type and term became",Paragraph
"common. Nevertheless, warehouses underwent fundamental changes in form as well as in",Paragraph
architectural presence during the 20th century.,Paragraph
"General-purpose, cold-storage, bonded, and household-goods warehouses, as well as",Paragraph
"industry-specific facilities, were in use by the turn of the 20th century. At that time the",Paragraph
typical warehouse was a loft structure of five stories in which goods were moved with,Paragraph
"platform elevators. The interior framing of these structures consisted of wood, cast-iron,",Paragraph
and wrought-iron members combined to support heavy floor loads. Masonry wareouses,Paragraph
"were often divided by interior firewalls into a series of discrete spaces, and such divisions",Paragraph
were sometimes expressed on their exteriors through piers and fenestration patterns.,Paragraph
These warehouses had enough windows to light the interior without the introduction of,Paragraph
the fire hazard of lanterns and to allow for conversion of the building to other uses; as,Paragraph
"electric lighting became more commonly used in warehouses, the number of window",Paragraph
"openings was reduced. Exterior, raised loading platforms sheltered by sheet-metal",Caption
awnings and series of wide doorways articulated the street levels of warehouses.,Paragraph
A functional yet expressive tone of architectural styling for warehouses was set during,Paragraph
"the 19th century. The sturdy brick forms and detailing of the Rundbogenstil, with piers,",Paragraph
"arcades, corbeled brick cornices, and arched window openings, were often selected to",Paragraph
express both a warehouse’s stability and strength and its important role in commerce. In a,Paragraph
"series of articles that appeared in the Architectural Record, the critic Russell Sturgis drew",Paragraph
attention to early 20th-century warehouse design that offered a similar clear expression of,Paragraph
structure and monumentality and was not cluttered with any applied ornament. Many,Paragraph
ware houses built during the first half of the 20th century exhibited architectural presence,Paragraph
and expressed this aesthetic sensibility as utilitarian purpose tempered references to,Paragraph
current styles.,Paragraph
"During the first decades of the 20th century, warehouses reflected both the continued",Paragraph
success of capitalism and advances in building arts as the warehouses became even larger,Paragraph
and stronger and incorporated new materials-handling methods. The use of expensive,Paragraph
steel beams was often limited to the framing of wide bays on the ground floor for the,Paragraph
"accommodation of rail and motor vehicles. Reinforced concrete, however, was widely",Paragraph
adopted because it was strong and fire resistant. The United States Army Supply Base,Paragraph
"(1918) in Brooklyn, New York, designed by architect Cass Gilbert, consisted of a pair of",Paragraph
reinforced-concrete loft buildings that flanked a covered rail siding commanded by a,Paragraph
traveling crane. The facility was widely admired because of its materials-handling system,Paragraph
as well as for the way in which Gilbert carefully modeled the stark concrete facades to,Paragraph
"convey great scale and strength. Another American project, the Starrett-Lehigh Building",Paragraph
"(1930-31) in New York City, designed by Cory and Cory with Yasuo Matsui, associate",Caption
"architect, demonstrated the ultimate development of the multistory warehouse both in the",Paragraph
vertical movement of goods and in the architectural expression of function. This structure,Paragraph
covered an entire block and rose to a height of 19 stories. Its steel-framed central service,Paragraph
"and circulation core, which served as a “vertical street” to bring trucks to each warehouse",Paragraph
"floor, was articulated by soaring pilasters. More dominant in the design, however, were",Paragraph
the flanking lofts. Their walls were slightly cantilevered beyond the exterior columns to,Paragraph
permit horizontal bands of windows and rounded corners. With its interpretation of,Paragraph
"European architectural modernism of the day, the Starrett-Lehigh Building earned notice",Paragraph
in the Museum of Modern Art’s “Modern Architecture: International Exhibition” of,Paragraph
1932.,Paragraph
"A new preference for the horizontal movement of goods, the relocation of warehousing",Paragraph
"operations to sites outside of urban cores, and a heightened desire to minimize",Paragraph
warehousing costs led to dramatic changes for warehouses during the middle third of the,Paragraph
century. Experimentation with platform trucks during the 1930s demonstrated the,Paragraph
"advantages of one-story facilities; after World War II, forklift trucks and pallets that",Paragraph
“unitized” goods storage and shipment became the modern tools of warehousing. The,Paragraph
warehouse design problem changed to become a matter of limiting initial costs and,Paragraph
choosing the best size and shape of a one-story structure that would have masonry,Paragraph
bearing walls and a lightweight flat roof. Ceiling heights of 20 feet or more and smooth,Paragraph
floors were provided to accommodate forklift trucks and pallets. An office area with a,Paragraph
public entry and fenestration was positioned to screen the rest of the building from the,Paragraph
"street or to occupy a corner of the building. Freight doors, truck docks, and railroad",Paragraph
sidings became the only features of the other sides of these windowless warehouses.,Paragraph
"Brick and other siding materials enclosed bland, unstyled warehouses intended to blend",Paragraph
in with nearby commercial and industrial structures.,Paragraph
"During the late 20th century, warehousing operations and buildings continued to",Paragraph
evolve in response to a just-in-time manufacturing philosophy and the development of,Paragraph
distribution networks that used a smaller number of larger warehouses. Even more,Paragraph
"emphatically, the warehouse building became perceived as merely a means to protect the",Paragraph
storage medium and materialshandling systems that were the important components of,Paragraph
"the operation. To serve Europe, Nike, Inc., developed a pair of side-by-side distribution",Paragraph
"centers (1994-95) near Meerhout, Belgium, that are representative of the quite large",Paragraph
facilities developed during the 1990s. The structures enclose one million square feet and,Paragraph
cover 23 acres as they accommodate high-bay storage that rises to a height of nearly 100,Paragraph
feet.,Paragraph
Yet even as most new warehouses became little-noticed background buildings in,Paragraph
"industrial developments and port areas, older urban warehouses were rehabilitated for",Paragraph
"new uses. Since the 1970s warehouses with style and versatile loft floors in Copenhagen,",Paragraph
"London, New York, and many other cities have provided space for people to live and",Paragraph
work in lively mixed-use neighborhoods and waterfront areas.,Paragraph

The Weissenhofsiedlung was one of the most significant architectural exhibitions of,Paragraph
the 20th century. It brought together for the first time the work of some of the most,Paragraph
influential and progressive European designers from the early decades of the century. The,Paragraph
"exposition, held in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1927, focused on “Die Wohnung” (the",Paragraph
"Dwelling). Initiated by the Deutscher Werkbund and financed by the city of Stuttgart, it",Paragraph
presented current ideas in modern residential design. The central feature of the event was,Paragraph
a development of 21 domestic buildings located on the Weissenhof hillside overlooking,Paragraph
the city. Over a half million people visited the Siedlung during the summer of 1927.,Paragraph
The full-scale model housing development was only one part of the exhibition.,Paragraph
Domestic products and furniture were displayed together in the exhibit “The Interior,Paragraph
"Design of the House,” located at Gewerbeplatz in Stuttgart. The exhibit featured the",Paragraph
"Spiegelglashalle, a plate-glass hall designed by Lilly Reich and Ludwig Mies van der",Caption
Rohe that consisted of wall planes of various glass materials—a predecessor to Mies’s,Paragraph
German Pavilion designed two years later for the Barcelona Exposition. The,Paragraph

buildings that reflected the new architectural ideas promoted in the designs of the,Paragraph
"Siedlung. A third group of exhibits, located at a site adjacent to the Weissenhof estate,",Paragraph
demonstrated the attributes of recently developed building materials and new methods of,Paragraph
"construction, including industrial prefabrication.",Paragraph
The initial underlying social goal of the exhibition was to present modern solutions to,Paragraph
the urgent need for low- and middle-income housing. Event organizers sought to,Paragraph
demonstrate ways to reduce housing costs and improve living conditions through the use,Paragraph
of recently introduced building materials and construction methods. Many of the 17,Paragraph
"architects involved in the Siedlung, however, ignored the basic economic objective of the",Paragraph
show and created designs more appropriate for affluent families. Many of the individual,Paragraph
housing units even contained maid’s quarters.,Paragraph
"Participating designers came from Austria, Holland, Switzerland, Belgium, and",Paragraph
"Germany. Organizers hired Mies van der Rohe as artistic director, and Richard Docker",Paragraph
served as technical director. Other architects who contributed designs for the,Paragraph
"development included Peter Behrens, Le Corbusier and his partner Pierre Jeanneret, Josef",Paragraph
"Frank, Walter Gropius, Ludwig Hilber-seimer, J.J.P. Oud, Hans Poelzig, Adolf Rading,",Caption
"Hans Scharoun, Adolf Schneck, Mart Stam, Bruno Taut, and Max Taut. A house",Caption
designed by the Belgian architect Victor Bourgeois located adjacent to the development,Caption
was also incorporated into the exhibition.,Paragraph
Most of the buildings in the Siedlung were situated on streets that curved along the,Paragraph
"Weissenhof hillside. The designs featured flat, unadorned facades; flat roofs; ribbon",Paragraph
"windows; and pipe railing. Although the basic, formal characteristics of the buildings",Paragraph
"suggested a great sense of unity among the designers, the unique nature of each of their",Paragraph
architectural ideologies was apparent in the details. Individual designers focused on,Paragraph
different aspects of modern housing. Mies van der Rohe designed a fourstory block of,Paragraph
"terrace apartments that served as the centerpiece of the exhibition. Inside, he showed how",Paragraph
universal spaces could be adapted to meet individual needs. Le Corbusier illustrated his,Paragraph
own ideas for the modern dwelling in two houses of reinforced concrete that he designed,Paragraph
with Pierre Jeanneret. The architect realized the concept of his Citrohan House in the first,Paragraph
"residence, whereas the second house featured the five points of architecture discussed in",Paragraph
"his 1923 treatise Towards a New Architecture. Some designers, such as Gropius, Stam,",Paragraph
"and Max Taut, explored newly available building materials and ideas regarding",Paragraph
"prefabrication. Others, such as Scharoun, Poelzig, and Schneck, were more interested in",Paragraph
producing functional layouts that could better meet the needs of the modern family.,Paragraph
Although the facades of the Weissenhof buildings appear neutral in black-and-white,Paragraph
"photographs, in reality many of the walls were originally painted in shades of yellow,",Paragraph
"blue, and other colors. Bruno Taut, Max Taut, and Le Corbusier all incorporated intense",Paragraph
"colors in their designs. Bruno Taut, for example, specified different saturated hues for the",Paragraph
"individual walls of his small, single-family residence, leading one critic to describe the",Paragraph
vivid colors as coming right out of a paint box.,Paragraph
The architecture of the Weissenhofsiedlung was strongly rejected by the National,Paragraph
"Socialists in Germany, who labeled it the “product of ‘cultural Bolshevists.’” The event",Paragraph
was better received in European and American design journals. The success of the,Paragraph
Siedlung led to a succession of similar housing exhibitions in Germany and elsewhere,Paragraph
"across Central Europe, including events in Prague, Brno, and Vienna. Progressive",Paragraph
European architects used these exhibitions to present and debate their modern design,Paragraph
ideologies. Their desire to further develop such dialogue led to the formation of CLAM,Paragraph
"(Congrés Internationaux d’ Architecture Moderne) in 1929, which provided a platform for",Paragraph
designers to discuss developing ideas in modern architecture. The formal unity of the,Paragraph
designs included in the Siedlung contributed to the concept of an International Style in,Paragraph
modern architecture that was heavily promoted five years later by Henry Russell Hitch-,Paragraph

given him credit for anticipating the standardization and machine aesthetic that were to,Paragraph
become hallmarks of avant-garde design and International Style modern architecture after,Paragraph
"World War | in Germany. Stanford Anderson, however, has more perceptively argued",Paragraph
that Muthesius intended to reinforce the conservative statement made by the classicism of,Paragraph
his own buildings and that he surely spoke for many of the reform-minded architects,Paragraph
present.,Paragraph
"Others at the exhibit, however, disagreed completely with Muthesius and were",Paragraph
"outraged that he voiced these ideas as Werkbund policy. The next day, speaking for a",Paragraph
"group of younger architects, including Gropius and Taut, van de Velde proposed ten",Paragraph

site and climate. Williams’s new approach toward creating a settlement is revealed in the,Paragraph
"manner in which the units are stepped to maximize light and ventilation, and a gentle",Paragraph
curving roof offers broader views for all residents.,Paragraph
The House over the Brook (1945) in Mar del Plata synthesized many significant ideas,Paragraph
"for Williams. Designed for his father, a musician, it remains one of his few built projects.",Paragraph
"Williams described this house, which embodies his classicist attitudes, as “a form in",Paragraph
"space that cannot deny nature...concrete—its material—is exposed, and textured by",Paragraph
"mechanical and chemical procedures: form, structure and quality are thus here the same",Paragraph
"thing” (Frampton, p. 10). Two pillars support the bridgelike structure, and the curvature",Paragraph
of the building responds to the landscape. The manner in which the house spans the brook,Paragraph
is related to Maillart’s bridge (1933) over the Schawanbach River. It exemplifies,Paragraph
Williams’s belief in the confluence of engineering and architecture. The interior displays,Paragraph
his concern for detail and his poetic sensibility toward the use of materials.,Paragraph
Structural typology also plays a crucial role in Williams’s proposal for the Airport of,Paragraph
Buenos Aires (1945). The solution is logical in its simplicity. Located 8 kilometers from,Paragraph
"the city, the airport was proposed to sit on massive slabs resembling airplane wings and",Paragraph
was supported by enormous pillars embedded into the shallow river. The proposal,Paragraph
"connected the airport with the city via a platform, beneath which hung all airport",Paragraph
circulation and services.,Paragraph
The Suspended Office Building project (1946) was designed in collaboration with,Paragraph
"Janello, Janello and Butler. This suspended skyscraper, designed for a site in Buenos",Paragraph
"Aires, is the most paradigmatic among all Williams’s projects. Four concrete columns",Paragraph
support two beams from which hang a steel framework for 28 floors divided into three,Caption
"sectors. The first slab was suspended 18 meters above the entrance, thereby generating a",Paragraph
covered open space for a densely populated area of the city. The interior had flexible,Paragraph
"partitions, a structural type that was developed decades later by Sir Norman Foster in the",Paragraph
Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Buildings.,Caption
"In Williams’s Hall for Visual Spectacle and Sound in Space (1953), the development",Paragraph
of the typology is determined not by the location but rather by objective scientific study.,Paragraph
Research that investigated the propagation of sound in space was used to shape the,Paragraph
auditorium and optimize acoustics for all listeners. Rotating a vertical axis generated the,Paragraph
"shell; thus, it created a mushroomlike amphitheater capable of providing a variety of",Paragraph
visual spectacles.,Paragraph
"Since the late 1940s, Williams produced a series of projects that studied the",Paragraph
"relationships between program-function, sitestructure, and climate-city. Several of these,",Paragraph
"executed from 1951 to 1966, employed concrete building shells of minimum thickness.",Paragraph
Others in the early 1960s rearticulated his strategies for the use of high roof structures. In,Paragraph
both cases the structures consisted of thin building shells or roofs that were supported by,Paragraph
large columns.,Paragraph
The shells in several projects acted as umbrellas that either grouped together or isolated,Paragraph
spaces. They were carefully calculated to incorporate alternative functions to easily,Paragraph
accommodate production processes and responded to differing contexts and programs.,Paragraph
"Among these proposals are the Hospitals in Corrientes, the proposals for Mbucuruya and",Paragraph
"Curuzu-Cuatia (1948-53), the Gas Station (1955) in Avellaneda, the Industrial School",Paragraph
"(1960) in Olavarria, the House (1960) in Punta del Este, and the Bunge and Born",Paragraph
Exhibition Stand (1966).,Paragraph
The series of projects employing high roof structures is part of Williams’s research and,Paragraph
innovative attitude toward design. In these cases individual shells are replaced with,Paragraph
continuous large roof structures supported by few columns. Horizontal panels or glass,Caption
membranes hang from the roof to offer protection from the climate and provide,Paragraph
continuity with the existing context. The basic structural components generate ample,Paragraph
space that can accommodate diverse programs and activities. Examples of this approach,Paragraph
"are the factory building proposal (1962) for Iggam, a small furniture shop (1962) in",Paragraph
"Buenos Aires, and a monument (1964) for the city of Berlin.",Caption
Many of Williams’s later major projects were also unrealized. Among these is an urban,Paragraph
proposal for a linear city of 300 kilometers in length by 6 kilometers in width. It is,Paragraph
"modeled after Le Corbusier’s approach to urban design, with the buildings supported by",Paragraph
"pilotis, thereby reclaiming the ground space to promote greater contact with nature. An",Paragraph
additional unrealized project is Williams’s design for a 200-meter-high cross standing,Paragraph
over the river (1988). It was to be situated on a large platform outside the port of Buenos,Paragraph
Aires.,Paragraph
In 1981 the critic Kenneth Frampton wrote that Williams “was an enigmatic figure...a,Paragraph
brilliant designer whose influence has been totally disproportionate to the extent of his,Paragraph
"own rather limited output” (Frampton, 1981). A renewed interest in architectural",Paragraph
typology and Latin American architecture led to Williams’s work being exhibited at,Paragraph
Harvard University in 1987. The exhibit contributed to a greater understanding and,Paragraph
deeper appreciation of Williams’s contribution to modern architecture.,Paragraph

the issues of life and architecture.”,Paragraph
"In their early work, Williams and Tsien experimented with materials in the designs for",Paragraph
installations at the Museum of the Chinese in the Americas in New York and elsewhere.,Caption
They used unconventional materials and also reconsidered how familiar materials could,Paragraph

Monte Dance Company in New York advanced the ideas of large screens to create a,Paragraph

These investigations informed their subsequent architectural work. The design for new,Paragraph
galleries at the Phoenix Art Museum explored the use of glass and metal and of different,Paragraph
aggregates in the making of the concrete for the building. The systems of construction,Paragraph

"modern architecture of the heroic period, made when Aalto received the RIBA Medal in",Paragraph
1957: “Like all revolutions it starts with enthusiasm and stops with some sort of,Paragraph

"The dramatic technological, environmental, political, and economic changes that",Paragraph
occurred during the 20th century irrevocably changed the way in which wood is used in,Paragraph
all types of building. Three major themes can be discerned: improved technology and,Paragraph
accelerating scientific research have resulted in novel uses for wood as well as in,Paragraph
"structural and decorative substitutes for wood; improved transportation, rising demand,",Paragraph
"and freer trade have created large, new worldwide markets for all types of timber and",Paragraph
"wood fiber; and, despite constantly shifting styles, steady change in construction",Paragraph
technology has reduced wood’s relevance to architecture.,Paragraph
"The immense investment of energy, time, and wealth in scientific research by",Paragraph
"governments, businesses, and universities throughout the 20th century bore fruit in",Paragraph
"practically every field of endeavor, and wood, despite its seemingly elemental nature,",Paragraph
was not neglected. The fundamental innovations of the 20th century were to devise new,Paragraph
"ways to break wood down into its boards, strips, strands, fibers, and even molecules and",Paragraph
"to concoct new and better ways to reattach these components. Another breakthrough,",Paragraph
"although of questionable environmental merit, was the gradual development of improved",Paragraph
"techniques for planting, growing, and harvesting trees. These innovations had the net",Paragraph
result of increasing both the usefulness and the value of wood in society. They also,Paragraph
"permitted, for the first time, many physical weaknesses of wood to be significantly",Paragraph
ameliorated.,Paragraph
"Except for scarce “old growth” timber, which can be up to 10 feet in diameter and over",Paragraph
"100 feet in length, trees produce lumber that is not very long, very straight, or very stable.",Paragraph
"Premodern carpentry accommodated the slender, flexible, environmentally sensitive",Paragraph
"nature of wood by devising intricate, laborintensive methods of combining small pieces",Paragraph
of wood to create architectural surfaces and structural frames. Carpenters in the 20th,Paragraph
"century, by contrast, were able to use many new wood products that are, in theory,",Paragraph
"infinitely wide, flat, long, stiff, uniform, and stable. The most famous example of this is",Paragraph
"plywood, actually a trade name for a Douglas fir product that was first exhibited at the",Paragraph
"Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition of 1905. Plywood is best known because, by the",Paragraph
"middle of the 20th century, it was being used for everything from furniture designed by",Paragraph
"Frank Lloyd Wright to P.T. boats, but it is just one of many different types of composite",Paragraph
wood panels made up of layers of wood veneer glued together. Because the layers of,Paragraph
"veneer are laid at cross angles to one another, plywood warps, shrinks, and cracks very",Paragraph
"little. Although it is sold today primarily in panels four feet wide by eight feet long, it can",Paragraph
theoretically be manufactured to any dimension and in virtually any thickness. Many,Paragraph
types of veneer panel were being manufactured in limited quantities during the 19th,Paragraph
"century, but the growing usefulness of composite wood panels in the 20th century",Paragraph
"depended primarily on the increasing strength, durability, and water resistance of the",Paragraph
adhesives.,Paragraph
"Composite panels could also be made from straw, wood, sugarcane, or practically any",Paragraph
"other kind of vegetable fiber. Such products as Masonite, Homasote, Celotex, Insulite,",Paragraph
and Presdwood were developed and produced throughout the 20th century and offered,Paragraph
"builders some of the same advantages as plywood, namely, perfect uniformity of size and",Paragraph
"strength, extreme economy, and tremendous structural efficiency. Because these products",Paragraph
"had limited insulating quality—and also because they were cheap, easy to produce, and",Paragraph
manufactured from agricultural or lumber waste products—they were in extremely high,Paragraph
demand during World War II. As the Masonite Man boasted in a wartime advertisement:,Paragraph
"Many a U.S. fighting man, from the north pole to the tropics, lives and works in",Paragraph
"a Quonset Hut, lined entirely with Masonite Presdwood. The entire lining for a",Paragraph
Hut is shipped easily in one compact crate...painted and ready to install. These,Paragraph
Masonite Presdwood walls resist both the frigid blasts of the Arctic and the,Paragraph
"heat, humidity and insects of the equator.",Paragraph
Another product that achieved popularity and importance in the 20th century was the,Paragraph
"“glue-lam” timber. The first recorded use of glued laminated arches was in Basel,",Paragraph
"Switzerland, in 1893. In 1901 the first patent was awarded to Otto Hetzer of Weimar,",Paragraph
"Germany. Thereafter, glued laminated arches were known in Europe as the Hetzer",Paragraph
"construction method. In the United States, the first glued laminated timbers were",Paragraph
"manufactured by Max C. Hanisch, Sr., a German immigrant and the founder of the Unit",Paragraph
"Structures Corporation of Peshtigo, Wisconsin, in 1934. The principle of the glue-",Paragraph
laminated beam was probably first employed by Bronze Age fletchers who manufactured,Paragraph
bows of extreme flexibility and power by gluing thin strips of animal horn together. In,Paragraph
"the case of the glue-lam timber, however, scientists in the 20th century developed",Paragraph
"efficient ways to laminate small, dry boards together to create, in theory, infinitely long,",Paragraph
deep timbers of uniform cross section and stable composition. Gluelam timbers could,Paragraph
"also be bent into any shape, increasing the variety of architectural effects that could be",Paragraph
achieved.,Paragraph
"In the past several decades, numerous variations on these two themes have been",Paragraph
"developed in an effort to reduce costs, preserve timber, increase efficiency, and raise",Paragraph
"profits. Oriented strand board, Para-lam timbers, pre-primed plywood siding, and",Caption
"trussjoists, to list just four among hundreds of brand-new products, utilize super-strong",Paragraph
"new waterproof adhesives and small, thin, dry boards or even mill scraps. The advantage",Paragraph
"of all this innovation has been constantly increasing speed of construction, vastly",Paragraph
"increased efficiency in the use of diminishing timber resources, ever lighter-weight",Paragraph
"structures, and lower building costs. The drawback to all these new products is greater",Paragraph
"fire hazard, slimmer margins of engineering safety, shorter life spans, and a reliance on",Paragraph
an increasing number of synthetic glues and preservative chemicals.,Paragraph
"Throughout the 20th century, but particularly after World War Ll, many nations and",Paragraph
"regions began to export formerly untapped timber resources, and many developing",Paragraph
nations established strong new wood-manufacturing industries. Increased trade in the,Paragraph
20th century had two major effects: the largest Western economies were benefited from,Paragraph
"the increased availability of foreign wood species, were formerly tiny, insular economies",Paragraph
"were being affected by international trends in construction, timber harvesting, and",Paragraph
manufacturing.,Paragraph
The international timber trade is at least as old as recorded history. In biblical times the,Paragraph
ceiling of Solomon’s temple was reputedly framed of cedar beams imported from,Paragraph
"Lebanon. During the Middle Ages, most of the highest-quality oak boards used in",Paragraph
England for doors and furniture were brought by ship from the Baltic. One result of,Paragraph
"growing trade in the 20th century, however, was the availability of larger and",Paragraph
comparatively less expensive quantities of foreign timber than ever before. The species,Paragraph
"might be exotic, such as teak from Myanmar or mahogany from Brazil, valued by",Paragraph
"shipbuilders, cabinetmakers, and other specialty secondary industries, or they might",Paragraph
"simply be inexpensive softwood for framing, such as the huge quantities of fir, spruce,",Paragraph
"hemlock, and pine pouring onto the world market from Canada, Russia, and other Baltic",Paragraph
"countries. Naturally, this increased trade was largely a result of rising demand. Annual",Paragraph
world demand for all types of wood is expected to rise in 2010 to approximately 2.7,Paragraph
"billion cubic meters, according to the United Nations. This is approximately 15 percent",Paragraph
higher than the world’s production capacity in 1997.,Paragraph
Increased international trade also increased pressure in many markets to standardize or,Paragraph
"to adopt new techniques. In Japan, for example, where carpentry is a ferociously",Paragraph
"defended traditional craft, pressures were mounting to incorporate Westernstyle framing",Paragraph
because of its low cost and its efficient earthquake resistance. This was contrary both to,Paragraph
"popular opinion in Japan, where traditionally framed structures are believed to flex and",Paragraph
"bend with earth tremors, and to carpenters’ preferred methods of work. Nevertheless, the",Paragraph
effectiveness of Western-style framing was demonstrated during the Kobe earthquake of,Paragraph
"1995. Following the terrible devastation, engineers in Japan noted that modern American-",Paragraph
"style plywood boxes had proven quite durable, whereas many traditionally framed",Paragraph
"postwar buildings had performed poorly. American-style platform framing, however,",Paragraph
"relies on standardized kiln-dried lumber and plywood, which American lumber",Paragraph
companies are eager to begin exporting to Japan in larger quantities. Japanese carpenters,Paragraph
"and lumber companies, on the other hand, would much prefer to import select American",Paragraph
"logs and process the lumber themselves, thereby preserving jobs and, they believe,",Paragraph
increasing quality. The serious consideration in Japan of the adoption of Western-style,Paragraph
"framing, Western lumber dimensions, and offshore labor exemplifies the power of",Paragraph
international trends to change even the most entrenched traditional local uses of wood in,Paragraph
construction. Such shifts have occurred throughout the world.,Paragraph
Probably the most interesting—and misleading—force that influenced wood’s use in,Paragraph
"the 20th century was the fluctuating popularity of many different fads, trends, styles, and",Paragraph
practitioners of architecture. These influences are difficult to disentangle from,Paragraph
"simultaneous technological, economic, and political changes and indeed were usually",Paragraph
precipitated by the more powerful shifts of the world at large.,Paragraph
One of the most notable shifts of the early 20th century was a worldwide move away,Paragraph
"from romantic, historicizing styles of building to the International Style. In the United",Paragraph
"States, this meant that Richardsonian Romanesque, Neoclassical, Craftsman, Edwardian,",Paragraph
"Art Nouveau, and a host of other styles of building were slowly overcome by the",Paragraph
machinery of the building itself. This shift was not merely stylistic. As Henry-Russell,Paragraph
"Hitchcock noted as early as 1928, “Indeed a client, while he may ask for a Tudor or a",Paragraph
"Georgian or even a Maya design, is unlikely to permit any serious sacrifice of /e comfort",Paragraph
"moderne to the exigencies of a past style” (Hitchcock, 1928).",Paragraph
"In retrospect, it was inevitable that as the building became filled with more and more",Paragraph
"lighting, heating, cooling, communication, and transportation equipment, not to mention",Paragraph
"a strong new steel skeleton, it would divide into at least three parts: guts, bones, and skin.",Paragraph
"The inconsistency of having fresh, young, vigorous guts and bones sealed in a leathery",Paragraph
old skin from a previous millennium slowly became more objectionable until advocates,Paragraph
"of the International Style proposed a solution: the entire building ought to be a new, up-",Paragraph
to-date machine for living.,Paragraph
"Naturally, this shift had a powerful influence on how wood was used in architecture.",Paragraph
"Where the Greene brothers, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, and Victor Horta glorified the",Paragraph
"skill of the craftsman, the physical beauty of architectural materials, and the expense and",Paragraph
"complexity of fabricating architecture, the International Style celebrated the economy,",Paragraph
"simplicity, and directness of mass-produced materials and components. Metals, glass,",Paragraph
"concrete, plastics, and rubber became the preferred palette of leading architects from the",Paragraph
"1930s on. Wood was acceptable if it was served up in flat, straight, square, uniform,",Paragraph
"repetitive chunks—in other words, if it imitated the stripped-down, mass-produced",Paragraph
aesthetic of the other parts of the machine. Frank Lloyd Wright expressed the disgust that,Paragraph
many modern architects felt toward traditional wooden embellishments very clearly when,Paragraph
he wrote:,Paragraph
"Wood, therefore, has more human outrage done upon it than man has ever done,",Paragraph
"even upon himself.... In his search for novelty, wood in his hands has been",Paragraph
"joined and glued, braced and screwed, boxed and nailed, turned and tortured,",Paragraph
"scroll sawed, beaded, fluted, suitably furbelowed and flounced at the carpenter’s",Paragraph
party—enough to please even him. By the aid of “modern” machines the,Paragraph
"carpenter-artist got it into Eastlake composites of trim and furniture, into",Paragraph
Usonian jigger porches and corner-towers eventuating into candle snuffer,Paragraph
domes or what would you have?; got it all over Queen Anne houses outside and,Paragraph
inside—the triumph of his industrial ingenuity—until carpentry and millwork,Paragraph
"became synonymous with butchery and botchwork. (Wright, 1928)",Paragraph
"According to Wright, the machine itself was not to blame—it could easily produce the",Paragraph
"smooth, rectangular, geometrically pure pieces that he and many other modernists desired",Paragraph
"and put to use in Wright’s Prairie-style houses and many other buildings. Naturally,",Paragraph
"therefore, the scientific and technological advances in the use of wood during the early",Paragraph
"20th century appealed to modern architects, and they made excellent use of new materials",Paragraph
and techniques.,Paragraph
"What is not obvious, perhaps even to the architects and critics of the Modern",Paragraph
"movement themselves, is that some of the bestknown and most contentious commentators",Paragraph
"of the 20th century were merely running a few steps ahead of the pack, ten moist fingers",Paragraph
to the wind. Far more influential—and ultimately irresistible in its power—was the tide,Paragraph
of economics and technology that swept everything architectural in its wake. Rising labor,Paragraph
"costs, decreasing quality of timber resources, sudden enormous wartime demands, the",Paragraph
"growth and monopolization of wood industries, and, most important, the growing",Paragraph
dominance of mechanical systems have been far more influential than any style or,Paragraph
architect despite what some might say about Alvar Aalto’s plywood chairs or Tadao,Paragraph
"Ando’s rustic wall treatments. According to Kenneth Frampton, two-thirds of the total",Paragraph
budget of any large building built in the 1990s is expended on mechanical and electrical,Paragraph
"provisions of one kind or another, from airconditioning to piped information.",Paragraph
"This observation has many implications. First, combined with the fact that most large",Paragraph
"buildings today are framed in steel, it means that high-status architecture utilizes very",Paragraph
little wood and consequently has practically no influence on the lumber industry.,Paragraph
"Custom-furnishings manufacturers provide the entire (small) package of fittings,",Paragraph
"furnishings, trim, and moldings. Wherever possible in their design, they will substitute a",Paragraph
"cheaper synthetic material, such as plastic laminate or metal. Where wood is absolutely",Paragraph
"required, it will usually be a thin veneer over a particleboard backing. Second, because",Paragraph
most “vernacular” structures—everything from tract homes to taco stands—are designed,Paragraph
"with absolute economy and relatively short life expectancies, lumber manufacturers are in",Paragraph
cutthroat competition to produce the cheapest possible structural components—and these,Paragraph
"vernacular wood-framed buildings, designed by builders and engineers, make up nearly",Paragraph
86 percent of all American structures and a growing percentage of new structures,Paragraph
"worldwide. The innovations of the lumber industry, consequently, will rarely reflect the",Paragraph
"stylistic or philosophical attitudes of architects, and because architects have little reason",Paragraph
"to be interested in the lumber industry anyway, only contractors, engineers, and",Paragraph
"environmentalists will be left to argue over how scarce timber resources ought to be used,",Paragraph
"protected, or augmented. In short, wood has moved out of the purview of the most",Paragraph
influential architects.,Paragraph
The main difficulty in an analysis of any topic as broad as the 20th-century use of,Paragraph
wood is to distinguish causes from effects. Scientists and engineers in the 20th century,Paragraph
created marvelous new uses for wood and surprising new ways to reconfigure wood.,Paragraph
Large new supplies of timber came onto the world market from all corners of the world;,Paragraph
"and, most noticeably to those of us who are architects and historians of architecture, there",Paragraph
were extremely novel and exciting new applications for wood devised in the 20th,Paragraph
century. No one who has visited one of Alvar Aalto’s buildings can fail to be impressed,Paragraph
"by his sensitive handling of a material as mundane as birch plywood, and no one who has",Paragraph
stood in a modern church sanctuary vaulted by glue-lam beams can fail to be impressed,Paragraph
"by their warmth, clarity, and dramatic effect. However, wood is rarely a major",Paragraph
"component in high-status architecture. Wood’s flexibility, warmth, beauty, and dynamic",Paragraph
vitality are used by leading architects only as special effects. Instead of being revered as,Paragraph
"the essential, expensive, natural material that it once was, it has become another cheap",Paragraph
mass-produced commodity sold by the truckload to weekend do-it-yourselfers and tract,Paragraph
"home builders. Scientific technology, which facilitated so many exciting changes in",Paragraph
"wood’s use throughout the 20th century, eventually brought forth other materials and",Paragraph
"systems. Those new systems, namely, electrical, plumbing, insulating, heating,",Paragraph
"communication, and transportation, have assumed prominence in construction projects of",Paragraph
"all types, and they, far more than any structural or decorative material, will continue to be",Paragraph
primary architectural influences throughout the 21st century.,Paragraph

"that included a pair of giant towers, surrounded by three smaller buildings: a hotel, the",Paragraph

foundations to heavy steel plates that were bolted into the bedrock. The dirt dug for the,Paragraph

The construction of the twin towers also required engineering ingenuity. The structural,Paragraph

The elevator system was sectionalized into three separate banks. Express elevators,Paragraph
"were designed to reach sky lobbies constructed at various intervals, where passengers",Paragraph
would then board another set of local elevators to reach the intervening floors. The result,Paragraph
was greater efficiency in terms of both the movement of people and the opening up of,Paragraph
more valuable floor space for office rental. The exterior walls were constructed with,Paragraph
"prefabricated panels combining two horizontal windows and three vertical windows,",Paragraph
producing a uniform pattern of fifty-eight 22-inchwide windows spread across each,Paragraph

"WRIGHT, FRANK LLOYD 1867-1959",Title
"Architect and designer, United States",Caption
"Frank Lloyd Wright remains America’s most original, influential, and significant",Paragraph
"architect. His works are more popular today, more than a century after he began his",Paragraph
"practice in 1893 and more than 40 years after his death, than they were at any time during",Paragraph
"his lifetime. During his 72-year career, Wright designed more than 600 built works and",Paragraph
"600 unbuilt projects, employing an astonishing range of forms and methods, yet he",Paragraph
"always described his life’s work as being one singular effort, emphasizing the",Paragraph
fundamental and unchanging ordering principles that consistently determined his work,Paragraph
from beginning to end.,Paragraph
"The first of these fundamental ordering principles, and by far the most important, was",Paragraph
"the primacy of the space of inhabitation, which he called “the space within.” Wright’s",Paragraph
concepts for architectural space evolved first in his designs for interior spaces and were,Paragraph
"only later projected or expressed in the exterior forms. For Wright, the spatial",Paragraph
composition must be determined by the experience of the inhabitants and not by some,Paragraph
preconceived formal order. The second principle was that space is given its essential,Paragraph
character through its construction. Wright believed that the way a space is experienced is,Paragraph
directly related to the way it is constructed and that the architect must work with “the,Paragraph
"nature of materials.” The third principle was that architecture takes place in nature, where",Paragraph
interior and exterior space are woven together to make an integral whole. The,Paragraph
relationship between architecture and the landscape was of fundamental importance to,Paragraph
"Wright, and he believed that the design of a building should start with the ground from",Paragraph
which it was to grow. Wright designed buildings not simply as freestanding forms but as,Paragraph
contributing elements in the larger order of both the landscape and the city.,Paragraph
Wright was raised in a household where the rigorously structured study of natural,Paragraph
"forms, the Unitarian faith, the ideas of American Transcendental philosophy, and the",Paragraph
Froebel kindergarten training methods were all powerfully present. These complementary,Paragraph
systems of thought had in common the belief that the material and spiritual worlds could,Paragraph
not be separated but were in fact one and the same. Emerson had written that “all form is,Paragraph
"an effect of character,” and Wright came to believe that every physical form had spiritual",Paragraph
and moral meaning. Wright’s development as an architect involved the evolution of this,Paragraph
"moral imperative through the search for a more principled relation to historical form, for",Paragraph
"a monumentality appropriate to the young American nation, and for a systematic yet",Paragraph
personal process of architectural design.,Paragraph
"Wright’s education as an architect took place in Chicago from 1888 until 1893, when",Paragraph
"he apprenticed for his mentor, Louis Sullivan. In his public lectures at this time, Sullivan",Paragraph
was calling attention to the absence of an appropriate American architecture but also,Paragraph
warning against efforts to speed its arrival by transplanting European historical styles,Paragraph
"onto the American continent. Rejecting imported Beaux-Arts classicism, Sullivan held",Paragraph
"that any truly organic American architecture would develop only on a regional basis, with",Paragraph
"variations dependent on local climate, landscape, building methods, and materials.",Paragraph
"Wright, who would later fulfill this prophecy of Sullivan’s, assisted Sullivan in his search",Paragraph
"for alternatives to what they believed to be the exhausted European classical tradition,",Paragraph
"analyzing the patterns from Islamic, Oriental, and Celtic sources presented by Owen",Paragraph
Jones in The Grammar of Ornament.,Paragraph
"In 1893, the year Wright started his own practice, he saw the efforts of Sullivan’s",Paragraph
Chicago School style overwhelmed by the classical architecture dictated for the World’s,Paragraph
"Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago. This academic classicism, as defined by the",Paragraph
"Beaux-Arts School in Paris, was canonically uniform, explicitly noncontextual, and",Paragraph
intended to be the same around the world—the first true “International Style.” For,Paragraph
"Wright, it was this universal applicability, as something that had nothing to do with the",Paragraph
"particular character of a place, that would always be unacceptable and that led him to",Paragraph
later oppose International Style modernism as forcefully as he now opposed BeauxArts,Paragraph
classicism.,Paragraph
"Yet, even as Wright attacked the Beaux-Arts as a superficial style, he was directly",Paragraph
"engaging its source, integrating the formal order underlying the architecture of classical",Paragraph
antiquity into his work of the Prairie period (1895-1915). In the first comprehensive,Paragraph
"national publication of his work in 1908, “In the Cause of Architecture,” written when he",Paragraph
"was 40 years old, Wright challenged the academic classicists’ exclusive control over",Paragraph
"historical form. He argued that his designs, with their symmetry, axial planning, and",Paragraph
"hierarchical ordering from earth to sky, but without any classical forms, demonstrated a",Paragraph
more principled manner of relating and remaining true to the architectural forms inherited,Paragraph
from history. Although Wright characterized the appearance of his buildings as radical in,Paragraph
"comparison with the prevalent classicism, he noted that his designs were the result of",Paragraph
reverential yet rigorous analyses of the great architecture of the past.,Paragraph
"While this battle raged in the professional publications, Wright was in fact well on his",Paragraph
"way to winning the war by establishing a truly American architecture, one based on his",Paragraph
"perfection of a particularly American building type, the single-family suburban house. By",Paragraph
"1910, when his designs were first extensively published in Europe, Wright had completed",Paragraph
"more than 150 built works, the vast majority of them houses. The prairie house was first",Paragraph
defined in Wright’s two prototypes published in Ladies’ Home Journal in 1901 and built,Paragraph
"out in the Ward Willits House (1902), the Thomas Hardy House (1905), the Robert Evans",Paragraph
"House (1908), and the Avery Coonley House (1908). The Frederick Robie House (1909)",Caption
"was Wright’s greatest urban residential design, engaging its compressed site to create a",Paragraph
"dynamic sequence of interlocking spaces, culminating in the famous living room and",Paragraph
"dining room, joined by their common ceiling, which passes through the open center of the",Paragraph
"fireplace. The Darwin Martin House (1904), five structures comprising a series of",Caption
"interpenetrating cruciform spaces woven into the landscape, was Wright’s greatest",Paragraph
"suburban residential design, its plan an astonishingly resolved masterpiece of formal",Paragraph
composition and the inhabitation of its exquisitely articulated interior spaces a comforting,Paragraph
yet profoundly meaningful experience.,Paragraph
"In Wright’s prairie house, the solid fireplace mass anchored the center while the space",Paragraph
"opened out in all directions at eye level, the outriding walls and overhanging eaves acting",Paragraph
"to layer the house into the earth, giving the suburban site a geometric order so that the",Paragraph
house and the landscape were inextricably bound to each other. Wright’s prairie houses,Paragraph
combined the formal order of symmetrical planning with the dynamism of,Paragraph
"interpenetrating spaces to produce the open, multifunctioning interiors, integrated with",Paragraph
"surrounding nature, that have since become the most popular characteristic of modern",Paragraph
domestic architecture. Wright’s prairie houses crystallized a uniquely American,Paragraph
"interpretation of the dwelling place, allowing the inhabitant to experience both comfort",Paragraph
"and inspiration, shelter and outlook, freedom and order.",Paragraph
"In addition to the reinvention of the American house, Wright’s Prairie period also",Paragraph
"produced new forms for public architecture. At the time Wright left Sullivan’s office, an",Paragraph
appropriate monumental form for American public architecture had not yet emerged. The,Paragraph
"egacy of the steel-framed office tower, which Wright had received from Sullivan and the",Paragraph
"Chicago School, had proved totally incapable of giving monumental form to the",Paragraph
architecture of the public realm. As a manifestation of the economic determinism of scale,Paragraph
"and massing, the universal planning grid, and the production of uniform interior spaces to",Paragraph
"e “styled” later by tenants, the Chicago frame skyscraper was a projection of private",Paragraph
commercial interests at a scale heretofore given only to public buildings yet without any,Paragraph
of the essential qualities necessary for monumentality.,Paragraph
Wright understood monumentality to originate in the fundamental uniqueness of each,Paragraph
"place, regardless of its scale within the city. This understanding was reflected in Wright’s",Paragraph
work only a year after leaving Sullivan’s office with his project for the Monolithic,Paragraph
"Concrete Bank (1894), a diminutive single-room edifice that nevertheless had the",Paragraph
powerful presence of an Egyptian temple. In his repeatedly revised designs for the All,Paragraph
"Souls Church, later renamed the Abraham Lincoln Center (1897-1905), Wright",Paragraph
transformed the spatial uniformity of Sullivan’s skyscrapers into a monumental form that,Paragraph
precisely articulated on the exterior the diverse functional spaces of the interior.,Paragraph
Wright achieved his fully developed vision of an appropriate monumentality for public,Paragraph
buildings with his design and construction of the Larkin Building (1904) and Unity,Paragraph
"Temple (1906). The plans of these two buildings were simple rectangles, with",Paragraph
"mezzanines surrounding and overlooking a central multistory space, lit by high clerestory",Paragraph
windows and continuous skylights and allowing no views out at eye level. On the exterior,Paragraph
these buildings were closed and solid and possessed a severity of form unlike anything,Paragraph
"else of their time, seeming to relate more to the stark rectilinearity of ancient monuments.",Paragraph
For Wright the monumentality appropriate to American public spaces would inevitably,Paragraph
"take the form of an introverted compound, seen from the outside as a grouping of",Paragraph
powerful independent masses bound together by mutual purpose. Entry occurred between,Paragraph
"these masses, leading to a low, dark, horizontal, rotating movement sequence that",Paragraph
"compressed and then released the occupant into the tall, light, hidden, vertical central",Paragraph
"space. The singularity of the central space, and the manner in which it fused form,",Paragraph
"structure, material, and experience, were profoundly monumental. The entire spatial and",Paragraph
"omamental program for Wright’s public buildings, from plans and massing to furniture",Paragraph
"and carpet patterns, was given order through developments of the square and cube, which",Paragraph
Wright considered to be the most perfect of geometries. Wright intended that his public,Paragraph
"buildings be experienced as sacred spaces, whatever their function, their introspective",Paragraph
interiors flooded from above with transcendent light to create a morally edifying effect,Paragraph
for those inhabiting the public place.,Paragraph
"Wright went through a personal and professional crisis in 1909, closing his Oak Park",Paragraph
"office, abandoning his family, and taking up residence in Italy. There, he and a select",Paragraph
"group of draftsmen prepared drawings for publication by the Wasmuth Company, a",Paragraph
German publishing house that was to issue a set of drawings of Wright’s work in 1910,Paragraph
and a book of photographs of Wright’s built works in 1911 that together were to exercise,Paragraph
"considerable influence in Europe. That year, Wright returned to the United States and",Paragraph
"began construction on his home and studio, called Taliesin (1911), outside Spring Green,",Paragraph
"Wisconsin. Like his favorite of the prairie houses, the Coonley House, Taliesin was",Paragraph
"organized around an exterior garden courtyard, framing but not completely enclosing the",Paragraph
brow of the hill on which it was built. This courtyard house type was developed by,Paragraph
"Wright in response to commissions, such as those for the unbuilt Henry Ford (1909) and",Paragraph
Harold McCormick (1907) Houses and the Aline Barnsdall “Hollyhock” House (1917-—,Caption
"20), built around the brow of Olive Hill in Los Angeles, which called for far larger",Paragraph
compositions than what could be organized within the pyramidal massing of the,Paragraph
prototypical prairie house.,Paragraph
"During this same period, from 1909 to 1920, Wright designed a series of public",Paragraph
"buildings that focused on interior garden courtyards. In contrast to his courtyard houses,",Paragraph
"which were inevitably asymmetrical and informal in plan, these public courtyard",Paragraph
"buildings were rigorously symmetrical, illustrating Wright’s use of symmetry to",Paragraph
"distinguish between the public and the private realms. The Midway Gardens (1913), an",Paragraph
"indoor and outdoor garden for music and dining, is perhaps Wright’s most completely",Paragraph
"resolved total work of art, for here he designed not only the architecture but also the band",Paragraph
"shell, interiors, furniture, dishes, sculpture, decorations, and landscaping. The Imperial",Paragraph
"Hotel (1914-22), a commission that required Wright to live in Japan during its",Paragraph
"construction, was a composition of monumental grandeur, unlike anything else in",Paragraph
Wright’s opus. This massive building was designed by Wright to float on a field of,Paragraph
"structural piers sunk into the unstable soil, an innovative seismic precaution almost",Paragraph
immediately tested when the Imperial Hotel survived the devastating 1923 Tokyo,Paragraph
earthquake.,Paragraph
"Wright engaged new materials with almost every design, yet reinforced concrete",Paragraph
proved to be the most consistently challenging to him. Despite his early success with,Paragraph
"reinforced concrete in Unity Temple, Wright remained critical of concrete’s lack of",Paragraph
inherent order and its ability to be formed into any shape at the whim of the designer;,Paragraph
"unlike all other construction materials, concrete did not exhibit a “nature” that would",Paragraph
"determine its appropriate use. In 1906, the same year that construction began on Unity",Paragraph
"Temple, Wright designed what he later called “the first block house,” developing the",Paragraph
concrete-block system of construction that he would realize 17 years later. The Alice,Paragraph
"Millard House (1923), the John Storer House (1923), the Charles Ennis House (1923),",Paragraph
"and the Samuel Freeman House (1923), all built in Los Angeles, were constructed using",Paragraph
"concrete blocks cast in custom-designed forms. In these houses, Wright succeeded in",Paragraph
"finding a means of expression suitable to reinforced concrete, the modular order imparted",Paragraph
to the concrete blocks giving character to this previously formless material.,Paragraph
"In 1932, during the Great Depression in the United States, Wright was already 65 years",Paragraph
"old, having written his autobiography while building only two houses since 1923. It is",Paragraph
thus understandable that both the American public and the architectural establishment,Paragraph
"assumed that Wright had retired from active practice. However, Wright was already",Paragraph
"laying the foundations for the most remarkable resurgence in architectural history, and he",Paragraph
would go on to construct almost twice as many designs in the next 27 years as he had,Paragraph
built in the preceding 40. Pivotal in this resurgence were the publication of Wright’s,Paragraph
"Autobiography, which brought new clients, and Wright’s opening of the Taliesin",Paragraph
"Fellowship, an apprenticeship school and office housed in the new Drafting Room (1932)",Caption
"addition to Hillside School (1902) at Taliesin, which provided both the architectural and",Paragraph
the farming workforce. The astonishing works that Wright designed in 1934-37,Paragraph
effectively reestablished his dominance of the American architectural profession. With,Paragraph
"their publication in the January 1938 issue of Architectural Forum and Time magazine,",Paragraph
Wright was again hailed as the greatest living architect.,Paragraph
"The Edgar Kaufmann House (1937), called Fallingwater, together with his own winter",Paragraph
"home and studio, Taliesin West (1938), exemplified Wright’s belief that architecture is",Paragraph
"born of its place and thus can never be the product of an “International Style,” as",Paragraph
European modernism was represented in 1932 at the Museum of Modern Art.,Paragraph
"Fallingwater, built above a mountain stream in southwestern Pennsylvania, is Wright’s",Paragraph
"greatest “natural” house, a place where man can truly be at home in nature. Taliesin",Paragraph
"West, built in the desert outside Scottsdale, Arizona, celebrated both the ephemerality of",Paragraph
"life, with its canvas roofs that had to be replaced seasonally, and the permanence of place,",Paragraph
"with its boulders cast into the concrete walls, still showing the carvings of the original",Paragraph
Native American inhabitants of this land-scape.,Paragraph
"The Johnson Wax Building (1939) is Wright’s great “cathedral of work,” with its",Paragraph
innovative thin-shell concrete columns standing in small brass shoes that delicately touch,Paragraph
"the floor of the central top-lit workroom, clad in streamlined brick and lit by tube glass",Caption
"laid up like bricks in clerestories and skylights. Like his own Drafting Room at Taliesin,",Paragraph
"employees work here in a room that feels as if it is in the forest, among the column trees,",Paragraph
in the light filtering down through the skylight leaves. Although dedicated to work and,Paragraph
"not worship, the central room of the Johnson Wax Building illustrates the way in which",Paragraph
Wright celebrated everyday rituals and functions by housing them in sacred spaces. It is,Paragraph
without question one of the greatest spaces in architectural history.,Paragraph
Broadacre City (1934) was Wright’s visionary proposal for a pattern of land,Paragraph
development that sought to establish an ordered pattern of cultivation and inhabitation for,Paragraph
the enormous scale of the Jeffersonian grid while providing every household a place in,Paragraph
"nature. A complete plan for the future expansion of America’s communities, it had",Paragraph
"public, commercial, and religious structures woven into its underlying fabric of single-",Paragraph
"family houses, giving the suburb an appropriate and precise spatial and social order. The",Paragraph
"Herbert Jacobs House (1937) was the first of Wright’s “Usonian” houses, small and",Paragraph
affordable homes for the rapidly growing American middle class that were to be placed,Paragraph
on oneacre sites to form the basic pattern of Broadacre City. In the last 20 years of his,Paragraph
"life, Wright designed hundreds of these Usonian houses for various climates and",Paragraph
"construction types, each one a masterpiece of spatial generosity within remarkably small",Paragraph
"total floor areas. Broadacre City was Wright’s counterproposal to the traditional city, to",Paragraph
"the isolation of agrarian life, and to the sprawling spread of the developer’s speculative",Paragraph
suburb.,Paragraph
"The last ten years of Wright’s life were incredibly productive, with hundreds of",Paragraph
designs emerging from Taliesin for virtually every conceivable building type. Among the,Paragraph
"best of this last period was the Solomon Guggenheim Museum (1943-59), built facing",Paragraph
Central Park in New York City. A glorious expression of the plastic formal possibilities,Paragraph
"of reinforced concrete, the Guggenheim Museum also explored dynamic spatial and",Paragraph
"experiential territory, suspending the art and its spectators in a continuously spiraling",Paragraph
"volume that opens toward the sky. The Beth Sholom Synagogue (1954), with its seating",Paragraph
within a folded concrete base anchored to the earth and its roof a translucent tent scaled,Paragraph
"to the heavens, is a powerful summary of man’s condition as both permanent dweller and",Paragraph
"perpetual wanderer. Finally, the Marin County Civic Center (1957-66), a series of",Paragraph
"horizontal planes bridging between the low hills, although unfinished at his death, is",Paragraph
perhaps Wright’s most brilliant site design.,Paragraph
"Despite the extraordinary public commissions of his last years, it could be argued that",Paragraph
"Wright’s greatest accomplishment remained his designs for hundreds of modest,",Paragraph
"inexpensive, yet spatially rich and experientially powerful Usonian houses. In a",Paragraph
"surprisingly humble definition, Wright had early on stated his belief that architecture was",Paragraph
the background or framework for the daily life that takes place within it. Wright’s system,Paragraph
"of design was measured, scaled, and calibrated precisely by the human body and its",Paragraph
"experience, and although the geometric rigor of Wright’s planning is well known, the",Paragraph
esteem in which he held the concepts of use and comfort is not widely understood. The,Paragraph
intellectual and formal order of Wright’s designs was balanced by the physical and,Paragraph
"spiritual engagement of the inhabitant: For Wright, architecture was understood to be the",Paragraph
shared discipline of principled place making. It could be argued that Wright’s,Paragraph
"achievement was virtually unmatched in the 20th century, which produced a rich",Paragraph
assortment of new architectural forms but few systematic conceptions that link spatial,Paragraph

WU LIANGYONG 1922,Title
"Architect, China",Title
Wu Liangyong was born in 1922 in Nanjing. He received his Bachelor of Architecture,Paragraph
degree from the National Central University in Chongqing in 1944 and completed his,Paragraph
Master of Architecture and Urban Design degree under Eliel Saarinen at Cranbrook,Paragraph
"Academy in Cranbrook, Michigan, in 1949. On his return to China in 1950, he joined the",Paragraph
"faculty of the Department of Architecture at Tsinghua University, a major school in",Paragraph
China for technical and engineering studies.,Paragraph
Wu has been recognized as a leading architectural designer and urban planner in,Paragraph
"China, especially since the 1970s. He played a major role in the replanning and design of",Paragraph
"Tiananmen Square, located in the center of Beijing. Surrounding the square are the",Paragraph
National Congress Hall and the National Museum of History. In 1976 Wu worked with a,Paragraph
team of five senior architects to win the competition for the design of the National,Paragraph
"Library of China. In the projects he has designed, he strives to combine traditional spirit",Paragraph
in architecture with modern construction to create a new form of Chinese contemporary,Paragraph
architecture.,Paragraph
Wu’s most well-known project in urban and architectural preservation is the New,Paragraph
"Courtyard House Complex (1987) at Juer Hutong, located in northeastern Beijing. Facing",Caption
"the challenges of rapid economic growth, the single-story courtyard houses, which were",Paragraph
"the major housing form for the old city of Beijing, had been in danger of disappearing",Paragraph
entirely from the city to make room for high-rise apartments. Wu and his design and,Paragraph
research group selected a typical neighborhood in the eastern district of Beijing as an,Paragraph
experimental project. It bears the main features of a multicourtyard system of housing,Paragraph
with multiple—usually three—stories in the structures to accommodate more residents.,Paragraph
The salvation of this traditional housing form turned out to be a success. The Juer Hutong,Paragraph
project won the World Habitat Award from the United Nations in 1993 and the Gold,Paragraph
Medal in Architecture from the Architects’ Regional Council in 1992.,Paragraph
"Wu worked as a designer and planner for several cities in China: Beijing, Handan,",Paragraph

Jiuquan in the west; and Suzhou and Wuxi in the east. Zhangjiagang is a newly planned,Paragraph

planning; he is on the committee for capital planning as a consultant for the municipal,Paragraph
"government, helping in the strategic planning of the city. He vation for the city. also",Paragraph
participates in policy making and research on historic preser,Paragraph
"As an educator in architecture, Wu led the School of Architecture at Tsinghua",Paragraph
University as the dean from 1977 to 1983. He was invited by the eminent architectural,Paragraph
scholar Liang Sicheng to participate in the founding of the school in 1946. Wu has since,Paragraph
then been one of the school’s most influential professors. He has formed two research,Paragraph
centers at Tsinghua: the Institute of Architecture and Urban Studies and the Center for,Title
Human Settlements. He serves as the director of both; many design and research projects,Paragraph
were completed by the centers under his directorship. The Institute of Confucianism in,Paragraph
"Qufu, Confucius’s hometown, is one of the most recent projects that they have",Paragraph
completed.,Paragraph
Wu’s teaching covers studio instruction and lectures on theory and history of cities.,Paragraph
His 4 Brief History of Ancient Chinese City Planning (1986) is the first English-language,Paragraph
book on the topic ever published by a scholar of mainland China. Wu used this book as a,Paragraph
"main reference when he taught at Gesamthochschule in Kassel, Germany. His teaching",Paragraph
extended to the seminar courses in Beijing for mayors. Wu was awarded the Jean,Paragraph
Tschumi Prize by the UIA (Union Internationate des Architect) in 1996 for his renowned,Paragraph
contributions in architectural education.,Paragraph
A Theory of integral Architecture (2001) advanced Wu’s ideas in China for dealing,Paragraph
with design issues in a global perspective. His book A General Theory of Architecture,Paragraph
"(1990, Beijing; 1992, Taipei) discusses human settlements, world urbanism, China’s",Paragraph
"responses to the challenges of environmental changes, and architectural regionalism,",Paragraph
among many other topics. Wu proposes that architectural studies in China should employ,Paragraph
“holistic thinking” and “cross-disciplinary research.” In that sense architectural and urban,Paragraph
studies in China should be combined closely in a system but should remain general:,Paragraph
"architecture and its humanistic presence of time and space, architecture and its",Paragraph
"geographical presence of time and space, architecture as the presence of culture and",Paragraph
"tradition, technical essence in architecture, and finally, architecture as a cultural",Paragraph
"expression for its aesthetic forms. Wu uses diagrammatic charts to illustrate his theory,",Paragraph
and he concludes that the general theory is a new subject that he calls a “science o,Paragraph
human settlement.” He further distinguishes his theory as a “new regionalism.”,Paragraph
China opened the door to the world after the Cultural Revolution that took place,Paragraph
"between 1966 and 1976, and it resumed its international connections to the architectural!",Paragraph
world in the mid-1970s. Wu has performed a major role in representing China’s,Paragraph
architectural professionals in world organizations and conferences. In addition to his busy,Paragraph
"schedule as visiting professor and research fellow in the United States and Europe, he",Paragraph

"WURSTER, WILLIAM 1895-1973",Title
"Architect, United States",Title
William Wurster was a chief exponent of the “Bay Region School” of architecture in,Paragraph
the United States. His development as an architect coincided with the years of the Great,Paragraph

"Hamilton Harris, and O’Neil Ford, exemplified a form of rooted and indigenous",Paragraph
modernism that flourished in the United States before the internationalist orientation of,Paragraph
"the 1950s. Wurster and his contemporaries believed that architecture, whether designed",Paragraph
"for the Northwest, the Pacific coast, or the Southwest, should visibly express the identity",Paragraph
of a region.,Paragraph
"Between 1913 and 1918, Wurster visited works by well-known Bay Region architects,",Paragraph
"among them Bernard Maybeck,",Paragraph
"Saxon Pope House, Orinda, California (1940)",Caption
Ezra Stoller © Esto,Title
"Emest Coxhead, and Willis Polk. Wurster especially appreciated Maybeck’s Christian",Paragraph
"Science Church, which synthesized BeauxArts ornamental exuberance with experimental",Paragraph
"building techniques and the Arts and Crafts ideals of simplicity, authenticity, and",Paragraph
naturalism. Wurster traveled to Paris in 1922 and from there departed on sketching tours,Paragraph
throughout Europe during 1922-23. Italy and Spain were key destinations: Their,Paragraph
vernacular traditions and rural landscapes held significance for California. After his,Paragraph
return William Adams Delano assisted Wurster with the financing of his own office in,Paragraph
Berkeley in 1924 and with introductions to some of Wurster’s most important early,Paragraph
clients.,Paragraph
Wurster launched his career with the Gregory Farmhouse (1927-28) near Santa Cruz.,Paragraph
"Designed for Mrs. Warren (Sadie) Gregory, whom Wurster met through a friend of",Paragraph
"Delano’s, the Farmhouse was widely published and functioned as a clear visual statement",Paragraph
"of Wurster’s architectural principles. First, both Wurster and his client envisioned an",Paragraph
"architectural character of crafted simplicity and calculated understatement. Wurster, who",Paragraph
was committed to the “cleanliness” of wood carpentry and inspired by the vernacular,Paragraph
"structures in California’s gold-mining towns and early Monterey, conceived and detailed",Paragraph
a composition that was both ranchlike and modern yet conscientiously devoid of any,Paragraph
"particular style. Finally, Wurster devised numerous strategies for integrating the house",Paragraph
"with its country setting. Each individual room, for instance, opened onto a corredor, or",Paragraph
"terrace, some of which served as “outdoor rooms,” and the house’s L-shaped plan framed",Paragraph
"a central courtyard, recalling at once European manor houses, Italian villas, and the",Paragraph
Spanish-influenced adobe houses of old Monterey.,Paragraph
"During the years following the Gregory commission, Wurster continued to refine his",Paragraph
"modern regionalist approach. In the early 1930s he designed 13 houses for Pasatiempo, a",Paragraph
"country club and residential community near Monterey Bay, among them the",Paragraph
"MacKenzie-Field House (1931). Wurster’s Pasatiempo houses, which he viewed as",Paragraph

"vernacular-inspired architectural vocabulary, simple yet refined techniques of wood",Paragraph
"construction, integration of indoor and outdoor spaces, and sensitivity to the natural",Paragraph
"surroundings. The Voss House (1931) in the countryside of Big Sur, with a profile",Paragraph
"embedded in the landscape, kitchen “cave,” and direct confrontation of the ocean vista,",Paragraph
epitomized Wurster’s search for a modern architecture that embodied the California,Paragraph
yearning for the simple yet “good” life in the open.,Paragraph
By the mid-1930s Wurster’s practice was well established. As his regionalist,Paragraph
"sensibility matured, his houses also became more consistently modernist and abstract.",Paragraph
"Wurster’s Clark House (1937) in Aptos, which had cubic volumes and flush planar",Paragraph
"surfaces, and his Saxton Pope House (1940) in Orinda, with powerful geometries and",Paragraph
"construction in concrete block and corrugated steel, exemplified his new, starker",Paragraph
"approach. These houses suggested a greater affinity with the European avant-garde, at the",Paragraph
"time promoted by the Museum of Modern Art as the “International Style.” Wurster,",Paragraph
"however, argued that “modern” was a point of view and not a style. In 1937 Wurster",Paragraph
"made his second European journey, with the objective of seeing the modern architecture",Paragraph
"of Scandinavia and, in particular, the work of Alvar Aalto. Wurster valued Aalto’s",Paragraph
"“humanist” approach; that is, his integration of architecture with the natural surroundings",Paragraph
and his attention to vernacular resources and to the sensuality of craftsmanship in wood.,Paragraph
"After Wurster discovered Aalto’s own house on the outskirts of Helsinki, the two",Paragraph
"architects visited Aalto’s Savoy Restaurant, Sunila Pulp Mill, and Paimio Sanatorium;",Paragraph
they discussed their shared philosophical viewpoints and established a friendship that,Paragraph
lasted throughout their lives.,Paragraph
"During the 1930s, Wurster became increasingly involved with the problem of low-cost",Paragraph
"housing. His designs for individual minimum dwellings, such as his “Unit Steel",Paragraph
"House” (1937) for the Soule Steel Company, along with housing communities such as",Paragraph

"YAAMA MOSQUE, TAHOUA, NIGER",Caption
"Designed by Falké Barmou, completed 1982",Caption
"The Yaama Mosque is a mud-brick building, but it is one that is strikingly different",Paragraph
from the Dyula-type mosques found in Mali. This is an example of a building built in a,Paragraph
"local style but whose growth over time shows a desire for monumentality in size, form,",Paragraph
and the complexity of its decoration. It also emphasizes that there can be monuments,Paragraph
within a vernacular style of architecture.,Paragraph
"A mud-brick and tamped-earth building, the mosque was designed by mason and",Paragraph
"farmer Falké Barmou in a semidesert region of Niger. Twenty years in the making, this",Paragraph
Friday mosque was completed in 1982. The client and the construction team was the,Paragraph
community of Yaama.,Paragraph
"The mosque is squarish in plan. The initial building was a hypostyle hall, a field of",Paragraph
closely spaced heavy columns whose visual weight lends the building’s interior a somber,Paragraph
air. The building was initially roofed with a simple post-and-lintel system. In 1975,Paragraph
Barmou took advantage of the need to fix a leaking roof to replace the ceiling with a,Paragraph
livelier vaulted system. Barmou had traveled to Dakar and to Mecca and thus was,Paragraph
"exposed to, and incorporated into his work, many building techniques.",Paragraph
"Frequently referred to simply as “Hausa,” Labelle Prussin feels that a more accurate",Paragraph
term is “Fulani-Hausa.” Her term acknowledges the dual influences of the nomadic,Paragraph
"Fulani, a Fulbe-speaking people who migrated into the region, which today lies in",Paragraph
northern Nigeria and Niger. The Hausa were the sedentary people native to the area.,Paragraph
"Barmou used one of the most significant features of Hausa architecture: arches, vaults,",Paragraph
and domes made of bundled and bent reeds covered with a mud-and-straw mortar. On top,Caption
"of these groin vaults, sticks are laid in a basket-weave pattern. When he replaced the roof,",Paragraph
Barmou also removed a central column that created a central space over which he added,Paragraph
a dome. This imposition of a central dome into the hypostyle hall shows the,Paragraph
interconnectedness of mosque architecture with multidomed Byzantine Christian,Paragraph
"churches, such as St. Mark’s in Venice.",Paragraph
This vaulted-and-domed construction system demonstrates the continuity into a,Paragraph
permanent kind of architecture of tech niques derived from less-exalted kinds of,Paragraph
"architecture, such as tents and straw huts. With temporary structures a material (fabric,",Paragraph
"hides, or straw) is laid over a framework. Prussin writes, “The Fulani-Hausa dome can be",Paragraph
construed as a visual synthesis of several contradictory aspirations into a unified image:,Paragraph
"mobility, identity with Islam, and sedentarization” (Prussin, 1986).",Paragraph
The largest element in the project is the hypostyle prayer hall. As is customary with,Paragraph
"mosques, a mihrab, or prayer niche, occupies the middle of the gibla wall (gibla denotes",Paragraph
"the direction toward Mecca). As there is a central row of columns, in the Yaama Mosque",Paragraph
the mihrab is slightly off center so that it lies at the end of a visual axis. A low perimeter,Paragraph
wall creates an enclosed compound that can be used as an overflow area for prayers.,Paragraph
"Some mosques (e.g. Djenné and Niono) are rectangular in plan, and the entry is in the",Paragraph
center of one of the long sides. This allows rows of worshipers to extend laterally as far,Paragraph
"as possible. Other mosques are square in plan, something that Prussin argues relates to",Paragraph
the Islamic magic square. The magic square is an arrangement of numbers in a graphic,Paragraph
pattern found in a variety of Islamic arts. A typical example is a three-by-three nine-,Paragraph
house square. Both the overall plan of Yaama and the square-based dome are similar in,Paragraph
form to the Islamic magic square.,Paragraph
The roof is made of bundles of sticks that are visible on the interior although skim,Paragraph
"coated with mud on the exterior. This kind of architecture, built of local materials and",Paragraph
"using local craftsmen, was sustainable before the term sustainability achieved its current",Paragraph
popularity. This building was literally built by the community.,Paragraph
"There are four corner towers, all different in form. The towers are divided into vertical",Paragraph
zones with setbacks. An initial simplicity has been augmented over time by an increasing,Paragraph
"desire to add detail and monumentality, particularly considering the towers. Over time,",Paragraph
there has been an increasing concern for aesthetics and decoration.,Paragraph
"None of the four towers, however, functions as a minaret. A minaret, the tower from",Paragraph
"which worshipers are called to prayer, is not an essential part of a mosque. Minarets are",Paragraph
frequently significant vertical elements in the design of Ottoman and Middle Eastern,Paragraph
mosques.,Paragraph
The selection of the Yaama Mosque for an Aga Khan Award in 1986 provoked a,Paragraph
"controversy within the Islamic architectural community. One of six winners, it was",Paragraph
"controversial, but not because of any perceived failings of this particular mosque. By",Paragraph
"excluding projects such as airports and skyscrapers, dissenting members of the judging",Paragraph

ZONNESTRAAL SANATORIUM 1926-31,Title
"Hilversum, Netherlands",Title
Thought to be a symbol of the solidarity of the Dutch workingclass movement at the,Paragraph
"turn of the century, the Zonnestraal Sana-torium in Hilversum is considered one of the",Paragraph
most complex and influential buildings of its time. Deemed one of the major works by its,Paragraph
"designer, Johannes (Jan) Duiker (1890-1935), the Sanatorium has long been associated",Paragraph
with the Modern architectural movement in the Netherlands.,Paragraph
"An independent and innovative architect, Duiker studied at Delft University of",Paragraph
"Technology with Bernhard Bijvoet (1889-1979), with whom he later became partners.",Paragraph
"Together they worked in the office of their former professor, Henri Evers, architect of the",Paragraph
"Rotterdam City Hall. Much of Duiker’s early influence can be attributed to Evers,",Paragraph
"Hendrik Petrus Berlage and the Amsterdam School, and the American architect Frank",Paragraph
Lloyd Wright. Duiker garnered later influence from the developing International Style,Paragraph
and the Nieuwe Bouwen movement while employing new building materials and,Paragraph
methods in the integration of architecture and science. It is believed that Duiker was also,Paragraph
"somewhat influenced by the De Stijl movement; however, he was more a proponent of",Paragraph
the “nonaesthetic” Modern architecture and not the movement’s “decorative facade,Paragraph
"architecture,” feeling that it only concealed inferior floor plans. As a result, he became",Paragraph
"the movement’s principal antagonist, further illustrated by his lack of exposure in their",Paragraph
"periodical, choosing rather to subscribe to the philosophies of the functionalist De 8, later",Paragraph
known as the De 8 and Opbouw group.,Paragraph
"Choosing functionality over aesthetic appearances, Duiker produced his own",Paragraph
"functionalist idiom, which became stronger and more expressive as his design philosophy",Paragraph
developed. His quest for an ideal structural form created a dichotomy between simplistic,Paragraph
and complex avant-garde architecture that was influential enough to have inspired,Paragraph
"Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s Tuberculosis Sanatorium (1929-33) at Paimio, Finland.",Caption
Duiker’s unfortunate early death at the age of 45 meant that his design repertoire was not,Paragraph
as extensive as that of his peers. This and the demolition of much of what he did design,Paragraph
"are perhaps the reasons for his apparent international obscurity. As a result, his remaining",Paragraph
architecture has suffered from indifference and neglect.,Paragraph
"After winning the competition for elderly housing in Alkmaar (1917), the socially",Paragraph
conscious Duiker and Bijvoet desired to improve the quality of lower-income health,Paragraph
"facility construction. Through associations with Berlage, Duiker and Bijvoet were",Paragraph
retained by the Koperen Stelen Fonds (KSF) foundation—a group of diamond workers,Paragraph
organized in 1905 whose motto was “renewed vitality’—to design a convalescent facility,Paragraph
for their tuberculosis-infected colleagues. Through fund-raising efforts by the foundation,Paragraph
"and by Delft professor Henri ter Meulen, in 1919 the KSF purchased the Pampahoeve, a",Paragraph
"country estate west of Hilversum. Designs were temporarily postponed, however, after",Paragraph
the diamond industry collapse in 1920.,Paragraph
"Duiker, collaborating with structural engineer Jan Gerko Wiebenga, utilized the newest",Paragraph
"structural technology, creating a cantilever system that produced a buoyant and",Paragraph
"rhythmically tectonic architecture. Resting on concrete blocks, the skeletal structure of",Paragraph
the buildings consists of a three-meter (ten-foot) grid with structural columns every nine,Paragraph
meters. Concrete was generously used in the floor slabs and the prefabricated paneled,Paragraph
walls that were installed between steel | sections at each floor. Although still in its,Paragraph
"infancy, reinforced concrete and the prefabricated-concrete building systems played a",Paragraph
monumental role in the development of the Sanatorium as well as the rest of Duiker’s,Paragraph
architecture.,Paragraph
"The Zonnestraal Sanatorium consists of three large buildings: the main building, the",Paragraph
"Henri ter Meulen Pavilion, and the Dresselhuys Pavilion, along with various smaller",Paragraph
outbuildings. The main building was begun in 1928 and was used to house the general,Paragraph
facilities of the complex. The functions were grouped together by their practical,Paragraph
"relationships, dividing the boiler house/bathroom, the kitchen, the medical facility, and",Paragraph
the infirmary into four distinct linear sections. The cruciform-shaped upper floor spans,Paragraph
"three of the four lower buildings, creating a unified mass.",Paragraph
"Flanking the main building are two independent pavilions. Also functionally distinct,",Paragraph
each consists of a square central form connecting two long wings that flare out at,Paragraph
different angles to provide maximum sunlight to the southern-exposed patient rooms and,Paragraph
"terraces. The Henri ter Meulen Pavilion was constructed in 1928, along with the skeleton",Paragraph
"of the Dresselhuys Pavilion, completed in 1931. Nowhere in the complex is Duiker’s",Paragraph
"coalescence of structure, form, and space so evident as in the pavilions. Structurally",Paragraph
"identical to the main building, the rhythmic grid system provides the convalescent living",Paragraph
spaces.,Paragraph
"Between the years of 1919 and 1932, many outbuildings were constructed as part of",Paragraph
the complex. Dormitory huts were built in 1929 for patients who were at the end of their,Paragraph
"convalescence, allowing them to transition out of the hospital setting. For economic and",Paragraph
"occupational therapy reasons, the convalescents themselves constructed a number of",Paragraph
"these buildings. Following the trends of the Amsterdam School, the first eight small",Paragraph
"utilitarian buildings, constructed in 1919-20, were timber-floored load-bearing brick",Paragraph
"structures. When construction resumed in 1924, Duiker’s conversion to concrete was",Paragraph
evident.,Paragraph
Most other buildings went unrealized. The most unusual was the Adamas diamond-,Paragraph
"polishing works (1928), designed to prepare the healed convalescents for their return to",Paragraph

"notable feature was the unusual roof, consisting of alternating asymmetrical sawtooth",Paragraph
projections.,Paragraph
"Unfortunately, the Sanatorium’s insufficiently prepared steel framing and structural",Paragraph
"members proved unsuitable for the Dutch climate. After World War II, the complex was",Paragraph
"expanded, but without any regard to Duiker’s original design concept. Along with an",Paragraph
"apparent lack of interest in his architecture, by the 1970s the complex was in serious",Paragraph
"decline. Recently restored, however, it is now listed as a national monument. The",Paragraph

"ZUMTHOR, PETER 1943",Title
"Architect, Switzerland",Title
Switzerland today represents one of the most important centers of modern architectural,Paragraph
"thought and practice, and Peter Zumthor has been among the major architects",Paragraph
representing the country since the 1980s. Zumthor presents in his work not only beautiful,Paragraph
form and masterly construction but the sensitive control of material and space achieved,Paragraph
only by gaining intimate knowledge of all these factors.,Paragraph
"Trained as a cabinetmaker, Zumthor studied design instead of architecture at Basel’s",Paragraph
school of arts and crafts. He has concentrated on adapting the rural form and materials of,Paragraph
"his headquarters, the Swiss canton of Graubuden, and he has built a small but captivating",Paragraph
oeuvre almost exclusively in his adopted home since his arrival there in 1967. Zumthor,Paragraph
has said that he “creates spaces with soul” that become part of the everyday and stand in,Paragraph
"opposition to the “general artificiality of the world” (Peter Zumthor, Works, 1998). He",Paragraph
"argues his case to great effect in all of his projects, including the Sogn Benedegt Chapel,",Paragraph
"a shingled, leaf-shaped church perched high in the misty Surselva Mountains. A",Paragraph
"weathered, earthy, and private place, the form is derived from the lemniscate, an",Paragraph
algebraic figure-8-shaped curve that when proportionately shortened also determines the,Paragraph
section. A delicate band of windows ringing the top of the building ensures steady natural,Paragraph
light. The chapel is an artful combination of rationality and poetry existing in an almost,Paragraph
dreamlike setting. The architect’s atelier in Haldenstein draws on the contrast between,Paragraph
softly finished local wood and brushed steel details to highlight the beauty in each. The,Paragraph
"humble building, though sited in the middle of town, lends no notion to its purpose. The",Paragraph
"modern addition to a traditional farmhouse in Versam, Switzerland, is an example of",Paragraph
"Zumthor’s seamless straddling of old and new, tradition and modernization, and his",Paragraph
dedication to rooting buildings to the landscape. The architect was able to match almost,Paragraph
perfectly the wood of the original building and made a modern addition for a family,Paragraph
without interrupting the spirit of the old house.,Paragraph
The much publicized and much photographed thermal baths in Vals revisit the,Paragraph
importance and sheer pleasure of bathing known in ancient Roman baths. The entire,Paragraph
"structure looks almost prehistoric, as if it emerged from the ground, and is con structed",Paragraph
"entirely of whole slabs of locally quarried, gray gneiss laid one on top of another, to a",Paragraph
"great monolithic effect. The beauty of the spa is awe-inspiring, as is its perfection in plan",Paragraph
"and construction. The sensuality of the color, the water, the sounds echoed in the",Paragraph
chamber of the bath seem all but mathematically engineered by the architect—a stunning,Paragraph
"feat matched by few, if any, other of his projects.",Paragraph
"If the spa at Vals is all subterranean mystery, then Zumthor’s first non-Swiss site, the",Paragraph
"Kunsthaus in Bregenz, Austria, is all light and transparency. Nestled beside a lake, the",Paragraph
glass box of a modern art museum goes from white to blue to glowing yellow during the,Paragraph
course of day to night. The light skin of the building allows but a peek into the frame and,Paragraph
at the silhouettes of the staircases between galleries. The glass panels of the museum’s,Caption
"skin are not perforated and hang on a system of metal brackets held in place by large,",Paragraph
modified clamps. Lighting is controlled by the amount of natural light entering the,Paragraph
building at any given time through the massive glass skin of the structure. The interior,Paragraph
floors and walls of the gallery levels are concrete and uniquely climate controlled by the,Paragraph
circulation of water to the gallery floors and walls from an underground stream.,Paragraph
Zumthor’s plan for the Swiss Pavilion at the Hannover Expo 2000 was meant to echo a,Paragraph
lumberyard in its use of piles of timber in parallel walls and the notion that the lumber,Paragraph
will be sold after the close of the exposition. The multidimensional use of the space,Paragraph
"speaks to all the senses: lines of poetry are projected on the walls, and small troupes of",Paragraph
"dancers and musicians perform in the space, making it a living, beating organism.",Paragraph
The architect has succeeded by trying the “obvious but difficult solutions” first. Those,Paragraph
"solutions make architecture the medium it is: construction, materials, earth and sky,",Paragraph
