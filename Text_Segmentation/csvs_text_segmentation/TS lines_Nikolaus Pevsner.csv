Introduction,Title
Where lie the sources of the twentieth century ? Sources bespeak,Paragraph
"a stream, then a river, and finally, in our particular case, the",Paragraph
ocean of the International Style of the 1930s. Do Prometheus,Caption
and the unknown inventor of the wheel stand by the source as,Paragraph
"the genii fontis? No; because there are breaks, and our civiliza-",Paragraph
tion is not connected with that distant past by a continuous flow.,Paragraph
"But even if we admit that civilizations ‘rise and fall, crumble,",Paragraph
"are extended, Are renewed, destroyed’, even if we keep within",Paragraph
"Western civilization, are the sources of the twentieth century",Paragraph
then the invention of clocks with wheels and weights and of,Paragraph
printing with movable type? They are; for without printing,Paragraph
and clocking-in there could be no twentieth century. Mass,Paragraph
communication and mass production are among the things,Paragraph
"distinguishing ours from all preceding centuries. However, it",Paragraph
is only the quantitative exploitation which belongs exclusively,Paragraph
"to us, not the invention itself. And that is indeed a phenomenon",Paragraph
to rank high in force among the sources of the twentieth century,Paragraph
and therefore of modern art.,Paragraph
The twentieth century is the century of the masses: mass,Paragraph
"education, mass entertainment, mass transport, universities with",Title
"twenty thousand students, comprehensive schools for two",Title
"thousand children, hospitals with two thousand beds, stadia",Caption
with a hundred thousand seats. That is one aspect; the other is,Paragraph
"speed of locomotion, every citizen being an express-train driver",Paragraph
"on his own, and some pilots travelling faster than sound. Both",Paragraph
"are only expressions of the technological fanaticism of the age,",Paragraph
and technology is only an application of science.,Paragraph
"Science, technology, mass locomotion, mass production and",Title
"consumption, mass communication — in the field of the visual",Paragraph
"arts which is our field in this book, that means the predominance",Paragraph
"of architecture and design over the beaux-arts, it means the",Paragraph
7,Title
"predominance of the city over the small town and the country,",Paragraph
and it means the concentration on architecture and design for,Paragraph
the masses and on what new materials and new techniques can,Paragraph
do for them.,Paragraph
"If this is accepted as a diagram of the twentieth century, so far",Paragraph
"as we can observe and analyse it, where do its sources lie then?",Paragraph
We can now endeavour to list and consider them in their order,Paragraph
of time.,Paragraph
CHAPTER ONE,Title
A Style for the Age,Title
"Architecture and design for the masses must be functional, in",Paragraph
the sense that they must be acceptable to all and that their well-,Paragraph
functioning is the primary necessity. A chair can be uncomfort-,Paragraph
"able and a work of art, but only the occasional connoisseur can",Paragraph
be expected to prefer its aesthetic to its utilitarian qualities. The,Paragraph
plea for functionalism is the first of our sources. Augustus,Paragraph
"Welby Northmore Pugin, born in 1812, the English son of a",Paragraph
"French father, wrote on the first page of his most important",Paragraph
book: ‘There should be no features about a building which are,Paragraph
"not necessary for convenience, construction, or propriety . . .",Paragraph
"The smallest detail should . .. serve a purpose, and construction",Paragraph
itself should vary with the material employed.’! That was,Paragraph
"written in 1841, but it was not new then. It is the direct continua-",Paragraph
tion of the principle of French seventeenth and eighteenth,Title
"century rationalism. Architecture, writes Batteaux,? ‘is not a",Paragraph
"spectacle . . . but a service’, and ‘security, fitness, convenience,",Paragraph
propriety’ are all familiar from Cordemoy to Boffrand and the,Paragraph
"younger Blondel. To quote two less familiar passages, neither",Paragraph
"French: Hogarth called the first chapter of his Analysis of Beauty,",Paragraph
"‘Of Fitness’, starting thus: ‘Fitness of the parts to the design for",Paragraph
which every individual thing is form’d . . . is of the greatest,Paragraph
consequence to the beauty of the whole. . . In ship-building the,Paragraph
dimensions of every part are confin’d and regulated by fitness,Paragraph
"for sailing. When a vessel sails well, the sailors call her a beauty;",Paragraph
"the two ideas have such a connection.’3 And the Abbate Lodoli,",Paragraph
"not uninfluenced perhaps by Hogarth, referred in hisstimulating",Paragraph
conversations to the Venetian gondola as a piece of functional,Paragraph
"design, and stipulated that nothing ought to appear ina building",Paragraph
which is not ‘truly fulfilling its function’ or: ‘has not its own,Paragraph
proper function’ and is not ‘an integral part of the fabric’ and,Paragraph
designed in a logical relation to the ‘nature of the material’.,Paragraph
9,Caption
"The fact that Pugin, who caine first in this string of quotations,",Paragraph
called the book which he started with this clarion call The True,Paragraph
"Principles of Pointed or Christian Architecture, the fact that his",Paragraph
principal purpose was not a plea for functionalism but for the,Paragraph
"Gothic Revival as the expression of a Catholic Revival, even",Paragraph
the fact that he argued extremely intelligently the functional,Paragraph
"aspect of the Gothic style, of buttresses, of rib-vaults and so on,",Paragraph
all these facts do not concern us at present. He was read by the,Paragraph
"Gothicists, but he was also read by the Functionalists. For such",Paragraph
existed among the mid-nineteenth century writers and thinkers.,Paragraph
"Gottfried Semper in Germany, with his explanation of the",Paragraph
applied or decorative arts as conditioned by materials and tech-,Paragraph
"niques, was one of them. He had lived in London asa refugee in",Paragraph
"the years 1851-5, and must have been in contact with the small",Paragraph
"group of architects, artists and administrators responsible for",Title
"the preparation, the success and the ruthless criticism of the",Paragraph
"Great Exhibition of 1851: Henry Cole in the first place, Owen",Caption
"Jones, Matthew Digby Wyatt and Richard Redgrave in the",Title
second.,Paragraph
"These men, even before the exhibition, had issued a small",Paragraph
journal called the Journal of Design and Manufactures and in this,Paragraph
"had applied the principles of Pugin, as Semper was going to do",Paragraph
"later, to matters of craft and industrial art. Pugin had objected",Paragraph
"to carpets where one walks ‘upon highly relieved foliage’ ,5 the",Caption
Journal now insisted that carpets should keep to ‘a level or low,Paragraph
"plane’,® that wallpapers should convey ‘the proper impression",Paragraph
"of flatness’? and in a more general way, that ‘the first considera-",Paragraph
tion of the designer should be perfect adaptation to intended,Paragraph
use’ and that every object ‘to afford perfect pleasure must be fit,Paragraph
for the purpose and true in its construction’ .?,Paragraph
"No wonder that these men, when the Crystal Palace had gone",Paragraph
"up and been filled with the proudest products of all nations,",Paragraph
were appalled at the standard of taste displayed. ‘The absence of,Paragraph
"any fixed principle in ornamental design is most apparent,’ they",Paragraph
"wrote, and ‘the taste of the producers is uneducated’.!° No",Paragraph
wonder cither that they admired the Crystal Palace itself.,Paragraph
10,Title
"1 The Crystal Palace, built for the Great Exhibition of 1851 and re-erected",Caption
"at Sydenham in 1853 (above, looking along the roof to the ‘transept’).",Caption
"Joseph Paxton’s building, which was entirely prefabricated, marked the",Paragraph
first major escape from historical styles in architecture,Title
"The Crystal Palace is the mid-nineteenth century touchstone,",Paragraph
if one wishes to discover what belongs wholly to the nineteenth,Paragraph
century and what points forward into the twentieth. The,Paragraph
". Crystal Palace was entirely of iron and glass, it was designed by",Paragraph
"a non-architect, and it was designed for industrial quantity",Paragraph
"production of its parts. It is a source in one sense, but it also had",Paragraph
"its sources, and they take us back once again to the cighteenth",Paragraph
century. The use of iron in architecture starts in France in the,Paragraph
"1780s with Soufflot and Victor Louis, who were especially",Paragraph
"concerned with making theatres fireproof, and in England in",Paragraph
"the 1790s with manufacturers who, acting as their own designers,",Paragraph
attempted to make their factories fireproof. In both cases the,Paragraph
vr,Title
iron was an expedient of high utilitarian but of no aesthetic,Paragraph
"significance. It came into the open, as it were, playfully and only",Paragraph
"internally, in some romantic buildings such as Nash’s Royal",Paragraph
"Pavilion at Brighton in 181 §~20, and seriously and externally in",Paragraph
the great bridges of the same years. The carliest iron bridge was,Paragraph
in fact designed as carly as 1777 — the Coalbrookdale Bridge in,Paragraph
England. It has a span of 100 feet. It was at once surpassed by the,Paragraph
"bridge at Sunderland which in 1793-6 spanned 206 feet, and",Paragraph
"this by James Finley’s Schuylkill Bridge of 1809, with 306 feet.",Paragraph
"The two English bridges had been iron arches, the Schuylkill",Paragraph
"Bridge was a suspension bridge, and the suspension principle",Paragraph
gave us the finest of the carly nineteenth-century bridges such,Paragraph
"2 Coalbrookdale Bridge, Shropshire, 1777-81, the first iron bridge in the",Caption
"world. Its builder, the ironmaster Abraham Darby, was assisted by a minor",Paragraph
"architect, T.F. Pritchard. The bridge crosses the Severn with a span of one",Caption
hundred feet,Title
"3 The Menai Suspension Bridge, linking North Wales with the Isle of",Caption
"Anglesey, was built by Thomas Telford between 1818 and 1826 as part of",Paragraph
"the Holyhead to Chester Road. Telford, the greatest road and canal",Caption
"engineer of the early nineteenth century, had earlier designed a vast single-",Paragraph
span iron bridge of unprecedented boldness (never built) to replace,Paragraph
London Bridge,Title
as Thomas Telford’s Menai Bridge of 1818-26 with a main span,Paragraph
of $79 feet.,Paragraph
Some architects later in the nineteenth century — Matthew,Paragraph
Digby Wyatt among them — were ready to count them among,Paragraph
the finest structures of the century. But they were not the work,Paragraph
"of architects. The architects, as we have seen, had been ready",Paragraph
"to use iron in a minor way, where necessity arose, but otherwisc",Paragraph
at best they only played with it. Now this is what Wyatt wrote,Paragraph
"in 1850-1, apropos the bridges, these ‘wonders of the world’:",Paragraph
‘From such beginnings what glories may be in reserve ... we,Paragraph
"may trust ourselves to dream, but we dare not predict.’'!",Paragraph
This was the year of the Crystal Palace. Pugin called it the ‘glass,Paragraph
"monster’,}2 Ruskin a ‘cucumber frame’,!? but Wyatt wrote",Paragraph
that the building was likely to accelerate the ‘consummation,Paragraph
devoutly to be wished’ and that ‘the novelty of its form and,Paragraph
details . . . will exercise a powerful influence upon national,Paragraph
taste’.14 A little later he even foretold from the union ofiron and,Paragraph
glass ‘a new era in architecture’.15 This was seill in 1851.,Caption

ings whose aesthetic character is determined by iron. Labrouste’s,Paragraph
"has the greater elegance and ornamental restraint, as Labrouste",Paragraph
was indeed doubtless the better architect of the two. That comes,Paragraph
out even more clearly in the exteriors: Bunning’s of an un-,Paragraph
principled jollity which was accepted at the time in England as,Paragraph
belonging to the Free or Mixed Renaissance; Labrouste’s also,Paragraph
"ofthe Renaissance and also a free Renaissance, but treated nobly,",Paragraph
with discipline and cconomy of decoration. And both architects,Paragraph
| hid their display of iron behind solid stone.,Paragraph
"4 Part of the icon-galleried interior of the Coal Exchange in London, by J.B",Caption
Bunning (1846-9). Its demolition in 1962 was one of London’s most serious and,Paragraph
futile recent losses,Title
"Wyatt appreciated Bunning, a greater man appreciated",Paragraph
Labrouste and was guided by him: Emanuel Viollet-le-Duc,Paragraph
"(1814-79). When Labrouste stopped teaching, his pupils",Paragraph
"induced Viollet-le-Duc to take over, and he taught for a short",Paragraph
time. In connection with this he began to deliver his Entretiens,Paragraph
"in 1858, published the first volume in 1863 and the more",Paragraph
important second in 1872. His approach to architecture is the,Paragraph
functionalist’s. He demands the ‘alliance of form with need’ and,Paragraph
with ‘the means of construction’.'®6 He demands truth: that,Paragraph
"‘stone should appear as stone, iron as iron and wood as wood’,!7",Caption
that no ‘monumental appearances should conceal bourgeois,Paragraph
habits’.18 And consequently he insists on the necessity ofa style,Paragraph
"for the nineteenth century. Today, he says, ‘we possess immense",Paragraph
resources provided by industry and ease of transportation.’!9,Caption
Architecture belongs ‘almost as much to science as to art’.20,Caption
Architects must cease to be interested only in whether their,Paragraph
"facades are to be Roman, Gothic or Renaissance. From that",Paragraph
attitude ‘nothing new or living can come’.?! When engineers,Paragraph
invented the locomotive ‘it did not occur to them to imitate the,Paragraph
harness of a stage coach’.2? If architects want to prevent their,Caption
profession from becoming obsolete they must become ‘skilful,Paragraph
"constructors, ready to take advantage of all the resources",Paragraph
"furnished by our society’.?3 And so he arrives at iron, proposes",Paragraph
iron even for ribs in vaults (as Boileau had already shown it in,Paragraph
Paris churches) and even for externally visible framing.,Paragraph
"Bold words indeed, but what were the deeds? Viollet-le-Duc",Paragraph
"was the great restorer of French cathedrals, the great scholar of",Paragraph
Gothic architecture — though admittedly with a keen sense of,Paragraph
"structure. Like Pugin before him, he did not practise what he",Paragraph
preached. His opposite number in England was Sir George,Paragraph
"Gilbert Scott, also a self-confident restorer, also a scholar of",Paragraph
"Gothic architecture of no mean achievement, who could write:",Paragraph
"‘An iron arched bridge may always be made beautiful, and it",Paragraph
would be difficult to make a suspension bridge anything else’ and,Paragraph

more and more — Baroque. Neither the aesthetic possibilities of,Paragraph
defeating the limitation of past styles by means of the new,Paragraph
possibilities of skeletal construction nor the social possibilities,Title
of mass-produced parts were taken seriously by the profession.,Paragraph
The great impetus in the fields of aesthetic and social renewal,Paragraph
came from England and centres in the larger-than-life figure of,Paragraph
"William Morris, poet, pamphleteer, reformer, designer —",Title
"trained a little at university, a little in architecture, a little in",Paragraph
"painting —and ending by being a manufacturer and shopkeeper,",Paragraph
"though a very special one. Morris’s firm was started in 1861, in",Paragraph
"collaboration with his close friends, the architect Philip Webb",Paragraph
"and the painters Ford Madox Brown, Rossetti and Burne-Jones.",Paragraph
"Morris’s theories, as he lived them from when he was twenty-",Paragraph
five and as he expounded them in impetuous lectures from when,Paragraph
"he was over forty, are familiar. They derive from Ruskin who",Paragraph
"had hated the Crystal Palace, had gone out of his way to say",Paragraph
that a railway station could never be architecture and denied,Paragraph
with frantic fanaticism the necessity for his age to search for a,Paragraph
style of its own: ‘A day never passes without our . . . architects,Paragraph
being called upon to be original and to invent a new style... We |,Paragraph
want no new style of architecture . . . It does not matter one,Paragraph
marble splinter whether we have an old or new architecture . . . },Paragraph
The forms of architecture already known to us are good enough,Paragraph
"for us, and far better than any of us’.25 Morris was wiser. He",Paragraph
"refuted the current historicism, the ‘masquerading in other",Paragraph
"people’s cast-off clothes’,26 but he too recommended architects",Paragraph
to ‘study the ancient work directly and to learn to understand,Paragraph
it’.2? He was nota revolutionary; he loved the Middle Ages and,Paragraph
"loved nature and the open country, and he hated the big cities.",Paragraph
"His hatred was visual at first, but turned social almost at once.",Paragraph
"7 The Hall des Machines, built for the Paris Exhibition of 1889. It was primaril",Caption
"the work of engineers, led by V. Contamin, though assisted in the details by th",Paragraph
architect Dutert - a pattern that was to become characteristic in the future,Paragraph
London to him was not only ‘a whole county covered with,Paragraph
"hideous hovels’,?8 but also a ‘beastly congregation of smoke-",Paragraph
dried swindlers and their slaves’.29 The Middle Ages were not,Paragraph
"only pleasing to his eyes, they were also — as they had been to",Paragraph
"Ruskin — right in their social structure, or what he believed to",Paragraph
"have been their social structure. In the Middle Ages, he said,",Paragraph
"art was not ‘divided among great men, lesser men, and little",Paragraph
"men’,?° artists were not, as they are now, ‘highly cultivated",Paragraph
"men whose education enables them, in the contemplation of the",Paragraph
"past glories of the world, to shut out from their view the every-",Paragraph
day squalors that most of men live in’.4! Artists were plain,Paragraph
"workmen, ‘common fellows’ who worked away ‘on the anvil’",Paragraph
or ‘about the oak beam’ with ‘many a grin of pleasure’.32 The,Caption
things which are museum pieces now ‘were common things in,Paragraph
"their own day’.33 And the reason why that was so, is that in the",Paragraph
Middle Ages ‘daily labour was sweetened by the daily creation,Paragraph
of Art’.34 And so Morris arrived at his definition of art as ‘the,Paragraph
expression by man of his pleasure in labour’.35 He arrived art the,Paragraph
demand that art should become this again: ‘a happiness for the,Paragraph
maker and the user.’ For while the average man can have no,Paragraph
"interest in the self-conscious isolated artist, he can enjoy what",Paragraph
the craftsman does for him. So art should be not only ‘by the,Paragraph
"people’ but also ‘for the people’.°¢ ‘I do not want art for a few,",Paragraph
"any more than I want education for a few, or freedom for a",Paragraph
few.’37,Paragraph
It is a strange system of theory to be guided by for a man in,Paragraph
the mid-nineteenth century. It can only be understood as a,Paragraph
demonstration of opposition to the standard and the taste of,Paragraph
design as it was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of London in,Paragraph
"1851, Paris in 1855, London again in 1862 and Paris again in",Paragraph
1867.,Paragraph
"Looking at the goods, especially the domestic goods, illus-",Paragraph
"trated in the catalogues of these exhibitions, one can understand",Paragraph
Morris's outbursts. In the Middle Ages ‘everything which was,Paragraph
"made by man’s hand was more or less beautiful,’ today ‘almost",Paragraph
all wares that are made by civilized man are shabbily and,Paragraph
20,Title
pretentiously ugly.’38 What is offered and sold is ‘hurtful to the,Paragraph
"buyer, more hureful to the seller, if he only knew'.3% Our",Paragraph
"houses are filled with ‘tons upon tons of unutterable rubbish’,",Paragraph
and the only acceptable things are usually in the kitchen.4° The,Paragraph
"reason is that they alone are honest and simple, and ‘the",Paragraph
two virtues most needed in modern life (arc) honesty and,Paragraph
simplicity’.41 Morris maintained that a bonfire ought to have,Paragraph
been made of nine-tenths of all that was in wealthy people’s,Paragraph
houses. 42,Paragraph
Morris in his own day was no doubt right in blaming,Paragraph
"industry. ‘As a condition of life, production by machinery is",Paragraph
"altogether an evil.’43 But if you refuse to accept the machine,",Paragraph
you cannot produce cheaply. What Morris’s firm made was,Paragraph
"bound to be expensive, and could not be ‘for the people’. Nor",Paragraph
was it strictly speaking ‘by the people’; for Morris and his,Paragraph
"friends designed their chintzes and wallpapers, their furniture",Paragraph
"and stained glass, and while it was made, admittedly, by hand",Paragraph
"(though not always), it was not really creative craft. Yet, in spite",Paragraph
"of such inconsistencies, Morris succeeded in what he had set out",Paragraph
to achieve. He made young painters and architects*in all,Paragraph
"countries turn to craft or design; that is, he directed them to-",Paragraph
wards helping people in their everyday lives.,Paragraph
"Why he succeeded, where Henry Cole and his friends had not,",Paragraph
is easily seen. For one thing he practised (up to a point) what he,Paragraph
"preached. He was a fanatical craftsman himself, trying his hand",Paragraph
"at wood-carving and illumination as early as 1856, and furnish-",Paragraph
ing his first rooms in London with Morris-designed and,Paragraph
carpenter-made ‘intensely medieval furniture . . . as firm and as,Paragraph
"heavy as a rock’.44 Two years later he got married, and a year",Paragraph
"after, iri 1860, he moved into Red House, a house at Bexley",Paragraph
"Heath outside London, designed for him by his friend Philip",Caption
Webb and furnished to Webb’s and Morris’s own designs. The,Paragraph
"house was daring in many ways, in exposing its red brick with-",Paragraph
"out a coat of stucco, in planning from inside out, that is, with",Paragraph
"secondary consideration of fagades, and in frankly showing the",Paragraph
construction inside.,Paragraph
Such a detail as the fireplace is of a truly revolutionary,Paragraph
"character, completely devoid of any period allusions and",Paragraph
completely functional in displaying its brick courseshorizontally,Paragraph
where the logs are laid and vertically where the smoke goes up.,Paragraph
It is an exception in its own day and more prophetic of the,Paragraph
coming twentieth century than anything in the field of domestic,Paragraph
design in any country for thirty years to come. Most of the,Paragraph
"firm’s early furniture is much more backward-looking, though",Paragraph
to the simplicity of the cottage and never to the displays of the,Paragraph
"rich man’s house. Yet even among the furniture sold by the firm,",Paragraph
one can find occasional pieces of remarkably independent,Paragraph
design. A chair designed by the Pre-Raphaelite painter Ford,Caption
"Madox Brown about 1860, for instance, though also clearly a",Paragraph
"simple cottage chair, shows originality in the slender elongation",Caption
of the rails of the back.,Paragraph
"Simplicity and directness unite this chair, Webb’s fireplace,",Paragraph
"and the very fine designs in the flat of Morris and his firm, such",Paragraph
as his famous Daisy wallpaper designed in 1862 and Webb’s,Paragraph

which was designed by Philip Webb,Paragraph

and very free in its handling of,Paragraph

originality that looks forward to,Paragraph

10 The firm of Morris and Co. exerted a decisive influence on almost every,Caption
aspect of design and interior decoration; it produced these tiles designed by,Paragraph
"Philip Webb in 1862, for a fireplace in Norman Shaw’s Old Swan House",Caption
"(see Ill, 17)",Paragraph
Swan tiles designed in the same year. It was the absence of,Paragraph
simplicity and directness from the goods one could buy in the,Paragraph
existing shops and stores which led to the creation of the firm.,Paragraph
And there again Morris directed development both as a,Paragraph
craftsman and a designer. When he decided that the firm should,Paragraph
"turn to the printing of textiles, and saw that bad dyeing was",Paragraph
"one of the chief troubles, he learned to dye for himself. And",Paragraph
"later, when the firm turned to tapestry weaving, he spent 516",Paragraph

graphic naturalism of High,Title
"Victorian designs, and produced",Paragraph
flat patterns for flat surfaces,Title
"only grounded in the example of craftsmanship he set, it was",Paragraph
even more due to his genius as a designer. The designs of the,Paragraph
"Cole circle are dry and doctrinaire, Morris’s are brimful of life.",Paragraph
That is one memorable thing about them; the others are these.,Paragraph
His designs are always crisp. There is no ‘slobbering and messing,Paragraph
"about’ in them.4> Secondly, he succeeded better than anyone",Paragraph
before or after him in achieving a balance between nature and,Paragraph
"style, between the flatness recommended for textiles, etc., by",Paragraph
"Pugin and the Cole circle, and the richness and abundance of",Paragraph
flower and leaf as he had studied it so well in his childhood and,Paragraph
"youth. Moreover, his designs — in terms of design, not of",Paragraph
imitation — possess the equivalent of the closeness and density of,Paragraph
nature observed. Finally —and this matters most in our particular,Paragraph
"context — the designs, especially those of before 1876, are not",Paragraph
in any way closely dependent on the past. They may be,Paragraph
inspired to a certain extent by Elizabethan and Jacobean,Paragraph
"embroidery, but they are essentially original.",Paragraph
"An example of Morris’s own design - a chinz (Tulip, 1875) that shows the",Paragraph
liness and crispness of Morris at his best,Paragraph
Just as Morris knew that to re-establish values in the things of,Paragraph
one’s everyday use was a matter of social conscience before it,Paragraph
"could ever become a matter of design, so he also knew — and",Paragraph
in this he proved just as much a prophet — that the revival of,Paragraph
sound architecture must precede the revival of sound design.,Paragraph
"‘Unless you are resolved’, he said in 1880, ‘to have good and",Paragraph
"rational architecture, it is... useless your thinking about art at",Paragraph
"all.’46 ‘The great architect’ of his own day, he knew, lived a life",Paragraph
carefully ‘guarded from the common troubles of common,Paragraph
men’.47 What he was referring to here is the fact that the leading,Paragraph
architects of the nineteenth century spent their lucrative,Paragraph
"working hours designing churches, public buildings and",Paragraph
country houses and villas for the rich. This attitude changed,Paragraph
"only gradually, and it will be one of our tasks in this book to",Paragraph
watch the change. Its first stage is what became known as the,Paragraph
14 Norman Shaw’s country houses may be compared with those of Philip,Caption
"Webb. Banstead, Surrey, of 1884, shows the same sensibly informal",Paragraph

"venience, Webb achieves a design combining sincerity and clegance",Paragraph
"English Domestic Revival, a turn of some architects of Morris’s",Paragraph
"generation to the domestic field, entirely or almost entirely,",Paragraph
and at the same time to a smaller scale and a greater delicacy of,Paragraph
detail.,Paragraph
The two most important names are that of Morris’s friend,Paragraph
Philip Webb and that of Richard Norman Shaw. We have,Paragraph
already met Webb more than once. An carly work of his,Paragraph
maturity is Joldwyns in Surrey of 1873. Its chief merits are a,Paragraph
"combination of boldness and straightforwardness, a refusal to",Paragraph
"do anything for show, and a great faith in local building",Paragraph
"materials. Webb, like Morris, was not a revolutionary. He",Paragraph
loved old building in the country and used its methods and,Paragraph
motifs. He was never afraid of mixing styles and he relished,Paragraph
"unexpected solecisms such as the long chimneys of Joldwyns,",Paragraph
"or the far-projecting five gables in a row at Standen, a house of",Paragraph
1892.,Paragraph
16 Shaw was an almost,Caption

distinguishes him is his,Paragraph

"18 Bedford Park, near London — the first garden suburb. The earliest",Caption
houses of about 1875 were designed in a modest style that has influenced,Paragraph
domestic architecture ever since. Gardens were large and informal; old,Paragraph
trees were kept to give a pleasant rural feeling,Paragraph
There is one more respect in which Shaw’s work concerns us,Paragraph
"here. At Bedford Park, not far from London, though at the",Paragraph
"time still not engulfed in the town, he buile from 1875 the first",Paragraph
"garden suburb ever. The idea was not his, but Jonathan Carr’s",Paragraph

Webb and Shaw had established the middle-class house as the,Paragraph

the aesthetic importance of our closest everyday surroundings.,Paragraph
But neither he nor Webb nor Shaw had felt as strongly about,Paragraph

"Duc had done. It made little difference; for Viollet-le-Duc,",Paragraph

The fact that America now reached this crucial moment is,Paragraph
one of the most memorable facts of the century. The United,Paragraph
States had been colonial in their reaction to European styles.,Paragraph
"They had become provincial, that is, part of a common front",Paragraph
"of progress, but an outlying part. Now all at once they left",Paragraph

job of the office building was here approached with a perfectly,Paragraph
open mind and the functionally best solution found. An un-,Paragraph
traditional building technique offered itself to fulfil the needs of,Paragraph
the job and was at once accepted. And it was now at last,Paragraph
"architects who took the necessary action, and no longer",Paragraph
engineers or other outsiders. Sullivan in particular knew clearly,Paragraph
"what he was doing. In his Ornament in Architecture, an article",Paragraph
"of 1892, he had written: ‘It would be greatly for our aesthetic",Paragraph
"good, if we should refrain entirely from the use of ornament for",Paragraph

only in a few judiciously chosen places. It is a very personal,Paragraph
"feathery foliage ornament, inspired partly by the Morris",Paragraph
"Movement, but much freer, wilder and more entangled. It has",Paragraph
"been called Art Nouveau or Proto-Art Nouveau, and whether",Paragraph
such a term is justifiable cannot be decided until Art Nouveau,Paragraph
has been closely examined.,Paragraph

"Ornament in architecture had a special importance for Sullivan, and his own, with",Paragraph

This is in fact our task now; for Art Nouveau was the other,Paragraph
campaign to drive out historicism. Thisisits primary significance,Paragraph
"in European design and architecture, whatever other delights",Paragraph
and aberrations it may harbour. Among the sources of modern,Paragraph
architecture and design it is still the most controversial. Today’s,Paragraph
architecture and design having taken a turn away from,Paragraph
"rationalism and towards fancy, Art Nouveau has suddenly",Paragraph
"become topical, and the very qualities of it which in this",Paragraph

Books and exhibitions have vied with each other to present its,Paragraph

CHAPTER TWO,Title
Art Nouveau,Title
The term Art Nouveau comes from S. Bing’s shop in Paris,Paragraph
"opened late in 1895, the corresponding German term Jugendstil",Paragraph
from a journal which began to appear in 1896. But the style is,Paragraph
older. Traditionally it is supposed to have started fully mature,Paragraph
"in Victor Horta’s house, no. 6 rue Paul-Emile Janson in Brussels,",Caption
and that house was designed in 1892 and built in 1893. But it,Paragraph
marks no more than the transfer of the style from the small to,Paragraph
a larger scale and from design to architecture.,Paragraph
The incunabula of Art Nouveau belong to the years 1883-8.,Paragraph
"They are the following. Arthur H. Mackmurdo, wealthy",Paragraph
"young architect and designer, in 1883 wrote a book on Sir",Paragraph
Christopher Wren’s churches in the City of London — not a,Paragraph
subject that seems to call for Art Nouveau — and gave it a title-,Paragraph
page fully Art Nouveau. What justifies this statement? The,Paragraph
"area inside the frame is filled by a non-repcating, asymmetrical",Paragraph
"pattern of tulips, stylized vigorously into flaming shapes. To",Paragraph
the left and right sharply cut short by the frame are two,Paragraph
"cockerels, pulled out to an excessive thinness and length. The",Paragraph
characteristics which we shall see recur whenever we speak of,Paragraph
Art Nouveau are the asymmetrical flaming shape derived from,Paragraph
"nature, and handled with a certain wilfulness or bravado, and",Paragraph
the refusal to accept any tics with the past. Of course Mack-,Paragraph
"murdo’s design is not without ancestors, but they are not to be",Paragraph
found among the hallowed period styles.,Paragraph
"He must have looked at Morris and, like Morris, at the Pre-",Paragraph
"Raphaelites. He must have known William Blake, as the",Paragraph
"Pre-Raphaelites did, but he was also familiar — socially too -",Paragraph

Kelmscott Press. Mackmurdo designed textiles for his guild in,Paragraph
"1884 too, and they possess much of the originality and the",Paragraph

Century Guild. The eighties were the years of Morris’s wide,Paragraph
"success as a designer. His by then much more staid, symmetrical,",Paragraph

46,Title
"associated with the Guild, worked in its style. The cover of the",Paragraph
translation of Fouqué’s Undine (1888) is a masterpiece in its own,Paragraph
right. The world of sprites or fairics of the water was bound to,Paragraph
appeal to Art Nouveau sensibility. Hair and waves and sca-,Paragraph
"weeds were as alluring as such elemental creatures themselves,",Paragraph
not guided by reason but by instinct. For order enforced by,Paragraph
intellect is one of the things against which Art Nouveau was in,Paragraph
"opposition, and the conscious selection of styles of the past to be",Paragraph
imitated represented that principle of enforced order.,Paragraph
"31 Cover of Fouqué’s Undine by Heywood Sumner, 1888",Caption
"Mackmurdo’s exploration was one in two dimensions, as",Paragraph
indeed Morris’s had been. But efforts at breaking the shackles of,Paragraph
"historicism in the crafts, expressing themselves in the shaping",Paragraph
"not the decorating of objects, were not entirely lacking either.",Paragraph
Pride of place here goes to France. Emile Gallé of Nancy was,Paragraph
five years older than Mackmurdo. His glass vessels of 1884 and,Paragraph
after are as alien to nineteenth-century conventions as Mack-,Paragraph

"certain pieces from him in 1885, and among them is a jardini¢re",Paragraph
"in imitation of jade and a tall vase of clear glass, both strikingly",Paragraph
independent and courageous. The scratched-in pattern of the,Paragraph

had in the 1880s begun to work in ceramics. The plate of 1891,Paragraph

art; but they antedate it by nearly twenty years. One might also,Paragraph
"-and more justly -— look in the direction of Gaudi, but even then",Paragraph
Bindesbgll seems to retain priority. Bindesbgll’s impact,Paragraph

the attitude of the architect turning potter and indeed craftsman,Paragraph
in general.,Paragraph

out of the impasse of Art Nouveau. He said already in 1906 that,Paragraph
"furniture should expressits function, thatitshould bein harmony",Paragraph
with the material and that curves should be used decoratively,Paragraph
only. His furniture is indeed a return to the principles and forms,Paragraph
"of the most refined French cighteenth-century furniture, even",Paragraph
if he never stooped to imitation.,Paragraph

After these French pieces van de Velde’s great desk of 1896,Paragraph
is impressive in its radicalism and its tautness. There is neither,Paragraph
the elephantine massiveness of Vallin’s dining room nor,Paragraph
Gaillard’s half-concealed sympathy with the classic past. Van,Paragraph
de Velde impressed Germany much when he first showed in,Paragraph
1897. Indeed Germany started a little later than Belgium and,Paragraph

"better known as a typographer and decorator of books, designed",Paragraph
"furniture for the Grand Duke of Hessen about 1898, surprisingly",Paragraph

he decorated. The solution of the seeming contradiction must,Paragraph
be van de Velde. Richard Riemerschmid’s chairs are more,Paragraph
"English in their inspiration, and he was indeed among those who,",Paragraph
"when he turned away from Art Nouveau, did so for social as",Paragraph
well as aesthetic reasons. The greatest ornamental originality in,Paragraph

"canapé of 1911, paraphrases classic French furniture in Art Nouveau",Paragraph
language,Title
"Germany was August Endell’s, as we shall see in another context",Paragraph
later. What is known of his furniture has a curious plastic,Paragraph
quality — plastic in the true English sense of the word — quite,Paragraph
different from anything so far examined. The scrolls at the ends,Paragraph
"of the arms of the chair illustrated are particularly convincing,",Paragraph
both aesthetically and functionally.,Paragraph
"Only one other designer of furniture did likewise, and he was",Paragraph
"neither German nor French nor English, nor indeed a furniture",Paragraph
designer. Antoni Gaudf’s chairs for the Casa Calvet of 1896-1904,Caption
have the same qualities as Endell’s but driven to an extreme.,Paragraph
"They are Art Nouveau in that they shun the straight line, shun",Paragraph
all relation to the past and also in that they are fanatically,Paragraph
personal. The bone-like formation of the elements is all Gaudf’s.,Paragraph
His most surprising furniture is that for the chapel of the,Paragraph
Colonia Giiell at Santa Coloma de Cervellé on which he worked,Caption
from 1898 till 1914. Here is one of the few cases of design trying,Paragraph
"to do what painting was doing at the same moment, that is,",Paragraph
scrapping all the agreed conventions of art. The brutality of,Paragraph
"85 Porch of the crypt of Sta Coloma de Cervellé, by Gaudi (1898-1914).",Caption
"The materials are rough stone, brick, cement, columnar basalt (pillar on the",Paragraph
"left), and tiles laid edge to edge in the vaults. Details were devised on the",Paragraph
spot rather than at the drawing-board,Paragraph
"the iron undercarriage of these benches, especially the feet,",Paragraph
"and of the seats themselves, goes indeed beyond Art Nouveau.",Paragraph
Gaudi’s architecture poses even more urgently the problem,Paragraph
"of how far Art Nouveau as a term with an analysable, useful",Paragraph
meaning can be stretched. That he is first and foremost Gaudi,Paragraph
there can be no question. The ironwork of the Casa Vicens,Paragraph
and the portal of the Palau Giiell have already demonstrated,Paragraph
that. But that his views and those of Art Nouveau coincided in,Paragraph
many ways is patent.,Paragraph
"However, there is a greater problem involved here. It has",Paragraph
been denied by more than one scholar that Art Nouveau,Paragraph
88,Title
"""We sree’ 1",Title
_Etuira,Title
architecture exists at all. It has been argued that Art Nouveau,Paragraph
"was no more than a decorative fashion, lasting hardly more",Paragraph

tained. It might be worth looking at a number of exteriors and,Paragraph
interiors of buildings in a systematic order culminating in,Paragraph

"Altogether, the role of iron in Art Nouveau is interesting",Paragraph
enough to deserve a paragraph. Iron is a decorative as well asa,Paragraph
structural material. Viollet-le-Duc had recognized that and,Paragraph
suggested its use in both capacities in the same buildings. He,Paragraph
"was the fountain head. Then, and independent of him, iron and",Paragraph
"later steel, externally in conjunction with glass, became the",Paragraph
"most technically suitable material for the factory, the warehouse",Paragraph
and the office building. The quality which recommended it was,Paragraph
that it lent itself to the unmitigated grid. This was an argument,Paragraph
"in itself not of an aesthetic nature, though the twentieth century",Paragraph
discovered the aesthetic possibilities of the grid. Buc Art,Paragraph
Nouveau must retain the credit for the discovery of the aesthetic,Paragraph
possibilities of iron and glass — even if these qualities have,Paragraph
nothing to do with those of the grid. Art Nouveau adored,Paragraph
"lightness, attenuation, transparency and of course sinuosity.",Paragraph
Iron meant thin members and ductility; iron and glass used,Paragraph
externally produced the same transparency obtained internally,Paragraph
by iron alone. Horta’s Maison du Peuple of 18y6-9 was the Art,Paragraph
Nouveau version of the American office building — both,Paragraph
"dependent on iron, but in exactly opposite ways. In America",Paragraph
"the steel controls structure and thereby appearance, though the",Paragraph
tacades are of stone cladding the steel; in the Maison du Peuple,Paragraph
"the iron frame is visible, and iron provides the music playing",Paragraph
round the frame and embroidering on the eternal Art Nouveau,Title
theme of the curve which also is that of the fagade as a whole.,Paragraph
"The rhythm of iron, glass, steel and brick is restless and the",Paragraph
"building does not read as a whole. In the great hall inside, iron is",Paragraph
"exposed everywhere, and yet the effect is not utilitarian, largely",Paragraph
again thanks to the use of curving members. The most daringly,Paragraph
glazed commercial building of those years was Bernhard,Paragraph
"Sehring’s Tictz Department Store in Berlin of 1898, which",Paragraph
"consists of three broad stone bays, left, right and centre,",Caption

In France the architect with the keenest sense of the poten-,Paragraph
tialities of the new materials was Hector Guimard. It was a fine,Paragraph
show ofa sense of topicality that the Paris Métro allowed him,Paragraph
for the relatively new purpose of a metropolitan underpavement,Paragraph
railway to design exclusively in the new material. The general,Paragraph
tenor is indeed as light as befits the introduction to fast transport.,Paragraph
But the details are bossy and bony — more similar to Alfred,Paragraph
Gilbert’s of more than ten years before than to anyone else’s.,Paragraph

"few other communications, and his originality might indeed",Paragraph
not have become quite so extreme if it had not been for his,Paragraph
working in the comparative isolation of Barcelona and working,Title
for a clientéle nationally disposed in favour of fantastical,Paragraph
architecture. Indeed the extremes of Plateresque and Chur-,Paragraph
rigueresque are hardly less bewildering than those of Gaudi.,Paragraph
"These he must have known, but they do not seem to have",Paragraph
inspired him. On the other hand he must have been impressed,Paragraph
by the Mohammedan style of southern Spain as well as that of,Paragraph
folk building in Morocco. And he must also have seen in the,Paragraph
"journals how Art Nouveau triumphed in France, and some of",Paragraph
"the interior details in his two blocks of flats, the Casa Batllé and",Paragraph
"the Casa Mild, are indeed entirely French Art Nouveau, just",Paragraph
as the use of concrete trees — leafless of course — in the Giiell Park,Paragraph
"is a conceit of Hennebique’s, the French concrete fanatic. Still,",Paragraph
"his overwhelming originality remains, but — at least in the Casa",Paragraph
"Batllé and the Casa Mila, both late works, begun in 1905 — it is",Paragraph
an originality within the framework of Art Nouveau.,Paragraph
"104 Detail of the facade of Gaudi’s Casa MilA, of dark, pitted stone ~ deliberately",Caption
"wave-like, with seaweed balconies",Paragraph
What after all is it that startles one in these facades as one,Paragraph
comes upon them unprepared in the Paseo de Gracia? A whole,Paragraph
"facade in a slow, sluggish and somewhat menacing flow — like",Paragraph
"lava, some people have said; as if carved out by the sea, say",Paragraph
"others; like the face of a long-disused quarry, yet others. So",Paragraph
"here is undulation, and here is the affinity with nature",Paragraph
"‘structurized’, as van de Velde once called it. Here also - and",Paragraph
this needs saying now at last — is that disregard for functional,Paragraph
advantages that did such disservice to Art Nouveau in buildings,Paragraph
and furnishings everywhere. Balcony railings which stab at you,Paragraph
and consistently curved walls against which no one’s furniture,Paragraph
will stand satisfactorily are only two examples. What elevates,Paragraph
these two late Gaudi buildings above those of other architects,Paragraph
"of the same moment is their restless force, their sense of masses",Paragraph
in motion and their single-mindedness. The plan of the Casa,Paragraph
Mila to which reference has already been made is ultimate proof,Paragraph
that Art Nouveau principles could be applied to space as well as,Paragraph
line and volume.,Paragraph
The placing of Gaudi within European Art Nouveau is,Paragraph
relatively easy as long as one confines oneself to his work after,Paragraph
1903. But three years earlier he had started on the Giiell Park,Paragraph
and five years earlier on the chapel of Santa Coloma de Cervellé,Caption
on an industrial estate also belonging to his patron Eusebio,Paragraph
"Giiell. In the chapel there are no undulating lines; all is sharp,",Paragraph
"angular, aggressive. Butall is also in its own idiom as unexpected",Paragraph
as the houses in the Paseo de Gracia. If one looks for comparisons,Paragraph
one is reminded rather of German Expressionism of the 1920s —,Paragraph
in its wildest Dr Caligari dreams — than of Art Nouveau. As far,Paragraph
as Art Nouveau was opposition to the past and opposition to,Paragraph
"the order of right-angles, Santa Coloma of course qualifies.",Paragraph
"As far as Art Nouveau was a challenging show of individualism,",Paragraph
"it also qualifies. And that is perhaps enough. The little building,",Paragraph
"abandoned before it was completed, is in its interpenetration of",Paragraph
outer and inner spaces bolder than anything Frank Lloyd,Title
Wright had done or was ever to do in pursuit of spatial,Paragraph
"confluence. The walls are a seemingly arbitrary zigzag, though",Paragraph
to§ At the Casa Batllé (1905-7) Gaudi refaced an older building with colov,Caption
"tiles, adding the rippling stone entrance and bay-windows and spiky, sini",Paragraph

an axiality from entrance to altar is preserved. But the approach,Paragraph
"is wholly asymmetrical, and even the round piers inside do not",Paragraph
"correspond left with right. Morcover, supports are set at",Paragraph
"raking angles, they are built up here of brick, there of stones;",Paragraph
"they are roughly shaped or frankly shapeless, and they carry ribs",Paragraph
"whose details seem to have been decided not at the office,",Paragraph
"beforehand, but on the spot, as work went on.",Paragraph
This is indeed true of the very similar structures connected,Paragraph
with the Giiell Park as well. Here also you find twisted supports,Paragraph
"set diagonally, fairly normal but leaning Doric columns,",Paragraph
"stalactite vaults, quite apart from the dead trees of concrete, and",Paragraph
quite apart from the enchanting back of the long seat running,Paragraph
all along the open space at the top where nannies sit and children,Paragraph
"play. This back, writhing and drooping like a serpent or some",Paragraph
"antediluvian monster, is yet gay, by virtue of its delicious",Paragraph
"colours, bright, happy colours, any number of them and in",Paragraph
"haphazard relations. The seat is faced with faience and tiles, and",Paragraph
here as well as on the roofs of his houses and indeed on the,Paragraph
"pinnacles of his great church, the Sagrada Familia, broken cups",Caption
"and saucers, broken floor tiles and wall tiles and chips ofall kinds",Paragraph
are used. Again Gaudf is closer to Picasso there than to the other,Paragraph
practitioners of Art Nouveau.,Paragraph
The Sagrada Familia spans Gaudi’s whole life. He dedicated,Paragraph
his powers more and more to it and in the end to the exclusion,Paragraph
of anything else. For Gaudf was an unquestioning Catholic.,Paragraph
"Religion was the centre of his life, and the aestheticism of much",Paragraph
of Art Nouveau experimenting is totally absent in him. In,Paragraph
1884 he was put in charge of a neo-Gothic building only just,Paragraph
begun. He continued it in that style and gradually turned freer,Paragraph
"and bolder. As one looks at the great facade of the south transept,",Paragraph
one can watch the process of liberation. Below there are still,Paragraph
"three tall gabled portals on the French Gothic cathedral pattern,",Caption
and it is only the decoration encrusting it that is transformed,Paragraph
into rockery and naturalistic leaf-work. The towers are without,Paragraph
"precedent, but they were only started in 1903. And as for",Paragraph
"the pinnacles, once again, it seems impossible to believe that",Paragraph

"He also designed the benches (see Ill. 84) ,",Paragraph
they can be the work of craftsmen working from architect's,Paragraph
drawings.,Paragraph
Gaudf was not an architect in the sense in which the profession,Paragraph
had established itself in the nineteenth century and was going,Paragraph
to be run in the twenticth. He was not a professional man,Paragraph
working in an office. He was essentially stall the medieval,Paragraph
craftsman whose final decision could only be taken as he watched,Paragraph
over the execution of what he had perhaps sketched out on,Paragraph
paper but never made final. In him one ideal of William Morris,Paragraph
had come true. What he built was ‘by the people for the people’,Paragraph

"109 Gaudi’s Palau Giiell (1844-9), two arches with massive ironwork in",Caption
the Catalan tradition. Gaudi used parabolic arches — the shape of the future —,Paragraph
both decoratively and structurally,Paragraph
It is of importance to say this; for recently Gaudi has been,Paragraph
"hailed as a pioneer of twentieth-century structure, a forerunner",Paragraph
"of Nervi. But whereas, in the field of new shapes and materials",Paragraph
"he points forward indeed, his use of complicated models to",Paragraph
experiment with strains and stresses is not that of the engineer-,Paragraph
"architect of our age at all. On the contrary, it is still that of the",Paragraph
"individualist-craftsman, the outsider, the lonely, do-it-yourself",Title
inventor.,Paragraph
And in this extreme individualism once again Gaudi was,Paragraph
part of Art Nouveau. For Art Nouveau was an outbreak of,Paragraph
individualism first and foremost. It depended for success entirely,Paragraph
on the personal force and sensibility of a designer or craftsman.,Paragraph
"What could be communicated of it, is what ruined it so quickly.",Paragraph
"The style of Schinkel, the style of Semper, the style of Pearson,",Paragraph
112,Title
the style of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts could be taught and used,Paragraph
with impunity by the rank and file. Commercialized van de,Paragraph
Velde and Tiffany is a disaster. Commercialized Gaudi was,Paragraph
hardly attempted. This individualism ties Art Nouveau to the,Paragraph
century at whose end it stands. So does its insistence on craft and,Paragraph
its antipathy against industry. So finally does its delight in the,Paragraph
precious or at least the telling material.,Paragraph
But Art Nouveau straddles the boundary line between the,Paragraph
"two centuries, and its historical significance lies in those of its",Paragraph
"innovations which pointed forward. They are, as has been said",Paragraph
"in these pages more than once, its refusal to continue with the",Paragraph
"historicism of the nineteenth century, its courage in trusting its",Paragraph
"own inventiveness, and its concern with objects for use rather",Paragraph
than with paintings and statues.,Paragraph

CHAPTER THREE,Title
New Impetus from England,Title
It is in its concern with objects for use that Art Nouveau was,Paragraph
most decisively inspired by England. The message of William,Paragraph
Morris was heeded everywhere. In other ways the relations,Paragraph
between the English and the Continental developments of the,Paragraph
1890s are more complex. They deserve more than one close,Paragraph
"look. The situation, it must be remembered, was that in the",Paragraph
"1880s Morris’s art of design had reached its richest, most",Paragraph
balanced maturity. A synthesis between nature and stylization,Paragraph
was achieved which has never been outdone. At the same time,Paragraph
"in architecture Webb and Shaw had, at any rate in the field of",Paragraph
"domestic building, defeated Victorian pomposity and re-",Paragraph
introduced a human scale and sensitive or at least telling details.,Paragraph
And already before 1890 Morris as well as Shaw and Webb had,Paragraph
their successors. The Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society had,Paragraph
started and the progressive architectural journals had begun to,Paragraph
"illustrate the designs of Voyscy, of Ernest Newton, Ricardo and",Paragraph
"others. Meanwhile, however, this Arts and Crafts movement",Paragraph
had also benefited from those among the young who wanted to,Paragraph
go beyond the enlightened traditionalism of Morris and Shaw.,Paragraph
"Mackmurdo, as we have seen, was their leader, and Mackmurdo",Paragraph
with his Wren title-page of 1883 had started Art Nouveau. The,Paragraph
"effect of the journal of his Century Guild, the Hebby Horse, had",Paragraph
"been great, and English book art right on to Beardsley was",Paragraph
indebted to it. But where Continental Art Nouveau of the 1890s,Paragraph
acknowledged this debt freely and developed its own national,Paragraph
"versions out of English precedent, England itself turned away",Paragraph
from it and followed Morris and Shaw rather than Art Nouveau.,Paragraph
"Indeed, and this is perhaps the most surprising aspect of",Paragraph
"Mackmurdo’s situation, he himsclf, when it came to designing",Paragraph
"buildings and furniture, did not apply the sinuosity of his book-",Paragraph
lis,Title
work and textiles. The carly chair which some regard — without,Paragraph
"sufficient evidence - as designed in 188153 has, apart from",Paragraph
"ornament directly connected with that of the Wren title-page,",Paragraph
"at least a curvaceous back, but the little desk of 1886 and the",Paragraph
exhibition stand at Liverpool of the same year are entirely,Paragraph
rational and rectangular. It is true they are in their own way as,Paragraph
"original as the proto-Art Nouveau of a few years before, but",Paragraph
their originality is their slender square posts and the curious far-,Paragraph
projecting hats or pieces of cornice each of them carries.,Paragraph
"112 In this chair,",Paragraph
designed in the carly,Caption
"eighties, Mackmurdo",Title

shape but with the,Paragraph
swirling plant forms,Title
of his influential,Title
title-page(see fl. 27),Caption
113 By 1886 Mackmurdo had moved on to the equally revolutionary,Paragraph
angularity of the Century Guild exhibition stand: its thin vertical posts,Paragraph
and ‘mortar-board’ tops were soon taken up — via Voysey and Mackintosh,Paragraph
—as far away as Austria and Sweden,Title
This motif in particular influenced Voysey and Mackintosh,Paragraph
"in their beginnings, and Voysey was also strongly influenced by",Paragraph
Mackmurdo in his early textile designs. Charles F. Annesley,Paragraph
Voysey must be regarded as the central figure in English,Paragraph
architecture and design during the two decades around 1yo0.,Paragraph
His style of domestic architecture was complete by 18go. In,Paragraph
"1891 he built a small studio house in West Kensington, London,",Paragraph
"and there already are the low, comfortable, spreading character,",Paragraph
"the bands of unmoulded window openings and of bare wall,",Paragraph
"the big, tapering chimneystacks. There is no longer even as",Paragraph
117,Title
"114 Studio in West Kensington, London, by Voysey (1891), an exercise in",Caption
"rational design devoid of ornament. Note the pebbledash rendering, broad",Paragraph
eaves and sloping buttresses — all Voysey trademarks,Paragraph
"115,116 Voysey specialized in country houses; Broadleys on Lake Winder-",Caption
"mere (right), of 1898, is remarkable for its plain bay windows with un-",Paragraph
"moulded mullions. The entrance of Vodin House, Pyrford Common,",Caption
"Surrey, of 1902 (below right), carries this simplicity even further",Paragraph
"much of period details as there had been in Shaw and Webb,",Paragraph
"but there remains all the same a strong period flavour, a flavour",Paragraph
of the Tudor or Stuart cottage or manor house. The house is in,Paragraph
"its own way as original as Morris’s designs, but hardly more",Paragraph
original. In the late nineties and shortly after 1900 Voysey was,Paragraph
extremely successful as a designer of private houses of moderate,Paragraph
"size, and for good reasons; for his plans are easy and at the same",Paragraph
"time his houses fit their setting, and their simple geometry was",Paragraph
"refreshing; they were eminently reasonable, unradical and",Paragraph
unexacting.,Paragraph
118,Title
"Others in England at the same moment were bolder, none",Paragraph
"more so than E.S. Prior, W.R.Lethaby, and the much younger",Paragraph
"Edwin Lutyens. Prior, more distinguished as a scholar than as",Paragraph
"an architect, built a few houses between about 1895 and 1905",Paragraph
which combine Voysey’s sixteenth- or seventeenth-century,Paragraph
sympathy with a fanatical use of mixed local materials.,Paragraph
Occasionally the bits of brick and the pebbles used in the raw,Paragraph
are almost reminiscent of Gaudf. Lutyens was a man of brilliant,Paragraph
talents who later turned away from the progressive develop-,Paragraph
ments and led the retreat into the grand manner which Shaw,Paragraph
himself had started in his buildings after 1890. This neo-Baroque,Paragraph
"117 Home Place, Norfolk, by E.S.Prior (1904-6). Prior tried hard to",Caption
"revive local styles and local materials, preferring to be known as a ‘builder’",Paragraph
"rather than an architect, but at Home Place his exotic mixture of flint, tile",Paragraph
and brick takes him far from any true vernacular — almost into the realm,Paragraph
of Gaudf,Title
118 The early work of Edwin Lutyens has as much wit as Norman Shaw's,Paragraph
"and a prodigious architectural inventiveness. Tigbourne Court, Surrey",Caption
"(1897) is Lutyens at his best. Note the dramatic massing of the whole, the",Paragraph
"relation of the three gables to the excessively high chimney-stacks, and",Paragraph
such details as the rusticated stonework with smooth banding,Paragraph
or neo-Classicism need not concern us here. It reigned in official,Paragraph
architecture nearly everywhere. Such public buildings as,Paragraph

Berlage’s Exchange of Amsterdam of 1898 are highly excep-,Paragraph
"tional in their free handling of traditional materials, and Nyrop",Paragraph

is the church designed by W.R.Lethaby at Brockhampton,Caption

"structive thinker on architecture and design in England, gave",Paragraph
up practising altogether after Brockhampton in order to teach,Paragraph
at the London Central School of Arts and Crafts which was the,Paragraph
most progressive school of those years anywhere. Lethaby in,Paragraph
his writings recommended the step from craft to industrial,Paragraph
"design, a step which Voysey and others already had taken as",Paragraph
practising designers. But only Lethaby in England saw that,Paragraph
more was concerned than a matter of production techniques.,Paragraph

"feet of Ashbee’s dish, derives ultimately from the seventeenth century",Paragraph
Astyle for industria! design was visualized by Lethaby but it was,Paragraph
developed in practice in other countries. As far as the style is,Paragraph
concerned; it mattered little whether what Voysey designed,Paragraph
was in the end made by the craftsman or the manufacturer. The,Paragraph
"style is moderate, sensible, always graceful, whether in furniture",Paragraph
or in textiles or in metalwork.,Paragraph
"The same applies to other architects, designers and craftsmen.",Paragraph
A chair such as that made by Baillie Scott for the Grand Duke,Paragraph
"of Hesse in 1898 is a good example, also in the design of the",Paragraph
covering of the back which has abandoned the Art Nouveau,Paragraph
way of Mackimurdo while keeping the sense of the pretty flat,Paragraph
pattern. Another example is the exquisite cabinets designed by,Paragraph
"Ernest Gimson. They also are in no demonstrative way novel,",Paragraph
"yet in no way imitative, and they are a triumph of revived",Paragraph
"craftsmanship. However, the cabinet illustrated dates from 1908,",Paragraph
"and by then, on the Continent, had lost all topicality. Gimson",Paragraph
was trained as an architect and designed a few houses before he,Paragraph
turned entirely to the crafts. The combination is characteristic,Paragraph
127,Title
"of Britain at that moment. On the Continent, in terms of Art",Paragraph
"Nouveau, it was the painters rather who listened to Morris. In",Paragraph
"Britain the message could be heard by the architects, because",Paragraph
already at the Webb-Shaw stage the alliance with the Morris,Paragraph
Movement had been established. One of the more interesting,Paragraph
cases is that of C. R. Ashbce who designed houses of considerable,Paragraph
"originality, chough obviously inspired by Shaw, and founded a",Paragraph
Guild and School of Handicraft having learned the Morris,Paragraph
"lesson. The school operated at first in the East End of London,",Paragraph
later at Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds; for Ashbee was,Paragraph
keenly interested in social reform too. It is worth comparing the,Paragraph
work of his craftsmen about 1900 with Continental work at the,Paragraph
Paris Exhibition. What appears is that in furniture and metal-,Paragraph
"work for use Ashbee was entirely on the Voysey side, but in",Paragraph
jewellery he comes remarkably close to Art Nouveau - a,Paragraph
typically English compromise. .,Paragraph

Voysey and others in England and of work on the Continent,Paragraph
too (for The Stidio kept readers up-to-date) into an idiom,Paragraph
"entirely their own, as original and as radical as Art Nouveau,",Paragraph
but never so contorted. Or at least not when they had reached,Paragraph
maturity. The leader of the group was Charles Rennie,Paragraph

"to these lean, sombre nudes is Toorop in Holland, and their",Paragraph
"completely abstract bands of hair, their draperies and trees",Paragraph
reduced to one leaf (or fruit) on each upward growing branch,Paragraph
are entirely Mackintosh’s. In the next few years they did other,Paragraph
"stationery, and the ladies did repoussé work as well. Then",Paragraph
Mackintosh’s great opportunity came. In 1896 he won the,Paragraph
"competition for a new building for the Glasgow School of Art,",Caption
and the building was erected in 1897-1909. In 1897 The Studio,Paragraph
published an illustrated article on the group. In 1900 they,Paragraph
"exhibited in Vienna, in 1902 in Turin. In 1901 Mackintosh went",Paragraph
in for a competition set by a German publisher — designing a,Paragraph
house for a lover of art. Glasgow was in fact destined to find,Paragraph
more resonance on the Continent than in England.,Paragraph
128 Mackintosh designed this diploma for the Glasgow School of Art Club,Caption
in 1893 — the year in which Toorop’s The Three Brides appeared in The,Paragraph
"Studio, The influence is obvious, but Mackintosh’s sparseness and angularity",Paragraph
are already unmistakable. Note too the compressed Jettering,Paragraph
The front of the Glasgow School of Art sets the theme for all,Paragraph
that Mackintosh was to do in the next ten or twelve years.,Paragraph
"Between 1900 and 191t he had plenty of work at Glasgow, a",Paragraph
"number of private houses, a number of tea-roomis, a school, and",Paragraph
"some interior work. England however remained closed to him,",Paragraph
and from about r9io his star waned. He was a fascinating but a,Paragraph
"difficult, erratic man, and he alienated clients’ sympathies in the",Paragraph
dour city of Glasgow. For the last fifteen years of his life he had,Paragraph
hardly any commissions.,Paragraph
The front of the School of Art is primarily a wall of large,Paragraph
studio windows facing north. They have the English Tudor,Caption
"motif of mullions and transoms, but the mullions and transoms",Paragraph
"are, like those of Voysey, completely unmoulded. The front",Paragraph
"would be a functional grid, ifit were not for the entrance bay or",Paragraph
"frontispiece which is placed out of the centre and is a free,",Paragraph
"asymmetrical composition of elements of the Baroque, of the",Paragraph
Scottish baronial past and of the Shaw-Voysey tradition. The,Paragraph
"pediment on the first floor belongs to the first, the bare turret",Caption
"to the second, the little oriel windows to the third. Moreover,",Paragraph
the functional grid and the sturdiness of the centre are relieved,Paragraph
"by delightful, very thin metalwork, the area railings, the",Paragraph
handrail of the balcony and especially the odd hooks carrying,Paragraph
"transparent, flower-like balls in front of the upper windows.",Paragraph
"Their practical purpose is to hold boards for window-cleaning,",Paragraph
"but their aesthetic purpose, like that of all the other metalwork",Paragraph
is to provide a delicate screen of light and playful forms through,Paragraph
which the stronger and sounder rest will be seen. Inside the,Paragraph
building too there are transparent screens of slender wooden,Paragraph
"posts, sudden surprises of relations between forms, especially in",Paragraph
"the boardroom, where pilasters are treated as an abstract grid",Paragraph
of a Mondrian kind below their perfectly harmless Ionic,Paragraph
"capitals, and on the roof, where shapes are almost as bold and",Paragraph
"abstract as Gaudi’s and Le Corbusier’s at Ronchamp, and there",Paragraph
are again the most unexpected curligigs of metal.,Paragraph
Once more only did Mackintosh design a building as func-,Paragraph
tional as the School of Art — the Concert Hall for the Glasgow,Paragraph
"130 Entrance of the Glasgow School of Art, 1897-9, by Mackintosh. Above the",Caption
"door is the window of the Director’s study, and above that his studio. The main",Caption

hold over four thousand people. Mackintosh provided fora low,Paragraph
building with a saucer dome on mighty buttresses. The supports,Caption
"were of iron, forming a span of about 165 feet. The organ, the",Paragraph
artists’ rooms and services were in an attachment with polygonal,Paragraph
walls and curved parapets and roof. The design gained no prize.,Paragraph
136,Title
ee 2 ee ee,Title
"While the building was severely plain, the organ-case would",Paragraph
have had ail the finesses and surprises of Mackintosh’s furniture,Paragraph
design. What characterizes all Mackintosh furniture can be said,Paragraph
to bea successful synthesis of the contrasting criteria of England,Paragraph
"and the Continent. Take, for example the two tables illustrated.",Paragraph
One is as square as a Voysey and indeed more rigidly so — as,Paragraph
"close in its grid as a cage — the second is oval, with two small",Paragraph
"oval set-in rose and ivory panels of abstract curves. Moreover,",Paragraph
"the first table has a black finish, the second a glossy white one,",Paragraph
"and white and rose, white and lilac, with black, and perhaps",Paragraph
silver and mother-of-pearl became Mackintosh’s favourite,Paragraph
"colours. These sophisticated, precious colours harmonize to",Paragraph
perfection with the sophistication of his slender uprights and,Paragraph
shallow curves. But the radicalism of ornamental abstraction,Paragraph
"and the lyrical softness of the colours also contradict each other,",Paragraph
and it is the tension between the sensuous and the structural,Paragraph
elements that makes Mackintosh’s decoration unique. But as,Paragraph
"one looks at some of the most remarkable chairs by Mackintosh,",Paragraph
one’s conviction might well be shaken that his use of grids is,Paragraph
indeed structural — in the sense of the skyscraper grids. The hard,Paragraph
verticals and horizontals must have been an attraction to,Paragraph
"Mackintosh in themselves, an aesthetic counterpoint to his",Paragraph
"tense curves, and a safeguard that the frail blooms and feminine",Paragraph
hues do not cloy.,Paragraph
Mackintosh’s fame was greater on the Continent than in,Paragraph
"Britain, let alone in England. The exhibition of rg00 in Vienna,",Caption
the competition of 1901 in Germany where he was placed,Paragraph
second — Baillie Scott won first prize — and the exhibition of,Paragraph
1902 in Turin have already been mentioned. What made it,Paragraph
possible for the Continent to admire him was precisely what,Paragraph
"deprived him of patronage in England. He wastoo Art Nouveau,",Paragraph
"and England, after the few years of her Art Nouveau avant la",Paragraph
"lettre had, as we have seen, turned away from everything outré.",Paragraph
"Indeed, when in 1900 some mostly French Art Nouveau",Paragraph
furniture had been acquired from the Paris exhibition by a,Paragraph

saying that ‘this work is neither right in principle nor does it,Paragraph
evince a proper regard for the material employed’.54 Those who,Paragraph
protested were of course right within their own terms of,Paragraph
reference. They were also right from the point of view of the,Paragraph
arising twentieth century. Art Nouveau can only be appreciated,Paragraph
on purely aesthetic grounds — and its products might well be,Paragraph
called unprincipled. But if these are looked at on aesthetic,Paragraph
"grounds, as they were in Austria and Germany, what a find the",Paragraph
"Glasgow group was. Vienna was particularly responsive,",Paragraph
"because Vienna in 1900 was, on her own, already on the way to",Paragraph
a straightening out of the Art Nouveau fancies. Joseph Olbrich’s,Paragraph

stand why he took Germany and Austria by storm. Here was the,Paragraph
wilfulness and irregularity of Art Nouveau handled with an,Paragraph
exquisite finesse previously unknown. But here was also a sense,Paragraph
"of slender, erect verticals and smooth, unbroken surfaces which",Paragraph
might well serve as a weapon to defeat Art Nouveau. Adherents,Paragraph
of Art Nouveau and its just-emerging opponents could,Paragraph
replenish their arsenals from the Haus eines Kunstfreundes.,Paragraph
The ubiquity and intensity of British influence on the,Paragraph
"Continent during these years is evident. Its conflicting directions,",Paragraph
"however, require some comment. The influence started with",Paragraph
Morris and the Domestic Revival. It stood then for a revived,Paragraph
"interest in craft, that is, the provision of objects tor use, and for",Paragraph
"an appreciation of the modest, comfortable, middle-class house",Paragraph
as against the pomposity of the public building and the rich,Paragraph

143,Title
"responsibility, this time in the art of the book - and of Mack-",Paragraph

encouraged Art Nouveau rather than responsibility. Voysey,Paragraph
"again stood for reason, domestic comfort and prettiness in the",Paragraph
design of interior furnishings; Ashbee and Baillie Scott a little,Caption
"more floridly for the same. Mackintosh alone, to repeat, could",Paragraph
be a witness for the defence and for the prosecution of both Art,Paragraph
Nouveau and anti-Art Nouveau. Olbrich in 190155 defended,Paragraph
Art Nouveau against England: ‘It is only if one can feel both,Paragraph
"democratically and autocratically, that one can evaluate the",Paragraph

more than mere utility. One may then even approach the,Paragraph
question which no one now ventures to touch: which forces,Paragraph

Art and Industry,Title
Vienna was first on the Continent in returning to the straight,Paragraph
"path of the straight line and the square and rectangle, and, being",Paragraph
"Vienna, succeeded in preserving the elegance and the sense of",Paragraph
precious materials of Art Nouveau. In Germany the change is,Paragraph
principally connected with the names of Riemerschmid and,Paragraph
"Peter Behrens, and while the change in Austria was an aesthetic",Paragraph
"one entirely, in Germany it was also social. Riemerschmid and",Paragraph
"his brother-in-law, Karl Schmidt, the founder of the Deutsche",Paragraph
"Werkstatten, as carly as 1899 began to tackle the problem ot",Paragraph
cheap furniture and in 1905 at an exhibition showed their first,Paragraph
"machine-made furniture, designed, they said, ‘from the spirit",Paragraph
"of the machine’. Behrens, who had belonged to the colony of",Paragraph
"artists at Darmstadt, abandoned the curve about 1904 and",Paragraph
"turned to cubic shapes and square decoration, as they had done",Paragraph
"in Vienna, but with greater severity. A few years later he was",Paragraph
"given the opportunity by the A.E.G., the German clectricity",Paragraph
"combine, of concentrating for a time entirely on factory",Paragraph
architecture and industrial design. But already in 1898 he had,Paragraph
designed glass for quantity production.,Paragraph
In France the revolt against Art Nouveau took yet another,Paragraph
form. It centred on the conquest of the new materials by new,Paragraph
architects. The triumphs of iron architecture at the exhibition,Caption
"of 1889 had still been the triumphs of engineers, even if the",Paragraph

"the opposition of van de Velde, who pleaded for individual",Paragraph
expression where Muthesius wanted to develop standards.,Paragraph
CHAPTER FIVE,Title
Towards the International Style,Title
Muthesius in the famous discussion at Cologne in 1914 said:,Paragraph
‘Architecture and with it the whole area of activity of the,Paragraph
Werkbund moves towards standardization (Typisierung) .. .,Paragraph
Only standardization can . . . once again introduce a universally,Paragraph
"valid, self-certain taste.” Van de Velde answered: ‘As long as",Paragraph
there are artists in the Werkbund . . . they are going to protest,Paragraph
"against any suggestion of a canon of standardization. The artist,",Paragraph
"according to his innermost essence, is a fervent individualist, a",Paragraph
"free, spontaneous creator. He will never voluntarily submit to",Paragraph
"a discipline forcing on him a type, a canon.’ It must have been",Paragraph
a memorable moment — Art Nouveau at its best resisting the,Paragraph
needs and declining the responsibilities of the new century.,Paragraph
In fact the victory of Muthesius was assured even before the,Paragraph
Cologne meeting. The meeting was held apropos the first,Paragraph
"Werkbund exhibition, and this exhibition, at least in its most",Paragraph
"important buildings, actually demonstrated that victory, and",Paragraph
would have demonstrated it internationally if the outbreak of,Paragraph
the First World War had not disrupted European unity and held,Paragraph
"up cultural progress. Among the buildings, Bchrens’s Festival",Paragraph
"Hall was disappointingly classical, Hoffmann’s Austrian pavilion",Paragraph
"equally classical outside, but inside had a playfulness which was",Paragraph
"as back ward-pointing, as was van de Velde’s impressive theatre",Paragraph
with its emphatic curves. The two most powerful buildings,Paragraph
were the Glass House by Bruno Taut and Gropius’s Halle des,Paragraph

"of 1893 the classicism of Beaux-Arts derivation had triumphed,",Paragraph
he had prophesied that this would put back architecture in,Paragraph
America by fifty years. He was nearly right. The so-called,Paragraph
School of Chicago fizzled out during the last years before the,Paragraph

the importance of Futurism to architecture lies in its adherents’,Paragraph
passionate commitment to the city.,Paragraph
The city was the most urgent and the most comprehensive,Paragraph
problem of the nineteenth century. It had been criminally,Paragraph
"neglected by the architects, and by governments as well. To cut",Paragraph
boulevards through Paris had its traffic advantages and offered,Paragraph
plenty of spectacular points de vue for the placing of monumental,Paragraph
"buildings, to open up the glacis of the fortress walls of Vienna,",Paragraph
to create a generous ring of gardens and ideal sites for yet larger,Paragraph
public buildings was no solution. These urban displays had,Paragraph
their aesthetic points — and who does not get a visual thrill out,Paragraph
of looking up the Avenue de I’Opéra or the Rue Royale? — but |,Paragraph
the real problem was the visually unpromising one of housing,Paragraph
a population which in London (the area which in 1888 became!,Paragraph
"the County of London), grew between 1801 and 1901 from",Paragraph
"under a million to nearly four and a half million, and in",Paragraph
Manchester from about one hundred thousand to about five,Title
hundred and fifty thousand. Equally unpromising visually and,Paragraph
equally urgent was the problem of the siting of industry. If,Paragraph
"architects did not care, manufacturers cared only rarely. But",Paragraph
"Robert Owen, the socialist manufacturer, designed in 1817 a",Paragraph
"model village with factory and housing, as Ledoux had done",Paragraph

"shipyard, active, mobile and everywhere dynamic, and the",Paragraph
modern building like a gigantic machine . . . Lifts must swarm,Paragraph
up the facades like serpents of glass and iron. The house of,Paragraph

mechanical simplicity . . . must rise from the brink of a,Paragraph
"tumultous abyss, the street . . . gathering up the traffic of the",Paragraph
metropolis connected for necessary transfers to metal cat-walks,Paragraph
and high-speed conveyor belts.’,Paragraph
"Perhaps, in spite of Behrens and Gropius, the new style",Paragraph
needed someone to grow lyrical over it to win the day. The,Paragraph
Futurists provided that. The Expressionists took it on after the,Paragraph
"war and dreamed up their first steel and all-glass skyscrapers,",Paragraph
"and finally, only in the middle of the century, the synthesis of",Paragraph
"the garden city and the metropolitan city was achieved, with",Paragraph
"garden cities culminating in urban centres, garden estates for",Paragraph
"ten thousand, with skyscrapers carefully placed, and office",Paragraph
buildings in various groupings enclosing patio gardens.,Paragraph
"With this, architecture has made a contribution to human",Paragraph
life as great as architecture ever did. Is the contribution of,Paragraph
"painting and sculpture on the same level, and are the so-called",Paragraph
fine arts of painting and sculpture and the so-called applied arts,Title
"of architecture and design working towards the same aims,",Paragraph
meeting with the same kind and intensity of response? So it,Paragraph
"had been in the Middle Ages, so in the Baroque. But that mutual",Paragraph
"sympathy, that common understanding had not always been a",Paragraph
matter of course. The Town Hall of Amsterdam and the,Caption
"Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis which Rembrandt painted for it,",Paragraph
do not belong together. Those who praised the one would not,Paragraph
"necessarily praise the other, and if some did they would do it",Paragraph
for opposite reasons. Holland in the seventeenth century was,Paragraph
a middle-class republic. It was here that the figure of the mis-,Paragraph
198,Title
"understood, the neglected, the starving artist first appeared.",Paragraph
"Moreover, Holland was a Protestant country and not in need of",Paragraph
the visual arts for worship. The second age of the art that,Paragraph
"mattered being unwelcome was the first middle-class age, the",Paragraph
"nineteenth century, or rather the nineteenth and the later",Paragraph
eighteenth century which belongs to it. Neglect grew into,Paragraph
"active opposition; art on the other hand in Goya, in Blake, in",Paragraph
Runge went into a secret language. If you want to understand,Paragraph
"the artist, you must entrust yourself to him and work at it; he is",Paragraph
no longer going to work for you. Patronage in the old sense was,Paragraph
"dead; what patronage there was to be was as individual, as",Paragraph
"exposed as the artist’s gospel itself. Isolation, half imposed and",Paragraph
"half self-imposed, was the fate of the painters of Barbizon, of",Paragraph
"Courbet, of the Impressionists, of the Post-Impressionists. If",Paragraph
"anything, the pitch of hostility rose. The social development of",Paragraph
architecture was bound to be different. There never can be an,Paragraph
architect as isolated as a painter. But while this relative security,Paragraph
"was a gratifying fact for the architect, it was not beneficial for",Paragraph
architecture. It meant quite simply that in the nineteenth century,Paragraph
the most ruthlessly creative minds did not choose the profession,Paragraph
ofthearchitect. This explains toa certain extent the phenomenon,Paragraph
of the collapse of aesthetic values in so much of the century. It,Paragraph
also explains why it is that the most forward-pointing work so,Paragraph
often came from outsiders. The reason why it came from,Paragraph
engineers is that the century was one of materialism and hence,Paragraph
of science and technology. No century ever before had seen,Paragraph
comparable progress in these fields. The progress was made at,Paragraph
the expense of aesthetic sensibility of the subtle kind that would,Paragraph
have granted acceptance to Impressionism and Post-Impression-,Paragraph
"ism. The Crystal Palace met with success, but so also did the",Paragraph
horrors of decorative art displayed in it. Architects’ architecture,Paragraph
"and salon or academy art went together, engineers’ and",Paragraph
explorers’ architecture and explorers’ are did not.,Paragraph
But this statement is perhaps too abrupt. The roads followed,Paragraph
"by the best painters, the best craftsmen or manufacturers and",Paragraph
the best architects did occasionally meet. The earliest was the,Paragraph
199,Title
most fruitful meeting; it is that between Morris’s preaching,Paragraph
and the conversion to craft and design of young painters and,Title
young architects. Otherwise meetings were mostly much less,Paragraph
"significant. One might perhaps just say that the turn to intimacy,",Paragraph
the turn away from bombast was of a similar nature in the,Paragraph
English Domestic Revival and in Impressionism in painting of,Paragraph
the same years. One can perhaps also say that the elegance of,Paragraph
facade detail which replaced the grossness and bluster of the,Paragraph
High Victorian architects corresponds to the elegance of,Paragraph
Impressionist painting as against Courbet’s. But that does not,Paragraph
take us very far.,Paragraph
It is different with Art Nouveau. Here indeed certain painters,Paragraph
were in full accord with the craftsmen-designers. If Art,Paragraph
"Nouveau is characterized by radical innovation, and by the",Paragraph
"incantation of the curve, then Gauguin certainly belongs to it —",Paragraph
as one of the illustrations to this survey has already demonstrated,Paragraph
"— and so do the northerners Munch and Toorop and Hodler,",Paragraph
"and to a more limited degree Maurice Denis, Vallotton, the",Paragraph
"Seurat of The Circus, the Signac of the Fénéon portrait. But",Paragraph
"after that moment, the short years about 1900, what happened?",Paragraph
"Architecture went the way of Garnier and Perret, of Loos and",Paragraph
"Hoffmann, of Behrens and Berg, and design the way of the",Paragraph
"Werkbund, but painting went the way to Fauvism and Cubism,",Paragraph
"to the Briicke and the Blaue Reiter, to Futurism and Kandinsky.",Paragraph
It is easy to see the similarities of approach and result in,Paragraph
"Bindesbdll’s plates, Gaudi’s pinnacles of the Sagrada Familia",Caption
"and Picasso’s pottery, but the dates will not match. It is also",Paragraph
"easy to see as one, cubist paintings of the geometrical kind and",Paragraph
cubic architecture of the 1920s — after all Le Corbusier produced,Paragraph
both — or Léger’s machine men and the machine-worshippers,Title
among the architects. But these comparisons are superficial.,Paragraph
"They do not concern the essential change, which is that",Paragraph
architects and designers once more accepted social respon-,Paragraph
"sibilities, that architecture and design consequently became a",Paragraph
"service, and buildings and objects of daily use were designed not",Paragraph
only to satisfy the aesthetic wishes of their designers but also to,Paragraph
200,Title
fulfil their practical purposes fully and enthusiastically. Painters,Paragraph
and sculptors moved in exactly the opposite direction. They had,Paragraph
been cut off from their public already in the nineteenth century.,Paragraph
Now they were cut off beyond redemption. Courbet shocked,Paragraph
"his public because of his message, but that message was perfectly",Paragraph
plain to everybody. The Impressionists were attacked for their,Paragraph
paintings not being recognizable. But that proved a matter of,Paragraph
visual habits. Their aesthetic aims were still those of Titian and,Paragraph
Velazquez. Only they had no other than aesthetic aims and that,Paragraph
deprived them of the sympathy which the public could extend,Paragraph
as long as the spiritual content of a work of art concerned it.,Paragraph
To recover these lost spiritual contacts was the most important,Paragraph
"effort of Gauguin, van Gogh, the Symbolists, Munch, Hodler —",Paragraph
"all of them. But they failed, and while from van Gogh’s",Paragraph
"longing for his paintings to be accepted by simple people, like",Paragraph
"the broadsheets they read, there might have been a bridge to",Paragraph
"the architects’ and designers’ endeavours towards a style for all,",Paragraph
there was none from cubism and the dynamic abstract art of,Paragraph
Kandinsky.,Paragraph
"Gropius hoped there might be, and the Bauhaus made the",Paragraph
noble effort of inviting Klee and other abstractionists under its,Paragraph
roof. No successful effort has been made since. To offer an,Paragraph
"abstract artist a wall in a building, or an abstract sculptor a place",Paragraph
in a courtyard is no substitute. To force the artist into direct,Paragraph
"social service against his better aesthetic conviction, as is the",Paragraph
principle of Socialist Realism and was that of National-Socialist,Paragraph
"Realism, is even less of a help. In fact there is no help. The gulf",Paragraph
between Jackson Pollock and Mies van der Rohe or even Nervi,Title
is beyond bridging. This book is not the place to suggest,Paragraph
remedies or foretell the future. Here it must be enough to state,Paragraph
that what is most disastrous in the visual arts of the twentieth,Paragraph
century and what is most hopeful was fully in existence by the,Paragraph
time the Age of the World Wars dawned.,Paragraph
