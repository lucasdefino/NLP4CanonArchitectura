MODERN BUILDING,Title
INTRODUCTION: THE PROBLEM OF ORDER,Title
ARCHITECTURE AS AN EXPERIENCE,Title
"In 1770, a young student from Frankfort set out to enter the",Paragraph
"University of Strasbourg, where his father wanted him to study",Paragraph
"law. Soon after his arrival in the foreign town, he went to see the",Paragraph
"famous cathedral, and from his very first moment in the presence",Paragraph
of this masterpiece of the Gothic he was deeply impressed.,Paragraph
"His previous studies in art had been guided by his father, who",Paragraph
"had taught him, in accordance with the esthetic ideals of his",Paragraph
"time, to regard the works of the ancients as the height of taste",Paragraph
"and the measure of beauty. In his father’s house, every day he",Paragraph
"had seen a series of Roman views, with which the Imperial",Paragraph
Councilor Johann Kaspar Goethe had adorned the ante-room:,Paragraph
"engravings by some of the accomplished predecessors of Piranesi,",Paragraph
"views of the Piazza del Popolo, the Colosseum, St. Peter’s",Caption
"Church, within and without, and the Piazza of St. Peter’s. In",Paragraph
"Dichtung und Wahrheit, we are told how these images im-",Paragraph
"pressed themselves deeply upon the youngster, trained his eyes,",Paragraph
formed and determined his judgment in art.,Paragraph
"From those examples, when he first approached the Strasbourg",Paragraph
"Cathedral, his head was full, as he said, of a general knowledge",Paragraph
of good taste. From hearsay he knew about harmony of masses,Paragraph
and clearness of forms; and by esthetic doctrine he was a pro-,Paragraph
fessed adversary of Gothic jig-saw work. Gothic he had been,Paragraph
"taught to interpret as something barbarous. But now, upon be-",Paragraph
"holding the great cathedral, his learned doctrine was overthrown",Paragraph
"by immediate experience. And trusting the deep impression, he",Paragraph
cast aside the traditional prejudices of his time. He had per-,Paragraph
ceived the greatness and sublimity of Gothic art.,Paragraph
From intuitive perception he then proceeded to study and in-,Paragraph
"vestigation. A spirit always striving to order isolated experiences,",Paragraph
he reflected on his impression. His findings were given form and,Paragraph
"published in his famous essay Von deutscher Baukunst, dedi-",Paragraph
"cated to Erwin von Steinbach, the builder of the Cathedral. In",Paragraph
"its clear conception of general principles, the paper reveals the",Paragraph
divination of a genius. In language poetic with the passion and,Paragraph
"enthusiasm of youth, the author praised the originality of the",Paragraph
"Gothic building, which seemed to him “‘not a product of human",Paragraph
"hands, but a creation of nature, everything perfect in form, even",Paragraph
"to the smallest detail, everything subordinated to the whole.”",Paragraph
In his imagination he set the Cathedral face to face with the re-,Paragraph
membered models of classicism. Their polished beauty seemed,Paragraph
"to him the mere result of esthetic rules, while the naturalness",Paragraph
and even harshness of the Gothic building seemed to manifest,Paragraph
"creative power. Interpreting his experience, he came to say: “Art",Paragraph
"is formative long before it is fine, and yet is true and great, in-",Paragraph
"deed, often truer and greater than fine art itself.”",Paragraph
THE DUALISM OF THE CREATIVE INSTINCT,Title
We set out from this profound statement because it refers to,Paragraph
"ar i er Cn, sn",Paragraph
"ee, ee re, ee",Title
"into the problem of order, which is the core of our discussion.",Paragraph
Formative art and fine art: in this antithesis there are traced,Paragraph
and formulated two potentialities to be found in Western art.,Paragraph
"To be sure, this distinction is not meant to be a criticism of the",Paragraph
"results of artistic production, or a judgment comparing their",Paragraph
esthetic values. Both the opposing potentialities are immanent,Paragraph
in man’s creative instinct. Formative art and fine art: this antith-,Paragraph
esis differentiates two kinds of art produced by the creative,Paragraph
"instinct, the manifestations of which share in that inherent an-",Paragraph
"tagonism between nature and reason, sense and thought, which",Paragraph
has determined the culture of Western mankind ever since,Paragraph
Socrates the philosopher proclaimed in the agora at Athens the,Paragraph
"supreme function of the Nous, that is to say Reason. According",Paragraph
"to that antagonism, human creative instinct is to be seen mov-",Paragraph
"ing between two poles, manifesting itself in two different ways,",Paragraph
which may be distinguished as intuitive and constructive im-,Paragraph
agination. With these terms there are characterized two ele-,Paragraph
"mental impulses that grow out of a common root, but separate",Paragraph
"into two opposing directions, and acting in individuals, lead to",Paragraph
two different kinds of form.,Paragraph
"This dualism of creative instinct, based upon the everlasting",Paragraph
"antagonism of sense and thought, involves two different attitudes",Paragraph
towards the cosmos. The work of the artist is always based upon,Paragraph
"the intuition he has of the world. In his attitude to the cosmos,",Paragraph
the artist may see and fee] the world as a finite or infinite reality.,Paragraph
He may take reality as it appears in its overflowing exuberance,Paragraph
"and variety of individual life. His attitude is close to nature,",Paragraph
filled with awe and respect for the manifoldness of her mani-,Paragraph
"festations. Following this attitude, not yet wrested from sim-",Paragraph
"plicity, he will then produce forms of an individual character,",Paragraph
existing but once and not repeated. Guided by intuitive im-,Paragraph
"agination, faithfully devoted to the given object, this simple state",Paragraph
of creative instinct produces what Goethe called “formative art.”,Paragraph
"There is, on the other hand, an attitude which feels puzzled",Paragraph
"by reality, upset by the overwhelming exuberance of individual",Paragraph
"life, entangled by the multitude and variety of its appearance.",Paragraph
"The artist tending toward such an attitude, will look for the",Paragraph
"unchangeable in the changing, for the continuous in the spas-",Paragraph
"modic shifting of things, for the everlasting in the temporal, in",Paragraph
short for an ultimate law bringing order to the chaos of appear-,Paragraph
"ances. Subjecting the world to that law, which is the product of",Paragraph
"his own mind, he makes this law and its fixed principles the",Paragraph
starting point in creating his forms. Reducing the infinite detail,Paragraph
"of appearances to a certain system of norms and lasting measures,",Paragraph
"he aims at forms of an idealized type, at forms representing an",Paragraph
"image of highest perfection, an ideal of beauty itself. From such",Paragraph
a refined state of creative instinct came into being what Goethe,Paragraph
called “fine art.”,Paragraph
"Intuitive imagination and constructive imagination, true de-",Title
"votion to life in its individual aspects on the one hand, and in-",Paragraph
"tense desire for the absolute, for the general law on the other—",Paragraph
these are the two poles between which human creative instinct,Paragraph
swings in an everlasting rhythm. And as human life attains new,Paragraph
forms over and over again in the everlasting tension between,Paragraph
"Liberty and Law, so in the realm of art, the polarity of creative",Paragraph
impulse causes perennial changes in structure and a constant,Paragraph
"transformation of forms. Being well aware of this polarity, we",Paragraph
"use, to characterize it, a varying terminology: realism and ideal-",Paragraph
"ism, naturalism and stylism, the particular and the universal.",Paragraph
"And we distinguish times, nations, even whole epochs of civiliza-",Paragraph
tion by whichever of these two tendencies of creative instinct,Paragraph
is predominant.,Paragraph
"The highest creations of art, however, the great masterpieces,",Paragraph
"distinguished and honored by the name of classic, arise in those",Paragraph
"rare moments of history, when in a people or in a man these two",Paragraph
opposing tendencies of creative instinct come to a harmonious,Paragraph
"adjustment; where sense and thought, emotion and reason coun-",Paragraph
terbalance each other. Said Friedrich Schiller in one of his essays,Paragraph
on esthetics: “It is only when in the midst of all the changes of,Paragraph
"which the imagination is susceptible, reason maintains its rule—",Paragraph
it is only then that the divine or the ideal is manifested.” In lit-,Paragraph
"erature, for instance, such great moments appeared with Dante,",Paragraph
with Shakespeare and Goethe; in painting with Giotto; in music,Paragraph
with Johann Sebastian Bach. These great artists succeeded in,Paragraph
merging the two divergent forces of mind to a harmonious,Paragraph
"whole, thus, as exceptional individuals, demonstrating a com-",Paragraph
"plete integration of liberty and law. In architecture, a similar",Paragraph
integration has been realized only once in the course of its his-,Paragraph
"tory: in the Doric temple, wherein the harmonious spirit of the",Paragraph
"Greek has created a form that for its perfection became, in fact,",Paragraph
"the esthetic pattern, the classic model and measure, for all time",Paragraph
to come.,Paragraph
DUALISM OF FORMS,Title
"From this immanent dualism of man’s creative instinct, there",Paragraph
was derived that dualism of forms which is to be found through-,Paragraph
"out the history of Western art. If we distinguish classicism, mean-",Paragraph
"ing ancient art and its later revival, the art of the Renaissance,",Paragraph
"from Gothic and Baroque, we really distinguish with those terms",Paragraph
"two different species of forms. Raphael and Mathias Griinewald,",Paragraph
"though they are contemporaries, are guided by different con-",Paragraph
"cepts of form. When both painted the same theme, the trans-",Paragraph
"figuration of Christ, Raphael, in his famous picture in the Vati-",Paragraph
"can, gave a strong composition of figures, arranged in well-",Paragraph
"balanced symmetry, and the masses in complete equilibrium.",Paragraph
"Griinewald’s picture, however, which formed a wing of the great",Paragraph
"altar at Isenheim, is a tempest of emotion, a movement of float-",Paragraph
"ing and soaring lines, expressing the exaltation and mystery of",Paragraph
the biblical miracle.,Paragraph
The contrast between these two pictures representing the,Paragraph
same scene is a consequence not so much on the difference of,Paragraph
"national characters, but mainly of the different attitudes to",Paragraph
the problem of form. What is meant by that is to be seen even,Paragraph
"more clearly if we compare two buildings, such as a palace of",Paragraph
"the Renaissance, let us say, the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, with",Paragraph
"a medieval castle, the Castle of Nuremberg, for example. In",Paragraph
"its irregular form, the Castle of Nuremberg, a huge mass of",Paragraph
"buildings, does not seem to be planned at all, but to have grown",Paragraph
"wild, built up by the dynamics of nature that continue to act",Paragraph
"in its structure. The outlines of the building, erected on a steep",Paragraph
"hill, adapt themselves to the natural conditions of the site: they",Paragraph
cling to all the ledges of the rugged rock; and like a plant that,Paragraph
"draws its nourishment out of its environment, out of the acci-",Paragraph
"dents and conditions of its existence, this building seems in the",Paragraph
act of adjusting itself to its life-space. The purpose of the build-,Paragraph
ing is to serve as a shelter and defense. And its structure is de-,Paragraph
"veloped out of the functions it has to serve. In its forms, each",Paragraph
part of this building is determined and adapted to the particular,Paragraph
demands it has to fulfill. It is due to this underlying concept,Paragraph
that the building shows an irregular structure. Its form is dy-,Paragraph
"namic like all forms of organic growth, and full of individual",Paragraph
character like all creations of nature.,Paragraph
"Now, when we look at the Renaissance palace, its form, in",Paragraph
"contrast to the medieval castle, shows complete regularity. Its",Paragraph
"plan presents a figure of regular outline, its rooms are grouped",Paragraph
"around a rectangular system of axes, its structure forms a simple",Paragraph
"cube and its facades are founded on a symmetrical design, ac-",Paragraph
centing the middle part by the dominating architecture of the,Paragraph
main entrance door. The walls are divided into regular sections,Caption
by grouping the windows at equal intervals. The purpose of the,Paragraph
"building is also to serve as a shelter and defense. However, in",Paragraph
"bringing this demand into form, the individual necessities were",Paragraph
"subordinated to a general law, to the geometric law of regularity",Paragraph
"and symmetry. Even in setting and placing the building, every",Paragraph
accidental character of the site had to yield to the rigid rules of,Paragraph
the geometric law. It is from such a concept that the building,Paragraph
"obtained its static form, representing a general type derived from",Paragraph
an abstract principle of order.,Paragraph
The same dualism of forms is revealed in the art of town,Paragraph
planning. There is the irregular town “with streets curled as,Paragraph
"fancy dictated, wandering along the foot or the scarp of a range",Paragraph
"of hills, following the ridge of winding downs, and only by",Paragraph
chance stumbling briefly into straightness.” But this seemingly,Paragraph
"fanciful irregularity is not the result of a haphazard growth, af-",Paragraph
"fording by chance the gratification of picturesque effects, but",Paragraph
"the product of the most deliberate building, adapting each part",Paragraph
of the town to the topographical conditions of the site. On the,Paragraph
"other hand, there is the regular town, the plan of which is based",Paragraph
on a pre-determined system without regard for the topography,Paragraph
of the site and the natural contingencies.,Paragraph
The city of Edinburgh offers a spectacular example in which,Paragraph
both the regular and the irregular form are to be found side,Paragraph
by side. The city is located on a group of hills between which,Paragraph
lies a ravine that once contained a lake. The oldest part of the,Paragraph
"city sprang up round Edwin’s castle, built on one of the rocky",Paragraph
"hills in the south. From this castle a main thoroughfare, the",Paragraph
"High Street, descends to the foot of the valley, and around it",Paragraph
"developed the medieval town, its narrow streets and alleys fol-",Paragraph
lowing the contours of the site and presenting a most picturesque,Paragraph
sight with their irregular lines and winding curves. When in,Paragraph
the eighteenth century the town began to extend over the north-,Paragraph
"ern hills beyond the intersecting valley, the new parts, in ac-",Paragraph
"cordance with the ideas of classicism, were laid out on a regular",Paragraph
plan. A network of straight streets crossing at right angles and,Paragraph
"interrupted by large plazas of geometrical form, was imposed",Paragraph
"on the hilly site, affording to the new town an architectural regu-",Paragraph
"larity, sharply contrasting with the picturesque irregularity of",Paragraph
"the medieval parts. But the regularity, obtained at the price of",Paragraph
"a conflict with the topographical conditions, in this case had",Paragraph
somewhat dubious results: the streets in the new town climb,Paragraph
"up the hills in steep grades, and the regular squares and circles,",Paragraph
"developed along the slopes, looking like plates on an inclined",Paragraph
"tray, give the impression that they will glide off the next mo-",Paragraph
ment.,Paragraph
These examples illustrate that the development of Western,Paragraph
"art, as is stated in Goethe’s distinction between formative and",Paragraph
"fine art, is marked by a dualism of forms. Its history moves be-",Paragraph
"tween these two poles of the regular and irregular, of the static",Paragraph
"and the dynamic form. Both forms exist side by side, often even",Paragraph
"at the same time, independent of the changing modes of orna-",Paragraph
ment and decoration which indicate the succession of styles. It,Paragraph
is not that one develops out of the other: each of these types has,Paragraph
"its own evolution, producing buildings of high perfection, each",Paragraph
after its kind. And the history of art is the history of these mas-,Paragraph
terpieces.,Paragraph
ORGANIC AND MECHANICAL ORDER,Title
"Whether regular or irregular, static or dynamic, all form is a",Paragraph
final result of the desire for order. To build is to make a plan.,Paragraph
To plan is to follow a definite concept of order.,Paragraph
In accordance with the dualism of the creative instinct and,Paragraph
"the antithesis of intuitive and constructive imagination, we find",Paragraph
followed in building two different principles of order: one that,Paragraph
takes the structure as an organism; growing on its own accord-,Paragraph
ing to the proper and immutable law of its individual existence;,Paragraph
"adapted to its function and environment, as a plant or any other",Paragraph
"living organism grows, developing itself in its proper life-",Paragraph
"space. Then, in contrast to this principle, we find another idea",Paragraph
"of order taking the structure as mechanism, composed of various",Paragraph
elements put into order according to the immutable law of a,Paragraph
system a priori. Viewing these two different concepts of the prob-,Paragraph
"lem of structure, we speak of organic order as opposed to me-",Paragraph
chanical order.,Paragraph
"In building, the immutable law followed by mechanical order",Paragraph
"is based on Geometry. As a practical art, Geometry was founded",Paragraph
by the Egyptians. Promoted later by the Greeks to a system of,Paragraph
"thinking, it is one of the oldest sciences invented by the human",Paragraph
"mind, and is used to understand and explain the universe as a",Paragraph
"system of order. Space and number, as ideas of the unchange-",Paragraph
"able and immutable, were early abstracted from reality, and as",Paragraph
fixed principles of the infinite and absolute set against the fluc-,Paragraph
tuation of appearances and the variations of individual life.,Paragraph
Not before Geometry had been invented had that art come,Paragraph
into being which is called Architecture. It is probably safe to say,Paragraph
that the first creation which deserves this name was the Pyra-,Paragraph
"mid. The divine will that the Egyptians saw, or read into the",Paragraph
"Universe, was manifested in their mathematical concept of the",Paragraph
world’s order. And this concept was represented in their social,Paragraph
"order, symbolized in the static form of the pyramid. The broad",Paragraph
basis supporting the structure of this feudal society is formed,Paragraph
by the great masses of the working people. The pyramidal build-,Paragraph
"ing of society, then, grades up in a large hierarchy of classes to",Paragraph
"the small caste of the priesthood, and finally culminates in the",Paragraph

"into the sky. This is architecture in its primal state, developed",Paragraph

"~of builder and peasant, aptly recalls.” All indigenous building",Paragraph

"organic nature, which produces new forms over and over again,",Paragraph
developing each of its creations into its own individual character.,Paragraph
"To build is to create organisms the form of which, in their par-",Paragraph
"ticular individuality, is determined by the principles involved",Paragraph

"ever we look, at the state or the people, at economics or society,",Paragraph
"at science or art, fundamental changes are in process. A world",Paragraph
"of obsolete forms and institutions is coming to an end, another",Paragraph
"slowly struggles into existence. With violent concussions, that",Paragraph
everlasting spectacle of dying and growing is taking place again,Paragraph
on the stage of the world. With combat and convulsion the old,Paragraph
forms of order are broken to pieces. With intense resistance the,Paragraph
emancipation from traditional habits of law is carried through;,Paragraph
"emancipation from forms that once were original and full of life,",Paragraph
but which in the course of historical evolution have lost their,Paragraph
"primary meaning and their relationship to life. Reluctantly, but",Paragraph
"at last, the discussion is opened on the changed reality that forms",Paragraph
"our environment. And in the course of this great historical act,",Paragraph
"arousing our sympathy and provoking immediate participation,",Paragraph
"we realize the constructive forces of a new spirit that will stamp,",Paragraph
"like the stage director behind the scene, man, society and the",Paragraph
form of a new civilization to come.,Paragraph
"Forces of a new spirit! It is, indeed, a fundamental change in",Paragraph
thinking that is revealed in the reconstruction of life now per-,Paragraph
formed by the human mind. Wherever the primary problem of,Paragraph
"structure is thought of anew, it is thought of in concepts related",Paragraph
"to organic life, to man and nature. “Science,” said the English",Paragraph
"philosopher A. N. Whitehead, “‘is taking on a new aspect in",Paragraph
our time. It is becoming a study of organisms.” Guided by this,Paragraph
"idea of organism, the human spirit, ever active and advancing,",Paragraph
begins to think of new forms which are once again suitable for,Paragraph
our organic existence. The disastrous conditions into which an,Paragraph
excessive rationalism and a humiliating mechanism have forced,Paragraph
"‘our natural existence have awakened a new longing for nature,",Paragraph
have called forth a desire to be nearer to the sources of life. A,Paragraph
complete reversal of the outlook on life is taking place in these,Paragraph
"times: we see another approach of man to nature, this time how-",Paragraph
"ever, not in the sentimental spirit of a Rousseau, but in accord-",Paragraph

"this way, the wonder of creation and life anew.",Paragraph
Wherever the manifold forms of human institutions are,Paragraph

they are thought of i in terms of organic structure. Among these,Paragraph
"institutions, society first needs a new order, a problem now",Paragraph
under passionate discussion. Its solution is still to be worked,Paragraph

can now hardly be foretold. But from the new mode of think-,Paragraph

"ready advancing in the spheres of social and economic planning,",Paragraph
where economic activity is no longer considered under the as-,Paragraph
"pect of private profit only, but as a social function, as a service",Paragraph
"for the community. Finally, in politics there is also a change of",Paragraph
ideas in process: a general discussion has gone on since the,Paragraph
World War as to whether the traditional principle of static,Paragraph
"structure in the relationship between the nations, implied in the",Paragraph
"political term of the “Balance of Power,” could be replaced by",Paragraph
another principle of organic order called “The Society of Na-,Paragraph
"tions,” thought of as an organization guaranteeing the welfare",Paragraph
of the commonwealth by organic co-operation of all its members.,Paragraph
"It is a new spirit, and also a new mood, another temper of",Paragraph
the soul that is announced in these changed ideas of structure.,Paragraph
"Rooted in conscience, they proclaim a new direction of will,",Paragraph
"and based on the ethics of service, they establish new ideas of",Paragraph

It is this conflict of two opposing ideas of order that causes,Paragraph

"under its alluring spell over and over again. The eye, strongly",Paragraph

monumental building the impulsive force of the main axis is,Paragraph

"bursting energy, like an exploding skyrocket, into a bundle of",Paragraph
minor streets radiating from this center. And as beyond the plaza,Paragraph

"Modern Paris, indeed, presents the apotheosis of classicism,",Paragraph

Paris of Classicism is an architectural spectacle arranged in mas-,Paragraph
terful fashion—a pompous show consisting of a continuous series,Paragraph
"of monumental plazas and broad avenues, gracefully interrupted",Paragraph
by entertaining entr’actes in form of spacious parks and public,Paragraph
gardens. Within the splendid framework of this enchanting,Paragraph
"scene, there appear, like actors on the stage, many magnificent",Paragraph
"buildings, isolated or arranged in a well-composed group, but",Paragraph
"always intimately connected with, and related to, one another",Paragraph
by a co-ordinating system of geometrical axes. These monu-,Paragraph
"mental buildings appear in richly adorned vestments, they use",Paragraph
"a solemn and dignified language, and talk in a moving and de-",Paragraph
clamatory tone; and with their ceremonial attitude they play,Paragraph
their dumb part “A toutes les gloires de France.”,Paragraph
Voltaire once said that it is the task of art to increase the fame,Paragraph
"of the King, the splendor of the Court, and the welfare of the",Paragraph
"State. With Paris as setting, classicism has accomplished one of",Paragraph
the most imposing exemplifications of that statement. As a style,Paragraph
whose principles are based on an abstract law imposed upon,Paragraph
"reality, classicism reveals the complete identity of the concept",Paragraph
of art with that of the state then in existence. In the state of,Paragraph
absolutism even art is supposed to render homage to the sover-,Paragraph
"eign power. In fact, the architecture of classicism is grand, even",Paragraph
unsurpassable in all those qualities which at this time state and,Paragraph
society demanded of art: qualities characterized in French as,Paragraph
grandeur—élégance—représentation.,Paragraph
"With the creation of eighteenth-century Paris, classicism was",Paragraph
"at the zenith of its destiny. Full of admiration, the world looked,",Paragraph
"from then on, at the French capital, enchanted as well as be-",Paragraph
"witched by its glamor and glare. With the pattern of Paris, it",Paragraph
"seems, a universal and popular taste was created to which the",Paragraph
whole world was ready to surrender. Let it be added that this,Paragraph
"pattern, with its wide streets, broad avenues, and circular plazas,",Paragraph
in many respects anticipated the needs of that new ration-,Paragraph

"ally felt. Take all these facts together, and you have the reasons",Paragraph
for the immense and never-ceasing influence spreading from,Paragraph
Paris through the whole civilized world up to the present time.,Paragraph
THE CODIFICATION OF THE ACADEMIES,Title
It is due to the example of Paris that the spirit of classicism,Paragraph
"has triumphed over and over again. For three centuries, the",Paragraph
"esthetic doctrine of the style, although frequently impeached",Paragraph
"and strongly opposed, kept its supreme authority in the domain",Paragraph
"of city planning, landscape architecture, and architecture.",Paragraph
"This doctrine, however, was worked out by the academies.",Paragraph
"Founded as professional schools, these new institutes of science",Paragraph
"and learning carried on a new kind of scientific training in art,",Paragraph
"which, since the time of the Renaissance, has replaced the old",Paragraph
honorable apprenticeship of trades and crafts as it was practiced,Paragraph
in the Middle Ages. During the seventeenth and eighteenth cen-,Paragraph
"turies, the leading architects of France, Perrault and D’Aviler,",Paragraph
"Blondel and Briseaux, tried to establish a universal doctrine of",Paragraph
"architecture based on the incontestable laws of Geometry, on",Paragraph
the fixed principles of number and measure. The midday of,Paragraph
classicism is filled with continuous efforts to find out the secret,Paragraph
of proportions and to raise it to the sphere of mathematical laws,Paragraph
accessible to reason. The greatest endeavors were made to frame,Paragraph
the principles of geometric order into a canon of final rules that,Paragraph
can be taught as well as learned.,Paragraph
"This doctrine, once established, was supposed to be infallible.",Paragraph
"It formed, from then on, the norm and measure of production",Paragraph
as well as of criticism. It is in its name that judgment is passed,Paragraph
in all matters of taste. All artistic production is subdued to its,Paragraph
rules and regulations. Every problem of building is now thought,Paragraph
of in terms of the doctrine; all planning is based upon a system,Paragraph
a priori abstracted from the laws of Geometry. To that system,Paragraph
"of co-ordinate axes, as the guiding principle of esthetic compo-",Paragraph
"sition, was deliberately sacrificed, without any scruple, all regard",Paragraph
"for use, for immediate service to life. Even the organic growth",Paragraph
of nature was entirely subjected to the authority of abstract,Paragraph
Jaw. It is with the doctrine of classicism that the French style,Paragraph
of landscape architecture came into origin: in the regular gar-,Paragraph
"den (that new pattern created by André LeNétre), with its trel-",Paragraph
"liswork, cut lawns and groves formed of trimmed hedges, the",Paragraph
rigidity of the doctrine is shown in its last consequences.,Paragraph
THE DECAY OF THE CLASSICAL TRADITION,Title
After the society that had initiated the rise of classicism had,Paragraph
"been toppled over in the tempest of the French Revolution, it",Paragraph
"was the academies that kept alive, not so much the esthetic",Paragraph
"values of the style, but its theory. Handed down by these schools",Paragraph
"from generation to generation, the doctrine of classicism lives",Paragraph
on into our times. But cut off from the soil in which it was once,Paragraph
"embedded, detached from the social conditions from which it",Paragraph
"received its driving power, the tradition of classicism became",Paragraph
"an empty husk, a surviving adornment of a social state long",Paragraph
"passed away. As a merely academic doctrine, the classical tradi-",Paragraph
"tion from the Napoleonic period on led an isolated life, a life,",Paragraph
"so to speak, in vacuo. The spirit was definitely gone. The classi-",Paragraph
cal tradition itself began to fade.,Paragraph
The architectural forms accepted in ready-made shape were,Paragraph
"no longer understood in their functional meaning, but used",Paragraph
as handy elements in the artificial game of composition. With,Paragraph
"the rise of the academic theory, however, the ground-plan began",Paragraph
"to lead an artistic life of its own: the plan, from then on, was",Paragraph
considered and designed to be a geometric ornament. In the,Paragraph
"present time this sort of planning, as an art in itself, is still",Paragraph
"cultivated at the Ecole des Beaux Arts at Paris. “The plan,”",Paragraph
"said Le Corbusier, criticizing the esthetic formalism of that mode",Paragraph
"of planning, “has become a piece of paper on which black marks",Paragraph
for walls and lines for axes play at a sort of mosaic on a decora-,Paragraph
"tive panel making graphic representations of star-patterns, creat-",Paragraph
ing an optical illusion. The most beautiful star becomes the,Paragraph
Grand Prix de Rome.”,Paragraph
This esthetic game of geometric composition is continued in,Paragraph
designing the facades: the surface is divided into regular sec-,Paragraph
tions by a number of axes following each other at equal inter-,Paragraph
"vals, and it is then decorated with architectural details of style-",Paragraph
forms accepted in ready-made shape. These standard forms ap-,Paragraph
"plied in a merely decorative, not in a functional sense, consti-",Paragraph
"tute the only substantial element of that esthetic game, and it",Paragraph
is just this element which in the further development proves,Paragraph
to be variable and most susceptible to change. After classicism,Paragraph
had once made autonomous the forms and ornamentation taken,Paragraph
"over from ancient architecture, and utilized these historical",Paragraph
"forms to represent new contents of life, the whole treasure of",Paragraph
inherited forms was gradually set free; and this inheritance was,Paragraph
heartily welcomed by the academic school as a means of enrich-,Paragraph
ing their compositions. Once the Renaissance had pointed the,Paragraph
"way to the revival of an historical style, the nineteenth century,",Paragraph
"then, took the next step on this path by the Gothic revival in",Paragraph
"architecture, accomplished in the era of Romanticism. This era,",Paragraph
"with its broad extension of man’s mental horizon, produced a",Paragraph
general “historicizing’”’ of thought and evolved a fresh sensitivity,Paragraph
"to all past cultures, even to the most foreign of them. This evo-",Paragraph
"lution, in its consequences, led in architecture to the concept",Paragraph
of the historical styles as independent entities. With the Gothic,Paragraph
"revival, the other basic form element of Western architecture",Paragraph
"was made independent, leading from then on an existence, so",Paragraph
"to speak, in abstracto.",Paragraph
With the progressive breaking of social bonds in the further,Paragraph
"course of the nineteenth century, with the collapse of standards",Paragraph
and traditional value-concepts under the economic and social,Title
"transformation, there set in that unconfined individualizing of",Paragraph
"thought and feeling, characteristic of the modern age, from",Paragraph
which arose the critical problems of its art and culture. While,Paragraph
"at the beginning of the century, in the period of Greek revival,",Paragraph
academic architecture was still based on a common ideal of cul-,Paragraph
"ture, providing an unquestionable accord at least on problems",Paragraph
"of art, this common ideal began to waver, finally making room """,Paragraph
for the boldest subjectivism. This attitude abolished every,Paragraph
"homogeneous standard of judgment, and introduced a fateful",Paragraph
anarchy into all questions of taste. It is in this way that the,Paragraph
"architecture of the nineteenth century, after having tried one",Paragraph
"historical style after another, finally ended at an extensive eclec-",Paragraph
"ticism, which greedily and without any scruple devoured the",Paragraph
architectural forms and ornaments produced the whole world,Paragraph
over. And finally architectural production grew stiff in a barren,Paragraph
formalism.,Paragraph

SHOPPING AMONG THE STYLES,Title
"This formalistic eclecticism is still in vogue, and favored by",Paragraph
the popular taste. And there are many varieties of this modern,Paragraph
species of academic architecture. In its production it follows,Paragraph
some tradition of choice corresponding to personal tastes and,Paragraph
convictions. These varieties range from a dry and formalistic,Paragraph
"style-architecture merely imitating the historical patterns, to",Paragraph
"those free and ingenious productions, in which the inherited",Paragraph
"forms are felt afresh, and, filled with the inventive spirit of the",Paragraph
"architect, sometimes regain their original character. It is from",Paragraph
the virtuosoship of architectural design that these buildings gain,Paragraph
"their particular charm and their sensuous effect, which never",Paragraph
fail to suit the ordinary taste. And the eclecticist is on intimate,Paragraph
"terms with his public; he is, so to speak, the artist of the juste",Paragraph
"milieu, keeping ready for each project a solution that will satisfy",Paragraph
everybody's taste. For the house of the bourgeois he uses the,Paragraph
"Georgian or Colonial pattern, skilfully adapting it to modern",Paragraph
needs; and for public buildings he follows the great examples,Paragraph
"of classicism, debasing the heroic character of that style into a",Paragraph
cheap allegory of power and domination. Some vague idea of,Paragraph
Napoleonic imperialism is impressed upon the naive spectator,Paragraph
who views the new buildings of the Government of the,Paragraph
United States erected at Washington in 1934: a group of office,Paragraph
"buildings of modern steel construction, but blinded with classi-",Paragraph
cistic facades forming an endless parade of columns (and with,Paragraph
rooms behind these pompous facades so dark that at noon of a,Paragraph
bright winter day the lights have to be turned on).,Paragraph
"The eclecticist, then, never takes a risk: he always keeps the",Paragraph
"beaten but safe track of academic doctrine, carefully avoiding",Paragraph
any kind of experiment. In the face of the audacious adventures,Paragraph
"to which the spirit of modern building always braces itself, the",Paragraph
"eclecticist pretends to be the reliable expert of the profession,",Paragraph
the appointed guardian and Lord Keeper of its-traditional crafts-,Paragraph
"manship. In fact, the eclecticist is well acquainted with all the",Paragraph
"tricks and knacks of the profession, and his routine d’atelier is",Paragraph
not easily to be surpassed. It is he who is at home with all the,Paragraph
arts of esthetic detail: he has a good sense of color and decora-,Paragraph
"tion, and he knows how to design and use ornaments. In short,",Paragraph
"he is strong, even unassailable in all those things that can be",Paragraph
"taught and learned, and his professional skill consists merely",Paragraph
of qualities which can be acquired by artistic training and by,Paragraph
"cultivation of taste, power of judgment and critical faculty.",Paragraph
"Where such qualities are deemed sufficient, his accomplishments",Paragraph
are beyond competition. Owing to the high standard of his es-,Paragraph
"thetic culture, he achieves in his production a sensuous effect",Paragraph
"frequently lacking in modern buildings, which as yet scarcely go",Paragraph
beyond the merely utilitarian form.,Paragraph
By their quantity the works of modern eclecticism still deter-,Paragraph
mine the architectural aspect of our cities. Perhaps the most,Paragraph
"exemplary, certainly the most brilliant, work of this school is the",Paragraph

ECLECTICISM: AN ART FOR ART’S SAKE,Title
"It is, however, the weakness of this eclecticism, as of all kinds",Paragraph

their love for art is antipathetic to the ingenuous experience of,Paragraph

2. STATING THE PROBLEM,Title
THE CLASSICIST CONFRONTS MANCHESTER,Title
The nineteenth century at its beginning was burdened with,Paragraph
the glorious inheritance of the classical tradition. But with this,Paragraph
"century, called the century of technical progress, there soon",Paragraph
"arose new problems and practical needs, which were no longer",Paragraph
to be mastered after the fashion imposed by the classical doc-,Paragraph
trine. There came an early awakening to the fact that machine,Paragraph
"technique, bringing something wholly new into the world, was",Paragraph
destined to overthrow the traditional forms of life and society.,Paragraph
It was also soon perceived that an architecture using the his-,Paragraph
"torical styles, as if to express living thoughts in a dead language,",Paragraph
was unworthy of the creative spirit of the new epoch. Impulsive,Paragraph
artists came to rebel against the fate of being epigones. Brought,Paragraph
"up in the doctrine of classicism, they soon perceived that the",Paragraph
mere exploitation of the inherited treasure of historical forms,Paragraph
"in itself could not generate new ideas. Venerable ideals, in-",Paragraph
"herited as part of a great tradition achieved in the past, when",Paragraph
"repeated under conditions so entirely changed, could only be",Paragraph
debased into mere conventions—even when these ideals were,Paragraph
recalled with the most noble and faithful of intentions.,Paragraph
The rise of a new spirit in building goes back to the early,Paragraph
"decades of the nineteenth century. In 1824, Karl Friedrich",Paragraph
=»,Title
"Schinkel designed the Berlin Museum, whose Greek columnar",Paragraph
facades gave a monumental expression to the classic epoch of,Paragraph
"Goethe. But at this very time, when the Greek Revival was in",Paragraph
"full bloom, the same architect wrote the following: “It would",Paragraph
"be a sorry thing for architecture, and it would not deserve its",Paragraph
"rank in the circle of the other arts, if all the individual parts",Paragraph
developed in ancient times—such as the orders of columns and,Paragraph
"the kinds of moldings—were filed away, and nothing were left",Paragraph
to imagination but to make some new combination of these,Paragraph
ready-made forms. A scanty matter for reason!”,Paragraph
"A few years later, the same architect went to England on a",Paragraph
"study-journey. Passing through the new industrial districts, he",Paragraph
frequently encountered the brutal manifestations of the early,Paragraph
age of steam-power. He went to Manchester and there saw the,Paragraph
"_new factories, where people worked from fourteen to sixteen",Paragraph
"hours a day. The enormous masses of red. brick, designed by",Paragraph
"mere foremen—showing no architecture, as he said, and erected",Paragraph
only for the barest necessity—gave him a tremendous shock.,Paragraph
Under the almost terrifying impression he received from these,Paragraph
"grimy monsters, of which he made a sketch in his note-book,",Paragraph
he began to think of the fundamental changes that the new,Paragraph
Industrial Age would produce in the whole social and mental,Paragraph
life of man. And thinking particularly of the influence the new,Paragraph
"age would exert upon architecture, he wrote in his diary: “All",Paragraph
great ages have left a record of themselves in their style of build-,Paragraph
ing. Why should we not try to find a style for ourselves?”—~our,Paragraph
"own independent form, as he explains, which must start with a",Paragraph
consideration of the life by which we are surrounded; a style,Paragraph
that will find its greatest merit in adapting itself to a host of,Paragraph
new inventions which have not as yet been utilized in an artistic,Paragraph
"manner,",Paragraph
"With these prophetic words, Schinkel stated the architectural",Paragraph
"problem of his century. And as an architect, he also dealt with",Paragraph
"it practically. He undertook some important experiments, quite",Paragraph
isolated in their time for their daring gallantry. Among these,Paragraph
projects the audacious design for a proposed department-store,Paragraph
"to be erected in Berlin Unter den Linden, is perhaps the most",Paragraph
"advanced example. In its general form, the project did not",Paragraph
"wholly break away from historical convention, for Schinkel tried",Paragraph
"a synthesis of Gothic and Classic, of Northern and Antique form",Paragraph
elements. But the spirit in which the problem was conceived,Paragraph
"and treated was quite new, and signified a beginning. ‘The new-",Paragraph
"ness of conception appears in the bold design of the walls, pro-",Paragraph
"viding large window openings, great areas of light-flooding glass.",Paragraph
The principle on which this design is based is defined by the,Paragraph
architect himself as follows: “Emphasize construction; use ma-,Paragraph
terials frankly; no useless parts; all clear and natural.” That,Paragraph
"was, indeed, the language of a new century, the first manifesta-",Paragraph
tion of a new spirit in building.,Paragraph
"Once the problem of a new style had been posed by Schinkel,",Paragraph
the drive for its solution gave man no rest. There soon developed,Paragraph
an inner spiritual movement that guided its discussion and,Paragraph
passed it on from generation to generation up to the present day.,Paragraph
THE CHANGING STRUCTURE,Title
Referring in his statement to the “new technical inventions”,Paragraph
"to be utilized in building, Schinkel showed that he understood",Paragraph
the problem of a new style as one of structure—as primarily a,Paragraph
"morphological rather than an esthetic problem. In fact, these",Paragraph
new inventions offered by modern technique caused a definite,Paragraph
"change from within, and it is with the use of new materials, such",Paragraph
"as iron and glass, that there first became visible a striking change",Paragraph
of structure.,Paragraph
The use of iron for the purpose of construction offered two-,Paragraph
fold advantage: less space was taken up than by the traditional,Paragraph
"stone work, and more light was admitted into the building. Used",Paragraph
"jointly with glass, the iron construction proved to be particularly",Paragraph
"fit to cover the large and wide-spanned halls now needed, such",Paragraph
"as track sheds for the new railroads, and market and exhibition",Paragraph
halls coming into use with the rise of the modern city.,Paragraph
Iron construction was first used on a large scale when Henry,Paragraph
"Labrouste, architect-engineer, built the Bibliothéque Ste. Gene-",Paragraph
"viéve in Paris, in the middle forties. As a true representative of",Paragraph
that new spirit which thinks first of the organism of each struc-,Paragraph
"ture, the architect set up within the large reading-room of the",Paragraph
Library an iron skeleton. The vertical posts are formed by slim,Paragraph
"columns of cast-iron, from which thin arched girders arise, grace-",Paragraph
fully perforated and adorned with delicate ornament. These,Paragraph
serve as transverse arches for the two large barrel-vaults which,Paragraph
cover the reading room. This form provides ample light and an,Paragraph
"uninterrupted expanse, both best serving the function of the",Paragraph
room. The exterior of the building does not suggest the nature of,Paragraph
the construction so frankly revealed in the interior. Here it,Paragraph
seems as though the architect were still afraid of accepting the,Paragraph
consequences involved in his courageous design. Sticking to his,Paragraph
"academic doctrine, he gave the building a rather dry fagade with",Paragraph
"applied pilasters in the style of classicism. In this respect,",Paragraph
Schinkel had already deviated much farther from the conven-,Paragraph
tional pattern in his bold design for the proposed department,Paragraph
"store in Berlin. In his demonstrative project, the first instance",Paragraph
of experimenting with wide wall openings and large areas of,Paragraph
"glass, the change of structure is more conspicuous; if executed,",Paragraph
this building would have become a great sensation for his con-,Paragraph
temporaries.,Paragraph
"Further experience in the new iron construction, then, was",Paragraph
"gained with the early works of engineering. Among them, the",Paragraph
"Halles Centrales in Paris, built in 1853 by Victor Baltard, was",Paragraph
one of the advanced examples that gave a great impetus to,Paragraph
"modern building. In its full effect, however, the change of struc-",Paragraph
ture was first revealed to the astounded world with the Crystal,Paragraph
"Palace, erected in 1851 by Joseph Paxton for the Great Inter-",Paragraph
national Exposition in London. It is worth noticing that the,Paragraph
"builder was not a professional architect, but a gardener who",Paragraph
used his experience in designing greenhouses to build the great,Paragraph
exhibition hall. In many cases throughout history it has been,Paragraph
"just the outsider, who, favored by his freedom from prejudices,",Paragraph
has pushed forward the course of events. Using an iron skele-,Paragraph
"ton closed with glass, Paxton erected a vast hall of airy lightness,",Paragraph
the first dramatic instance of a reduction of the walls: changing,Paragraph
their traditional function of a solid enclosing and weight-bearing,Paragraph
"mass into a thin transparent shell, bearing no weight, and in-",Paragraph
deed supported by the iron frame. With that structure the tra-,Paragraph
"ditional idea of enclosed space, the dominant idea of classical",Paragraph
"architecture, is abandoned. It is supplanted by the idea of un-",Paragraph
"limited space: the world outdoors implied by the space within,",Paragraph
a grand achievement that the new spirit of modern building,Paragraph
would develop later on into a new architectural form expressing,Paragraph
a new feeling toward life.,Paragraph
There was still another factor tending to transform the struc-,Paragraph
ture from within: that is the needs that made themselves felt,Paragraph
with the development of modern comforts. Their growing pres-,Paragraph
sure is to be noticed in the changed conception of planning.,Paragraph
Schinkel erected for Wilhelm von Humboldt a new house in,Paragraph
"Tegel near Berlin, its design still based on the principles of",Paragraph
"the classical doctrine: the plan, developed in complete sym-",Paragraph
"metry, is formed around a central axis, along which is also ar-",Paragraph
ranged a large open entrance hall. The first break with the,Paragraph
"classic ideal, as yet of exclusive authority and carefully guarded,",Paragraph
"was made by Ludwig Persius, a disciple of Schinkel, and the",Paragraph
most gifted of his successors. He rejected the excessive passion,Paragraph
"for symmetry, which keeps the bulk of the building unbroken.",Paragraph
"This he did not for esthetic reasons, but because that passion,",Paragraph
"he said, restricted freedom in developing a useful and comfort-",Paragraph
able interior. With this argument he pushed on to the very heart,Paragraph
"of the problem, which goes far beyond a merely esthetic dis-",Paragraph
"cussion and refers first, and in an elementary sense, to the prob-",Paragraph
lem of structure.,Paragraph
"Persius built a great many houses in Potsdam and its environs,",Paragraph
and in all his projects he emphasizes the individuality of each,Paragraph
"particular case, doing justice to the nature of each building and",Paragraph
its special demands. He starts from the use each room has to,Paragraph
"serve, and he steadfastly tries to adapt the form and height of",Paragraph
the room to its special function. He keeps to the principle of,Paragraph
"free grouping, in order to arrange the rooms according to their",Paragraph
inner relationship. His plans are designed to provide the most,Paragraph
"favorable exposure to the sun, and to open to the rooms both",Paragraph
the near prospect of the garden and the distant view of the sur-,Paragraph
"rounding landscape. As for the exterior, this kind of planning",Paragraph
"results in a structure the various parts of which, according to",Paragraph
"their purpose, are differentiated in their architectural appear-",Paragraph
"ance, in the height as well as in the form of their roofs. In the",Paragraph
facades the different nature of the rooms is shown in the varied,Paragraph
"size and grouping of the windows, and in the form and arrange-",Paragraph
"ment of the necessary appurtenances, such as loggias, bay-win-",Paragraph
"dows and balconies. The buildings, clinging to the topographical",Paragraph
"contour of the site, are developed in intimate contact with their",Paragraph
soil.,Paragraph
It is this regard for life and nature that gives the houses de-,Paragraph
signed by Persius their simple charm and loveliness. In these,Paragraph
"well-formed houses, with their serene grace, there are already",Paragraph
"anticipated some of the ideas which much later, grown to full",Paragraph
"maturity, were realized in the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. In",Paragraph
"the architectural form Persius still adhered to historical patterns,",Paragraph
"but, aiming in his buildings at a more indigenous and popular",Paragraph
"effect, he preferred to go back to pre-classical styles: his forms",Paragraph
and details are selected from Italian patterns of the romanesque,Paragraph
"period and from motives of the early Renaissance. As a rule, he",Paragraph
used native materials found in the neighborhood where the,Paragraph
building was to be erected. And he utilized these materials with-,Paragraph
out concealment in a form of construction demanded by their,Paragraph
nature.,Paragraph
"The work of this new school of architecture, rising under the",Paragraph
"influence of Romanticism, has been appropriately termed Land-",Paragraph
"schafis-Architektur; and for good reasons Persius, the founder",Paragraph
"of this school, was called the master of the architectural idyll.",Paragraph
But one does no justice to the significance of Persius’ work for,Paragraph
the history. of modern building if one limits oneself to a merely,Paragraph
"esthetic valuation, appreciating only the delightful effects of his",Paragraph
ingenious eclecticism. It has often been noticed that in the art,Paragraph
"of Romanticism, which involves a great many heterogeneous",Paragraph
"elements, there is also implied a strong element of realism. This",Paragraph
"double tension of the era is clearly revealed in painting, and",Paragraph
perhaps it can be best realized in the work of the French painter,Paragraph
"Géricault, certainly one of the most genuine representatives of",Paragraph
"the romantic temperament, whose paintings were infused with",Paragraph
"a strong naturalism. Persius, the architect, was a contemporary",Paragraph
of a group of German painters that included such names as Otto,Paragraph
"Runge, Caspar David Friedrich, Carl Blechen and George Fried-",Paragraph
"rich Kersting. The works of this group, who in their choice of",Paragraph
"subject prove true and typical exemplars of the romantic spirit,",Paragraph
manifest an attitude of strict realism; and their realistic execu-,Paragraph
tion of subjects romantic in spirit has been characterized by one,Paragraph
"critic as Stimmungs-Realismus, which may be approximated in",Paragraph
"translation by “realism with overtones.” As for Persius, there is",Paragraph
no doubt that he was in accord with the attitude of this new *,Paragraph
school of painting; he consciously joined the drift toward,Paragraph
"realism, manifesting a fundamental change in the mode of per-",Paragraph
"ception and thought, and giving rise, in logical consequence, to",Paragraph
that basic change of structure which is to be noticed in building.,Paragraph
It is in this sense that his work was felt and estimated as new by,Paragraph
"his contemporaries, notably in a study, published in Forster’s",Paragraph
"Allgemeine Bauzeitung, on occasion of a memorial exhibition",Paragraph
after his untimely death in 1845. This voluminous and not un-,Paragraph
"critical essay is, of course, rooted in the esthetic ideas of the time.",Paragraph
The author characterizes the principle on which the work of,Paragraph
Persius is based as “picturesque” in contrast to the “architec-,Paragraph
tural” one of classicism. As in the meantime we have learned,Paragraph
to make structure the starting point of all discussions on archi-,Paragraph
"tecture, we must talk of “organic building” as opposed to the",Paragraph
mechanic order of classicism based on an external Geometry.,Paragraph
"Though the essay still sticks to an old-fashioned terminology,",Paragraph
the nature of the new principle is fully comprehended and,Paragraph
clearly characterized with respect to its structural tendencies.,Paragraph
"Summing up the results of this new conception, the author said:",Paragraph
"“Arranging the parts of his buildings, Persius always followed",Paragraph
"the demand of use, and almost always the form truly corresponds",Paragraph
to the particular nature of these parts: the halls show themselves,Paragraph
"as halls, the living rooms as real living rooms, both in their con-",Paragraph
trast and in their absolute form. The different sections of the,Paragraph
building are so characterized that from the nature of the species,Paragraph
"is developed the entity of the individual room, a concept that",Paragraph
7,Title
brings about the more differentiated contrast between hall and,Paragraph
"dining room, between living room and bed-room, between",Paragraph
kitchen and servant room.”,Paragraph
It is almost as if this contemporary criticism were groping for,Paragraph
that new term “functionalism” which was to become the dis-,Paragraph
tinctive note of modern building.,Paragraph
SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS,Title
"While the structure was changing from within, the buildings",Paragraph
were still dressed in a stylish drapery woven of historical forms,Paragraph
and ornaments. The slender columns of cast-iron carrying the,Paragraph
barrel-vault of the reading room in the Bibliothéque Ste. Gene-,Caption
"viéve, show a fine channeling, and end in Corinthian capitals,",Paragraph
skilfully designed with a sharp pencil. When in the sixties the,Paragraph
"use of cast iron fronts, first employed by James Bogardus, became",Paragraph
"common in New York, the facades manifested a progressive",Paragraph
"change of structure: with the windows separated now only by ,",Paragraph
narrow columns the walls began to shrink and the apertures to,Paragraph
widen and to admit a larger amount of light. But the garniture,Paragraph
"of the iron columns still remained classic, its particular style to",Paragraph
"be freely chosen from the catalogue of the mill, according to",Paragraph
personal taste. Architects had still to find the definite answer to,Paragraph
Schinkel’s question: “Why not a new style?”,Paragraph
"To open the discussion of this problem anew, Maximilian,",Paragraph
"King of Bavaria, a friend of Schinkel and a sovereign interested",Paragraph
"in architecture, undertook a daring experiment. About the mid-",Paragraph

new forms produced with these ideas are transformations of the,Paragraph
"old ones. It is, however, a need of the human mind to strive for",Paragraph
"the new, and not only to imitate, with more or less perfection,",Paragraph
the creations of the past. The basic idea of our epoch may be,Paragraph
"described as the striving for freedom, for free development and",Paragraph

tecture adjusted in its forms to use and purpose; an architecture,Paragraph
"made of the old styles which the zeal of science has reconquered,",Paragraph
"but offering in its products a fine, harmonious and particular",Paragraph
unity.”,Paragraph
The announcement characterizes the mentality of the time,Paragraph
and proves that even the problem of a new style could not be,Paragraph
conceived in other than historical terms. The result of this well-,Paragraph
"meant attempt, of course, was a complete failure. For a style",Paragraph
"cannot be invented, it must grow naturally from the soil of an",Paragraph
"integrated society, as an expression of a new collective conscious-",Paragraph
a.,Paragraph

"is to be found a long list of courageous pioneers, at the head of",Paragraph
"which is Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who not only came to an early",Paragraph
"understanding of the new problem, but also had a rather clear",Paragraph
"notion of the principles to be used in its solution. The record,",Paragraph
"indeed, is full of precocious experiments and daring advances",Paragraph
"into an unknown land, as it is also full of depressing failures",Paragraph
"and heroic defeats. To account for these, it has to be remem-",Paragraph
bered that while the courageous pioneers saw and understood,Paragraph
"the new building problems, the time was not ripe for a solution",Paragraph
to be attained. It is one thing to recognize a new problem; it is,Paragraph
"another to solve it, the possibility of a solution depending upon",Paragraph
"the time itself and its sociological conditions. An artistic idea,",Paragraph
"in the language of the sociologists, is only to be realized, when",Paragraph
the social milieu is ready to accept it. Only when an idea is so-,Paragraph
cially possible does it become a reality.,Paragraph
5. A MORAL REVOLUTION,Title
A CRUSADE FOR CRAFTSMANSHIP,Title
If there is one thing that the history of modern building,Paragraph
"teaches, it is that all efforts to renew the art of building remain",Paragraph
"futile, until its roots begin to be firmly embedded in the freshly",Paragraph
plowed soil prepared by the new social and economic forces.,Paragraph
"Look, for example, at the tragic fate of the Arts-and-Crafts move-",Paragraph

in the sixties. This reform movement was a moral crusade for,Paragraph

"ness; and if Morris, with his profound knowledge of the crafts",Paragraph
"of the Middle Ages, tried to re-enoble craftsmanship by a revival",Paragraph
"of its old techniques, the burning enthusiasm for their models",Paragraph
was spent less on the esthetics of style and form than on the,Paragraph
ethical and spiritual sustenance they believed them to contain.,Paragraph
Morris took it for granted that the breakdown of art in mod-,Paragraph
"ern times was caused by the undermining of work-morale, and",Paragraph
"the decline of craft quality. Looking back at the Middle Ages,",Paragraph
"when handicraft was in full bloom, he found a code of labor",Paragraph
that made the craftsman responsible for his product to the com-,Paragraph
"munity, a responsibility obliging him to work on a principle of",Paragraph
quality. The medieval guilds guaranteed this lofty work-,Paragraph
"morale by restricting the amount of work, on the basis that no",Paragraph
workman should sacrifice craftsmanship to quantity or do more,Paragraph
work than was needed to provide a living suitable to his social,Paragraph
"rank. In the medieval tradition of handicraft, Morris also found",Paragraph
a concept of labor that gave man the pleasure of work by mak-,Paragraph

"bedded in handicraft, was the highest expression of man’s pleas-",Paragraph
"ure in life and labor; it was “not luxury, it was right labor.”",Paragraph
EARLY EVILS OF INDUSTRIALISM,Title
This high ideal of work was shaken to its foundation by mod-,Paragraph
"ern industrialism, which by its new processes broke the tradi-",Paragraph
tional unity between producer and product. The modern sys-,Paragraph
tera of division of labor turned the workman into an operator,Paragraph
"of a machine, and as the machine does not turn out the whole",Paragraph
"of an article, but makes only a part of it, the workman is pre-",Paragraph
"vented from thinking of the product as a whole. Suppressing,",Paragraph
"by this mode of specialization, both the activity and expression",Paragraph
"of the whole individuality, the new system deprived the work-",Paragraph

"Now, under this new industrial system, what became of the",Paragraph
product itself? In the age of handicraft the product grew sim-,Paragraph
"ply, without any intermediary between the mind and the hand.",Paragraph
Producer and product formed an integral unit in the system,Paragraph
"of work. Modern industrialism, breaking this integral unit by",Paragraph
"the principle of division of labor, placed between the workman",Paragraph
"and his product a new factor—the designer. However, it took a",Paragraph
"long time before the designer’s task was really understood, and",Paragraph
it was not before the end of the century that a new type of spe-,Paragraph
cialized industrial designer was educated. In the early days,Paragraph
of Industrialism the designer was a man trained in ornamental,Paragraph
"design, and hired by the company to adorn the machine-made",Paragraph
product with some cheerful and buoyant decorations copied,Paragraph
from the sample-book of historical patterns. Having no under-,Paragraph
"standing whatsoever of the process of production, the designer,",Paragraph
"given free hand, produced patterns suited neither to the material",Paragraph
"used for the product, nor to the tool used for its execution.",Paragraph
Imitating the individual form of decoration which formerly,Paragraph
"flowed out of the manual work of the craftsman, he mistook the",Paragraph
"nature of the machine, which is strictly suited to standardized",Paragraph
production only. In adding historical ornaments to the indus-,Paragraph
"trial article, he vulgarized the new goods, and also profaned the",Paragraph
"old ones, from which his patterns were copied. But it was be-",Paragraph
"lieved that there is a common human desire for ornaments, and",Paragraph
"that it is too strong not to be satisfied. Thus, human ingenuity",Paragraph
"was misused to invent all sorts of machinery, tools and imple-",Paragraph
"ments to produce stamped, punched, pressed ornaments. It is the",Paragraph
"substitute, shabby in form, and using cheap materials, that char-",Paragraph
acterizes this early period of Industrialism.,Paragraph
The general debauchery of taste was first made public at the,Paragraph
"Great International Exposition in London, in 1851. The quality",Paragraph
of the average products to be found on the market is to be,Paragraph
judged from the Official Descriptive Catalogue. Here is a small,Paragraph
selection of articles as described in the Catalogue:,Caption
"“Imitations of flowers, made of paper, or modeled in wax,",Paragraph
showing their applicability as ornaments for the drawing room.”,Paragraph

"And so forth, other imitations and more substitutes, and at",Paragraph

"the country of improvements: day by day new materials, new",Title
"advances, new tools, new machines, new forces, are invented and",Paragraph

but at the cost of certain human faculties which will hardly be,Paragraph
"developed by the rationalistic mode as yet guiding the sciences,",Paragraph
the leaders of the new present.”,Paragraph
THE STORY OF THE RED HOUSE,Title
This was the historical environment into which William,Paragraph
"Morris was born. He was twenty-five years old, and already well-",Paragraph
"known both in poetry and in art, when he first came face to face",Paragraph
with the problem which decided his future career. The story,Paragraph
"of how he became a reformer of household art and decoration,",Paragraph
is told at length in J. W. Mackail’s The Life of William Morris.,Paragraph
He had just been married and was about to build himself a house,Paragraph
"near London. Philip Webb made the design, and for its time,",Paragraph
the planning was as original as was its material. It completely,Paragraph
"abandoned the type of the Italian stucco villa, the fashionable",Paragraph
"pattern of early Victorian, the type which Morris was fond of",Paragraph
describing as a square box with a lid. “The name of Red House,Paragraph
given to the new building was sufficient to describe it without,Paragraph
"ambiguity.” Built in red brick and roofed with red tiles, it was",Paragraph
the first attempt to re-establish the use of native building ma-,Paragraph
terials for the purpose of domestic building. The architect ob-,Caption
viously did not care for purity of style in his design: he frankly,Paragraph
used and mixed some reminiscences of Gothic and Baroque,Paragraph
"forms, such as the pointed arches and the high transom-windows",Paragraph
of a small rectangular shape. He merely tried to give a homey,Paragraph
"and domestic character to the house, and to make it harmonious",Paragraph
with its environment. “Externally the house was plain almost,Paragraph
to severity; the decorative features it possessed were construc-,Paragraph
"tional, not of the nature of applied ornament.” For its effect,",Paragraph
"it depended solely on the material, the color and the grouping",Paragraph
of the masses; and the straight-forwardness in using and show-,Paragraph
ing the material gave freshness and originality to the building.,Paragraph
In the history of modern building the Red House marked a,Paragraph
"new epoch. Built in 1859, it was the first example of a modern",Paragraph
"house that in its exterior and interior, in its decoration and",Paragraph
"furniture, was planned and executed as a single unit. And this",Paragraph
happened under sheer necessity: because when the shell of the,Paragraph
"house was completed, Morris could not find on the market “any-",Paragraph
thing to be bought ready-made that he could be content with,Paragraph
"in his house: not a chair, or table, or bed; not a cloth or paper",Paragraph
hanging for the walls; nor a curtain or a candlestick; nor a jug,Paragraph
"to hold wine or a glass to drink it out of, but had to be rein-",Paragraph
vented to escape the flat ugliness of the current article.” All fur-,Paragraph
nishings and decoration needed for the house had to be designed,Paragraph
by himself and made to order. But when he tried to realize his,Paragraph
designs he could not even find a workman able to execute them.,Paragraph
All the work of interior decoration was finally done under his,Paragraph
own eyes and direction.,Paragraph
A NEW TYPE OF WORKSHOP,Title
"The difficulty of furnishing the house when built was one, as",Paragraph
"Dr. Mackail says, that demanded some more practical solution",Paragraph
than that of getting each article singly and laboriously manu-,Paragraph
"factured, even had it been easier than it was to find manufac-",Paragraph
turers who would accept such orders. There was involved in this,Paragraph
"difficulty an actual problem, indeed, and its urgency, personally",Paragraph
"felt and experienced, kindled in Morris the idea of founding",Paragraph
his own workshop devoted to producing all sorts of beautiful,Paragraph
objects. With some of his friends he established the firm of,Paragraph
"Morris & Company, the name and wares of which have since",Paragraph
"become so widely known. “To Morris, who had not yet been",Paragraph
"forced by business experience into being a business man, the",Paragraph
firm probably meant little more than a definite agreement for,Paragraph
co-operation and common work among friends who were also,Paragraph
artists.” The associated members of the firm were the painters,Paragraph
"Ford Madox Brown and Burne-Jones, both already well-known",Paragraph
"for their designs for stained glass; Philip Webb, the architect;",Paragraph
"Faulkner and P. P. Marshall, both engineers by profession.",Paragraph
a a2,Title
"In the first announcement of the firm sent out in 1861, it was",Paragraph
stated that the members had felt the want of some one place,Paragraph
where work of a genuine and beautiful character might be pro-,Paragraph
"duced and obtained. Therefore, they had determined to devote",Paragraph
their time to designing any species of work susceptible of “art,Paragraph
"beauty,” and like a federation of medieval craftsmen, they had",Paragraph
banded themselves together to execute such work by co-opera-,Paragraph
tion and at the smallest expense possible. The firm was said to,Paragraph
"be established for the production of Mural Decoration, Carving,",Paragraph
"Stained Glass, Furniture and Metal Work. As the main prin-",Paragraph
ciple of the new firm—and this was the point and something,Paragraph
quite new—it was announced that all production was to be done,Paragraph
"by the members themselves, or under their personal supervision.",Paragraph
"At first, the young company was harshly ridiculed and ham-",Paragraph
"pered by the intrigues of jealous rivals. But soon, favored by",Paragraph
"large commissions, it began to flourish. Its products appeared",Paragraph
"at several exhibitions, and, greatly admired in the circles of the",Paragraph
"English gentry, soon acquired a wide reputation.",Paragraph
THE POET AS DESIGNER,Title
"This was the way that William Morris, the poet, became a",Paragraph
decorative manufacturer. Following the principle announced in,Paragraph
"the first circular of his firm, that nothing should be done in his",Paragraph
"workshop that he did not know how to do himself, he gradually",Paragraph
informed and trained himself in the techniques of the different,Paragraph
"branches of handicraft: in furniture and textiles, tapestry, ce-",Paragraph
ramics and printing.,Paragraph
"His own particular field of work, however, became the de-",Paragraph
"signing of flat patterns, especially for all kinds of textiles, for",Paragraph
"woven stuffs, tapestries and wallpapers. And his ornamental com-",Paragraph
positions are indeed of a quality unparalleled in the art of the,Paragraph
"nineteenth century, abnormally fertile though that century was",Paragraph
"in the production of ornament. For his patterns, Morris frankly",Paragraph
follows the medieval style of design: because to him the chief,Paragraph
thing was not so much the originality of form as the quality of,Paragraph
"execution. For his designs, Morris preferred, like his Gothic",Paragraph
"predecessors, naturalistic motifs taken from the vegetable or ani-",Paragraph
mal world and stylized in figures on a large scale. In form and,Paragraph
"color, all his ornament is founded on careful study of nature.",Paragraph
"In the designs of his skillful hand, even such an outworn motif",Paragraph
"as the Acanthus, used over and over again for decorative pur-",Paragraph
"poses, acquired a new life and freshness, as may be seen from",Paragraph
"one of his numerous wallpapers, where he turned this common",Paragraph
motif into a powerful ornament rising up like a wave in its,Paragraph
rustling rhythm.,Paragraph
"As a pattern designer, Morris revealed an imagination as in-",Paragraph
ventive as it was prolific. One of his biographers estimated the,Paragraph
total number of his designs for textiles and tapestries at about,Paragraph
"six hundred. And in all his designs, he revealed a sure under-",Paragraph
standing of the particular problem of flat pattern: an ornamental,Paragraph
composition that covers the ground in an harmonious balance of,Paragraph
"lines and colors, forming a pleasant but neutral background that",Paragraph
carries the eye agreeably along but attracts little attention to,Paragraph
"itself. Looking at his patterns from a distance, the particular",Paragraph
"motif fades away, it loses its individual meaning: it becomes a",Paragraph
"mere arabesque, form without content, a serene interplay of",Paragraph
tb,Title
ornamental lines limited only by the rules of strong rhythm.,Paragraph
"The pattern, thus, enlivens the ground without overcrowding",Paragraph
"it or, worse, perforating it. In this regard, the designs of William",Paragraph
"Morris not only attain the quality of their originals, but fre-",Paragraph
"quently even excel them, They really reach a degree of perfec-",Paragraph
"tion comparable to the best examples of Oriental carpets, even",Paragraph
to that most characteristic of their attributes: an absolute neu-,Paragraph
trality of pattern which enables them to harmonize with any,Paragraph
style and provides a universal adaptability and perpetual mo-,Paragraph
dernity that survives the transient phases of style and fashion.,Paragraph
"In fact, Morris’ designs justify the wide renown that they still",Paragraph
"retain, and their qualities will be treasured by the taste of every",Paragraph
epoch to come.,Paragraph
PRACTICAL RESULTS OF AN IMPRACTICABLE IDEA,Title
"William Morris was a poet and an artist, and it was in the",Paragraph
"cause of art that he became a passionate socialist. As a socialist,",Paragraph
"he saw the defects and weaknesses of the existing order, and was",Paragraph
conscious of the fact that the decay of art was due to the decay of,Paragraph
"society. As an artist, he plunged into the daring adventure of",Paragraph
trying to reform a decaying society by reviving craftsmanship,Paragraph
and restoring the dignity and morale of work. To re-establish,Paragraph
"the Golden Age of craftsmanship, where the worker knew no",Paragraph
"higher ambition than serviceability, Morris fought against the",Paragraph
"Iron Age, where the great aim was vendibility and profit. That",Paragraph
"heroic effort failed. In stating the problem, he misinterpreted",Paragraph
"the signs of the times; and, we must also admit, the stronger",Paragraph
"battalions were on the side of his adversaries. But, in aspiring",Paragraph
"to a new ideal of labor, he met, even in his retrospective manner,",Paragraph
"a very actual problem, which still remains to be solved.",Paragraph
"Moreover, the impracticable ideas of a sensitive artist, aspix-",Paragraph
"ing to the unequaled standards of a past perfection, succeeded",Paragraph
in bringing about some practical results of greatest importance.,Paragraph
"With his exemplary achievements in the field of household art,",Paragraph
Morris worked wonders in an educational way. Although it has,Paragraph
"to be admitted that the products of his workshop, made by hand",Paragraph
"by himself or his fellow-craftsmen, were so expensive that only",Paragraph
"a select circle of well-to-do amateurs were able to afford them,",Paragraph
his work set up a new standard of taste and awakened in the,Paragraph
English public a new sensitiveness to truth and genuineness of,Paragraph
"workmanship. All better new house furniture in England, it has",Paragraph
"been said, for example, owes something to Webb’s experiments",Paragraph
done for Morris & Company. It is in this way that Morris finally,Paragraph
"succeeded in bringing his arch-foe, machine industry, to a pause",Paragraph
for self-discipline. Forcing upon industry a new standard of qual-,Paragraph
"ity in production, his fanatic struggle against the use of the ma-",Paragraph
"chine mitigated, at the very least, the misuse of that new im-",Paragraph
proved instrument offered by modern technique.,Paragraph
EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF THE GOTHIC PATTERN,Title
"The types of Morris’ designs, the models of his furniture and",Paragraph
"the patterns of his tapestries and textiles, as it has been pointed",Paragraph
"out, were taken from medieval sources. Thus, his work was not",Paragraph
in the nature of an original creation. But inspired by the same,Paragraph
"ideals as were inherent in Gothic art, it was based solidly on",Paragraph
"the feeling of truth, honesty and naturalness. And to that extent,",Paragraph
"and for its time, it was original. In the vast flood of a merely",Paragraph
formalistic architecture produced in the sixties by the sham,Paragraph
Gothic Revival best represented in the extensive work of Sir,Paragraph
"Gilbert Scott (which produced, as Mr. Kenneth Clark has said,",Paragraph
"so little on which our eyes can rest without pain), the work of",Paragraph
William Morris and his comrades stands out like a green island.,Paragraph
To adhere to the Gothic tradition was for Morris not a choice,Paragraph
"but a following of true mental kinship. And he revealed, indeed,",Paragraph
an amazingly positive feeling for modern problems of structure,Paragraph
"when he said: “We should take Gothic architecture by the hand,",Paragraph
and know it for what it was and what it is: a magnificent mani-,Paragraph
"festation of organic order. Proceeding on such a tradition, one",Paragraph
avows a principle of structure that evolves its forms in the spirit,Paragraph
"of strict truthfulness, following the conditions of use, material,",Paragraph
and construction.”,Paragraph
The principle characterized in this statement gives the key to,Paragraph
the modern problem of structure. But in trying to interpret,Paragraph
"these problems, Morris still needed the image of Gothic archi-",Paragraph
tecture; for the age could not think of its problems of building,Paragraph
"in other than historical form and terms. It is, however, a re-",Paragraph
"markable fact, and by no means an accident, that all the archi-",Paragraph
tects who are found to be forerunners and pioneers of the spirit,Paragraph
of modern building were enthusiastic admirers of Gothic art,Paragraph
and sworn enemies of Renaissance architecture. On another oc-,Paragraph
"casion, Morris said that he found it difficult to put himself in",Paragraph
such a frame of mind that he could accept even St. Paul’s Ca-,Paragraph

"(1814-1879), a constructive spirit, made an impassioned plea for",Paragraph
"the adoption of Gothic, the great national tradition of his coun-",Paragraph

1. THE ROLE OF THE ENGINEERS,Title
THE LINE OF CREATIVE BUILDING,Title
Tracing the line of creative building through the course of,Paragraph
"the nineteenth century, we will find it keeping aloof from the",Paragraph
precincts of high architecture and taking its direction strictly,Paragraph
"among utilitarian buildings. In fact, the great achievements of",Paragraph
"the century in building, the works of historical significance,",Paragraph
originated from the disciplined mind of the engineers rather,Paragraph

neers which wholly changed the face of the cultivated land.,Paragraph
While architecture at this time was in general reactionary in its,Paragraph
"attitude and reminiscent in its effect, and even the best works of",Paragraph
"the leading academic masters revealed but vestigial ideas, the",Paragraph
works of the engineers appeared as buildings of a really creative,Paragraph
"nature, announcing something new and pointing towards the",Paragraph

"opened up, forms as new in their nature as they were strong and",Paragraph
exciting in their effect.,Paragraph

"labor, which dominates the modern process of production, spe-",Paragraph
"cialization took place in the building profession, too, dividing it",Paragraph
"into two different fields, artistic and constructive—and that to its",Paragraph
great detriment.,Paragraph
Specialization in building set in pretty early. It began with,Paragraph
"the development of military architecture, when the rise of long-",Paragraph
range guns made necessary a new art of fortification requiring,Paragraph
"special experts. It was then definitely established in France, the",Paragraph
"country of reason, where the art of engineering, after Italy’s",Paragraph

"rowing historical details, by using ready-made ornaments and",Paragraph
by contriving ever-new variations of the perennial five orders,Paragraph

There are many examples illustrating the different methods,Paragraph
of procedure followed by the engineer and the architect. Many,Paragraph

recognition as an outstanding achievement on the part of the,Paragraph

monumental pillars and gates draped with historical forms taken,Paragraph

ON THE NATURE OF TECHNICAL FORM,Title
At a time when the architects voluntarily restricted themselves,Paragraph
"to the esthetic problems of building, busy about solving them",Paragraph
"in the spirit of the academic doctrine, the engineers took in hand",Paragraph
"the new problems of construction and developed, in the way of",Paragraph
"methodical research and tedious experiment, both the theoret-",Paragraph

"architects, devoted only to the formalistic problems of style, be-",Paragraph
came more and more estranged from the fundamentals of their,Paragraph

kept pace with the practice of building. Thereby they rendered,Paragraph
an eminent service to architecture. Their notable mission con-,Paragraph
sisted in conserving the principles of real creative building at a,Paragraph
"time when architecture, fatally misguided by its one-sided es-",Paragraph
"thetic point of view, drove at full speed to catastrophe. With the",Paragraph
"results of their work, which proved to have a strong sensuous",Paragraph
"effect, though they did not follow the academic doctrine at all,",Paragraph
the engineers propagated the moral demand to keep away from,Paragraph
"esthetics and to deal, first of all, with the technical problems of",Paragraph
building and the demands of use. It was due to the educational,Paragraph
influence springing from the works of the engineers that the,Paragraph
"architect’s attention, as yet one-sidedly concentrated on the form",Paragraph
"alone, the final result of artistic creation, was gradually turned",Paragraph
"again to the way to form, to the process of creating the form.",Paragraph
"All technical form is pure form of use. From the first tools,",Paragraph
"from hammer and plow, up to the modern dynamo turbine, all",Paragraph
technical form was developed solely out of the function the ob-,Paragraph
ject had to serve. And the history of the technical form is but a,Paragraph
continuous process of refining the form by more and more adapt-,Paragraph
"ing it to its function. Step by step, advancing from experiment",Paragraph
"to experiment, the form is materialized, extricated and pulled",Paragraph
out of the matter and gradually developed into its final state in,Paragraph

in the process of production. The technical form is not invented.,Paragraph
on the drawing board through the efforts of the individual de-,Paragraph
"signer, but developed in practice in a process of collective effort,",Paragraph
and it is on that account that Lewis Mumford calls engineering,Paragraph
the most impersonal of the arts. As in horticulture a new species,Paragraph
of plant or flower is produced by means of crossing and cultiva-,Paragraph
"tion, so in technique the way to create a new form is by a process",Paragraph
of breeding carried through a long series of tedious experiments.,Paragraph
"And this process of cultivation and refinement, kept in motion",Paragraph
"by collective efforts, is not ended until the pure form of use is",Paragraph
"obtained, a form satisfying the demands of highest efficiency. In",Paragraph
"this way all our modern machinery, our ships and locomotives,",Paragraph
"our automobiles and airplanes, found the final forms we now",Paragraph
so highly admire for their perfection. In the rise of these forms,Paragraph
"of modern technique, a process of morphological evolution has",Paragraph
passed before our eyes. In every single stage this persistent im-,Paragraph
pulse towards highest efficiency has enhanced the purity of the,Paragraph
form.,Paragraph
"In these products of modern technique, in the works of the",Paragraph
"engineers, architecture was given a new orientation, not from an",Paragraph
"esthetic point of view, it goes without saying, but from the point",Paragraph
"of view of structure: as pure form of use, adapted to a certain",Paragraph
"function, all technical form is organic in character; and so by its",Paragraph
nature it demonstrates the basic principle of order that the new,Paragraph
spirit of building is pursuing.,Paragraph

RISE OF A NEW ORNAMENT,Title

"Up to the time of William Morris’ death, all attempts to",Paragraph

with the past. Its disciples not only envisaged their problems by,Paragraph
"historic analogy, but also took over the language of the historical",Paragraph

"gave, as we have seen, a new meaning to the problem of struc-",Paragraph
ture and to the entire scene a new aliveness.,Paragraph
Let us take a glimpse at the esthetic temper of the moment.,Paragraph
"In 1889, as a widely visible landmark for the World’s Exposition",Paragraph
"in Paris, the French engineer, Gustave Eiffel, erected the great",Paragraph

The effect of this powerful demonstration was rather disrupt-,Paragraph

all of them belonged to the same generation as Ruskin and,Paragraph
Morris.,Paragraph
The new generation was enchanted. Full of admiring ap-,Paragraph
"proval, it stood before this thrilling spectacle and accepted it",Paragraph
as a revelation of the form of its own age. It felt simply over-,Paragraph
whelmed with the new beauty. Its conviction was eloquently,Paragraph
"expressed by Henry van de Velde, who in the further course of",Paragraph
the movement was soon to ascend to the réle of a leader. “There,Paragraph
"is a class of men,” he announced in one of his first manifestoes,",Paragraph
“from whom we cannot withhold the title of artist. Their work,Paragraph
"rests, first, on the use of materials hitherto unknown to build-",Paragraph

"that of the great cathedral builders. These artists, the creators",Paragraph
"of a new architecture, are the engineers. The soul of their work",Paragraph
is Reason. The means is Calculation. The consequence of their,Paragraph
use of reason and calculation may be the surest and purest,Paragraph

We will attach no more importance to these emphatic words,Paragraph

"reality, his method of procedure is directed straightforwardly to-",Paragraph
"wards the exact fulfillment of the demand for efficiency, and in",Paragraph
"adapting his structure to this end, he develops the form that",Paragraph

a.,Paragraph

an error to search for beauty in any other forms than in those,Paragraph
best suited to their purpose.”,Paragraph
THE SEARCH FOR A GUIDING PRINCIPLE,Title
"When, in the early nineties, the generation of Henry van de",Paragraph
"Velde pushed forward into the Art Nouveau Movement, it was",Paragraph
the previous reform movement in England and the successful,Title
experiments in a new realistic architecture essayed by William,Title
"Morris’ followers, in the domain of domestic building, from",Paragraph
which they took their ideas and drew their inspiration. At about,Paragraph
this time in Germany another experiment toward such a realistic,Paragraph
"architecture was made by Alfred Messel, when he built the",Paragraph
Wertheim’s Department Store in 1896. In this case efficiency de-,Paragraph
"manded a light-flooded interior, so the architect dissolved the",Paragraph
"enclosing walls into a system of vertical granite piers, and filled",Paragraph
the wide intervals with great areas of glass. This building still,Paragraph
"contained some reminiscences of historical forms, and the old-",Paragraph
fashioned roof of French descent certainly does not agree with,Paragraph
the modern system of piers. Yet the design on the whole mani-,Paragraph
fested a strong feeling for reality. By its undaunted realism it,Paragraph
"gained great influence among the young generation, giving a",Paragraph
fresh impetus to the new spirit of building.,Paragraph
To think realistically and be guided by the demand of use and,Paragraph
purpose became to the young generation an obligation as sacred,Paragraph
as it was self-evident. Yet not thus could they realize the further,Paragraph
goal of innovation set up by their youthful self-confidence. They,Paragraph
longed for their own language of form. They wanted to be rid,Paragraph
of historical style concepts and to find an elementary form that,Paragraph
belonged to their own time. To overcome the complete anarchy,Paragraph
"of form they found themselves living in, an anarchy brought",Paragraph
about by the indiscriminate use of old styles and the thought-,Paragraph
"less copying of their forms, they realized that the movement first",Paragraph
"needed the rigid guidance of a principle of structure, a principle",Paragraph
of general validity by which creative instinct would be bound,Paragraph
and directed anew. In seeking such a guiding principle that,Paragraph
"could help to interpret the actual problem of structure, their",Paragraph
"predecessors, as we have seen, returned to Gothic art. To them,",Paragraph
such a guiding principle was inherent in the creations of modern,Paragraph
"technique, the only works of the time that revealed not only",Paragraph
"a style of complete unity, but one in which there was also a novel",Paragraph
"beauty. This guiding principle, followed by modern technique,",Paragraph
was defined by Henry van de Velde in terms of “logical concep-,Paragraph
tion” and “reasonable beauty.” And intrigued by its generative,Paragraph
"force, on it he based the idea of a new style.",Paragraph
SOCIOLOGICAL GROUNDWORK,Title
If the definition of the principle was rather vague and de-,Paragraph
"batable, the tendency of the new belief was clearly revealed,",Paragraph
when van de Velde said that a thing can be shaped into a form,Paragraph
"that corresponds to its nature and natural law, only when the",Paragraph
process of production is developed according to reason. When,Paragraph
"van de Velde, in a terminology of his own, talked about a prin-",Paragraph

really endeavoring to interpret with this somewhat rationalis-,Paragraph
tically colored phrase the structural problem of the pure form,Paragraph
of use. He was groping for a definition of the principle of or-,Paragraph
ganic order.,Paragraph
This becomes manifest in one of his later writings. He ex-,Paragraph
"plains at greater length the leading idea of his theory, when he",Paragraph
discusses the structural character of the styles. And he contrasts,Paragraph
"the organic styles which he calls “the styles of the great tribes,”",Paragraph
"with the styles of the Renaissance and its descendants, the Ba-",Paragraph
"roque and Rococo, which, as he says, divorced the idea of beauty",Paragraph
"from that of purpose, deliberately failing to recognize the func-",Paragraph
tion of what had once been organic.,Paragraph
"As a matter of fact, with his theory, which was less concerned",Paragraph
with esthetic problems or with a doctrine of beauty than with,Paragraph
"the problem of structure itself, van de Velde developed a new",Paragraph
"morphology, the basic principle of which was a clear response",Paragraph
to the demand for organic order. And the progress of the new,Paragraph
"spirit of building in knowing and penetrating its problem, is",Paragraph
revealed in the fact that van de Velde did not seek a justification,Paragraph
for his doctrine in the domain of esthetics alone. He achieved,Paragraph
"a sociological basis for his theory, arguing that it is the principle",Paragraph
of organic structure that determines the thought of our time,Paragraph
and acts as the guiding idea in the process in which all phases,Paragraph
of society and economy are being transformed. To follow this,Paragraph

"foundations, they plunged into an attack on that part easiest",Paragraph
of access but least essential to the whole: ornament. Spurning,Paragraph

"The history of art proves, however, that the advent of a new",Paragraph

visible in the agile and easily changeable art of decoration. Here,Paragraph
the artist occupies himself with covering the surface of furniture,Paragraph
and all small objects of use with fresh ornamental forms that,Paragraph
manifest the new direction of the imagination. And so it was,Paragraph
in the history of modern building. With the rise of the Art,Paragraph
"Nouveau movement, a fresh start was made with the invention",Paragraph
"of a new ornament. And to begin with the beginning, the young",Paragraph
"revolutionists first designed a new type for printing—and, artists",Paragraph

the essential problems of building.,Paragraph
Throughout the whole movement plenty of new forms were,Paragraph

the stage of creating ornaments. The great hopes based on the,Paragraph
invention of a new ornament show their exalted belief in the,Paragraph

was considered as much a channel for self-expression as any other,Paragraph

GOTTFRIED SEMPER,Title
Such ideas were not quite new. Let it be remembered that,Paragraph
similar definitions had been used and discussed about two gen-,Paragraph
erations ago by the German architect Gottfried Semper (1803-,Paragraph
"1879) . He spoke of “a constructive, or better dynamic principle",Paragraph
ny.,Paragraph
"of ornamentation,” and he demanded that each part of a work",Paragraph
"as well as its whole should manifest what it has to do, in other",Paragraph
"words should express its function; and this not only by its form,",Paragraph
but also in its ornament. Regretting the lack of a book teaching,Paragraph
the principles of style in their adaptation to the new inventions,Paragraph
"of science and manufacture, he devoted a good part of his life",Paragraph
"to studies aimed to fill that gap, and in 1860-1863 published a",Paragraph

“YACHTING STYLE”,Title
It is in the work of van de Velde himself that we may observe,Paragraph
the nature of this new style in its purest and most unre-,Paragraph
strained form. He is the real initiator as well as the most original,Paragraph
inventor of that abstract and spiritual ornament which gave the,Paragraph
"Art Nouveau movement its particular character, and which was",Paragraph
soon discredited by the inferior works of unscrupulous imita-,Paragraph
tors. There is no better way to describe the nature of this style,Paragraph
and to characterize the principle of structure on which it is based,Paragraph
than by quoting van de Velde’s laconic statement: ‘“The line is,Paragraph
a force.” A new path of self-expression was revealed in these or-,Paragraph
namental lines overloaded with symbolism. That this ornament,Paragraph
grew out of painting is to be seen from the early designs of van,Paragraph
"de Velde, flat patterns for rugs and woven stuffs, patterns which",Paragraph
"obviously poured from a brush, not from a pencil. What van",Paragraph
"Gogh, the painter, achieved with the dramatic force of his brush-",Paragraph
"strokes, van de Velde sought in the expressive lines of his ab-",Paragraph
"stract ornament. With it, there were already realized certain",Paragraph
ideas which more recently have dominated the school of abstract,Paragraph
painting.,Paragraph
Starting as a painter and from ornament and proceeding self,Paragraph
"taught to building, van de Velde, the architect, developed an",Paragraph
individualistic style which reveals unmistakably in every detail,Paragraph
his characteristic handwriting. The tendency towards abstraction,Paragraph
"which kept his mind in subjection, made him prefer plain and",Paragraph
"smooth forms of various moldings, such as are to be seen",Paragraph
"in the decoration for the entrance hall of the Weimar Museum,",Caption
and in the architecture of the little theater which he built in,Paragraph
the name of the Deutsche Werkbund for the Exposition at,Paragraph
Cologne in 1914. Looking at this individualistic example of,Paragraph
"functionalism, one may be disposed to take it as an effective an-",Paragraph
ticipation of the streamline theory rather than as an experiment,Paragraph
in modern dynamic architecture. It is from this preference for,Paragraph
curved lines that the Brothers Goncourt characterized his man-,Paragraph

SENTIMENT VERSUS REASON,Title
When van de Velde’s attention was once called to the fact that,Paragraph
his furniture was constructed in open conflict with the nature,Paragraph
"of the material, he bluntly declared to the objector that for a",Paragraph
long time he had been convinced of the inadequacy of wood as,Paragraph
"material for his designs, and that he anticipated the discovery",Paragraph
of a more suitable material which could be cast: a remark that,Paragraph
seemed to foresee the invention of the steel chair of today.,Paragraph
r. va,Title
"However, there was lying in wait a conflict between the com-",Paragraph
"mand of reason, at first proclaimed as the guiding principle of",Paragraph
"the movement, and the exuberant urge to expression that poured",Paragraph
itself out in the forms and decorations of the Ari Nouveau. So,Paragraph
strong was the intensity of the urge that all craft traditions and,Paragraph
"technical rules, all laws of material and construction, even the",Paragraph
"most obvious demands of use and purpose, were cast aside. That",Paragraph
first fine consecration to the logic of a reasonable concept was,Paragraph
completely forgotten. The rational doctrine with which the,Paragraph
"movement began, based as it was on the controlling power of",Paragraph
"reason, was offset, in the result, by a world of irrational forms",Paragraph
that merely reflected the uncontrollable urge to express. Senti-,Paragraph
ment became once more victorious over reason. The theory of,Paragraph
the movement fell a victim to the wayward willfulness of fantasy.,Paragraph
The youthful band took the field to seek and to find the eternal,Paragraph
"style of the pure form of use, but they became mired in the or-",Paragraph

trated in a fine episode told by Gotthard Jedlicka in his book on,Paragraph
"Toulouse-Lautrec. In 1894, van de Velde built himself a small",Paragraph
house in Uccle near Brussels. Down to the last detail it was in-,Paragraph
"tended to demonstrate his own ideas. To it, one day, came",Paragraph
Toulouse-Lautrec and Joynant his friend and biographer. The,Paragraph
"guests, after having inspected the house, were charmed with",Paragraph
their impressions. Nothing had been left to chance: the library,Paragraph
"was really a place to study in, the nursery, painted in white, was",Paragraph
joyous. The hostess’ gown harmonized beautifully with the din-,Paragraph
ing room and the colored glasses on the table. The colors of the,Paragraph
"plates, even of the food in the dishes were but single parts of an",Paragraph
"ensemble. The tendency towards harmony, as Joynant diffidently",Paragraph
remarked was rather too distinctly felt. They were perplexed,Paragraph
with the play of valeurs covering the table cloth; lit up by the,Paragraph
"sun, the grating of the windows cast its shadow on the floor; the",Paragraph
"light, falling through the stained-glass window panes, split the",Paragraph
room in layers of various colors. Yellow eggs and red beans were,Paragraph
"served on china, tinted in green and violet. Joynant, a gourmet,",Paragraph
later remarked cynically that it all seemed to have been done at,Paragraph
the expense of the cooking. The guests said farewells. On the,Paragraph
"way home, their opinions, as they reflected on their impressions,",Paragraph
"underwent a change. “Well,” said Toulouse-Lautrec at last, “the",Paragraph
"only successes are the bathroom, the nursery, painted with white",Paragraph
"enamel, and the W. C.”",Paragraph
"In that story, all is told. The sharp criticism that lay in the",Paragraph
gentle irony hit not only this single attempt but the whole move-,Paragraph
ment. The new faith was unable to prevent a temporary relapse,Paragraph
into the old manners of individualism which were at odds with,Paragraph
"the theory. In practice, all structure, even the objects of pure",Paragraph
"use, were interpreted as “objets d’art” and treated as vehicles",Paragraph
"for a personal artistic expression, and the style they had set out",Paragraph

of an impersonal technique.,Paragraph

"individual creative genius, manifesting unbounded force of",Paragraph

"already from our present point of view that, seen in historical",Paragraph
"perspective, we can appreciate them merely as museum pieces.",Paragraph
"Exhibited as such in collections of decorative art, they will reveal",Paragraph

mains only an episode. It was a courageous experiment look-,Paragraph
"ing towards the future, as estimable as the result was dubious.",Paragraph
But the fate of evanescence destined to its creations did,Paragraph
not diminish the vital power of the doctrine. Its continued in-,Paragraph
fluence is proved in the practical results that followed the en-,Paragraph
lightenment provided by van de Velde and his comrades. It is,Paragraph
the lasting merit of van de Velde that he first saw and rightly,Paragraph
formulated an actual problem of the time. Disclosing its relation,Paragraph
"to the driving forces and guiding ideas of the time, he removed",Paragraph
the discussion from the limited domain of esthetics and put it,Paragraph
under the wide aspect of a new comprehensive culture. The,Paragraph
"ideal itself has a generative force, and it matters but little how",Paragraph
long the practical results of this ideal remain unrealized. When,Paragraph
"van de Velde and his followers attacked the problem from above,",Paragraph
beginning with the outside and demonstrating the new ideas in,Paragraph
"the form of a new ornament, they were forced to do so by the",Paragraph
"unsettled conditions of the time, which was still not ripe for",Paragraph
accepting the full change of structure in building itself.,Paragraph
"“There was a moment in the history of the movement,” van",Paragraph
"de Velde once said, ‘“‘when our task was revealed to us. At that",Paragraph
"moment, we freed the objects of our surroundings from all orna-",Paragraph
"ment, and began to expose their joints and skeletons, in order",Paragraph
to permeate ourselves with the logic of these elementary forms.”,Paragraph
It is by returning to this task asking for the purification of form,Paragraph
that the movement found its way out again of the blind alley,Paragraph
where it had become stuck with its emotional adventure of creat-,Paragraph
ing an expressive ornament.,Paragraph
A NEW ESTHETIC PURGE,Title
"Up to this time, the leaders of the revolutionary movement",Paragraph
had been mostly painters who entered the new field of their,Paragraph
wider activity self-taught. It was about the turn of the century,Paragraph
"that the professional architects of Europe, attracted by the idea",Paragraph
of a new style and inspired by the results of the Art Nouveau,Paragraph
"movement, began to settle their final accounts with an eclectic",Paragraph
architecture founded on the close imitation or zealous adapta-,Paragraph
tion of historical styles.,Paragraph
"The professionals opened their attack with an esthetic purge,",Paragraph
more concerned with the form and the attendant problem of,Paragraph
expression than with the constituent problem of structure. To,Paragraph
overcome the multitude of forms conjured up by modern eclec-,Paragraph
"ticism, they began to purify the building, thereby restoring its",Paragraph
basic structure. With this process of simplification they certainly,Paragraph
"succeeded in strengthening the emotional effect of the form, but",Paragraph
failed to touch the problem of structure. With the theory stated,Paragraph
"by the Art Nouveau movement, this problem had been most",Paragraph
"strictly defined as a problem of organic order. This problem,",Paragraph
"however, was not solved by a process of mere purification. The",Paragraph
structure itself had not yet been changed. And as this structure,Paragraph
"was based on the principles of geometric order, it remained the",Paragraph
same after the purification of the building from all ornamental,Paragraph
details.,Paragraph
"To be sure, this tendency towards purification sprang from a",Paragraph
desire for formal discipline rather than from evolutionary im-,Paragraph
"pulse, and thus it was more reformative than creative in its",Paragraph
character. This new tendency of the movement towards purify-,Paragraph
"ing the form by reducing it to its geometric stem, has an interest-",Paragraph
ing parallel in the architecture of the second half of the eight-,Paragraph
"eenth century. When, at the end of the Baroque period, as a",Paragraph
"result of its exuberant urge to expression, the form became more",Paragraph
"and more dissolved, a rationalistic movement was started in",Paragraph
"France, promoting a new conception of architecture based again",Paragraph
on reason. The leading ideas of the movement are demonstrated,Paragraph
in the work of Claude-Nicolas Ledoux (1732-1806). Reducing,Paragraph
in its numerous projects the form to the prime elements of,Paragraph
"Geometry, to the square, the circle and the triangle, he restored",Paragraph
"the basic ground of all architecture. And from the simple, almost",Paragraph
"heroic monumentality of the pure bodies of Geometry, his build-",Paragraph
ings derive a strong emotional appeal. In a recent study de-,Paragraph
"voted to his work, Ledoux has been called a predecessor of",Paragraph
"Le Corbusier, and indeed, in his conceptions he anticipated the",Paragraph
basic ideas of the later architect who by the offerings of modern,Paragraph
technique was able to cast his geometric ideas in the form of a,Paragraph
graceful modernism.,Paragraph

DUTCH AND AUSTRIAN CONTRIBUTIONS,Title
"This line was first resumed in Holland, with the work of",Paragraph

"Polytechnicum, where at the time Gottfried Semper was one of",Paragraph
"the foremost teachers. In his beginnings, Berlage was still en-",Paragraph
"tangled in the ideas of historical style architecture, as is to be",Paragraph
"seen from one of his early designs, a project for a mausoleum",Paragraph
"(1889), perhaps the most intricate instance of nineteenth-century",Paragraph
formalism in architecture. But soon he saw the sterility of this,Paragraph
"kind of form concept, and with strong self-discipline tried to find",Paragraph
his way back to a more fundamental basis for the evolution of,Paragraph
form. He developed his own concept which in its essence turns,Paragraph
out to be an unreserved return to the geometric principles of,Paragraph
"structure: he based his designs on a network of squares, and into",Paragraph
that scheme the various parts of the plan as well as of the fagade,Paragraph
"were divided, according to the law of geometrical proportions.",Paragraph

"the technical treatment of this attractive material, as excellent",Paragraph
"in the grouping of the masses. The setting, with the square-built",Paragraph

points of view. In the interior the construction is frankly re-,Paragraph
vealed: in the great hall the large girders are exposed without,Paragraph
"any applied ornament, contrasting in their dynamic lines with",Paragraph
the fine masonry surface of the brick walls. Berlage’s form is as,Paragraph
"frugal as the ornament of the Art Nouveau was exuberant, and",Paragraph
his puritanism gave his work a stern character of sobriety. But,Paragraph
his urge to puritanism was no less intense and genuine than the,Paragraph
emotions of the Arf Nouveau decorators. And his practical ex-,Paragraph
"ample, in its essence more educational than creative, opened a",Paragraph
new path for the younger generation.,Paragraph
"In Austria, the first impetus to the regeneration was given",Paragraph
"by Otto Wagner, also a man of the older generation (1841-1918),",Paragraph
"and a pupil of Gottfried Semper’s. In one of his first manifestoes,",Paragraph
he stated his belief that “there is no other starting point for,Paragraph
"our work than modern life.” But when it came to work, he did",Paragraph
"not live up to this profession, and instead of applying the con-",Paragraph
"stitutive principles of modern life to the problem of structure,",Paragraph
"he used in practice, as his starting point, the approved prin-",Paragraph
ciples of geometric order. He tried to restore the integrity of,Paragraph
architecture by reducing the bulk of the building to plain con-,Paragraph
"tours and pure form, to simple cubes. By removing all architec-",Paragraph
tural and ornamental relief he freed the fagades from historical,Paragraph
"detail, and covered the surface of the building with thin marble",Paragraph
"slabs, which gave the walls, with their few joints, a rather mod-",Paragraph
ern appearance. Otto Wagner designed the architecture for the,Paragraph
Stadtbahn and he also did quite a number of public buildings,Paragraph
"in Vienna, among them the church for the Steinhof Hospital,",Paragraph
a building which clearly reveals how close he still remained to,Paragraph
the classical notion of structure. He gained great influence over,Paragraph
the younger generation not so much by his work as by his teach-,Paragraph
"ings, inspiring his students through the intrepid and unrestricted",Paragraph
acknowledgment of the demands of modern life. Among the,Paragraph
"numerous disciples of the Wagner school, Josef Hoffman was",Paragraph
"one of the most gifted architects. In the Maison Stoclet, built",Paragraph
"in 1911 in Brussels, he developed the new technique of surface",Paragraph
"treatment to such perfection that the house, though in its plan",Paragraph
"and structure based on the geometrical concept, comes close, at",Paragraph
"least in its outer appearance, to certain more authentic examples",Paragraph
of modern building.,Paragraph
"At the same time, Adolf Loos began to disturb the equanim-",Paragraph
ity of the Viennese by his provocative articles and lectures on,Paragraph
misuse and misunderstandings in the arts. He certainly was an,Paragraph
"exceptional figure, a man of varied acquirements, and very gifted",Paragraph
"in all of them. As a youngster, he came to the United States,",Paragraph
"where he lived for three years, working his way as a mason, and",Paragraph
at other times as a sawyer in a factory for inlaid floors. In this,Paragraph
country he saw some machine-made products that impressed him,Paragraph
very much by the simple beauty of their plain forms: such arti-,Paragraph

pattern for the industrial age he advocated the pure form of,Paragraph

"Ornament roused all his passions, and to such an extent that he",Paragraph
_,Title
once flung from the table of his café in Vienna the sharply,Paragraph
"pointed remark: “Ornament is a crime,” an aphorism which",Paragraph
"for a long time became the popular slogan of the movement,",Paragraph
used pour épater le bourgeois. The essence of Loos’ conviction,Paragraph
is expressed in his statement that marks the line along which,Paragraph
the modern spirit of building developed: ‘The evolution of cul-,Paragraph

strongly lived up to his conviction. In their simple forms and,Paragraph
"their abstinence from any ornament, they disclosed a character,",Paragraph

by the fact that the completion of one of his buildings in Vienna,Paragraph
was temporarily prohibited by the building authorities.,Paragraph
NEW INDUSTRIAL BUILDING,Title
"There was probably no other country in Europe, where the",Paragraph
influence of the Art Nouveau movement was more strongly felt,Paragraph
than in Germany. Impressed by the lofty aim of van de Velde’s,Paragraph
"program and inspired by his all-embracing theory, the new",Paragraph
"spirit of building gained momentum, and, rapidly spreading",Paragraph
"among the younger architects, soon conquered now domains.",Paragraph
The change of conception was first seen in the field of industrial,Paragraph
building. And it is certainly not by accident that this new spirit,Paragraph
"first came to act on such utilitarian buildings as factories, office",Paragraph
"buildings, department stores, worksheds and storage houses. To",Paragraph
"solve the problems involved in these new types of building, a",Paragraph
"strict rationality was needed, and strong technical logic. It is in",Paragraph
the nature of the problem that its solution has to be sought in,Paragraph
"a realistic conception, truly devoted to the demands for service",Paragraph
"and efficiency, and conscientiously utilizing the means of mod-",Paragraph
"ern technique, the new processes of production as well as mod-",Paragraph

"and impressive in their effect. ,",Paragraph
Perhaps the most interesting original examples of this new,Paragraph
development are to be found in the work of Hans Poelzig. In,Paragraph

which the new structural problems are not only realized but,Paragraph

THE DEUTSCHE WERKBUND,Title
To sum up: the Art Nouveau movement did not succeed in,Paragraph
fulfilling its ambitious program endeavoring no Jess than the,Paragraph
creation of a new style. But it succeeded in loosening the minds,Paragraph
and spreading the new spirit over wider regions. And there is,Paragraph
perhaps no better example to prove the educational influence,Paragraph
of the movement than the organization that grew out of it in,Paragraph
"Germany, well known under the name of Deutsche Werk-",Paragraph
bund. It was founded by artists devoted to the emerging ideas,Paragraph
of the movement. It was felt that the new art needed a social,Paragraph
"soil to take root and to grow in. To prepare such a fostering soil,",Paragraph
"they appealed to industry, as the most advanced constituent of",Paragraph

"Thus, in 1904, a craft association was founded, the aim and",Paragraph
object of which was set forth as “to ennoble industrial labor,Paragraph
"through the co-operation of art, industry and handicraft—by",Paragraph
"means of education, propaganda and united action on relevant",Title

recommendation. Membership was restricted to those invited,Paragraph
"to join by the executive committee. Thus, the union represented",Paragraph
"a selection of the very best of artistic talent, skill in craftsman-",Paragraph

RICHARDSON: FOUNDER OF A NEW AMERICAN VERNACULAR,Title
H. H. Richardson was one of the first American architects,Paragraph
who went to Paris to get his professional training at the Ecole,Paragraph
des Beaux Arts. The formal discipline of that school provided,Paragraph
him with the advantageous routine d’atelier exhibited through-,Paragraph
out his work in the art of design and the skillful handling of the,Paragraph
"detail, such as color, ornament and decoration. Yet his strong",Paragraph
character is proved by the fact that this formal education did,Paragraph
not impair his realistic sense. Counterbalancing the one-sided,Paragraph
"training of the school by practical work, done in the ateliers of",Paragraph
"some Parisian architects, he kept an open and ingenious mind",Paragraph
and never submerged himself in merely esthetic passions. By,Paragraph
"nature and talent a born architect, he succeeded in developing",Paragraph
himself into a real builder rather than a draftsman and designer.,Paragraph
At a time when architecture was debased by the activities of,Paragraph
SEEN OE IE EEDA Nee EE NE NE Ee Net Na Euan Beant OE Net tN,Title
qualities were sufficient to make him a regenerator of building,Paragraph
and the founder of a new American vernacular.,Paragraph
"Living in a period of complete stylistic confusion, and still a",Paragraph
period unable to think of its architectural problems in other,Paragraph
"than historical terms, what else could a young fervent architect",Paragraph
do in order to find an inspiration but turn his attention to a,Paragraph
"primary style? Indeed, it proves the soundness of Richardson's",Paragraph
"instinct that he made the Romanesque style his choice. When,",Paragraph
"in the midst of a despairing decay in building, he was looking",Paragraph
for a new discipline able to restore the dignity and integrity of,Paragraph
"architecture, this great style, imposing in its monumental group-",Paragraph
"ing of masses and the expressive masonry of its strong walls, must",Paragraph
have most nearly responded to his idea of real building: ele-,Paragraph
"mental, stable, and expressive of power.",Paragraph
But by selecting the Romanesque as the chief source of his,Paragraph
inspiration he also revealed the narrow limits of his intention.,Paragraph
His efforts were devoted to regaining solidity and esthetic qual-,Paragraph
ity in building. He was interested in the problems of monu-,Paragraph
mental composition and the visual effects of vigorous masonry,Title
rather than in the structural problems arising with the technical,Paragraph
innovations made in his time. Had he been interested in these,Paragraph
"actual problems of structure, he would, like Viollet-le-Duc, for",Paragraph
"instance, have followed the Gothic tradition. But, while the",Paragraph
engineers of his time were working to develop new methods of,Paragraph
"construction, loosening and lightening the structure, he clung",Paragraph
"to somewhat reactionary methods of building, preferring heavy",Paragraph
"and rugged masonry, built of large-sized rough-hewn stone.",Paragraph
anim,Title
"Nevertheless, using these materials and methods in a straight-",Paragraph
"forward manner, with a fine feeling for their expressive qualities,",Paragraph
"he finally succeeded in developing a personal style, and gave his",Paragraph
buildings a monumental character not seen in this country be-,Paragraph

ner are such well-known buildings as Trinity Church in Boston,Paragraph
and the Pittsburgh Jail and Courthouse.,Paragraph
ON THE IDEA OF A PERSONAL STYLE IN ARCHITECTURE,Title
But the typical monuments of the Richardsonian man-,Paragraph
"ner, a manner highly admired by contemporaries but soon",Paragraph
"thinned out by imitators, have mainly faded from interest, even",Paragraph
if they have not been demolished in fact. Expressive as they are,Paragraph
in their robust masonry and in the effective grouping of their,Paragraph
"large masses, piled up, as it seems, by the hands of a giant, they",Paragraph
have proved to be the most transitory of his works. For this inner,Paragraph
"weakness with which they are afflicted, in spite of the freshness",Paragraph
"and vigor of their outer appearance, there is only one explana-",Paragraph
"tion. Being creations of a personal style, a virtue which roused",Paragraph
"the enthusiasm of the contemporaries, they are revealed to us",Paragraph
as the limited offspring of the nineteenth century. This era with,Paragraph
its general tendency towards individualism also furthered the,Paragraph
idea of personal expression in architecture. Such an idea may,Paragraph
"be permitted to a genius like Michelangelo, although even this",Paragraph
titan of architecture came to feel the danger of his individual-,Paragraph
"istic experiments—look, for instance, at the Biblioteca Lauren-",Paragraph

architects came to grief: Richardson as well as Poelzig at a later,Paragraph
"period, and even van de Velde, the greatest theorist of the move-",Paragraph

"straightforward theory, to realize his idea of a new style in a",Paragraph
"merely individual manner, in the way of personal expression.",Paragraph
"In modern times, it has become, and still is at the present day,",Paragraph
"the tragedy of many talented architects, and especially of the",Paragraph
"strong and imaginative ones, that they believe in the sovereign",Paragraph
"consciousness of their own artistic personalities, that they can",Paragraph
rise above the social conditions of their epoch; and so they ex-,Paragraph
"haust their strength on ideas in which the age no longer believes,",Paragraph
"and which, in spite of all their abilities, they cannot actualize.",Paragraph
"Their works may be interesting, even admirable as documents",Paragraph
of personal expression; yet they are not capable of further de-,Paragraph
"velopment, because they contain too much of personal caprice",Paragraph
and special opportunity and contribute too little to the general,Paragraph
"problems of their time. In fact, the significance of any man of",Paragraph
"talent for his time, is precisely decided as he decides for himself",Paragraph
"in his work, in the choice of his problem and his attitude to it.",Paragraph
"And in the nineteenth century, that era of general transforma-",Paragraph

"lem of a personal style. To attack these general problems, there",Paragraph
"was needed, however, a willingness to limit the freedom of the",Paragraph
artistic personality in devotion to a super-personal necessity.,Paragraph
And the solution of these new and urgent problems was retarded,Paragraph
and postponed over and over again by the fact that so many,Paragraph
architects of the nineteenth century were entirely absorbed by,Paragraph
"their individual problems, and put the satisfaction of their ego",Paragraph
above collective needs.,Paragraph
CHARACTER OF THE NEW VERNACULAR,Title
It is for that reason that the historical significance assigned to,Paragraph
"Richardson for developing a new spirit in building, has to be",Paragraph
"dated not so much from his large monumental buildings, which",Paragraph
"once established his name and fame, as from a series of smaller",Paragraph
"commissions he did in his mature years. In these buildings, al-",Paragraph
"though they are touched with historical reminiscences, he made",Paragraph
"the closest contact with his time. Look, for instance, at his small",Paragraph
"public libraries, particularly those in Quincy and North Easton.",Paragraph
Here he achieved a new freedom of composition tending towards,Paragraph
"the functional arrangement of the plans, which in the exteriors",Paragraph
finds its logical and effective expression in the free grouping,Paragraph
of the parts and in the varying size of the windows and their,Paragraph
disposition. And in the great series of railroad stations built for,Paragraph
"the Boston and Albany, he manifests a realistic conception which",Paragraph
made these buildings not only structurally appropriate to their,Paragraph
"function, but also in form a true and clear expression of their",Paragraph
"purpose. With their simple elements, their low walls and broadly",Paragraph
"expanded masses, with their sloping roofs and projecting sheds",Paragraph
"running along the tracks, they reveal a character immediately",Paragraph
felt as modern.,Paragraph

The same is true for some of his later works in the field of,Paragraph

construction of iron frame work which he deliberately sheathed,Paragraph
"with masonry walls. When, in the following year, Richardson",Paragraph
"was commissioned to build the Marshall Field Store in Chicago,",Paragraph
"planned for seven stories only, he insisted upon the use of sturdy",Paragraph
"masonry, relying on a traditional construction proved as certain,",Paragraph
rather than on a technical innovation not yet tried as to its,Paragraph
solidity. He erected a large square block reduced to the simplest,Paragraph
form with almost no architectural detail. But above the broad,Paragraph
basis of the building the massive walls are opened up by wide,Paragraph
"windows, admitting large amounts of light into the interior. In",Paragraph
"the fagades, several stories are grouped together under a series",Paragraph
of lofty arches providing the broad-spread mass of the building,Paragraph
with a definite verticalism.,Paragraph
This tendency towards lightening the building bulk was con-,Paragraph
"tinued and pushed to a climax in the Pray Building in Boston,",Paragraph
"erected in 1886, the year Richardson died at the age of forty-",Paragraph
"eight, ending a most promising career before it had.developed",Paragraph
into full maturity. With this building Richardson surpassed,Paragraph
himself: it is perhaps the best and certainly the most important,Paragraph
"of his works. The outer walls, built in brick, are reduced to small",Paragraph
"sturdy piers, rising up to the height of five stories and connected",Paragraph
by wide arches which support the attic and the heavy corbeled,Paragraph
cornice. The spandrels are reduced to the thickness of the in-,Paragraph
"terior floors. Thus the design, already bearing in its main lines",Paragraph
"the characteristic features of the steel frame construction, offered",Paragraph
an inspiring example for the solution of the structural problem,Paragraph
now arising with the general use of this new method of building.,Paragraph
LOUIS SULLIVAN: THE FOUNDER OF A NEW THEORY,Title
This very problem of structure was first systematically at-,Paragraph
"tacked in this country by Louis Henry Sullivan, born in Boston",Paragraph
"in 1856. He was not only a great artist, a splendid draftsman",Paragraph
endowed with all the esthetic faculties that make up a great,Paragraph
"architect; his was also an original mind, a fresh and independent",Paragraph
nature that soon found itself in strong disagreement with the,Paragraph
surrounding world. And suffering from the conditions he had,Paragraph
"to live in, he turned to thinking, as passionately as impatiently,",Paragraph
seeking an answer to the perplexing problems that crowded,Paragraph
upon him from all sides. .,Paragraph
"Sullivan attended the Massachusetts Institute of ‘Technology,",Paragraph
where he had to learn the five classic orders of architecture. But,Paragraph
"the lifeless method of academic training, based on the doctrine",Paragraph
that architectural perfection can only be achieved by using the,Paragraph
"vocabulary of the historical styles, evoked in him the defi-",Paragraph
nite conviction that architecture was a dead art. He then went,Paragraph
"to Paris and spent two years at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, con-",Paragraph
"sidered as “the fountainhead of theory,” and was dissatisfied,",Paragraph
"too. The discipline of this school, as he points out in his auto-",Paragraph
"biography, “settled down to a theory of plan, yielding results",Paragraph
"of extraordinary brilliancy, but which, after all, was not the",Paragraph
"reality he sought.” To him it was “but an abstraction, a method",Paragraph
"that was intellectual and esthetic, a state of mind that was local",Paragraph
"and specific, not universal.” This statement should be taken to",Paragraph
heart as a warning of the danger involved in any kind of merely,Paragraph
academic education.,Paragraph
"There were, however, two events in his formative years, when",Paragraph
"he set out to find this “universal,” which deeply impressed his",Paragraph
"mind and definitely directed his mode of thinking. In Paris,",Paragraph
"when preparing his entrance examinations for the Beaux Arts,",Paragraph
"he took lessons with M. Clopet, a tutor in Mathematics. At their",Paragraph
"first meeting, the pupil brought an American text book on De-",Paragraph
"scriptive Geometry; but the teacher, looking the book over, dis-",Paragraph
covered that to each theorem there was “a procession of excep-,Paragraph
tions and special cases.” He suggested throwing the book in the,Paragraph
waste basket. ‘““We shall not have need of it here; for here our,Paragraph
demonstrations shall be so broad as to admit of no exception.”,Paragraph
"As these startling words flashed through his mind, there arose,",Paragraph
"to use his own words, a vision and a fixed resolve: “If it can be",Paragraph
"done in Mathematics, why not in Architecture? It shall be! No",Paragraph
one has—I will!”,Paragraph
"The other event took place in Chicago, where fate threw in",Paragraph

When the word “function” was detonated by the word “sup-,Paragraph

"eral validity, putting to test a rule “‘so broad as to admit of no",Paragraph

"stating the morphological law of all organic growth, he finally",Paragraph
formulated this guiding principle in the words: ‘Form follows,Paragraph
function.”,Paragraph
"In this simple formula, the new spirit of building acquired",Paragraph
its credo.,Paragraph
“BEAUTY THE PROMISE OF FUNCTION”,Title
The essence of this functionalist theory was in the air all,Paragraph
"through the nineteenth century, in this country as well as in",Paragraph
"Europe. It might well be that Sullivan breathed it in as a boy,",Paragraph
"when he lived in Boston. Here it was that Horatio Greenough,",Paragraph
"the sculptor, as early as the forties had set forth in his lectures",Paragraph
and writings a principle of structure revealed to him in nature:,Paragraph
“the primal law of unflinching adaptation of form to function.”,Paragraph
"This structural law, he found, obtained in the forms of the",Paragraph
"clipper-ship and the “American trotting-wagon,” and he referred",Paragraph
his readers to these examples as demonstrating “‘an organization,Paragraph

"No doubt Greenough, like many another advanced thinker of",Paragraph
"his age, had in his hands all the essential elements of a new the-",Paragraph
"ory of structure. However, it was left to the following generation",Paragraph
"to tie these elements together, and it was Louis Sullivan who",Paragraph
"according to Hugh Morrison, his biographer, first succeeded in",Paragraph
setting forth both by precept and by example a new theory of,Paragraph
organic building.,Paragraph
THE RISE OF THE SKYSCRAPER,Title
Sullivan undertook a long series of practical experiments in,Paragraph
"developing an architecture that fitted its functions, “a new real-",Paragraph
"istic architecture,” to use his own words, based on well-defined",Paragraph
"needs and practical conditions, which no architectural dictum,",Paragraph
"or tradition, or superstition, or habit should stand in the way of.",Paragraph
"The eighties, full of robust realism in technique, science and",Paragraph
"economics, were well prepared for such a decisive attempt at a",Paragraph
realistic architecture. With the advance of urbanization a great,Paragraph
"many new building types had come into being, throwing up a",Paragraph
host of new architectural problems which urgently called for a,Paragraph
practical solution. Among these new types the tall office build-,Paragraph
"ing, rapidly multiplying its stories and extending skywards, was",Paragraph
a,Title
certainly the most conspicuous one. And it is with this type that,Paragraph
Sullivan found his first chance to put his theory to a practical,Paragraph
"test. At the age of thirty, he designed, as partner of Dankmar",Paragraph
"Adler, the Auditorium Building in Chicago: a ten-story build- :",Caption

unit and lightening the heavy masses of masonry.,Paragraph
The next year he built the Wainwright Building in St. Louis.,Paragraph
"Applying in this project the new steel skeleton construction, he",Paragraph
soon recognized that the change in the structural system meant,Paragraph
"a radical revolution in architecture, overthrowing the traditional",Paragraph
idea of building mass related to supporting walls. In the skele-,Paragraph

but are themselves supported by the horizontal beams: a kind,Paragraph

and it has to be admitted that Richardson in his design for the,Paragraph
"Pray Building in Boston, though carried out in masonry, came",Paragraph
closer to the solution than Sullivan when he built the Wain-,Paragraph
wright Building in skeleton construction. The accentuated ver-,Caption
ticalism applied for its design is not logically derived from the,Paragraph
"steel cage system which is rather a structure of square frames,",Paragraph
but from the urge to emotional expression which proved once,Paragraph
more to be stronger than his faith in the principle that form,Paragraph
follows function.,Paragraph
"As a practical demonstration of the theory, the Monadnock",Paragraph

FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT: FOUNDER OF AN ORGANIC ARCHITECTURE,Title
"Before Frank Lloyd Wright became Sullivan’s pupil, he re-",Paragraph
ceived the beginnings of professional training at the University,Paragraph
"of Wisconsin, where he attended an engineering course. Perhaps",Paragraph
"it is due to this realistic rather than formal education that, when",Paragraph
"he later became an architect, he was never benumbed by the",Paragraph
academic dogma. From the start he preferred to be animated by,Paragraph
the individual conditions of the problem at hand rather than,Paragraph
to be confined to the general rules of the geometric law. To start,Paragraph
"from necessity, to proceed on the demands of service and effi-",Paragraph
"ciency, and not from random abstractions which escape from",Paragraph
life: that was to the man sympathetic to the engineer an obliga-,Paragraph
tion as strong as self-evident.,Paragraph
With Wright’s work the principle of organic structure re-,Paragraph
"curred on a higher level. With him architecture, after having",Paragraph
grown torpid through excessive occupation with the master-,Paragraph
"pieces of the past, turned decidedly to the rejuvenating sources",Paragraph
of its strength: to Nature. But this new turn towards nature,Paragraph
"manifests itself not in an intentional naturalism, but in a new",Paragraph
mode of thinking about the structure. In one of his earliest mani-,Paragraph
"festoes, Wright declared: “Although for centuries our practice",Paragraph
"has been to turn from nature, seeking inspiration in books, ad-",Paragraph
"hering slavishly to dead formulas, her wealth of suggestion is",Paragraph
"inexhaustible, her riches greater than any man’s desire. . . .”",Paragraph
And he continues: “‘A sense of the organic in Nature is indis-,Paragraph
"pensable to an architect, and the knowledge of the relation of",Paragraph
form to function is at the root of his practice.”,Paragraph
These few sentences characterize clearly and comprehensively,Paragraph
"the spiritual standpoint, which shows, even in the formulation,",Paragraph
a striking congruity with the principal belief of Goethe ex-,Paragraph
"pressed in one of his Essays on Art, when he said: “An universal",Paragraph
knowledge of organic nature is necessary in order to understand,Paragraph
and develop the artist through the labyrinth of his structure.”,Paragraph
"Wright’s reflection of nature is, conforming to the classic ex-",Paragraph
"ample of Goethe, of that creative kind, where “intuition itself",Paragraph
"becomes thinking, and thinking an intuition.” It is directed",Paragraph
"upon the morphological, upon the problem of structure, and",Paragraph
upon the laws of organic growth. From the study of nature and,Paragraph
"its formative laws, he gets a firm and definite conception for his",Paragraph
architectural creation. He realizes “how form derives its struc-,Paragraph
ture from nature and from the character of the material and its,Paragraph
"conditions, exactly as a flower forms itself according to the law",Paragraph
"which lies in its seed.” Subjecting the structure of building,",Paragraph
"with the severest logic, to the laws upon which all organic growth",Paragraph
"rests, he succeeded in reaching beyond the results that realistic",Paragraph
"architecture had hitherto achieved, deliberately based as it was",Paragraph
"on a one-sided rationalistic concept, and pushed on to forms of",Paragraph
higher organic order. It was he who first brought the idea of,Paragraph
organic structure defined in the striking formula of his master-,Paragraph
teacher to realization: a new architectural form. And the sensu-,Paragraph
ous effect of this form has evidently not suffered because the,Paragraph
creative instinct was guided by a cognition derived from natural,Paragraph
science. The result is not only convincing by its logic; it also gives,Paragraph
delight through the manifold imaginativeness of the form. This,Paragraph
"form, stimulating by its fullness of nature and nearness to life,",Paragraph
"immediately appeals to intuition and feeling, enchanting the",Paragraph
senses with the melody of its language and the expressive grace,Paragraph
of its appearance.,Paragraph
A DEMONSTRATION OF ORGANIG PLANNING,Title
One must consider the plans of Wright’s buildings in detail,Paragraph
in order to understand the change in the principle of structure,Paragraph
and the working of the new law. The ground-plan shows itself,Paragraph
"freed from the rigid doctrine of geometric order. Mathematics,",Paragraph
"as is proper in the realm of art, has sunk from the commanding",Paragraph
position as a determinant of the law of the form and structure,Paragraph
to that of an auxiliary réle: it has become a technical subsidiary,Paragraph
"science. With this new spirit in building, space has lost its archi-",Paragraph
tectural sovereignty. For it is not the aim in forming the struc-,Paragraph
"ture to represent the geometric idea of space, but to create for",Paragraph
"the individual life, which unfolds itself within that space, an",Paragraph
accurately adjusted shell. This explains the strange irregularity,Paragraph
"of these plans, which exhibit irregular contours with numerous",Paragraph
"projections, and also single rooms of various shapes with mani-",Paragraph
fold juttings and recessions.,Paragraph
And with the conception of space the manner of arranging,Paragraph
the rooms also changes. The plan is no longer a geometric dis-,Paragraph
"tribution of rooms attached by principle to a system of axes, but",Paragraph
the rooms are arranged so that they complement each other in,Paragraph
"their services, forming in their totality a uniformly functioning",Paragraph
"whole. And in their connection, the rooms are so bound to one",Paragraph
"another, spliced like muscles, that by their inner tension they",Paragraph
"are brought into indissoluble cohesion. At first, this new method",Paragraph
"of joining the rooms was accomplished by arranging, as connect-",Paragraph
"ing links, short lobby-like passages between the main rooms,",Paragraph
effecting an almost imperceptible flowing of the rooms into one,Paragraph
"another. Later, this method was felt to be too loose, and replaced",Paragraph
"by an interlacing of rooms, at times increased toward bold pene-",Paragraph
"trations, so that it seems as though one room were evolving out",Paragraph
"of another. And the more the inner structure strengthened, the",Paragraph
looser became its outer contour. The more the sureness in the,Paragraph
"mastery of the new laws increased, the freer and opener became",Paragraph
the contours of the ground-plan. In the projects in which Wright,Paragraph
"has achieved the maturity of his style, the rooms are arranged",Paragraph
"around the nucleus of the chimney part, like leaves of a plant",Paragraph
"around their stem. Radiating as if from a power center, they",Paragraph
"reach out into the garden and the landscape, opening themselves",Paragraph
to the light and the view on all sides.,Paragraph
TOWARDS AN ORGANIC FORM,Title
In the same manner that the plan in all its parts forms an,Paragraph
"indissoluble whole, so, according to the law of organic growth,",Paragraph
are the ground-plan and elevation inseparably united with one,Paragraph
"another. “An organic form,” Wright has said, “grows its own",Paragraph
structure out of conditions as a plant grows out of the soil: both,Paragraph
"unfold similarly from within.” In this sense, the laws of organic",Paragraph
planning find their continuation and completion in the external,Paragraph
"structure; and the manifold arrangement of the parts, the lively",Paragraph
"grouping of building masses, are to be viewed as the result of the",Paragraph
"inner logic of design, and not as a brilliant show-piece of a de-",Paragraph
"liberately picturesque composition. As to these buildings, one",Paragraph
"had better avoid speaking of “composition” at all, since no less",Paragraph
"a man than Goethe has condemned this expression, in nature",Paragraph
"as well as in art, as degrading. “The organs do not compose",Paragraph
"themselves as if already previously finished,” he said; “they de-",Paragraph
"velop themselves together and out of one another, to an existence",Paragraph
which necessarily takes part in the whole.” Wright’s buildings,Paragraph
are neither designed nor composed; they are built and created,Paragraph
in three dimensions as coherent organisms. It is for that rea-,Paragraph
son that his buildings have no definite main view or any real,Paragraph
fagade at all. As a plant viewed from any angle appears in its,Paragraph
"full beauty and always offers new charms, so the nature of these",Paragraph
buildings can only be experienced by encircling them. What-,Paragraph
"ever the perspective may be to the building, it always offers new",Paragraph
"aspects, full of variety, and only in the succession of one upon",Paragraph
the other is there disclosed the nature and meaning of the whole.,Paragraph
"Speaking of the structure of these buildings, it is not by",Paragraph
"chance that one is, again and again, urged to a comparison with",Paragraph
"the world of plants. Like a plant, the building grows up from",Paragraph
the earth to the light. Above a compact base unfolds a loosened,Paragraph
"bulk, developed into rich plastic form through the harmonic",Paragraph
interplay of its necessary parts and through the extended full-,Paragraph
ness of its appropriate detail. And in the development of this,Paragraph
detail any trace of a leaning upon historic examples has been,Paragraph
"eradicated. It is in its form entirely independent, and new, also,",Paragraph
"in the sense of being organic. “Form,” Wright once said, “is",Paragraph
"made by function, but qualified by use. Therefore, form changes",Paragraph
with changing conditions.” It is the aim of this new art of detail,Paragraph
"to develop every form to complete individuality, according to",Paragraph
"the individual conditions from which it grows and which, there-",Paragraph
"fore, are studied with an incomparable degree of sensibility.",Paragraph
Here it becomes clear how the creative observation of nature,Paragraph
"turns into a new artistic vision. Take, for instance, the horizontal",Paragraph
"slabs boldly projected, that new motive which has been the most",Paragraph
"imitated in modern building: in these widely overhanging eaves,",Paragraph
"spreading themselves canopy-like over terraces and balconies,",Paragraph
there seems to be plantlike existence translated into architectural,Paragraph
"form. Or again, look at the changing forms of the windows, their",Paragraph
"distribution, their arrangement in groups of rhythmic order, in",Paragraph
which the law seems to repeat itself that determines the ranging,Paragraph
and ranking of leaves. Notice the delicate relation between the,Paragraph
building bulk and the detail: as the bulk rises higher from the,Paragraph
"ground it becomes looser and lighter, while the detail becomes",Paragraph
more elaborate and more tenuous. Notice finally the new devel-,Paragraph
"opment of the roofs, which free themselves from the substruc-",Paragraph
"ture through widely overhanging projections, and spread like",Paragraph
"lofty tree-tops, making the house with its loosened silhouette",Paragraph
"stand out against the horizon. There may creep in, at times,",Paragraph
something too “motive-like”; there may occasionally be found,Paragraph
in this new art of detail a relapse into compositional tendencies,Paragraph
opposed to the command of artistic economy: the excess is easily,Paragraph
"attributable to the exuberant joy in the new vision, and con-",Paragraph
"sidering the enrichment of form gained thereby, and its emo-",Paragraph
"tional effects, we will always feel our objections weakened.",Paragraph
It is quite within the sphere of this new vision that it also,Paragraph
"turns its special attention to the effects of light, and beyond",Paragraph
"this, also includes in the artistic calculation the air. Wright",Paragraph
treats light as if it were a natural building material. The gradu-,Paragraph
ated interplay of light and shade is to him an artistic medium,Paragraph
"of expression. The broad shadows, cast by the widely projecting",Paragraph
"eaves and roofs, shade off the plastic modeling, and the chang-",Paragraph
ing contrasts of light and dark underline the dynamics of the,Paragraph
"building groups. And similarly, the air is evaluated as an ele-",Paragraph
"ment of form, is drawn into the concept of building. Wright",Paragraph
"splits the building mass up, he loosens its volume, since he in-",Paragraph
termingles it with open air-space. With this inclusion of the air-,Paragraph
"space in the formation, there is accomplished an intimate con-",Paragraph
"nection of the inside with the outside, a new feature which from",Paragraph
now on becomes the unmistakable characteristic of the modern,Paragraph
"house. “Wright,” said one of his German critics, “is the first",Paragraph
architect to whom the atmosphere is more than mere back-,Paragraph
"ground to his works. He uses it, he calculates with it, again and",Paragraph
again he tries to relate his work so finely with the atmosphere,Paragraph
that both must seem indissolubly connected. His entire system,Paragraph
"of projecting flat roofs, the inclusion of air-space within the",Paragraph
"building, and the concentration of shadow, in contrast to the",Paragraph
"rows of loosened, almost light-drinking windows in the upper",Paragraph
"stories, serves unconsciously this goal. Almost everywhere he",Paragraph
"tries, with the most varied means, to create between the outer",Paragraph
"world and the building intermediate bodies, forming transitions",Title
and sympathetically and more fully molding the relation be-,Paragraph
"tween the two, taking all harshness from the fusion.”",Paragraph
"The new relation to nature and to organic life, from which",Paragraph
"the fundamental ideas of Wright’s art are derived, is finally re-",Paragraph
"vealed in the changed treatment of the material. Wright uses,",Paragraph
"as a rule, the material in the sense of its organic nature. For him",Paragraph
"the material is by nature a willing friend, and everything de-",Paragraph
"pends upon hewing out of it, through careful treatment, its es-",Paragraph
sential peculiarity. Veneration for nature forbids him to destroy,Paragraph
"the natural grain of the wood; he never uses covering paint, but",Paragraph
"leaves the wood in its simple state, shows the chance work of",Paragraph
"its branching, or treats it at times with colored stains. In the",Paragraph
same manner he turns to account the structure of plaster and,Paragraph
"of bricks, the surface glazing of ceramic tiles, the nature of stone,",Paragraph
"its jointing and its size, utilizing not only the physical but also",Paragraph
et en ne,Title
"the physiognomical properties of the material, in order to en-",Paragraph
hance the individualizing characteristics of his building. And,Paragraph
"never is there a casual, or even conflicting juxtaposition of ma-",Paragraph
terials: they are harmoniously connected with each other and,Paragraph
organically joined in the sense of a natural common union.,Paragraph
"“OUT OF THE EARTH, INTO THE SUN”",Title
This live feeling for materials is another reason why Wright’s,Paragraph
buildings fit so naturally in their surroundings. They are built,Paragraph
"into nature, almost bred into the life-space of their surround-",Paragraph
ing landscape. The majority of the country houses he built are,Paragraph
"on the wide plains of the Middle West, that solemn landscape",Paragraph
"consisting of luxuriant vegetation with ancient timber-lands, of",Paragraph
gentle far-ranging hills and an endless horizon. The houses with,Paragraph
"their broad masses widely spread out, with their low proportions",Paragraph
"and the long horizontal lines of their roofs, follow these large",Paragraph
"contours of the landscape. Like dense thickets, rooted firmly in",Paragraph
"the earth, their low building-masses stretch out over the ground,",Paragraph
"always turning towards the light, following the natural tenden-",Paragraph
"cies of the site, adapting themselves pliantly to every fold of",Paragraph
"land, every elevation of ground, with far-stretched low walls",Paragraph
"framing the garden, trees and other vegetation of the surround-",Paragraph
"ings and pulling them, as if with fangs, inward to the house.",Paragraph
"The domestic buildings of Wright are like Japanese houses,",Paragraph
so fitted into the landscape that the building almost impercep-,Paragraph
tibly blends with surrounding nature. The Japanese house mani-,Paragraph
"fests the same spirit of nature, the same tendency toward an",Paragraph
organic structure. It also shows this intimate connection with,Paragraph
"the scene it is set in, this multiform arrangement of roofs me-",Paragraph
"ticulously calculated in its effects, and the careful treatment of",Paragraph
materials according to their physical and physiognomical prop-,Paragraph
erties. It is not by chance that Wright’s country houses recall,Paragraph
the Japanese pattern. He was several times in Japan for long,Paragraph
intervals (and in Tokio he even built a hotel which though one,Paragraph
of his largest works is certainly not his best). The philosophy,Paragraph
"of a country where man merges in nature, and a civilization",Paragraph
"where art and life permeate each other so intimately, must have",Paragraph
been especially favorable to his own conception of art. Wright’s,Paragraph
"art is, in fact, similar to the Japanese, nature-like and rural; and",Paragraph
it evidently loses its greatest values when it is diverted to proj-,Paragraph
ects of typical city building.,Paragraph
Wright's decided preference for low building corresponds to,Paragraph
this pastoral character. He certainly knows the satisfaction of,Paragraph
"being able to build everything on the ground level, and he",Paragraph
"knows how to prize it, this “highest happiness of the architect”:",Paragraph
"he has tasted it to the full in his own house Taliesin, which",Paragraph
in its high perfection is to date his most mature work. In,Paragraph
"its organic structure and its intimate connection with nature,",Paragraph
this house may justly take as its due the famous words of praise,Paragraph
which Vasari coined for Raphael’s Villa Farnesina: “non mu-,Paragraph
"rato, ma veramente nato.”",Paragraph
WRIGHT THE ARTIST,Title
"Each house of Wright’s is an individual organism, related in",Paragraph
"every detail to man, alive in itself, friendly to all life, and in",Paragraph
"complete harmony with nature, a growth. Always starting from",Paragraph
"the stern command of use, Wright tries to develop the form of",Paragraph
the structure out of its functions; he tries to articulate the in-,Paragraph
"dividual nature of each building, and to unfold this nature in",Paragraph
"its own world, in its own proper life-space, according to its im-",Paragraph
manent law. From this conception derives the stupendous mani-,Paragraph
"foldness of his form, and the incomparable art of imbuing with",Paragraph
character every part which marks the summit of his mastery.,Paragraph
Wright’s work reveals a new conception of the idea of organic,Paragraph
structure. The creative observation of nature which led him to,Paragraph
"that conception, and the stating of the morphological problem",Paragraph
"involved in it, is alone an achievement of extraordinary intel-",Paragraph
lectuality. No less important is the architectural achievement,Paragraph
with which the new idea of structure gained its artistic presen-,Paragraph
tation. In it there is revealed the unfathomable strength of his,Paragraph
intuition and the abundance of creative power with which,Paragraph
he is gifted. From these extraordinary faculties there originated,Paragraph
"the inexhaustible richness of his form. His work is full of form,",Paragraph
like nature herself whose laws are at the basis of his work. In,Paragraph
"every detail this law is evident, and yet the command of its ne-",Paragraph
cessity is followed with complete inner freedom. In the work,Paragraph
itself the principle on which it is based has been completely,Paragraph
"absorbed, so that it constitutes not a demonstration but a work",Paragraph
of art unfolding a new form of beauty. The form always binds,Paragraph
"itself to its law, but it yet remains free from any dogmatic in-",Paragraph

All the conditions stated prove true for Frank Lloyd Wright.,Paragraph
"As an artist he really is nature, and a great contribution towards",Paragraph
developing this nature and preserving its originality is certainly,Paragraph

1. FROM PERSONAL EXPRESSION,Title
TOWARDS A NEW STYLE,Title
REACTIONS TO THE WORLD WAR,Title
Art is subjected to continuous change by the changes in civi-,Paragraph
"lization. The nineteenth century, that epoch of triumphant in-",Paragraph
"dividualism, was in art a period of great personalities, coming",Paragraph
to flower in as many styles as there were individuals capable of,Paragraph
personal style. In architecture probably the last of these great,Paragraph
personalities to assert himself was Frank Lloyd Wright. His art,Paragraph
"is founded on a principle of general validity, the principle of",Paragraph
organic structure which must be the guiding principle of the,Paragraph
"future, if architecture is again to be a living art. Yet the form",Paragraph
in which Wright realizes and represents this general principle,Paragraph
"is unique: a personal creation, worthy of highest esteem, as a",Paragraph
"product of an exuberant imagination, full of grace and serenity,",Paragraph
"of gaiety and enjoyment of life, a form of such wealth as we shall",Paragraph
not see soon again. The period of individualism which formed,Paragraph
"the background of his art, giving the artist a full opportunity",Paragraph
to develop his own personality to its utmost potentialities—this,Paragraph
happy period is over. It was rudely ended by the World War.,Paragraph
"The significance of this primary event, its spiritual meaning",Paragraph
"and effect, was of course not recognized at once. But the reper-",Paragraph
cussions and emotional reactions were to be felt in art very soon.,Paragraph
The frightful experience of the war resulted in a flight from,Paragraph
"reality, and the artists who had lived through it now abandoned",Paragraph
themselves to the impulses of their agitated sentiments. There,Paragraph
"first arose a huge wave of expressionism, producing strange",Paragraph
"works full of individualistic emotion, of passionate sentiment,",Paragraph
of romantic ecstasy.,Paragraph
"Even architecture, an art sternly material and therefore an art",Paragraph
"that does not easily succumb to the urge of self-expression, was",Paragraph
seized by that wave of expressionism. Its tendencies are plainly,Paragraph
"reflected in such a romantic project, for instance, as Hans Poel-",Paragraph
"zig's design for the Festspielhaus in Salzburg, a project in which",Paragraph
"reality is entirely neglected, even to the degree of destroying any",Paragraph
possibility of practical execution. The design is the sheer prod-,Paragraph

this excited time.,Paragraph
Other examples of that urge for self-expression are the utopian,Paragraph
"designs of the German architect Bruno Taut, published in the",Paragraph

as documents illustrating the temper of this period. Condemned,Paragraph

"form of human settlement, freed from the avoidable burden of",Paragraph
"urban agglomeration, and shows the possibilities which might",Paragraph

And the same line of self-expression is followed in the early,Paragraph
projects of Erich Mendelsohn who by virtue of his alert intelli-,Paragraph
gence and his strong and aggressive temperament soon became,Paragraph
one of the most audacious members of the avant-garde. Take the,Paragraph

"full assent to his principles, and although it was, according to",Paragraph
"J. J. P. Oud, who ought to know, precisely the enthusiasm",Paragraph
aroused by Wright’s form that to a large extent paved the way,Paragraph
for cubism in architecture.,Paragraph
Cubism—that is one of the numerous currents in art originat-,Paragraph
ing from the reaction against impressionism. With it came the,Paragraph
"turn from the naturalistic picture to the stylized image, in short",Paragraph
"to a canon of style. Cubism traces its origin back to Cézanne,",Paragraph
who tried to lead painting beyond the dissolving tendencies of,Paragraph
impressionism to a higher development. His problem was figura-,Paragraph

and devoted all his efforts in a life full of work to develop a,Paragraph

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NEW STYLE,Title
To characterize in brief the attributes of this new form-type:,Paragraph
"the bulk of the building is broken up in parts, following cu-",Paragraph
"bistic principles, and the various parts by skillful grouping of",Paragraph
"the masses are then composed into a whole, in its aspect “still",Paragraph
revealing the elements of the original analysis.” To such a sim-,Paragraph
plified form of geometrical character belongs the flat roof; it is,Paragraph
the logical consequence of the esthetic principle of the style: the,Paragraph
cubic blocks of the building mass and the even planes of its walls,Paragraph
need a clear and sharp-edged contour. The loosening of the,Paragraph
building bulk and the dynamic grouping of the masses afford,Paragraph
"by means of the resulting shadows all the molding desirable, and",Paragraph
lead to a plain treatment of the fagades which are consequently,Paragraph
designed for graphic rather than for plastic effects. This explains,Paragraph
"the preference for smooth, white-colored plaster for covering the",Paragraph
outer walls: it is favored because it emphasizes the intended ef-,Paragraph
fect by strengthening the black-white appearance. And this kind,Paragraph
"of surface treatment, showing no longer any joints, also serves |",Paragraph
"to express the tendency toward dematerializing of the walls, the",Paragraph
"lightening of its mass and weight, and to articulate its new char-",Paragraph
"acter as a mere skin, which it achieved with the adoption of",Paragraph
modern skeleton construction. In the total aspect the graphic,Paragraph
element prevails: line takes a decisive part and becomes once,Paragraph
again the acknowledged leader of plastic form. The building,Paragraph
"mass, largely loosened and lightened, assumes the strength of its",Paragraph
plastic effect through the interplay of large even planes and the,Paragraph
clear flow and graduated dynamics of lines. Hence follows that,Paragraph
striking similarity with the stylistic features which Wilhelm,Paragraph
Pinder has given for the medieval sculpture of about 1400; and,Paragraph
he himself has pointed to this stupendous parallel in the pur-,Paragraph
"suits of modern art. “The eye of the spectator,” he says, “should",Paragraph
"not take in the volume at once, but should rise with the lines",Paragraph
"along the contour. Everything tangible is transmuted, so to",Paragraph
"speak, to a lighter substance. The form becomes alive for the",Paragraph
traveling rather than for the fixed glance. The eye is not offered,Paragraph
"single and separate main views, on the expansions of which it",Paragraph
"can rest; but it is kept in gliding motion, along the lines and",Paragraph
contours of the figure.” These features came to prominence in,Paragraph
"Wright’s art, where we have found them developed to highest",Paragraph
"effectiveness. And after all, they are features not only of archi-",Paragraph
"tectural composition, but also, as plainly proved by the para-",Paragraph
"digm of this master, characteristic of the change in the idea of",Paragraph
"structure, of the turn to organic planning.",Paragraph
"In its aspect, and in full contrast to Wright’s form, the new",Paragraph
form-type is of intentional and elaborate simplicity. Its physiog-,Paragraph
"nomical expression is crabbed and severe, but with all the scanti-",Paragraph
"ness and even parsimony of the form, the type attains a certain",Paragraph
"solidity, and even elegance, through the careful treatment of",Paragraph
"construction, through the exactness and-precision of the tech-",Paragraph
"nical details. Endowed with inner control and outer coldness,",Paragraph
"filled with renunciation, the new form convinces through the",Paragraph
ethic force of the style idea more than the sensuous effects of its,Paragraph
"artistic substance. The style idea always prevails, and the more",Paragraph
the personality of the single artist steps back behind the general,Paragraph
"aims of the school, the more the character of the building ap-",Paragraph
pears impersonal.,Paragraph
"With the rise of this style of cubism, the new spirit of build-",Paragraph
ing entered a new phase which up to now is also its Jatest one.,Paragraph
The generative impulse of the new spirit is now no longer lim-,Paragraph
ited to the more or less interesting experiments of individuals.,Paragraph
"Diffusing itself ever wider, its ideas have penetrated everywhere:",Paragraph
its sphere extends from Europe over the United States to the,Paragraph
Far East. And the results of its work prove unmistakably the,Paragraph
coherence of a world-wide school. The new spirit has now soared,Paragraph
far beyond any special concern with the overthrow of historic,Paragraph
"forms. In its progress, it has coined elements of a new language,",Paragraph
and although it may not yet be able to use that language for,Paragraph
"speaking in pure poetry, it has already changed the outward",Paragraph
forms of our time.,Paragraph
THE INTERNATIONAL LEADERS,Title
Among the great number of architects who share in the de-,Paragraph
"velopment of this new language, there are a few individualities",Paragraph
whose work has gained international influence. The first place,Paragraph
is due to J. J. P. Oud. Gifted with great artistic talents sustained,Paragraph
"by an intelligence of equal strength, he was predestined for the",Paragraph
"profession of architect. Born in 1890, he grew up in the ideas",Paragraph
of Berlage who by means of purification had established a new,Paragraph
"discipline and integrity of form. To Oud, who was well. ac-",Paragraph
"quainted with Berlage’s theory, based on geometrical concepts,",Paragraph
"the ideas of cubism came as enlightenment, developing his self-",Paragraph
consciousness. He joined a group of young painters connected,Paragraph
"by kindred views, and with Peter Mondrian and Theo van Does-",Paragraph
"burg, he founded a magazine, De Stijl, as a center for the devel-",Paragraph
opment and interpetation of the theory and principles of the,Paragraph
new style of cubism.,Paragraph
"When he first came to practice, he was still under the com-",Paragraph
"manding infltence of Berlage, and in such buildings as the large",Paragraph
"apartment blocks for workmen, erected in a suburb of Rotter-",Paragraph
"dam, he even surpassed the master in puritanism. The plain",Paragraph
"blocks, built in brick, present an exterior of an almost repellent",Paragraph
coldness‘and austerity. Impelled by his fresh enthusiasm for the,Paragraph
"ideas of cubism, he then designed a series of projects demon-",Paragraph
strating the theory of the style and so truly devoted to principles,Paragraph
that they almost appear as products of academic sobriety. But,Paragraph
"from project to project he attained greater freedom, finally doing",Paragraph
"justice to his artistic talent, hitherto too much suppressed by the",Paragraph
disciplining forces of his intellectuality. As architect of the city,Paragraph
"of Rotterdam, he built a few housing schemes, proving that his",Paragraph
social responsibility and his respect for function is not infringed,Paragraph
by his profound respect for pure form. His experiments in col-,Paragraph
ored architecture prove not only his ability to overcome his early,Paragraph
"puritanism, but also his esthetic understanding of the functional",Paragraph
"meaning of color. In his buildings, however (and he has built",Paragraph
"all-too-few), he truly adheres to the principles of cubism, using",Paragraph
"no other form elements than cube, sphere and cylinder. He",Paragraph
"began with the simplest forms, strengthening his discipline by",Paragraph
"intentional primitiveness, and not before his latest work, a hous-",Paragraph
"ing scheme in the Hook of Holland, did he advance to the use",Paragraph
of the curve. Oud is extremely severe and straightforward with,Paragraph
"himself. And so is his form: chaste and severe, but always really",Paragraph
"finished, and filled with music and rhythm. And so his work",Paragraph
gives both a summary of the stage of development and a meas-,Paragraph
ure of quality for the achievements the new spirit of building,Paragraph
has reached up to now.,Paragraph
"A congenial talent, and related to Oud in many respects, is",Paragraph
"Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Born in 1886, he worked as a begin-",Paragraph
"ner in the atelier of Peter Behrens, whose great form and monu-",Paragraph
mental style must have most nearly responded to the innate in-,Paragraph
"stinct of the youngster. Developing this instinct, he became a",Paragraph
"true guardian of the spirit of form, and thereby a leader in a",Paragraph
"generation which, by its tendency towards theory and principle",Paragraph
as well as by its inclination to try the new potentialities of,Paragraph
"modern technique, is often enticed to one-sided occupation with",Paragraph
"the mere rationale of building. At the same time, however, Mies",Paragraph
"is devoted with all conviction to the new ideas of structure, and",Paragraph
pursues their problems with a resolute radicalism not easily to,Paragraph
be equaled.,Paragraph
"He, too, approached the aims which direct the work of his",Paragraph
generation by way of cubism. From this period of his develop-,Paragraph
ment originated a project for a country house which as an ex-,Paragraph
"emplary work, demonstrating the ideas of the time in the most",Paragraph
"concentrated essence, gained among the young generation a fame",Paragraph
that started a new experimental school. The significance of this,Paragraph
"project lies not only in the esthetic element, which in the bold",Paragraph
dissolution of the building bulk and the plastic grouping of the,Paragraph
"single blocks, reduced to elemental geometric forms, clearly",Paragraph
"demonstrates the doctrine of cubism; it lies also, and even more,",Paragraph
"in the spiritual attitude of the project, manifesting the change",Paragraph
"in the idea of structure. Look, for instance, only at the ground",Paragraph
"plan. To be sure, it is fully based on a formal conception, and",Paragraph
"so close to the ideas of cubism that the design, eyed as a mere",Paragraph
"drawing, looks like the reproduction of one of Mondrian’s paint-",Paragraph
ings. Yet it also reveals the decisive transformations meanwhile,Paragraph
achieved in the inner structure. The single rooms are no longer,Paragraph
"bound in themselves, any more than is the bulk of the building.",Paragraph
"As in Wright’s most advanced examples of organic building, the",Paragraph
"boundaries of the rooms are loosened, their outer walls are fully",Paragraph
"opened, their volumes flow into one another, penetrate each",Paragraph
"other, and thereby achieve a connection more intimate than the",Paragraph
"mechanical one of geometric order, accomplished by the mere",Paragraph
relation of axes.,Paragraph

form.,Paragraph
Interpreting these revolutionary methods of modern construc-,Paragraph
"tion in the scientific terms of Statics, one may say that modern",Paragraph
construction brought about a transition from the inflexible to,Paragraph
"the flexible, from the stiff to the elastic methods of building. As",Paragraph
"to its nature, modern construction is framework, related in its",Paragraph

"steel frame construction is called a skeleton, language accurately",Paragraph

One of the main advantages derived from this new method,Paragraph
of construction is the complete freedom gained for the arrange-,Paragraph
ment of the ground plan. The distribution of the rooms is com-,Paragraph
"pletely independent of the relation to supporting walls, formerly",Paragraph
"enforced by constructive necessities. The wall itself, freed from",Paragraph

"The wall openings are widened, the windows turn into glass",Paragraph
"walls, the whole building bulk loosens up, and there results a",Paragraph
structure of floating lightness which seems almost entirely freed,Paragraph

MODERN BUILDING NOT A PASSIVE PRODUCT OF TECHNIQUE,Title
"To be sure, modern construction responds readily to the ideas",Paragraph
"of organic structure, and is an obedient tool for realizing the",Paragraph
principles of order followed by the new spirit of building.,Paragraph
"Hence, it is a common opinion, repeated again and again, that",Paragraph
"modern building is a result, or a downright product, of modern",Paragraph
technique. And this widely current but still untenable opinion,Paragraph
"implies enthusiastic praise to some, moral indignation to others.",Paragraph
Certain though it may be that modern technique is one of the,Paragraph
"most important and strongest components of new building, it is",Paragraph
nevertheless quite erroneous to assume that modern construction,Paragraph
"will produce of itself, somewhat in the way of cause and effect,",Paragraph
the new forms of architecture. There are enough modern build-,Paragraph
ings which plainly disprove such an assumption. In their erec-,Paragraph
tion extensive use is made of modern methods of construction,Paragraph
"and of new building materials, but from their outer appearance",Paragraph
nobody would ever realize the character of this construction.,Paragraph
The structure is covered with a rich drapery of historical styles,Paragraph

Under cover of this historical dress nothing of the powerful,Paragraph
effect spreading from the bare structure is to be perceived. In,Paragraph
"7,",Title
"fact, these buildings are, as it was said of the goddess Aphrodite,",Paragraph

FORMAL INTERPRETATION OF THE NEW CONSTRUCTION,Title
Although the new construction does not produce the new,Paragraph
"architectural form of itself, it is based on a distinct principle of",Paragraph
structure that decisively needed to be followed in developing,Paragraph
the architectural form. And in so far we may say that the archi-,Paragraph
tectural form is inherent and latently included in the construc-,Paragraph
"tion itself. And it is of the greatest interest, indeed, to study how",Paragraph
the modern architect deals with these new form problems in-,Paragraph
"volved in modern construction, how he tries to interpret its",Paragraph
character by an expressive form appealing to emotion.,Paragraph
"In this way, through translating the nature of modern con-",Paragraph
"struction into a new means of architectural expression, have",Paragraph
arisen all the new and well-known forms which characterize,Paragraph
"modern building. Take, for instance, that striking wall-pattern",Paragraph
dividing the facade into long horizontal strips of spandrels and,Paragraph
"glass areas, generally used for modern office buildings and de-",Paragraph
partment stores. It has been derived from modern cantilever con-,Paragraph

guide the eye in rapid flight along the building.,Paragraph
Modern construction has also bestowed upon building the,Paragraph

has been developed into architectural forms that give to build-,Paragraph
"ing the fantastic effect of floating. Floating, by the way, is a func-",Paragraph
"tion limited to organisms, and as a function of building, it was",Paragraph
"unknown, indeed, to classic architecture, based as that was on",Paragraph
"the static laws of Geometry. Elevated above the ground level,",Paragraph
"without any visible base, the building seems to be suspended",Paragraph
"in the air, demonstrating a new lightness of its masses. That it",Paragraph
"does not need any external piers or stilts, that it supports itself,",Paragraph
is by intuition not to be reconciled with the laws of gravity.,Paragraph
"These laws, however, are repealed by the inner strength of the",Paragraph
"construction, by the elastic force of steel, acting invisibly. This",Paragraph
"amazing process, made possible with the progressive conquest",Paragraph
"of nature by the human mind, excites the play of the imagina-",Paragraph

"It is, indeed, the nature of modern construction, characterized",Paragraph
"by its elastic structure, that with it the natural statics and its",Paragraph
"laws of load and support, gained from immediate experience of",Paragraph
"the human body, have been overcome to the benefit of a ration-",Paragraph
alistic domination of matter. It is worth mentioning that just,Paragraph
this spiritual domination of matter and the turning away from,Paragraph
the natural truth of experience and intuition have been declared,Paragraph
to be the aim and characteristic of expressionism in architecture.,Paragraph
"Indeed, this aim is discernible, as it was in Gothic, which denied",Paragraph
with the greatest consequence this natural truth of experience.,Paragraph
"With the achievement of modern technique, there have been",Paragraph
"developed new forms, which “though they appear of a quite",Paragraph
"rationalistic nature, a pure objectification in the material,",Paragraph
plainly prove their purely spiritual origin.” And just from its,Paragraph
strict objectivity regarding the principles of structure the new,Title
form acquires its fantastic features. As George Dehio has said,Paragraph
of the Gothic: “As construction it is full of the most ingenious,Paragraph
"rationalism, but only in the reality of construction; in appear-",Paragraph
"ance, it looks quite irrationalistic, that is to say subdued to a",Paragraph
higher than earthly causality.”,Paragraph
CONSTRUCTIVISM,Title
The modern architect feels a naive pleasure in the new tech-,Paragraph
"nical acquisitions, and sometimes he is obviously carried away",Paragraph
by the possibilities of modern building technique and by the,Paragraph
"expressiveness of modern building materials. This enthusiasm,",Paragraph
"as may be easily understood, occasionally leads to exaggerations.",Paragraph
"On one hand, the esthetic charms of the materials are misused",Paragraph
"for simply decorative effects; on the other, the technical inno-",Paragraph
vations are overemphasized: in both cases the value of the ma-,Paragraph
terial is overrated to the detriment of the esthetic substance of,Paragraph
the form. It may be true to the purpose to fill the interior of a,Paragraph
"workshop, or a factory, with light by complete dissolution of",Paragraph
the outer walls in glass. It may also be desirable to enlarge the,Paragraph
window-openings in our houses to give the interior close con-,Paragraph
tact with surrounding nature. The extent to which building has,Paragraph
"meanwhile been affected by this sound tendency, is to be seen",Paragraph
"from estimates, published in Robert S. Lynd’s study on Middle-",Paragraph
"town, according to which the majority of houses, constructed in",Paragraph
"the last ten or fifteen years, have at least fifty per cent more glass",Paragraph
surface than in 1890. But in many a modern house the use of,Paragraph
"glass seems to be taken as a point of honor, as an article of faith,",Paragraph
"so to speak, the credo being to enlarge the area of the window-",Paragraph
openings to the utmost. Such exaggerations grow only from the,Paragraph
wish to revel in technical novelties and to boast of the charm,Paragraph
of new materials. What Le Corbusier said is true: that a window,Paragraph
may as well be three hundred feet as three feet wide. But it,Paragraph
becomes pure dogmatism when the real demands of function,Paragraph
are sacrificed to the theory; for then it is no better than the aim-,Paragraph
less insistence on the use of axes in academic architecture. A,Paragraph
"kind of esthetic constructivism exists in modern building, com-",Paragraph
posing with the elements of modern construction and machinery,Paragraph
in the same way that academic architecture composes with col-,Paragraph
umns and cornices. The works of this modern romanticism of,Paragraph
"the machine do not lack a sensational effect, but still this effect,",Paragraph
"as in all sorts of academic composition, is of a merely decorative",Paragraph
"character, and does not rest on truth of artistic form.",Paragraph
There is also to be found in modern building a sort of primi-,Paragraph
tive constructivism. Impressed by the emotional effect spread-,Paragraph
"ing from the bare structure, many an architect takes mere con-",Paragraph
"struction to be the same as architectural form. Construction,",Paragraph
"however, is an end in itself only for the engineer; for the archi-",Paragraph
tect it is still a raw material to be molded and brought into,Paragraph
"architectural form. When, however, the process of transforming",Paragraph
the structure from the sphere of mere technique to the sphere,Title
"of art has not yet begun, or remains unfinished, the work of the",Paragraph
"architect gets stuck in the material. And as architectural form,",Paragraph
it lacks the emotional appeal which the construction affords.,Paragraph
The esthetic value attributed in our time to the pure form,Paragraph
of use must not eclipse the fundamental truth that the sphere,Paragraph
"of Technique is separate from that of Art. To be sure, the pure",Paragraph
"form of use is existent in both spheres, and grows in each. But",Paragraph
it can only develop into a work of art if it is elevated by the,Paragraph
"creative spirit to a sphere where necessity becomes freedom,",Paragraph
where form follows the rules of reason but keeps its meaning,Paragraph
"beyond all reason and, freed from the idea of use and purpose,",Paragraph
appeals to the senses and the emotions alone by its form.,Paragraph
LACK OF ORNAMENT,Title
"Modern building, on its way toward a definite form, is very",Paragraph
"likely to develop a sort of technical style, a style which accepts,",Paragraph
"both practically and imaginatively, the qualities inherent in ma-",Paragraph
terials; a style which consciously utilizes for its forms the cul-,Paragraph
"tivated beauty of the finished materials, the visual surface values",Paragraph
"of steel, glass, ceramics, and so forth; values achieved by an in-",Paragraph
"tensive process of technical refinement. Modern building, since",Paragraph
it relies on the work of machine and industrial technique rather,Paragraph
"than on the work of craftsmen, cannot have ornament. But what",Paragraph
"it loses in this respect, it regains many fold by the charm and",Paragraph
"expressiveness inherent in its refined materials, the exactitude",Paragraph
"of its technique, and the precision of its forms. As an essential",Paragraph
"product of our time and as a truthful expression of modern life,",Paragraph
"modern building, it has to be granted, will probably not look",Paragraph
"otherwise than our machines, our airplanes and automobiles.",Paragraph
"It will not be more pleasant in its features, more poetic or ro-",Paragraph

"5, NEW BUILDING TYPES",Title
ON THE NATURE OF THE TYPE,Title
"The ideas of modern building, at the beginning of the nine-",Paragraph
"teenth century only an inspiration, have now grown into reali-",Paragraph
zation. The new spirit has meanwhile created a great number,Paragraph
"of new building types, proving the strength as well as the limits",Paragraph
of its generative power.,Paragraph
These types have not arisen as individual creations of a sin-,Paragraph
gle architect. The type is the final product of a common creative,Paragraph
"process, continued through generations and shared in by current",Paragraph
"customs and habits of life, by the economic forces of the age",Paragraph
"and its technical potentialities, as well as by the formative skill",Paragraph
"of many architects. Now, in times in which a constant order",Paragraph
"prevails and life runs its steady course in fixed paths, the archi-",Paragraph
"tect finds his work well prepared, his task well outlined: for the",Paragraph
"part he has to contribute to that creative process, he is directed",Paragraph
by the guiding star of living traditions. From the constancy of,Paragraph
"the time and the established authority of its social order, there",Paragraph
results a definite uniformity of demands from which gradually,Paragraph

basement; an arrangement not only detrimental to the efficiency,Paragraph
"of housekeeping, but also spoiling the comforts of domestic life",Paragraph
by separating the ground floor from the garden level.,Paragraph
It is due to the new habits of life that this questionable type,Paragraph
of house has meanwhile died out. The style of life has entirely,Paragraph
"changed in our time, and with it the type of our houses. We live",Paragraph
as informally as our parents lived conventionally. We regard,Paragraph
>!,Title
the house as an efficient instrument for living a natural life and,Paragraph
"not, like our forebears, as an ornament for social display to be",Paragraph
paid for with no matter how many inconveniences.,Paragraph
The diminished desire for social display reacted upon the,Paragraph
"house, first, with a decrease in the demand for purely formal",Paragraph
"spaciousness. Less room is needed, also, since in the modern",Paragraph
"economic system, working place and dwelling place have been",Paragraph
definitely separated: one works downtown in the city but lives,Paragraph
"in a suburb. Moreover, the lives of the family’s members are",Paragraph
for a good part of the day spent outside of the home. This is a,Paragraph
"general rule for the man; it is in many cases true for his wife,",Paragraph
"too, as far as she is induced, by necessity or vocation, to practice",Paragraph
a profession; it is particularly true for the children who with,Paragraph
the extended system of public education are for many hours,Paragraph
"detained in school, at the playing field or in their youth organi-",Paragraph
"zations. Thus, in the modern house the dwelling space has been",Paragraph
greatly reduced as to both the total number of rooms and their,Paragraph
dimensions.,Paragraph
"This tendency towards reducing the living space, so character-",Paragraph
"istic of our times, cannot be explained on economic grounds",Paragraph
"alone, though the vexatious problem of keeping servants, sharply",Paragraph

"the United States, the dwelling demand of modern man in the",Paragraph

"completeness of its technical equipment, and in its elaborate",Paragraph
"fitting strictly limited to the necessary, this type affords, indeed,",Paragraph
everything to satisfy modern dwelling demands—except the rep-,Paragraph
resentation of personal taste.,Paragraph
The restriction as to the extent of dwelling space is compen-,Paragraph
"sated, on the other hand, by increased demands for efficiency,",Paragraph
guaranteeing by an elaborate organization of the ground plan,Paragraph
a far-reaching simplification of household work and a smooth,Paragraph
and frictionless flow of domestic life. It is this enhanced demand,Paragraph
for efficiency which in the modern house has led to the pro-,Paragraph
"gressive specialization of the rooms. In the seventeenth century,",Paragraph
"the bedroom, to infer from its furniture, was at the same time",Paragraph
"living- and dining-room, dressing chamber and reception room.",Paragraph
The modern house provides single rooms for each of these pur-,Paragraph
poses; and a further division and differentiation of the rooms,Paragraph
has occurred all over the house: a development which corre-,Paragraph
"sponds to the principles of modern technique, according to",Paragraph
which the increase of efficiency is sought through functional di-,Paragraph
vision of labor. The improvement of quality in modern tech-,Paragraph
"nics, said Wilhelm Ostwald, is attained through a process which",Paragraph
is also denoted in living organisms as a characteristic and a meas-,Paragraph
ure of progress: that is through the distribution of the different,Paragraph
a. Te,Title
functions to specialized organs. In this sense the modern house,Paragraph
satisfies the increased demands for efficiency by differentiating,Paragraph
its organism and assigning the various functions of domestic,Paragraph
"life, such as working, eating, cooking, sleeping, to separate and",Paragraph
particularly specialized organs.,Paragraph
"With this change of its organization, the modern house gained",Paragraph
many times in comfort what it lost in grandeur. Private houses,Paragraph
of palatial dimensions are left to us only as historical monu-,Paragraph
"ments; and when they are still to be met in present times, their",Paragraph
owners almost always prove to be loaded with historical reminis-,Paragraph
cences. Living accommodations of such an extent as the ruler,Paragraph
of Versailles once conceived as the type of shelter suitable to,Paragraph
"his rank, are hardly thinkable today. But we also read that some-",Paragraph
times the smoke of the fireplaces disturbed his repose in the,Paragraph
"sumptuous rooms, and that their pompous luxury did not save",Paragraph
Le Roi Soleil from occasionally having his wine served frozen,Paragraph
"on the table. Due to the advances of technique, we are spared",Paragraph
such inconveniences in our modest and limited dwellings. And,Paragraph
"when we speak today of luxury in a dwelling, a new connota-",Paragraph
tion is given to the word. It does not mean a vast extent of,Paragraph
"dwelling space, but the increased comfort obtained by the more",Paragraph
ample technical equipment.,Paragraph
The rapid increase in such equipment was shown in a series,Paragraph
of interesting sketches suggested by the late Henry Wright and,Paragraph
published in the Journal of the American Institute of Archi-,Caption
tects in 1922. These sketches follow the historical development,Paragraph
"from the dwelling of the first American colonists, which con-",Paragraph
"sisted of only two rooms and an open fireplace, up to the house",Paragraph
"of the present, which, with the increasing use of the oil furnace",Paragraph
is definitely ridding itself of the unavoidable dirt connected with,Paragraph
the use of coal. Electric current is used for every type of house-,Paragraph
"hold work, for cooking as well as for cleaning and washing. And",Paragraph
a great number of electrical appliances has been introduced for,Paragraph
saving labor in the management of the home. Finally with the,Paragraph
"radio, the latest addition, the modern house has gained a new",Paragraph
"and highly sensitive organ, enabling it to catch the voice of the",Paragraph
world.,Paragraph
Another aspect of the modern style of life is the great regard,Paragraph
"for all sorts of sport, and the emphasis on bodily hygiene. These",Paragraph
characteristics of our mode of life are also expressed in the new,Paragraph
type of domestic building. Modern man wishes to enjoy in his,Paragraph
house the benefits of an outdoor existence. He disdains the,Paragraph
padded comfort and the somber atmosphere of Victorian par-,Paragraph
lors. He does not care for the narrow apertures toward the out-,Paragraph
"side; he demands bright rooms, filled wth light and air. In short,",Paragraph
"he asks, perhaps as compensation for the dehumanizing anomaly",Paragraph
"of a mechanized life, for a type of house that opens itself on all",Paragraph
sides and also on its roof to the stimulating and regenerative,Paragraph
virtues of nature.,Paragraph
To these demands the modern house responds with its wide-,Paragraph
"opening windows, its large terraces and roof gardens, generally",Paragraph
known as the most characteristic and most popular features of,Paragraph
"its exterior. And it responds to them, also, with an organization",Paragraph
"of its interior which, based on the principles of organic order,",Paragraph
in its aspect entirely deviates from the traditional conceptions,Paragraph
"of architectural space. In the modern house, as a matter of fact,",Paragraph
a. ae,Title
"there is no longer to be found the type of architectural space,",Paragraph
firmly enclosed and resting in itself: that product of geometric,Paragraph
order the beauty of which consists in the balance and harmony,Paragraph
"of its proportions. Space has become mobile, its limits are melt-",Paragraph
"ing away, its surrounding walls are blasted asunder. The rooms",Paragraph
of the house penetrate each other and interlace in new com-,Paragraph
"binations. And this not only in one plane, but simultaneously",Paragraph
"in several planes: with the partition walls between rooms, there",Paragraph
is also eliminated the separation between the stories. The whole,Paragraph
"building from top to bottom is developed, as shown, for ex-",Paragraph
"ample, in the houses built by Le Corbusier, into a loose struc-",Paragraph
"ture of living space. The increased opening of the outer walls,",Paragraph
"the widening of the windows, help to abolish the customary form",Paragraph
of an optically limited space: the within is united with the with-,Paragraph
"out. In fact, this kind of space is no longer to be defined in terms",Paragraph
"of rigid geometry, it presents an undeterminable, indistinct, un-",Paragraph
"shaped mass. In other words, space has lost its architectural au-",Paragraph
tonomy. Where the structure is determined by the principle of,Paragraph
"organic order, the idea of abstract space has lost its meaning.",Paragraph
Space becomes neutralized in its relation to architectural or style,Paragraph
"ideas, it is imagined and evaluated as cosmic space, as life-space",Paragraph
only. And within that life-space there are planned and placed,Paragraph
the various objects needed for the development of domestic life.,Paragraph
This change in the conception of space is revealed in a highly,Paragraph
advanced example in the House Tugendhat built by Mies van,Caption
"der Rohe in Brno. In this house, which makes full use of the",Paragraph
new freedom which the skeleton construction confers on the de-,Paragraph
"velopment of the ground plan, the entire domestic section of the",Paragraph
"first story is developed into a single unit, to be divided into loose",Paragraph
parts or mere niches by screens or curtains only. Neither the,Paragraph
unit itself nor any of its various subdivisions shows any form,Paragraph
of optically limited space. The more so since the outer walls,Paragraph
"are entirely opened in large areas of glass, to be lowered by",Paragraph
"motor power, so that the interior becomes united with the out-",Paragraph
"side world, with the all-space of the universe. Yet while the sec-",Paragraph
tion of the first story serving the family for common use is,Paragraph
"loosened up to the extreme, the rooms of the upper story serv-",Paragraph
ing the private life of the single members are rather secluded.,Paragraph
"The house is located on the crest of a slope, and much as it un-",Paragraph
folds its face to the garden and the view into the surrounding,Paragraph
"landscape, as fully it keeps its walls closed towards the street.",Paragraph
This house displays the new ideas in an almost programmatic,Paragraph
form. And regarding the complete loosening of the walls in the,Paragraph
"lower floor, one might doubt whether such an interior can still",Paragraph
"afford that comfortable feeling of being sheltered which, after",Paragraph
"all, we are supposed to expect from a house. The residents, who",Paragraph
"are the first concerned with that question, felt obliged in the",Paragraph
interest of their architect to publish their experiences (in an,Paragraph
"article in Die Form, the Deutscher Werkbund’s magazine, in",Paragraph
1931). They declared that they had no reason for complaint.,Paragraph
"They ought to know, and it would be unfair to assume that the",Paragraph
new feeling for life which finds its ease and comfort in that,Paragraph
"house, would be willing to manage without such psychical val-",Paragraph
ues. Only it is a different mentality in which this feeling has its,Paragraph
"roots from that of former ages, which had another idea of space",Paragraph
"and of the universe as well. In former times, space dominated",Paragraph
"man, and he found his happiness in submitting himself in his",Paragraph
own room to the autonomy of its geometric laws. In modern,Paragraph
"times, man dominates space, and consequently he also denies its",Paragraph
limits in his own rooms.,Paragraph
Not alone has a changed conception of space affected the sur-,Paragraph

THE NEED OF A NEW TYPE,Title
Nothing perhaps shows better how much the development of,Paragraph
new types depends upon the sociological conditions of the time,Paragraph
than the situation in housing. Nowhere are more clearly to be,Paragraph

"problem has been acute, urgently demanding a solution. The",Paragraph

that new social stratum which was to form the broad basis of,Paragraph
the new industrial structure. The requisite type would have,Paragraph
"heen a small dwelling, consisting of about three or four rooms,",Paragraph
"according to the income level of that class, and at the so-called",Paragraph
"reasonable rent, a monthly rent not higher than one week's",Paragraph

"temporary economics, to the free interplay of economic forces.",Paragraph
The results are known.,Paragraph
"Housing became a mere branch of real estate business, which",Paragraph
concerned itself with the realization of growing land values,Paragraph
rather than with the real needs of the community. The small,Paragraph
"dwelling, not realized at all as a special type, needing a special",Paragraph
"development and a particular method of land division, was at",Paragraph
first evolved on the remnants left over from the development of,Paragraph
"the high class dwelling, and these remnants were considered",Paragraph
"good enough, for people condemned to use them, for human",Paragraph
habitation.,Paragraph
"In New York, for instance, when with the rise of the business",Paragraph

"method of procedure, not hindered by any building restrictions,",Paragraph
was finally established as a norm with the development of the,Paragraph

population became masses of frightful congestion.,Paragraph
"In Berlin, the example of which was followed in great parts",Paragraph

There was even in pre-war times a full understanding of the,Paragraph

experts in all countries had realized the defects of the traditional,Paragraph
"methods of production, and showed the way needed for their",Paragraph

value and usefulness with the numerous experiments carried,Paragraph
through by co-operative housing societies. Their work showed,Paragraph
in practice that even when high land values necessitated the,Paragraph
"building of multi-family houses, much better results could be",Paragraph
obtained by replacing the obsolete subdivision of the block into,Paragraph
"small single lots by large scale construction, with the whole area",Paragraph
of the block as building unit.,Paragraph
Their excellent demonstrations of the possible development,Paragraph
of the small dwelling into a type of its own remained isolated;,Paragraph

deviations were necessary from the principles of the existing,Paragraph
"economic system, and new legal statutes and institutions had to",Paragraph
"be established. As these changes, however, interfered with the",Paragraph
traditional conceptions of capitalistic economy and with the,Paragraph
"privileged power of private interests, they were bound to fail.",Paragraph
Here it becomes manifest that the housing problem is not,Paragraph
"a technical or building problem only, but also, and in a predom-",Paragraph
"inant sense, an economic and political problem. Here it becomes",Paragraph
clear that a unified state of society is the main prerequisite for,Paragraph
"the rise and development of new building types. It needed, in",Paragraph
"fact, the energizing repercussions of a war to make the times",Paragraph
"ripe for those changes demanded by the experts, and to provide",Paragraph
the sociological background for their execution.,Paragraph
The crisis of thought following the World War brought,Paragraph
about a new social concept bringing home to public opinion the,Paragraph
"idea of social responsibility, of social control and readjustment.",Paragraph
"With this change of public opinion it became possible, at least",Paragraph
"in the field of housing, to deviate from the principles of private",Paragraph

was strengthened to such a degree that they could finally realize,Paragraph

"tural problems of housing. Now, for the first time, it became",Paragraph
"his task to develop, in accordance with actual and clearly defined",Paragraph
"needs, and with all the aid of technical science, a new type of",Paragraph
small dwelling.,Paragraph
His work started with the development of new methods of,Paragraph
layout. The obsolete scheme of subdividing the block in indi-,Paragraph
"vidual plots, characteristic of the old tenement house system,",Paragraph
"was entirely abandoned, and replaced by a system adapted to",Paragraph
"the principles of large scale construction, connecting in one",Paragraph
"homogeneous plan the area not only of a single block, but of",Paragraph
"entire city districts. With the whole block as a unit, only its",Paragraph
"borders are built upon, and with the structures no more than",Paragraph
two rooms deep. Rear buildings and courtyards are thereby,Paragraph
"eliminated, and replaced by large open spaces in the interior",Caption
"of the block, developed into common gardens and playgrounds",Paragraph
for children. Constant attempts to lower both the cost of layout,Paragraph
and the proportion of land coverage finally led to the “strip,Paragraph
"building method” (Zeilenbau). With this method, up to now",Paragraph
"the last stage of development, the blocks are arranged on the",Paragraph
"area to be built upon in long parallel rows, oriented according",Paragraph
"to the needs of latitude and climate, but irrespective of the di-",Paragraph
rection of the main traffic and communicating roads. For direct,Paragraph
"access to the single houses, small paths are provided and narrow",Paragraph
"sidewalks, lightly paved, to be used only for pedestrians. This",Paragraph
"new method, only possible under the new freedom procured by",Paragraph
"large scale operation, also secures the utmost economy in street",Paragraph
"building. Moreover, it does completely away with all sorts of",Paragraph
"courts, entirely abolishing the differentiation of front and rear.",Paragraph
Both facades are now of equal value as to their architectural,Paragraph
"aspect as well as for dwelling purposes, and every single dwelling",Paragraph
unit in such a super-block enjoys the same advantage of ex-,Paragraph
posure to the sun.,Paragraph
"With this new method of layout, there appears a new concept",Paragraph
of town planning; a concept revealing the structural ideas of,Paragraph
organic order with its attempt to restore to the city the natural,Paragraph
"world of the open landscape. With this concept, however, are",Paragraph
"also abandoned the esthetic ideas of town planning, inherited",Paragraph
"from Renaissance and Baroque times. The street, now regarded",Paragraph
"according to its natural function as a mere organ of traffic, is",Paragraph
freed from the esthetic function of representing the idea of archi-,Paragraph
"tectural space. And the blocks, no longer supposed to form with",Paragraph
"their fagades the enclosing walls of this architectural space, are",Paragraph
"simply placed within the open space of the urban scene, and",Paragraph
grouped according to the demands of exposure and the needs,Paragraph
of light and air.,Paragraph
The second and no less important task for the architect was,Paragraph
"the development of the new types of small dwellings, appropri-",Paragraph
ate in their plans to the living standards and the social concepts,Paragraph
of the prospective occupants. As with these standards narrow,Paragraph
"limits are assigned to the extent of dwelling space, it becomes",Paragraph
the more important to provide the best and most economical,Paragraph
use of the habitable floor area. Methodical studies have been,Paragraph
made for the planning of rooms in regard to domestic arrange-,Paragraph
"ment, especially to kitchen arrangement, in order to simplify",Paragraph
housekeeping and to lighten the work of housewives. By way of,Paragraph
"numerous experiments, an exact scientific method of planning",Paragraph
"has been developed, demonstrating how to construct in every de-",Paragraph
tail the single dwelling cell. It is the basic idea of that method,Paragraph
that the dwelling unit is a tool of living which in its form and,Paragraph
structure has to be adapted to the manifold functions of do-,Paragraph
"mestic life, such as working and resting, cooking and eating.",Paragraph
And it is the guiding principle of this method that the particular,Paragraph
function each single room has to serve determines its size and,Paragraph
"shape, the distribution of the windows and doors and even the",Paragraph
arrangement of the furniture.,Paragraph
"In developing the new types, it has become an almost general",Paragraph
practice to make the living-room as large as possible and to re-,Paragraph
strict the other rooms to the smallest size compatible with the,Paragraph
dimensions of the necessary furniture. In most of the new hous-,Paragraph
"ing developments, the furniture is built-in, wherever possible,",Paragraph
"sometimes even the beds, not only to save space but also to avoid",Paragraph
cluttering with superfluous movables which impéde cleaning.,Paragraph
"And the kitchen, equipped with all sorts of built-in furniture—",Paragraph
"wall cupboards, working tables, range, sink and tap—so arranged",Paragraph
"as to afford the highest degree of work economy, has developed",Paragraph
"into a sort of laboratory, its floor space reduced to a minimum.",Paragraph
"The limitation of habitable area, characteristic of these small",Paragraph
"housing schemes, is offset by freeing the single unit from former",Paragraph
demands on floor space through the transfer of private domestic,Paragraph
"functions to new commercial units, such as central heating",Paragraph
"plants, central baths and laundries, common garden courts, nur-",Caption

"The new multi-family house resulting from this development,",Paragraph
a building limited to three stories with two apartments on one,Paragraph

ing in common with the old tenement except the name. In this,Paragraph
new type of multi-family house the small dwelling unit changed,Paragraph
from the monstrosity it had been in the former mass-tenement,Paragraph
"to a well-shaped organic unit, to a living cell, full of life and",Paragraph
"friendly to life, a cell from which a healthy and well-formed",Paragraph
city structure could be developed. While in former days the dis-,Paragraph
order of small single fagades made impossible a homogeneous,Paragraph
"architectural effect even within one single street, the new method",Paragraph
"of housing production, based on large-scale operation, develops",Paragraph
great districts of the urban area into harmonious neighborhood,Title
units provided with the amenities of a human environment.,Paragraph
"The houses, always recurring in uniform types and arranged in",Paragraph
"long rows, are united under a common roof. These large groups,",Paragraph
"forming the architectural units of the housing scheme, are varied",Paragraph
by different groupings of the building masses.,Paragraph
"As their main and characteristic feature, however, uniformity",Paragraph
"prevails in these new housing schemes, as in the demands of the",Paragraph
"occupants, so in their architectural aspect. Their occupants are",Paragraph
"more or less of the same income group, and their living standards",Paragraph
do not allow much scope for individual preferences. This socio-,Paragraph
logical fact finds its obvious expression in the architectural physi-,Paragraph

uniformity is compulsory since it is inherent in the conditions,Paragraph

"by which the city is bounded in its organic growth—the physical,",Paragraph
"economic and social conditions of its existence. These facts, as-",Paragraph
"sembled by the geographer, the economist and the sociologist",Paragraph
"and laid down in the civic survey describing the nature, the",Paragraph
"character and the function of the city organism, form the solid",Paragraph
"base for the city planner’s work. This work, however, is solely",Paragraph
directed towards preparing for the organic growth of the city,Paragraph
by providing for the wise and economic use of the urban land.,Paragraph
"Taking the city as a living organism, it has to be developed",Paragraph
into a structure serving its various functions with the highest de-,Paragraph
"gree of efficiency. The city is a rather complicated organism, serv-",Paragraph
"ing first for work, in its manifold ramifications, including the",Paragraph
"various activities of trade, commerce and industry, next, for",Paragraph
"communication, and finally for housing and recreation. And as a",Paragraph
"living organism, the city practices these vital functions in perma-",Paragraph
"nent mutual interaction. Thus, the general plan, adjusting these",Paragraph
"various functions to special organs, divides the urban area in",Paragraph
"different zones, such as transportation zones, business quarters~",Paragraph
including both commercial and industrial zones—residential,Paragraph
quarters and green zones. Providing in advance certain areas of,Paragraph
"the urban ground for the purposes they are best suited to, ac-",Paragraph
"cording to their location or physical features, the plan prepares",Paragraph
the proper and economic utilization of the urban land. And the,Paragraph
art of planning consists in arranging and distributing these vari-,Paragraph
ous areas all over the urban ground in accordance with the re-,Paragraph
"quirements of their inner dynamics and functional relationship,",Paragraph
thus eliminating for the future any friction of space.,Paragraph
"In the modern city, according to such an organic plan, the",Paragraph
"main business districts, the seats of trade and commerce, the",Paragraph
"banks and office buildings, are concentrated in the central areas,",Paragraph
closely connected with the main railway stations. The industrial,Paragraph
"plants, however, the factories, workshops, and storehouses, are",Paragraph
not concentrated in one area alone in order to avoid traffic con-,Paragraph
gestion and overcrowding in the residential sections of the,Paragraph
"working population. Industrial zones, differentiated for light",Paragraph
"and heavy industries, are distributed throughout the city. To",Paragraph
further systematic decentralization large areas are provided for,Paragraph
"heavy industries on the fringes of the city, in close connection",Paragraph
"with the main freight yards, with waterways, canals, and com-",Paragraph
mercial harbors. Near to these industrial districts new housing,Paragraph
schemes are developed to shorten the daily travel between home,Paragraph
and working place. And these residential sections are separated,Paragraph

"penetrate the whole city, breaking as far as possible even into",Paragraph

"in the general plan for needs to come, for enlargements or new",Paragraph
"construction of all sorts of communication ways, railroads, high-",Paragraph
"ways, waterways, airports and so forth, should be used, as long",Paragraph
"as they are not needed, for open space and park grounds.",Paragraph
A NEW CITY TYPE IN THE MAKING,Title
"With the realization of these new ideas of planning, based on",Paragraph
the orderly differentiation and interrelation of both functions,Paragraph
"and structures, a new city type begins to arise. The modern",Paragraph
"city, instead of sprawling itself in an uncontrolled growth that",Paragraph
"would relentlessly engulf the countryside of field and forest, pro-",Paragraph
"ceeds by planned settlements, by garden suburbs and satellite",Paragraph
"towns, growing gradually into its natural surroundings. Inter-",Paragraph
"preting this new tendency towards decentralization, one may",Paragraph
suppose that the sharp boundaries between urban and rural,Paragraph
"districts, which we took as a given fact up to now, will loosen up",Paragraph
in the future. It seems as though we were entering a new epoch,Paragraph
"in the history of human settlement. In the Middle Ages, agri-",Paragraph
"cultural and industrial activities became definitely separated,",Paragraph
and the town became sharply distinguished from the surround-,Paragraph
"ing rural district, its boundaries marked by walls characterizing",Paragraph
the urban community as an independent seat of economy and ad-,Paragraph
ministration. It seems that in our time this principal distinction,Paragraph
"between town and country will be more and more wiped out,",Paragraph
"that the modern city, following the fundamental changes of eco-",Paragraph
nomic structure and according to the new conditions and needs,Paragraph
"of social life, bursts its boundaries, wandering out again into the",Paragraph
country. It seems that town and country begin to penetrate,Paragraph
"each other, fusing the two ways of life, thereby restoring to man",Paragraph
a natural and healthful life of work and play.,Paragraph
FROM TOWN PLANNING TO REGIONAL PLANNING,Title
"Therefore, the timely provision for the wise use of land must",Paragraph
not stop at the borderline of the urbar territory itself. The,Paragraph
urban development can no longer be considered as a problem by,Paragraph
"itself, but must be treated in a larger connection, as a part of the",Paragraph
"general problem of human settlement. In fact, town planning",Paragraph
has been supplemented in our time by another and wider plan-,Paragraph
ning activity; and if anything can prove the new mode of think-,Paragraph
"ing characteristic of our time, which conceives the problem of",Paragraph
"structure in terms of organic order, then it is that fresh and most",Paragraph
promising branch on the tree of the Arts which is called Regional,Paragraph
Planning.,Paragraph
"The regional concept, directed towards developing an area",Paragraph
"into an organic unity, has supplanted the traditional concept of",Paragraph
"political boundaries which usually arise by pure chance, the",Paragraph
historical heritage of previous wars or conquest. This static,Paragraph
concept of the political territory has been replaced by the dy-,Paragraph
namic concept of the geographical region the unit of which is to,Paragraph
be determined by the Jaws of its growth set by the physical condi-,Paragraph
tions of the area and its economic functions and its social needs.,Paragraph
Defining the region as “an area where land-work-folk fuse into a,Paragraph
"pattern coherent within, but differentiated from other regions",Paragraph
"without,” regional planning deals with the development of",Paragraph
"cities and countrysides, of industrial and natural resources, as",Paragraph
parts of a regional whole. And by organizing the area according,Paragraph
"to the requirements of its social, economic and cultural life and",Paragraph
"its relationship to other regions, regional planning aims at de-",Paragraph
veloping the region into an organism so well adapted to its en-,Paragraph
"vironment that it can fulfill, with the highest degree of efficiency,",Paragraph
all the various functions it has to serve for the good life of man.,Paragraph
"In European countries, the need for regional planning was",Paragraph
first felt in territories where abundant raw materials had called,Paragraph
"forth a conglomeration of industry, and therewith a fatal con-",Paragraph
"gestion of population. In England, the large coal districts in",Paragraph
"Kent and Wales, in Germany the rich mining region on the",Paragraph
"Ruhr, form a continuous area of cities, interlacing in each other",Paragraph
"and almost melting together. This development, for which Pat-",Paragraph
"rick Geddes, in his book Cities in Evolution coined the new term",Paragraph
"of “conurbation,” caused an acute state of congestion, local fric-",Paragraph
"tion and waste, whose difficult problems could be overcome only",Paragraph
"by a wider concept of planning, surpassing the municipal limits",Paragraph
and establishing a new administrative area taking within its,Paragraph
boundaries “all that was really functional for the whole region.”,Paragraph
"Meanwhile, the regional concept has been generally adopted",Paragraph
for reconstruction such overdeveloped areas as are exemplified,Paragraph
by most metropolitan regions. And in the United States the,Paragraph
"Tennessee Valley project, now under construction, represents",Paragraph
an experiment demonstrating the potentialities of regional plan-,Paragraph
"ning for the problem of an underdeveloped region; a region,",Paragraph
"however, which in its natural conditions and economic possibili-",Paragraph
ties affords all prerequisites for a new standard of civilization to,Paragraph
be established.,Paragraph
A NEW OUTLOOK,Title
"With the turn to the ideas of organic order, we are advancing",Paragraph
in planning from smaller to ever-larger units. From the former,Paragraph
"layout of single lots for individual houses, we advanced to the",Paragraph
larger unit of the neighborhood. When the larger population,Paragraph
"centers spread their influence over the surrounding areas, we",Paragraph
extended the field of planning from the city to the larger unit,Paragraph
of the metropolitan region. Realizing the relationship of the,Paragraph
metropolitan region to the larger unit of the geographical region,Paragraph
"of which it is a part, we advanced to regional planning, taking",Paragraph
"in not only the urban centers but the groups of cities, and of",Paragraph
"highways, and of natural resources that make up a unified dis-",Paragraph
"trict. In developing the regional concept, however, we discovered",Paragraph
"that there is also an interrelationship between these regions, and",Paragraph
"we are now advancing to state, and even to national planning,",Paragraph
preparing a new organization of the national territory by divid-,Paragraph
ing its area into regions of organic unity.,Paragraph
This progress in planning toward larger and larger units opens,Paragraph
"a new and hopeful outlook for the future. In the long run, the",Paragraph
"new concept of planning, guided by the principles of organic",Paragraph
"order, will not be restricted to that largest unit we have reached",Paragraph
"up to now, that unit which is determined by the political",Paragraph
"boundaries of a nation. In our dynamic life, there is going on a",Paragraph
continuous interaction between the various nations and coun-,Paragraph
tries all over the world. This interaction will and must lead to,Paragraph
"a new plan of the world, in which the outworn ideas of inflex-",Paragraph
ible political boundaries will give way to a new dynamic and,Paragraph
"flexible organic order, setting up a new entity of component and",Paragraph
"interrelated parts, which in closest association and peaceful co-",Paragraph
operation render effective service to the welfare of the greater,Paragraph
Commonwealth.,Paragraph
SUMMARY: THE FUTURE,Title
OF MODERN BUILDING,Title
"The new spirit of building, and the movement which it has",Paragraph
"originated, is of an international character, as is the crisis of",Paragraph
order from which it is derived. The problem pursued in the new,Paragraph
"spirit is common to all nations, rising from the same needs",Paragraph
and inducing spiritual alliances that cross national boundaries,Paragraph
for its solution.,Paragraph
It is for this reason that the works of modern building show a,Paragraph
"striking conformity all over the world, an almost style-like simi-",Paragraph
"larity of their form. Indeed, the works of modern building still",Paragraph
largely lack the differentiating note of national touch and char-,Paragraph
acter. The same happened at the rise of the Gothic: its modern-,Paragraph
"ism, too, grew out of the ground of a common building prob-",Paragraph
lem—the construction of the ribbed vault~which finally was,Paragraph
brought to its solution in a spiritual alliance of the Western na-,Paragraph
tions. And it was only in the historical course of its develop-,Paragraph
ment that the style gained its differentiating features derived,Paragraph
from the various and diversifying influences of national tradi-,Paragraph
tions and local peculiarities.,Paragraph
"With the national coloring, the forms of modern building",Paragraph
"also lack, as yet, that individual touch resulting from the refining",Paragraph
hands of the single master. But as long as the general solution of,Paragraph
"a problem is to be found, involving the development of a new",Paragraph
"type, the work of the single individuality becomes merged in the",Paragraph
co-operative work of the group. This turn from emphasizing the,Paragraph
individual talent to devoting it to the common problem is also,Paragraph
a characteristic noted in all times of important transformations,Paragraph
"in art. It is necessary first of all, said Wilhelm Pinder, to set up",Paragraph
"something new, a whole to which the work of the following",Paragraph
generations will then bring the differentiating features.,Paragraph
The creation of this new general form which the times call,Paragraph
for—that is the present aim of the new spirit of building. It is,Paragraph
"the Zeitgeist, the spirit of the age, which incarnates its form in",Paragraph
"modern building. As to the esthetic quality of this form, it can-",Paragraph
not be denied that it still suffers from the tendency towards mod-,Paragraph
"ernism, as form always does from any kind of tendency. In its",Paragraph
"pTesent state, there is very little to be said as to its artistic sub-",Paragraph
stance. As yet this form can be spoken of and evaluated only by,Paragraph
considering the mental attitude from which it originated. The,Paragraph
"form of modern building may still be crude, sober, and unfin-",Paragraph
"ished, resembling in this tentative nature the unsettled age in",Paragraph
"which it arises. But it also reveals new mental content, it mani-",Paragraph
fests a new value-concept related to the ideal of a new society,Paragraph
that is now emerging.,Paragraph
"This brings us back to our starting point. Building, as a func-",Paragraph
"tion of the community, is a social art. It is from society that the",Paragraph
"architect gets his task, and it is society that gives him the stuff",Paragraph
"that he has to mold into form. To the architect, society is both",Paragraph
"abettor and mediator of his creative work, which would be",Paragraph
"an effort in vacuo if dependent on itself. Thus, among the de-",Paragraph
"cisive factors the work of the architect is bounded by, the social",Paragraph
"conditions under which he enters his task, are of the greatest",Paragraph
importance—a fact which led Jakob Burckhardt to the conclu-,Paragraph
sion that greatness in architecture is more a product of the time,Paragraph
in question than of one or the other great master.,Paragraph
"', Greatness, however, is denied in our time not only to archi-",Paragraph
"tecture, but apparently to all art. In this era of social transforma-",Paragraph
"tion, life centers around other problems than those of art and",Paragraph
"artistic imagination. In the new spirit, however, in which this",Paragraph
time tries to overcome those other problems arising from the,Paragraph
"crisis of order, there are also rooted the principal ideas that guide",Paragraph
the international movement of new building. As a driving force,Paragraph
"by its moral principles, as a formative power in the sociological",Paragraph
"field, the movement has proved its rejuvenating and enlivening",Paragraph
"strength. And, therefore, the future belongs to it. Yet while it is",Paragraph
true that the spirit of new building can only grow and thrive,Paragraph
in an atmosphere where the driving forces of this time are felt,Paragraph
"and affirmed, it is likewise true that its forms can only unfold",Paragraph
and ripen to full maturity in the same measure as the changing,Paragraph
ideas of order succeed in accomplishing a new form of society.,Paragraph
