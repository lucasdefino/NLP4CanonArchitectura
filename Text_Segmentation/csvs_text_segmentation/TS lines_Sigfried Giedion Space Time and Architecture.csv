INTRODUCTION,Title
Unknown in the United States and using a language that is,Paragraph
"foreign to me, I must seek the shortest way to direct contact",Paragraph
with an American public. The way of personal contact is,Paragraph
"always the shortest route to understanding, not merely in",Paragraph
personal but in general matters. Let me begin then by saying a,Paragraph
few words about where I come from and where I intend to go —,Paragraph
for these facts have a bearing upon the discussion that follows.,Paragraph
As an art historian I am a disciple of Heinrich Wolfflin. In our,Paragraph
personal contacts with him as well as through his distinguished,Paragraph
"lectures, we, his pupils, learned to grasp the spirit of an epoch.",Paragraph
Wolfflin’s incisive analysis made clear to us the true meaning,Paragraph
and significance of a painting or a piece of sculpture.,Paragraph
He delighted in contrasting one period with another. He em-,Paragraph
ployed this method most effectively both in his teaching and,Paragraph
"in his books —in his Renaissance and Baroque (1889), in",Paragraph
"Classical Art (1899), in which the fifteenth century is opposed",Paragraph
"to the sixteenth, and even in his Principles of Art (Kunst-",Paragraph
"geschichtliche Grundbegriffe, 1915), which had just appeared",Paragraph
when I studied under him at Munich. Many of his pupils have,Paragraph
"tried to emulate this method of contrasting styles, but none",Paragraph
have achieved the same depth and directness.,Paragraph
"In my own first book, Late Baroque and Romantic Classicism",Paragraph
"(Munich, 1922, written as a thesis), I tried to follow Wolfflin’s",Paragraph
method. The periods contrasted were the end of the eighteenth,Paragraph
"century and the beginning of the nineteenth, both periods of",Paragraph
classicism. The Louis X VI style formed in shape and structure,Paragraph
"the end of late baroque tendencies, with classicism serving as",Paragraph
its framework. The classicism of the beginning of the nine-,Paragraph
teenth century found its most significant outlet in that country,Paragraph
"of romantics, Germany. In the architecture of the time the",Paragraph
trend toward an individualistic isolation of rooms from each,Paragraph
other was nowhere so strongly marked as it was in Germany —,Paragraph
"in the work of K. F. Schinkel, for example. This was the true",Paragraph
architectural equivalent of the individualism of the romantic,Paragraph
poets.,Paragraph
I called this period one of romantic classicism. Classicism in,Paragraph
"both periods was only a coloring — a transitory fact, as I would",Paragraph
7 PSremmeness ase,Caption
"say now. The essential characteristic of this time was that,",Paragraph
"beneath the classic exterior, the baroque inheritance had begun",Paragraph
to disintegrate and nineteenth century tendencies had begun,Paragraph
to appear.,Paragraph
The problem which fascinated me was how our epoch had been,Paragraph
"formed, where the roots of present-day thought lay buried.",Paragraph
This problem has fascinated me from the time I first became,Paragraph
capable of reasoning about it until today.,Paragraph
"Heinrich Wélfflin was the pupil of Jakob Burckhardt, and",Paragraph
succeeded him as professor at the University of Basle when he,Paragraph
was only twenty-seven years old. He later taught with great,Paragraph
success at Berlin and Munich. Wolfflin always laid stress on,Paragraph
the wide view taken by Jakob Burckhardt and often quoted,Paragraph
Burckhardt’s words not only in his lectures but also in con-,Paragraph
yersation. Thus the Swiss historical tradition formed the basis,Paragraph
of our instruction in the science of art. But I am afraid that,Paragraph
many of us did not grasp the significance of Burckhardt — a,Paragraph
significance which reached beyond his métier — until much,Paragraph
later.,Paragraph
Jakob Burckhardt (1818-1897) was the great discoverer of the,Paragraph
age of the Renaissance. He first showed how a period should,Paragraph
"be treated in its entirety, with regard not only for its painting,",Paragraph
"sculpture, and architecture but for the social institutions of its",Paragraph
daily life as well.,Paragraph
"I shall mention only one book in this connection, his Civiliza-",Paragraph
"tion of the Renaissance, which first appeared in 1860. The",Paragraph
English translation was produced in 1878. An extremely well-,Paragraph
informed review of it appeared in the New York Herald for,Paragraph
"October 20, 1880. Burckhardt, who normally shrank from",Caption
"praise, was so pleased with this review that he wrote “ Bravo!”",Paragraph
at the bottom.,Paragraph
In Cwilization of the Renaissance Burckhardt emphasized,Paragraph
sources and records rather than his own opinions. He treated,Paragraph
only fragments of the life of the period but treated them so,Paragraph
skillfully thal a picture of the whole forms in his readers’ minds.,Paragraph
Jakob Burckhardt had no love for his own time: he saw during,Paragraph
the forties an artificially constituted Europe which was on the,Paragraph
verge of being overwhelmed by a flood of brutal forces. The,Paragraph
South at that Lime appeared to have withdrawn from history ;,Paragraph
for Burckhardt it bad the quiet of a tomb. So it was to Lhe,Paragraph
"South, to [taly, that he turned for refuge from all those things",Paragraph
for which he fell hatred and disgust. Bul Burckhardt was a,Paragraph
"man of great vitality, and a man of vitality cannot entirely",Paragraph
desert his own time. His flight to Italy produced the finest,Paragraph
"traveler's guide that has ever been wrilten, his Cicerone",Paragraph
(1855) -- a book which has opened the eyes of four generations,Paragraph
"to the unique qualities of the Italian scene, His Civilization",Paragraph
of the Renaissance aimed at an objective ordering of factual,Paragraph
"material, but in it his greatest efforls are devoted to uncovering",Paragraph
"the origins of the man of loday. John Ruskin, Burekhardt's",Caption
"immediate contemporary, also hated the age and sought to",Paragraph
draw the means for its regeneration from other periods (though,Paragraph
not those which preoccupied the Swiss historian).,Paragraph
But I owe as large a debt to the artists of today as to these,Paragraph
guides of my youth. It is they who have laught me to observe,Paragraph
"seriously objects which seemed unworthy of interest, or of",Paragraph
interest only to specialists. Modern artists have shown that,Paragraph
mere fragments lifted from Lhe life of a period can reveal ils,Paragraph
habits and feelings; that one must have Lhe courage to take,Paragraph
small things and raise them to large dimensions.,Paragraph
These artists have shown in their pictures that the furniture of,Paragraph
"daily life, the unnoticed articles that result from mass produc-",Paragraph
"tion — spoons, bottles, glasses, all the things we look at hourly",Paragraph
without seeing — have become parts of our natures. They,Paragraph
have welded themselves into our lives without our knowing it.,Paragraph
My activities have brought me into friendly contact with the,Paragraph
architects of our day. We have sat together in small groups,Paragraph
"about many tables in Europe, from Stockholm to Athens —",Paragraph
not to discuss problems in art or matters of specialized detail,Paragraph
"but to determine as clearly as possible what directions housing,",Paragraph
"town planning, or regional planning had lo take. This close",Paragraph
and continual contact granted me the privilege of seeing,Paragraph
architectural problems in their nascent slate.,Paragraph
THE IHSTORIAN’S RELATION TO HIS AGE,Paragraph
"The historian. the historian of architecture especially, must be",Paragraph
in close contact with conlemporary conceplions.,Paragraph
Only when he is permeated by the spirit of his own Ume is he,Paragraph
prepared to detect those tracts of the past which previous,Paragraph
genera lions have overlooked.,Paragraph
History is nol static but dynamic. No generation ts privileged,Paragraph
to grasp a work of art from all sides: cach actively’ living,Paragraph
generation discovers new aspects of it. But these new aspects,Paragraph
will not be discovered unless the historian shows in his field the,Paragraph
cournze and energy which artists have displayed in their use of,Paragraph
methods developed in their own epoch.,Paragraph
"Archilects have imitated other periods, taken over their special",Paragraph
"shapes and techniques, in the hope of escaping from transitory",Paragraph
work and achieving a timeless rightness. And afler a short time,Paragraph
"their buildings have become lifeless masses of stone, in spite of",Paragraph
the incorporation into them of details from works of eternal,Paragraph
beauly. These men possessed the exact contrary of the,Paragraph
* Midas touch “ — everything they pul their hands on turned,Title
to dust rather Lhan to gold. Today we can see why. History,Paragraph
"is nol simply the repository of unchanging facts, bul a process,",Paragraph
a pattern of living and changing altitudes and interpretations.,Paragraph
"As such, itis deeply a part of our own natures. To turn back-",Paragraph
ward lo a past age is not just to inspect it. to find a pattern,Paragraph
which will be the same for all comers. The backward look,Paragraph
transforms its object: every spectator at every period —,Paragraph
"at every moment, indeed — inevitably transforms the past",Paragraph
according to his own nature. Absolute points of reference are,Paragraph
no more open to the historian than they are to the physicist;,Paragraph
both produce descriptions relative to a particular situation.,Paragraph
Likewise there are no absolute standards in the arts: the nine-,Paragraph
tecnth-century painters and architects who thought certain,Paragraph
"forms were valid for every age were mistaken, Flistory cannot",Paragraph
be Louched without changing it.,Paragraph
The painters of our period have formulated a different,Paragraph
atuitude: lo spetlatore nel centro del quadro. The observer must,Paragraph
"be placed in Lhe middle of the painting, not at some isolated",Paragraph
"observation point outside. Modern art, like modern science,",Paragraph
recognizes the fact that observation and what is observed,Paragraph
form one complex siLuation — to observe something is to act,Paragraph
upon and alter it.,Paragraph
THlistorians quile generally distrust absorption into contempo-,Paragraph
rary ways of thinking and feeling as a menace to their scientific,Paragraph
"detachment, dignity, and breadth of outlook. But one can be",Paragraph
"thoroughly the creature of one’s own period, embued with its",Paragraph
"methods, without sacrificing these qualities. Indeed. the",Paragraph
historian in every field must be united with his own time by,Paragraph
as widespread a system of roots as possible. The world of,Paragraph
"history, like the world of nature, explains itself only to Lhose",Paragraph
"who ask the right questions, raise the right problems. The his-",Paragraph
lorian must be intimately a part of his own period to know,Paragraph
what questions concerning the past are significant to it.,Paragraph
"Apart from this approach, history remains a wilderness of",Paragraph
blank happenings in which no creative work is possible.,Paragraph
Only dead chronologies and limited special studies will be,Paragraph
produced. The historian detached from the life of his own time,Paragraph
"writes irrelevant history, deals in frozen facts. But it is his",Paragraph
unique aud nontransferable task to uncover for his own age its,Paragraph
vital interrelalionships with the past.,Paragraph
The historian cannot in actual fact detach himself from the,Paragraph
"life about him; he, too, stands in the stream. The ideal his-",Paragraph
"torian — out of the press of affairs, au-dessis de la mélée, sur-",Caption
veying all time and all existence from a lofty pedestal — is a,Paragraph
fiction.,Paragraph
"The historian, like every other man, is the creature of his Lime",Paragraph
and draws from it both his powers and his weaknesses. By,Paragraph
virtue of lus calling he may survey a larger circle of events,Paragraph
"than his average conlemporary, bul this docs not lift him out of",Paragraph
his own historical selling. It is even to his advantage lo be,Paragraph
forced from his academic chair occasionally and made to,Paragraph
participate in Lhe common struggles of the moment. For direct,Paragraph
contact with life and its necessilies sharpens his abilities to,Paragraph
penetrate the jungle of printed records to the unfalsified voices,Paragraph
of the real actors.,Paragraph
It is the task of the historian to recognize the truth through,Paragraph
all its disguises.,Paragraph
Unfortunately the historian has often used his office to pro-,Paragraph
claim the eternal right of a static past. He has gone further,Paragraph
and has used arguments based on past happenings to restrict,Paragraph
and distort the future.,Paragraph
THE DEMAND FOR CONT,Title
ATY,Title
For planning of any sort our knowledge must go beyond the,Paragraph
state of affairs that actually prevails. To plan we must know,Paragraph
what lias gone on in the past and feel what is coming in the,Paragraph
future. This is not an invitation to prophecy but a demand,Paragraph
for a universal outlook upon the world.,Paragraph
At the present time the difficult field of town planning seems,Paragraph
to resist all handling. In times when a universal viewpoint,Paragraph
existed no genius was required to produce urban treatments of,Paragraph
high quality whose influence long outlasted the period of their,Paragraph
creation. Achievements brought about for a specific purpose,Paragraph
and # specific social class proved serviceable in a quite different,Paragraph
period for different purposes and different groups. This was,Paragraph
possible simply because the original crealion came out of a,Paragraph
universal point of view.,Paragraph
Today the urge toward such universality is deeply felt by,Paragraph
evervone. It is the reaction against a whole century spent in,Paragraph
living from day to day. What we sce around us is the reckon-,Paragraph
ing that this shortsightedness has piled up.,Paragraph
"This living from day to day, from hour to hour, with no feeling",Paragraph
"for relationships, does not merely lack dignity; it is neither",Paragraph
natural nor human. It leads to a pereeption of evenls as,Paragraph
isolated points rather than as parts of a process with dimen-,Paragraph
sions reaching out inlo history. The demand for a closer con-,Paragraph
tact with history is the natural oulcome of this condition.,Paragraph
"To have a closer contact with history: in other words, to carry",Paragraph
on our lives ina wider time-dimension. Present-day happen-,Paragraph
ings are simply the most conspicuous sections of a continuum;,Paragraph
they are like that small series of wave lengths between ullra-,Paragraph
violet and infra-red which translate themselves into colors,Paragraph
visible Lo the human cye.,Paragraph
The destructive confusion of events in the world at large today,Paragraph
is so great that the movement toward universality is clearly,Paragraph
visible in the field of science and scholarship. The desire for,Paragraph
similarity of methods in the separate sciences — including the,Paragraph
"social sciences — in philosophy, and in art, becomes more and",Paragraph
more definite. Already the demand for a universal outlook,Paragraph
upon the world has made itself felt in the college: intellectual,Paragraph
connections between the various faculties are consciously,Paragraph
being developed.,Paragraph
Everybody knows that we have far more means of bringing,Paragraph
change under farsighted control than any of the peoples of,Paragraph
earlier times. It is the new potentialities at our disposal which,Paragraph
are the key to a new and balanced life for enormous numbers,Paragraph
of men.,Paragraph
The desire for universality is an expression of the need we feel,Paragraph
to master and codrdinate these new potentialities.,Paragraph
It is always dangerous to assume that one’s own time has an,Paragraph
"exceptional importance. Even so, the years through which we",Paragraph
"are living seem to constitute a test period for mankind, a test",Paragraph
of man’s ability to organize his own life.,Paragraph
CONTEMPORARY HISTORY,Title
A wider survey of the whole domain of human activity is the,Paragraph
unmistakable need of the century. It is in this connection that,Paragraph
history can play an important role. One of the functions of,Paragraph
"history is to help us to live in a lafger sense, in wider dimen-",Paragraph
sions. This does not mean that we should copy the forms and,Paragraph
"attitudes of bygone periods, as the nineteenth century did, but",Paragraph
that we should conduct our lives against a much wider histori-,Paragraph
cal background.,Paragraph
"In the part of contemporary history we shall be concerned with,",Paragraph
the most important developments are the changes that have,Paragraph
come about in daily life.,Paragraph
The eternal complaint of the nineteenth century was that all,Paragraph
the dignity had gone out of ordinary life. And ordinary life,Paragraph
did lose its dignity from the moment it was put on an exclu-,Paragraph
ively day-to-day basis. People lost all sense of playing a part,Paragraph
st pistory: they were either indifferent to the period in which,Paragraph
jhey lived or they hated it. When they compared themselves,Paragraph
with the people of other periods their activities seemed unim-,Paragraph
"portal stand without significance, either good or bad.",Paragraph
The same feeling produced an extreme disregard for the,Paragraph
"immediate past — for contemporary history, Lhat is. Uncon-",Paragraph
"sciously, jn their matter-of-fact constructions, the men of the",Paragraph
ninetcenth century were producing the constituent facts from,Paragraph
which the future was to take its structure. They did not sce,Paragraph
"this. however; indeed, it is sometimes not recognized today,",Paragraph
The result was not merely the neglect of contemporary history,Paragraph
but something still worse —- the wanton destruction of the,Paragraph
objects and the records which were essential to its understand-,Paragraph
ing. Later periods will be forced to leave great gaps in their,Paragraph
“accounts of the modes of existence of the nineteenth and,Title
twenLieth centuries and the origin of these.,Paragraph
On every band we hear the complaint that essential documents,Paragraph
have been lost through sheer indifference to our own tradition.,Paragraph
"The town planner, for example, cannot find the detailed ac-",Paragraph
counts of the evolution of great cities which he needs in his,Paragraph
researches. The virtues and defects of the various types of,Paragraph
"cities — governmental centers, sea ports, factory towns — can-",Paragraph
"not be compared, simply because there has been no steady and",Paragraph
unified research. The fact that research has been so irregular,Paragraph
means that the historian anxious to complete a survey such as,Paragraph
this one must sometimes fall back on his own investigations.,Paragraph
"The danger of overemphasis is, of course, always present.",Paragraph
The history of nineleenth-century industry has suffered,Paragraph
heavily from our indifference to our own tradition and is full,Paragraph
"of gaps. The extremely interesting development of tools, for",Paragraph
"example, can be seen only from the few surviving ninetcenth-",Paragraph
century hardware calalogues. For the most part these cata-,Paragraph
"logues of the thirties, fifties, and seventies have been lost.",Paragraph
There are only a few places where these irreplaceable docu-,Paragraph
ments have been preserved; the library of the Victoria and,Paragraph
Albert Museum in London is one of them.,Paragraph
The period in America when complicated trades abandoned,Paragraph
handwork and changed over to machine production is a unique,Paragraph
"one, without counterpart elsewhere in the world. I myself",Paragraph
visited a great factory outside Boston where clocks and watches,Paragraph
were first assembled from standardized parts shortly after,Paragraph
1850. (This principle later found its most extensive use in the,Paragraph
manufacture of automobiles.) The early products of this fac-,Paragraph
tory were mentioned by some European observers of the,Paragraph
seventies. I wanted to see examples of them and to study the,Paragraph
early catalogues of the company. There were no old cata-,Paragraph
"logues at all— the company destroyed them, on principle,",Paragraph
when they were three years old — and the only old watches,Paragraph
"were those which had come in for repairs. ‘There was, on the",Paragraph
"other hand, a Jarge, valuable, but historically unimportant",Paragraph
collection of European watches.,Paragraph
"The oldest mail-order house in the country, with an annual",Paragraph
"business of $500,000,000, is located in Chicago. [ went there",Paragraph
to see what changes had been made in articles of daily life,Paragraph
since Civil War times. The company possessed some material —,Paragraph
"incomplete, however — and very properly kept it in a safe.",Paragraph
The Otis Elevator Company in New York had comparatively,Paragraph
full records of their products — and the literature dealing with,Paragraph
elevators is none too precise — but even here material dealing,Paragraph
with the earliest beginnings had not been preserved.,Paragraph
"In the 1880’s, when European architecture seemed given over",Paragraph
"to a future of muddle, indecision, and despair, a new architec-",Paragraph
ture was growing up on the American prairies. From 1880 to,Paragraph
the time of the Columbian Exposition of 1893 the “ Loop ”,Title
"area in Chicago (its business quarter, that is) was the center",Paragraph
of architectural development uot merely for the United States,Title
but for the whole world.,Paragraph
It may be that after a few decades the skyscraper automati-,Paragraph
cally becomes a sort of blighted area and must be torn down.,Paragraph
It may be that the Marshall Field wholesale store -— one of,Paragraph
Chicago’s finest buildings and Henry Hobson Richardson’s,Title
best work — had to be destroyed to create a parking lot.,Paragraph
It may be that there was no other direction for a highway,Paragraph
except one that will eventually lead over the site of the Adler,Paragraph
"and Sullivan Auditorium, with ils unique theater interior.",Paragraph
It may be that John Root’s Monadnock Block — the most,Paragraph
celebrated of the early skyscrapers — cannot be protected,Paragraph

"Tt does concern us, however, that there is no particular feeling",Paragraph
for what is being destroyed. Chicago seems quite unaware of,Paragraph
the signilicance of the Chicago school. i went searching in,Paragraph
Chicugo for pictures of the interiors of ils great hotels and,Caption
"apartient houses in the cighties, buildings which in their",Paragraph

have heen endeavoring to preserve material of this sort. It is,Paragraph
"doubtful, however, whether their endeavors are enough Lo stop",Paragraph
the losses that constantly occur.,Paragraph
These remarks have been made simply to indicate the wide-,Paragraph
"spreacl indifference to the immediate past, to the century out",Paragraph
of which our period grows and derives the basic elements for,Paragraph
its own life.,Paragraph
THE IDENTITY OF METHODS,Title
Our period is a period of transition. The tangle of different,Paragraph
"tendencies continuing from the past or pointing to the future,",Paragraph
tendencies which mix confusedly and interpenetrate al every,Paragraph
"point, makes our period seem to lack any definite line of",Paragraph
advance. To some it presents the appearance of a chaos of,Paragraph
contradictory impulses. An‘ eminent French sociologist wrote,Paragraph
"recently that ‘ we see around us nothing save tumult, aimless",Paragraph
"agitation, hesitant opinions, vacillating thoughts.”",Paragraph
"We must not forget, however, that this particular transition",Paragraph
period has lasted fora whole century. It has made itself felt,Paragraph
in cach country at the same rate and in the same proportion,Paragraph
as the disorder which the process of industrialization produced,Paragraph
every where.,Paragraph
"Ever since the opening of this transitional period, our mental",Paragraph
life hag been without equilibrium. Our inner being has under-,Paragraph
gone division. This state of the contemporary spiril has been,Paragraph
"recognized often enough, bul its consequences have not been",Paragraph
drawn.,Paragraph
if chaos had for its only definition the coexistence of tendencies,Paragraph
"contradictory to one another, our period would certainly de-",Paragraph
serve to be called chaotic. But we believe that these contra-,Paragraph
dictions are merely surface ones.,Paragraph
There is this remarkable circumstance which we can observe,Paragraph
today: sciences which differ widely in their objects are begin-,Paragraph
ning to resemble each other in their methods. A continued and,Paragraph
extensive search for exact knowledge is at the bottom of this,Paragraph
growing resemblance. It is being recognized in all quarters,Paragraph
that the ideas which we have Laken over from the past are both,Paragraph
too complex and too crude.,Paragraph
A transition period may affect two observers in verv different,Paragraph
ways. One may see only the chaos of contradictory traits and,Paragraph
mutually destructive principles: the other may see beneath all,Title
this confusion those elements which are working together to,Paragraph
open the way for new solutions. It is not a simple thing to,Paragraph
"decide between two such judgments, to determine which has",Paragraph
emphasized the essential marks of the time. We need some,Paragraph
"objective guide to what is going on in the depths of the period,",Paragraph
some sign by which we can determine whether or nol its dis-,Paragraph
persed energies are being brought into united action. A com-,Paragraph
"parison of the methods which govern its major activities, its",Paragraph
"thinking and feeling, may afford us such an objective",Paragraph
crilerion.,Paragraph
"John Dewey, in his Ari as Experience, points out that “com-",Paragraph
partmentalization of occupations and interests brings about,Paragraph
separation of that mode of activity commonly called * practise *,Paragraph
"from insight, of imagination from executive doing, of significant",Paragraph
"purpose from work, of emotion from thought and doing.”",Paragraph
Each of these activities is Lhen assigned “its own place in,Paragraph
which it must abide. Those who wrile the anatomy of experi-,Paragraph
ence then suppose that these divisions inhere in the very,Paragraph
conslitution of human nature.”,Paragraph
It is just such an evolution which lies behind the doubt as Lo,Paragraph
whether science and art have anything in common. The ques-,Paragraph
Uon would not be raised except in a period where thinking and,Paragraph
fecling proceed on different levels in opposition to each other.,Paragraph
"In such a period, people no longer expect a scientific discovery",Paragraph
to have any repercussions in the realm of feeling. It seems,Paragraph
unnatural for a theory in mathematical physics to meet with,Paragraph
all equivalent in the arts. Bul thts is to forget that the two,Paragraph
"are formulated by men living in the same period, exposed lo",Paragraph
"the same general influences, and moved by similar impulses.",Paragraph
Thought and feeling could be entirely separated only by cut-,Paragraph
ting men in bwo.,Paragraph
We have behind us a period in which thinking and feeling,Paragraph
were separated. This schism produced individuals whose inner,Paragraph
"development was uneven, who lacked inner equilibrium: split",Paragraph
personalities. The split personality as a psychopathic case,Title
does not concern us here; we are speaking of the inner dis-,Paragraph
harmony which is found in the structure of the normal person-,Paragraph
ality of this period.,Paragraph
What are the effects of this inner division? Only very rarely,Paragraph
do we encounter a master in one field who is capable of recog-,Paragraph
nizing workers of the same stature and tendency in another.,Paragraph
Contemporary artists and scientists have lost contact with,Paragraph
each other; they speak the language of their Lime in their own,Paragraph
"work, but they cannot even understand it as it is expressed",Paragraph
in work of a different character. The great physicist may,Paragraph
lack all understanding of a painting which presents the,Paragraph
artislic equivalent of his own ideas. A great painter. may fail,Paragraph
entirely to grasp architecture which has developed out of his,Paragraph
own principles. Men who produce poetry which is purely an,Paragraph
expression of this time are indifferent to the music which is,Paragraph
contemporary in the same sense and to the same degree. This,Paragraph
"is our inheritance from the nineteenth century, during which",Paragraph
the dilferent departments of human activity steadily lost touch,Paragraph
with one another. The principles of laissez-faire and laissez-,Paragraph
aller were extended to the life of the spirit.,Paragraph
Throughout the nineteenth century the natural sciences went,Paragraph
"splendidly ahead, impelled by the great tradition which the",Paragraph
"previous two hundred years had established, and sustained",Paragraph
by problems which had a direction and momentum of their,Paragraph
own. The real spirit of the age came out in these researches -,Paragraph
"in the realm of thinking, thal is. But these achievements",Paragraph
al,Title
ra,Title
rt,Title
ry,Title
n-,Title
"were regarded as emotionally neutral, as having no relation",Paragraph
to the realm of feeling. Feeling could not keep up with the,Paragraph
swift advances made in science and the techniques. The cen-,Paragraph
tury’s genuine strength and special accomplishments remained,Paragraph
largely irrelevant to man’s inner life.,Paragraph
This orientation of the vital energies of the period is reflected,Paragraph
in the make-up of the man of today. Scarcely anyone can,Paragraph
escape the unbalanced development which it encourages.,Paragraph
"The split personality, the unevenly adjusted man, is sympto-",Paragraph
matic of our period.,Paragraph
But behind these disinlegraling forces in our period tendencies,Paragraph
leading toward unity can be observed. From the first decade,Paragraph
"of this century on, we encounter curious parallelisms of method",Paragraph
"in the separate realms of thought and feeling, science and art.",Paragraph
Problems whose roots lie entirely in our time are being treated,Paragraph
"in similar ways, even when their subject matter is very dif-",Paragraph
ferent and their solutions are arrived al independently.,Paragraph
In 1908 the great mathematician Hermann Minkowski first,Paragraph
"conceived a world in four dimensions, with space and time",Paragraph
coming together to form an indivisible continuum. His Space,Paragraph
"and Time of that year begins with the celebrated statement,",Paragraph
"“ Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to",Paragraph
"fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the",Paragraph
two will preserve an independent reality.” It was just at this,Paragraph
time thal in France and in Italy cubist and futurist painters,Paragraph
developed the artistic equivalent of space-time in their search,Paragraph
for means of expressing purely contemporaneous feelings.,Paragraph
Some less spectacular duplications of methods in the fields of,Paragraph
thought and feeling also date from this period. Thus new basic,Paragraph
elements designed to permit the solving of problems that had,Paragraph
just been recognized were introduced in construction and paint-,Paragraph
ing around 1908. The basic identity of these elements will be,Paragraph
"discussed in Part VI, ‘* Space-Time in Art, Architecture, and",Paragraph
Construction.”,Paragraph
Only a small part of the full range of the sciences can be,Paragraph
mastered by a single man. Their specialized inquiries and,Paragraph
complicated techniques of research make any far-reaching,Paragraph
"competency impossible. Bul, even apart from this impossibil-",Paragraph
"ity, we Move ina different direclion today in seeking to arrive",Paragraph
ata general outlook. It is no longer specific scientific facts and,Paragraph
"achievements that call for popularization, as was the case in",Paragraph
the nineteenth century. Then even the greatest scientists felt,Paragraph
sp necessary to acquaint the public with what was being done,Paragraph
in their fields. In the thirties of the nineteenth century Michael,Paragraph
Faraday in England and Francois Arago in France were,Paragraph
greatly concerned with increasing popular knowledge of the,Paragraph
sciences. Faraday’s chair during his lifetime was associated,Paragraph
"with the Royal Institution in London, a society founded in",Paragraph
1799 for “the promotion and the diffusion and extension of,Paragraph
useful knowledge.” To the present day the weekly evening,Paragraph
meetings of this rather exclusive society are attended by mem-,Paragraph
bers only (white ties obligatory) in Faraday’s old lecture thea-,Paragraph
"ter in Albemarle Street, London. Faraday himself introduced",Paragraph
in 1826 a special course for juvenile auditors which until the,Paragraph
present day has been delivered every year at Christmas time.,Paragraph
"Francois Arago, the well-known physicist who discovered",Paragraph
fundamental laws of electricity and who was a pioneer in the,Paragraph
"undulatory theory of light, was most celebrated for his gift for",Paragraph
trealing difficult subjects — such as astronomy — in a popular,Paragraph
"manner. In his courses at the observatory in Paris, he spoke",Paragraph
to an audience unacquainted with mathematics. The larger,Paragraph
part of the fourteen volumes embracing his work is devoted to,Paragraph
such popularizing.,Paragraph
"University extension in the modern sense, introduced in the",Paragraph
"seventies of the nineteenth century at Oxford and Cambridge,",Paragraph
grew out of these efforts to popularize scientific results.,Paragraph
Today a leading scientist — a “Secrétaire perpétuel de I’ Acad-,Paragraph
"émie.” such as Arago was, for example — would not make",Paragraph
the popularization of scientific research one of his chief con-,Paragraph
cerns. Other problems are more important today. The,Paragraph
methods of science are of more concern to us now than any,Paragraph
of their separate results.,Paragraph
The problem of today is not lo popularize science. What our,Paragraph
period needs much more than this is to gain an understanding,Paragraph
and a general view of the dominant methods in different fields,Paragraph
"of human activity, recognizing their differences and their",Paragraph
likencsses.,Paragraph
The scientific education of our day is designed to produce,Paragraph
"extreme specialists. That there is, on the other hand, an urge",Paragraph
toward interrelation cannot be denied. Yet there is no insti-,Paragraph
lution to help us understand the interrelations that exist,Paragraph
between the different sciences or between the sciences and the,Paragraph
realm of feeling.,Paragraph
A general contemporary understanding of scientific method is,Paragraph
more important for our culture as a whole than widespread,Paragraph
knowledge of scientific facts. It is through their increasing,Paragraph
similarity of method thal the various activilics of our times are,Paragraph
drawing Logether to consLitute one culture. Some grasp ol the,Paragraph
way in which different sciences resemble each other in the,Paragraph
employment of similar methods is needed for insight into,Paragraph
contemporary life as a whole.,Paragraph
But science is not an activity which goes on indepeudently,Paragraph
of all others. Lach period lives in a realm of feeling as well as,Paragraph
"in a realm of thought, and changes in cach realm affect the",Paragraph
changes in the other. Each period finds outlets for its emotions,Paragraph
through different means of expression. Emotions and ex-,Paragraph
pressive means vary concomitantly wilh the concepts that,Paragraph
dominate the epoch. Thus in the Renaissance the dommant,Paragraph
"space conceptions found their proper frame in perspective,",Paragraph
while in our period the conception of space-time leads the,Paragraph
artist Lo adopt very different means.,Paragraph
Economics and politics have been taken as points of departure,Paragraph
for explanations of the structure of a period in all its aspects.,Paragraph
"The influence of feeling upon realily, its constant permeation of",Paragraph
"all human activities, has been largely disregarded or felt to be",Paragraph
of negligible importance. In tracing the interrelaled develop-,Paragraph
"ments in art, architecture, and construction through the period",Paragraph
"we have selected, it is precisely the influence of fecling which",Paragraph
we shall emphasize.,Paragraph
Our cullure has a slructure different in many of its aspects,Paragraph
from the cultures that grew up in pre-industrial periods. In,Paragraph
"the baroque period, for example, Leibnil arrived at the dis-",Paragraph
covery of the calculus from a starting point in philosophy. ITe,Paragraph
moved from a general. - one might say a cosmological — out-,Paragraph
look to this particular discovery.,Paragraph
"With our inheritance from preceding generations, we are",Paragraph
obliged lo adopt a different starting point and follow another,Paragraph
roule. We must take our departure from a large number of,Paragraph
specialized disciplines and go on from there Loward a coherent,Paragraph
eeneral outlook on our world. It is beside the point whether or,Paragraph
"pot this route is more difficult, more precarious, and less certain",Paragraph
to end te success than the path that lay open to Leibnitz. It is,Paragraph
"the roule that present realities force us to bake. Unity, for us,",Paragraph
will have lo come about through the unintended parallelisims,Paragraph
inamethod that are springing up im the specialized sciences and,Paragraph
the equally specialized arts. These are the indications that,Paragraph
we are nearing a spontancously established harmony of emo-,Paragraph
tional and intellectual activities.,Paragraph
In both conlemporary science and contemporary art it is,Paragraph
possible Lo detect elements of the general pattern which our,Paragraph
culture will embody. The situation is a curious one: our cullure,Paragraph
is like an orchestra where the instruments lic ready tuned but,Paragraph
where every musician is cut off from his fellows by a sound-,Paragraph
"proof wall, It is impossible to foretell the events that will have",Paragraph
"to come before these barriers are broken down, The only serv-",Paragraph
"ice the historian can perform is to point out this situation, Lo",Paragraph
bring it into consciousness.,Paragraph
The degree to which its methods of thinking and of feeling,Paragraph
coincide determines the equilibrium of an epoch. When these,Paragraph
methods move apart from each other there is no possibility of,Paragraph
a culture and a tradition. These are not deliberations remote,Paragraph
from our subject: we shall soon see that it was just this un-,Paragraph
fortunate schism between its thought and fecling which struck,Paragraph
down the magnificent power of the nineteenth century. Out,Paragraph
of such a schism come split personalities and split civilizations.,Paragraph
TRANSITORY AND CONSTITUENT FACTS,Title
It is not the historian’s task to tell the public what pleases or,Paragraph
displeases him personally. That is a private affair which loses,Paragraph
all its interest in the telling. The historian is not required to,Paragraph
correct an epoch in the light of his own opinions. Ile has to,Paragraph
"explain it, to show why history took a certain direction. The",Paragraph
"people who lived in a period can best tell us, out of their own",Paragraph
"inner feelings, whelher its development was happy or unhappy.",Paragraph
The voices which come to us out of the fortunes or misfortunes,Paragraph
of an age furnish indispensable testimony. No man of a later,Paragraph
"time, however great the impartiality which distance from the",Paragraph
"events has brought, can approach Lhe direct and certain feeling",Paragraph
for a period which belonged Lo Lhose in the midst of the strug-,Paragraph
gle — a struggle which involved their destiny. Words uttered,Paragraph
"out of the needs of the time are the historian’s real guides, and",Paragraph
itis from them that he must draw his explanation of the period.,Paragraph
The true critique of an age can only be Laken from the testi-,Paragraph
mony of that age.,Paragraph
"Entirely objective judgment with no trace of personal bias is,",Paragraph
"on the face of things, quite impossible. Nevertheless, the in-",Paragraph
filtration of the personal must be reduced to a minimum. The,Paragraph
"historian is not solely a calaloguer of facts; it is his right, and",Paragraph
"indeed his duty, to pass judgment. His judgments must, how-",Paragraph
"ever, spring directly from his facts.",Paragraph
The historian cannot speak with the direct authority of a con-,Paragraph
"temporary, but he has a breadth of outlook which the con-",Paragraph
temporary inevitably lacks. He sees facts which were hidden,Paragraph
from the people of the time he studies. He can tell more or Jess,Paragraph
short-lived novelties from genuinely new trends. The facts of,Paragraph
"history fall into one or the other of these classes, and it is the",Paragraph
business of the historian to distinguish accurately between,Paragraph
them.,Paragraph
"Constituent facts are those tendencies which, when they are",Paragraph
"suppressed, inevitably reappear. Their recurrence makes us",Paragraph
"aware Lhat these are clements which, all together, are produc-",Paragraph
"ing a new tradition. Constituent facts in architecture, for",Paragraph
"example, are the undulation of the wall, the juxtaposition of",Paragraph
"nature and the human dwelling, the open ground-plan. Con-",Paragraph
stituent facts in the nineteenth century are the new potentiali-,Paragraph
"ties in construction, the use of mass production in industry,",Paragraph
the changed organization of society.,Paragraph
Facts of the other sort — equally the work of the forces moving,Paragraph
in a period — lack the stuff of permanence and fail to attach,Paragraph
themselves to a new tradition. At first appearance they may,Paragraph
"have all the éclat and brilliance of a firework display, but they",Paragraph
have no greater durability. Sometimes they are interlaced,Paragraph
with every refinement of fashion — the furniture of the Second,Paragraph
Empire in France is an instance. These we shall call transitory,Paragraph
facts.,Paragraph
Transitory facts in their dash and glitter often succeed in tak-,Paragraph
"ing over the center of the stage, This was the case with the",Paragraph
experiments in historical styles that went on — with infinite,Paragraph
changes of direction — throughout the whole nineteenth cen-,Paragraph
tury. The entire output of official painting was a Lransitory,Paragraph
"fact of that period, almost wholly without significance to the",Paragraph
present day.,Paragraph
A period may be dominated by transitory or by constiluent,Paragraph
"facts; both alternatives are open. There is, however, no doubt",Paragraph
which of these two classes of trends is the more likely to pro-,Paragraph
duce a solution of the real problems of the age.,Paragraph
It is in this field that the historian is not only free to use his,Paragraph
judgment but obliged to. To make the not always obvious,Paragraph
distinction between transitory and constituent facts is his own,Paragraph
personal responsibility.,Paragraph
ARCHITECTURE AS AN ORGANISM,Title
We are looking for the reflection in architecture of the progress,Paragraph
our own period has made toward consciousness of itself — of,Paragraph
"ils special limitations and potentialities, needs, and aims.",Paragraph
Archilecture can give us an insight into this process just be-,Paragraph
cause it is so bound up with the life of a period as a whole.,Paragraph
"Everything in it, from ils fondness for certain shapes to the",Paragraph
approaches to specific building problems which it finds most,Paragraph
"natural, reflects the conditions of the age from which it springs.",Paragraph
"It is the product of all sorts of factors -— social, economic,",Paragraph
"scientific, technical, ethnological.",Paragraph
"However much a period may try to disguise itself, its real",Paragraph
"nature will still show through in its architecture, whether this",Paragraph
uses original forms of expression or attempts to copy bygone,Paragraph
"epochs, We recognize the character of the age as casily as we",Paragraph
identify a friend’s handwriting beneath alltempted disguises.,Paragraph
It is as an unmistakable index to what was really going on in,Paragraph
a period that architecture is indispensable when we are seek-,Paragraph
ing to evaluate that period.,Paragraph
"In the great architectural masterpicces, as im every great work",Paragraph
"of art, the human shortcomings which every period exhibits so",Paragraph
liberally fall away. This is why these works are true monu-,Paragraph
ments of their epochs; with the overlay of recurrent human,Paragraph
"weaknesses removed, the central drives of the time of their",Paragraph
creation show plainly.,Paragraph
"But if architecture is the result of so many condilions, is it",Paragraph
"either proper or possible to examine it out of ils context, as a",Paragraph
finite organism in ils own right?,Paragraph
An architecture may be called into being by all sorts of external,Paragraph
"conditions, but once it appears it conslitutes an organism in",Paragraph
"itself, with ils own characler and its own continuing life. Its",Paragraph
value cannot be stated in the sociological or economic Lerms,Paragraph
"by which we explain ils origin, and its influence may continue",Paragraph
after its original environment has altered or disappeared.,Paragraph
"Architecture can teach out beyond the period of its birth,",Paragraph
"beyond the social class that called it into being, beyond the",Paragraph
style Lo which it belongs.,Paragraph
When a Roman baroque archilect of the late seventeenth cen-,Paragraph
tury invents the undulating church fagade we can account for,Paragraph
the invention in various ways. This was the lime of the,Paragraph
Counter Reformation; means were demanded of focusing all,Paragraph
the attention of the people upon the Church. Or we might,Paragraph
invoke economic factors and attribute the undulation of the,Paragraph
wall to the constricted streets of Rome and the economy of,Paragraph
front which they made necessary.,Paragraph
"3oth factors were no doubt involved. The undulating wall,",Paragraph

The chateau of Versailles admits of a purely sociological ex-,Paragraph

"is certainly informative and interesting They overlook, how-",Paragraph
"ever. the conslituent facts, the lasting lendencies, which made",Paragraph
their first appearance at Versailles.,Paragraph
In a modern work of art it is the relationships between the,Paragraph
elements in the composition that are decisive in determining,Paragraph
its character. Modern science likewise seeks to fit the objects,Paragraph
of its study into a relational scheme. [t is nol the qualities,Paragraph
which make these objects unique among others that are of in-,Paragraph
terest but rather the ways in which they function in their,Paragraph
enviroument. History is always the last of the sciences to,Paragraph
develop a method in harmony with its own period. Neverthe-,Paragraph
less. a modern history seems to be taking form which is follow-,Paragraph
ing the direction art and science have already adopted. The,Paragraph
historian nowadays seems more concerned with the links be-,Paragraph
"tween periods, the lines of foree which persist and develop",Paragraph
"through several periods, Lhan with those special aspects which",Paragraph
separate each period from every other.,Paragraph
"In the arts, periods are differentiated by the “ styles * which",Paragraph
became fixed and definite in cach stage of development. And,Paragraph
ihe study of the history of styles was the special work of nine-,Paragraph
"teenth-century historiaus, a work most skillfully carried",Paragraph
through. But it may be that the links and associations be-,Paragraph
iween periods — the constiluent facts — are more important,Paragraph
to us than self-enclosed entities such as styles.,Paragraph
"When we consider the chateau of Versailles, for example, what",Paragraph
"we find most interesting in it is that here, for the first time. a",Paragraph
great. dwelling complex (equal to a small lown in size) was,Paragraph
placed in direct contact with nature. This had never been,Paragraph
done before on such a large scale. The juxtaposition of resi-,Paragraph
denees with nature was one of the constituent facts that grew,Paragraph
"out of the period of Louis XLV, A century later, this pattern",Paragraph
for living was adopted in town planning for a completely dif-,Paragraph
ferent social elass in another country.,Paragraph
The associations and interrelatious of events are what matter,Paragraph
Most tous. We know thal there are no isolated or spontaneous,Paragraph
"happenings, and we look always for the connections between",Paragraph
them.,Paragraph
"Even though architecture is inseparable from life as a whole,",Paragraph
it is still possible to write a history of architecture in which it,Paragraph
is regarded as an independent organism. The case is no dif-,Paragraph
ferent from that of mathematics or physical science. The,Paragraph
evolution of mathematical knowledge is discussed ordinarily,Paragraph
without reference to the social background against which it,Paragraph
took place — this in spite of the fact that there is a baroque,Paragraph
"mathematics, as well as a baroque physics. The integral cal-",Paragraph
culus is a perfectly consistent outgrowth of the baroque univer-,Paragraph
salistic point of view. It is no coincidence that in this period,Paragraph
"lwo invesLigators bit upon it simullaneously, though the most",Paragraph
promising of previous efforts in this direction invariably,Paragraph
stopped short of a solution. And the two discoverers developed,Paragraph
distinctively baroque schemes in other fields — Newton,Paragraph
"in his universally active laws of gravilation, Leibnitz in the",Paragraph
monad’s internal relationships to the entire universe. But,Paragraph
it would not occur to anyone to stress the baroque ori-,Paragraph
gin of the integral calculus. It is independently a part of,Paragraph
"the whole body of mathematical knowledge, and its most",Paragraph
significant aspect is the role it played in the evolution of,Paragraph
mathematics.,Paragraph
The human factor obviously plays a much larger part in,Paragraph
architecture than it does in science; the two are uot entirely,Paragraph
"comparable. Nevertheless there is a history of archilecture,",Paragraph
and there are developments which are influenced by architec-,Paragraph
tural considerations alone and can be evaluated solely in,Paragraph
architectural terms. This history from baroque to ninetcenth-,Paragraph
century times has its slormy moments and ils full share of,Paragraph
dramatic episodes.,Paragraph
If it is the general line of evolution which interests us — the,Paragraph
"development which runs through different periods, social",Paragraph
"orders, and races — then the formal and stylistic variations",Paragraph
which mark Lhe separate slages will lose some of their impor-,Paragraph
tance. Our allention will shill to the history of architecture,Paragraph
as an enterprise with a continuous and independent growth of,Paragraph
"its own, apart from questions of economics, class interests,",Paragraph
"race, or other issues.",Paragraph
"Architecture is not exclusively an affair of styles and forms,",Paragraph
por ig it completely determined by sociological or economic,Paragraph
"conditions. It has a life of its own, grows or dwindles, finds new",Paragraph
potentialities and forgets them again. ‘The view of architecture,Paragraph
as a growing organism is particularly useful in the study of,Paragraph
"American architecture. In this field concentration on styles,",Paragraph
on particular outlels or manifestations of the life of architec-,Paragraph
ture. leads us nowhere. The fundamental line of development,Paragraph
"that runs through the different periods, ignoring stylistic",Paragraph
fashions. is the only way of escape from complete confusion.,Paragraph
"Styles and Lheir variations form a baffling maze, with all its",Paragraph
alleys stopped.,Paragraph
"From the beginning, styles in America were imported. They",Paragraph
were nol developed in the country but came here full-grown.,Paragraph
"None of them in the nincleenth century — romantic, Victorian,",Paragraph
"Tudor, Gothic revival—is representative of the American spirit,",Paragraph
whose adventures and changes went on outside their narrow,Paragraph
"limits. The manor houses of the romautics, the Victorian villas,",Paragraph
even Lhe doorways and columns of colonial dwellings — charm-,Paragraph

sources elsewhere.,Paragraph
PROCEDURE,Title
We intend to see how our period has come to consciousness of,Paragraph
"itself in one field, architeclLure. To do this we must understand",Paragraph
"the architectural inheritance of our period, the knowledge",Paragraph
which had been continuously evolved in the preceding periods.,Paragraph
‘These periods do not have to be examined in their entirety.,Paragraph
Tt will be enough to see how a new space conception appears,Paragraph
in Lie early Renaissance with the revival of the direct and dis-,Paragraph
interested study of nature. Two and a half centuries after-,Paragraph
"ward, in late baroque times, this conception is given a new",Paragraph
boldness and flexibility.,Paragraph
Qur next concern will be the ways in which outer space was,Paragraph
"organized, first in Lhe South and then (in the seventeenth cen-",Paragraph
tury) in northern countries -— France and England. These,Paragraph
"developments, employing the architectural experience which",Paragraph
"had accumulated since the Renaissance, raised town planning",Paragraph
and the organization of space on a large scale to new heights.,Paragraph
Throughout the eighteenth century this tradition in urbanism,Paragraph
spread and developed. All over Europe we encounter examples,Paragraph
of ils ability to bring separate and often already existent ele-,Paragraph
"ments inlo splendid, coherent, and surprising unity. At that",Paragraph
"time, just before industrialization set in, town planning was",Paragraph
advancing toward solutions which artists of our day are once,Paragraph
more atlempting — with the changed approach which new,Paragraph
needs and new knowledge diclate.,Paragraph
The fact. Lhat we are considering architecture as an organism,Paragraph
makes it natural for us to examine both ils beginning and its,Paragraph
"end, construction and town planning. And it will be easier",Paragraph
"for us to deal with our subject if we can, so Lo speak, use lwo",Paragraph
"handles to pick it up by. At all events, iL will be unecessary",Paragraph
for us Lo give more attention Lo construction and town planning,Paragraph
than would be the case if we were writing a history of styles.,Paragraph
It would be a mistake to look at modern engineering construc-,Paragraph
lions only through the eyes of the engincer or to sce in them,Paragraph
only efficient adjustments Lo useful purposes. Their technical,Paragraph
aspects will not concern us so much as the general methods,Paragraph
that appear in them and their content of fecling — prophetic,Paragraph
of archilectonic expressions which come later.,Paragraph
"In the nineteenth century, as in all periods when methods of",Paragraph
"production are changing, construction was particularly im-",Paragraph
portaul for the architectural knowledge which lay hidden in,Paragraph
it. The new potentialities of the period are shown much more,Paragraph
clearly in its engineering constructions than in its strictly,Paragraph
architectural works. For a hundred years architecture lay,Paragraph
"smothered in a dead, eclectic atmosphere in spite of its con-",Paragraph
"tinual attempts al escape. All that while, construction played",Paragraph
"the part of archileclure’s subconsciousness, contained things",Paragraph
which it prophesied and half revealed long before they could,Paragraph
become realities. ‘The constituent facts in the nineteenth,Paragraph
century can often be found in construction when the ruling,Paragraph
architecture gives no clue to them. It is construction and not,Paragraph
architecture which offers the best guideposts through the,Paragraph
century.,Paragraph
Architecture has caught up with construction very gradually.,Paragraph
Our own period has been slowly finding the ability lo express,Paragraph
in architecture what construction bas for a long while been,Paragraph
mutely signifying in its abstract language. This process moved,Paragraph
so slowly that around 1900 on the Continent most of the,Paragraph
buildings from which the modern development stems lacked,Paragraph
"all connection with human residence. They were factories,",Paragraph
"stock exchanges, warehouses, and the like. The building",Paragraph
schemes which represent the first solutions in the manner of,Paragraph
"the present day were set forward in a neutral atmosphere, one",Paragraph
far removed from the range of intimate personal feelings.,Paragraph
Architects today are perfectly aware thal. the future of archi-,Paragraph
tecture is inseparably bound up with town planning. A single,Paragraph
beautiful house or a single fine residential development ac-,Paragraph
complishes very little. Kyerything depends on the unified,Paragraph
"organization of life. The interrelations between house, town,",Caption
"and conntry, or residence, labor. and leisure, can no longer be",Paragraph
left to chance. Conscious planning is demanded.,Paragraph
In a single building something extraordinary may be sought,Paragraph
"after and achieved. The whole body of a cily, however, shows",Paragraph
heyond dispute the slate of the architectural knowledge of a,Paragraph
period. Tt shows the extent lo which the period was capable of,Paragraph
organizing its own life.,Paragraph
Iu Europe during the nineties a demand for morality in archi-,Paragraph
teclure arose in many different countries. As van de Velde,Paragraph
"puls i, people saw that the reigning architecture was a“ lie,”",Paragraph
"all posturing and no truth, and that greater purity of expression",Paragraph
"was needed. This means that, besides the urge to find new ways",Paragraph
"of expression suitable to the limes, there was the more general",Paragraph
urge to bring arlislic expression into harmony with the new po-,Paragraph
tentiiities born of the age. Or we might say that the desire grew,Paragraph
up to reconcile methods of feeling with methods of thinking.,Paragraph
We shall observe the development which the demand for,Paragraph
morality set under way through some close-ups of a few of its,Paragraph
critical stages. The whole process is bound up with the pro-,Paragraph
gressive awakening to the potentialities inherent in modern,Title
construction: with Lhe iron-skeleton building in Belgium of the,Paragraph
"nineties, for example, and with the ferroconcrete skeleton in",Paragraph
France around 1900.,Paragraph
Le,Title
Architecture gradually threw off its confusion and indecision,Paragraph
in Lhe face of the new building tasks of the century. I saw its,Paragraph
way clearly first as regards those buildings which stood half-,Paragraph
way between “neutral” industrial constructions and the,Paragraph
"hunian residence, with its inescapable associations of feeling.",Paragraph
Thus the gap between bare construction and architeclure in,Paragraph
the grand manner is first bridged in the Chicago business,Paragraph
buildings of the 1880's. The architecture of the Chicago school,Caption
shows with astonishing clarity the urge to use constructional,Paragraph
discoveries expressively that is a keynote in this period.,Paragraph
It was the Chicago atmosphere that made it possible for a,Paragraph
phenomenon like Frank Lloyd Wright to appear during the,Paragraph
"nineties. During his stay in Chicago, Wright reached solu-",Paragraph
tions of the dwelling problem which furnished the basis for,Paragraph
further developments in Europe at the hands of the post-war,Paragraph
generation. These men resumed the problem at the point,Paragraph
where Wright had left off.,Paragraph
Up to 1910 architects tried many ways of arriving at a new,Paragraph
feeling for space — the basis and the strongest impulse for,Title
original architectonic creation. They could never quile break,Paragraph
through. Only the narrow gates of *“ fitness for purpose ” and,Paragraph
“ rejection of historical styles ’’ were open to such endeavors.,Paragraph
Around 1910 an event of decisive importance occurred: the,Paragraph
discovery of a new space conception in the arts. Working in,Paragraph
"their studios as though in laboratories, painters and sculptors",Paragraph
"investigated the ways in which space, volumes, and materials",Paragraph
existed for feeling.,Paragraph
The speculations of the mathematical physicists seem very far,Paragraph
"removed from realily and from practical affairs, but lhey have",Paragraph
led to profound alterations in the human environment. In the,Paragraph
same way the experiments of Lhe cubists seemed to have little,Paragraph
significance for any kind of practice — even for architecture.,Paragraph
"Actually, however, it was just such work which gave the",Paragraph
architects the hinls they needed to master realily in their,Paragraph
particular sphere. These discoveries offered architecture the,Paragraph
objective means of organizing space in ways that gave form,Paragraph
to contemporary feelings.,Paragraph
Our interest is confined to the reflection in architecture of,Paragraph
the process by which the period has moved toward self-,Paragraph
consciousness. We shall follow the development only to that,Paragraph
int when architecture achieves a clear mastery of means of,Paragraph
expression natural to our time. ‘This point is reached about,Paragraph
1926 oF 1927.,Paragraph
In the field of town planning we shall consider only those,Paragraph
places » here the furthest advance was made at a given period.,Paragraph
The Landon squares (1800-50) illustrate Lhe continuation into,Paragraph
the nineteenth century of late baroque urban forms. The rue,Paragraph
"corridor, aD outstanding fact of nineteenth-century urbanism,",Paragraph

mation of Paris (1850-70). The evolution to the city of today,Paragraph
js summarized in the slep-by-slep development of Amsterdam,Paragraph
that has continued from 1900 until the present time.,Paragraph
In town planning we cannot ignore the developments that are,Paragraph
"still in progress. Town planning, always Lhe last branch of",Paragraph
"architecture to reach full growth, has begun to arrive at new",Paragraph
conceplions only quite recently — since about 1925. We shall,Paragraph
try lo assemble the fragmentary and dispersed work that has,Paragraph
been done and derive from it some insight into the tendencies,Paragraph
which are still evolving.,Paragraph
"The history of architecture could be treated by sketching, in",Paragraph
"yery broad strokes, all the great varicly of movements and",Paragraph
the masses of facts connected with them. But in attempting lo,Paragraph

cross sections of decisive stages in the history of archilecture.,Paragraph
"We prefer to deal with fewer events more penetratingly, in",Paragraph
close-up view. A few facts seen clearly cnough may lead to a,Paragraph
knowledge of something more important than the isolated facts,Paragraph
themselves: the inner structure of architecture at the slage of,Paragraph
growth which it has reached in our time.,Paragraph
There are some individual artists whom we shall also scrutinize,Paragraph

of the period than we can from its greal official celebrities.,Paragraph
Simple utilitarian structures reveal more of its essential spirit,Paragraph

THE NEW SPACE CONCEPTION: PERSPECTIVE,Title

The Renaissance ferment which was working in Florence,Paragraph
showed itself under the widest variely of forms. We shall con-,Paragraph

"new conception of space. At the start of the fifteenth century,",Paragraph
"in Florence, this conception was translated inlo artistic terms",Paragraph

before we deal with these we shall turn lo some of the archi-,Paragraph
tectural works already executed in which the spirit of the early,Paragraph
Renaissance first showed through.,Paragraph
The first building in which the Renaissance spirit appears is,Paragraph
Brunelleschi’s loggia on the front of the Spedale degli Innocenti,Caption
"al Florence. The Spedale degli Innocenti, or the loundling",Caption
"Hospital, was built at the order of the silk-weavers’ guild, of",Paragraph

There is no direct connection between classical archilecture,Paragraph
and Brunelleschi’s Foundling Hospital. It has often been,Paragraph
remarked that the chief features of Branelleschi’s architectural,Paragraph
style are closely related to buildings which he saw every day,Paragraph
"in Florence —- to the Baptistery, to San Miniato, and to the",Paragraph
sadia of Fiesole. All these are in the tradition of medieval,Paragraph
architecture from the eighth to the twelfth century. The coved,Paragraph
or jienuspherical vault which Brunelleschi used with such great,Paragraph
sureness in his churches and in the Innocenti —- and which was,Paragraph
always the vaulting motif he preferred — was likewise unusual,Paragraph
"in antiquity, It was, however, quite common in Byzantine",Paragraph
"archilecture, especially for loggias and the entrance halls of",Paragraph
ecclesiastical structures. There was a comparatively close,Paragraph

tects of the lale seventeenth century — all this is quite familiar.,Paragraph
"In the hands of the baroque builders, the Renaissance shapes",Paragraph
were no more than the primilive elements of architectural com-,Paragraph
position. In just the way that Bach would transpose a simple,Paragraph
"melody into a great new harmony, elaborate and subtle, these",Paragraph
architects transmuted the forms developed in the Renaissance.,Paragraph
The interiors they produced are marked by an inseparable,Paragraph
union of two kinds of interests usually encountered separately:,Paragraph
they are at once the products of purely mathematical specula-,Paragraph
"tions of a high order of complexity, and completely visionary",Paragraph
or mystical imaginalive creations. The same union of two such,Paragraph
different spirils appears in the work of a baroque master of,Paragraph
"another medium, Blaise Pascal (1623-1662). At sixteen he had",Paragraph
wrillen a classic work on conic sections; he went on to study,Paragraph
"the cycloid curve, Lo develop the theory of probability, and to",Paragraph

"these infinite spaces terrifies me"" comes out of his work on the",Paragraph

The last phases of the baroque development are the true in-,Paragraph
heritance of the epoch out of which we grow. We shall have to,Paragraph
"consider first the Italian products of the baroque era, and then",Paragraph
go on to see what the north of Europe adds to these results.,Paragraph
It may perhaps be advisable —- in view of the history of the,Paragraph

Borromini built the cloister and the interior of the church,Paragraph
nearly thirty years before he completed the facade — in the,Paragraph
interval between 1634 and 1641. The interior is thus one of,Paragraph
his earliest productions. It is left almost entirely dark; on this,Paragraph
account the way in which the light bursts into it through the,Paragraph
lantern is all the more effective. The light shimmers over the,Paragraph
curious combination of geometrical forms which are cut into,Paragraph
"the underside of the dome. As Borromini handles them, these",Paragraph
forms give the dome an appearance Lhat suggests the cellular,Paragraph
structure of a plant (fig. 7).,Paragraph
Borromini’s treatment of an inlerior space is best shown in,Paragraph
"Sant’ Ivo (fig. 8), the church which he built for the Sapienza (the",Paragraph

finity. The baroque period felt strongly attracted to construc-,Paragraph
tious which seemed to defy the force of gravity. All the arts - —,Paragraph
including even the use of colored lights —- were exploited to,Paragraph
produce this exciting impression. In Rome there was a chapel,Paragraph
where the lantern in the dome was borne aloft on the shoulders,Paragraph
"of sculptured angels. In San Lorenzo, Guarini uses purely",Paragraph
architectonic means to put gravity at defiance. He proceeds,Paragraph
copventionally until the ring of the cupola is reached: there,Paragraph
he plunges at once into the reahn of fantasy. Interseeting,Paragraph
binding arches are carried from one point to another on the,Paragraph
"ring like a network woven by some giant spider, They cross",Paragraph
each other to forma kind of filigree-work star with an octugon-,Paragraph
shaped opening in its center. In this way the impression is,Paragraph
h-,Title
produced that the lantern above the arches is magically sus-,Paragraph
pended in mid-air. In reality it rests on the octagon formed by,Paragraph
their intersection (fig. 16).,Paragraph
The impression of unlimited space has been achieved not,Paragraph
through the employment of perspective illusions or of a,Paragraph
painled sky bul through exclusively architectural means. The,Paragraph
dazzling light that penetrates the star-shaped filigree has the,Paragraph
effect of dematerializing its surroundings. This is one of the,Paragraph
rare cases where a fecling of infiniteness is produced by archi-,Paragraph
tectonic means alone.,Paragraph
It is safe to assume that the dome of San Lorenzo would never,Paragraph
have been conceived had Guarini not seen the domes of the,Paragraph
Mih‘rab — the praving niche — of the mosque Al Hakem in,Paragraph
Cordova (fig. 18). These domes were constructed toward the,Paragraph
"eud of the tenth cenlury — to be exact, in 965. The same",Paragraph
method of construction was employed in the domes that,Paragraph

The cupolas of the praying niches in the mosque at Cordova,Caption
are Lhe earliest known specimens in which the binding arch is,Paragraph
given a constructional function. It has even been asserted by,Paragraph
some French historians that it was this Moorish invention,Paragraph
which suggested to Gothic builders of a century and a half later,Paragraph
the possibility of replacing the solid vault by a framework of,Paragraph
ribs in stone. But the dimensions of these Moorish domes are,Paragraph
humble in comparison with Guarini’s daring masterpiece. As,Paragraph
"far as I could ascertain, the binding arches of San Lorenzo are",Paragraph
"composed of long, massive stone beams, a dangerous and",Paragraph
"laborious method. In fact, the architect of San Lorenzo asked",Paragraph
"from construction almost more than it was prepared, at that",Paragraph
"date, to give. No later architect dared to follow the precedent",Paragraph
Guarini set in this church. With San Lorenzo the technical,Caption
"possibilities of the age were exhausted, just at the moment",Paragraph
when the vision of further architectural advances was begin-,Paragraph
ning to dawn. We find oursclves quite spontaneously driven,Paragraph
to think how easy the solution of such a problem would be with,Paragraph
the means available to modern construction. But we must,Paragraph
reject such reflections as absolutely unhistorical. The dome of,Paragraph
San Lorenzo presents the case of an architectural vision that,Paragraph

French architecture from this period onward is a very impor-,Paragraph
tant one.,Paragraph
The elaborate routine of court ceremonies is another major,Paragraph

life dictated a more complicated arrangement of rooms in,Paragraph

treatment. At the same time changes are made in the designs,Paragraph
"of furniture, especially as concerns such pieces as are intended",Paragraph
for sitting and lying: these become better accommodated to,Paragraph
"women, and to love-making.",Paragraph
At this period in France the general type of dwelling was being,Paragraph
transformed; the chateau was replacing the villa of Italian,Paragraph
style. The town mansions of the nobility and of high state,Paragraph
"officials, buildings like the Hétel Lambert which Louis",Paragraph
"Le Vau built at Paris in 1650, showed a highly developed",Paragraph
dwelling culture that had arisen out of the special requirements,Paragraph
of French life. But very soon the growth of this culture was to,Paragraph

"financiers, and the chief state functionaries alike was eclipsed",Paragraph
by the demands of an absolute king.,Paragraph
"In keeping with this change, the royal chateau — placed out-",Paragraph

to erect Versailles in all its magnilicence. He began the work,Paragraph
"when he was twenty-two, firmly rejecting the suggesLions of his",Paragraph

Louis NIV had other ideas.,Paragraph

"years 1668-74 a new conception took shape, a conception",Paragraph
"gigantic in scale (fig. 25). The great U-shaped, central block",Caption
faces the park. Jules Hardouin-Mansard elongated the front,Caption
of the palace by building a long wing at right angles to each,Paragraph
end of the U. The left wing (1679-82) was built for the royal,Paragraph
princes; the right wing (begun in 1684) was built as an office,Paragraph
"building for the various French ministries. (It was in 1683,",Paragraph
when he decided to house the administration of France in his,Paragraph

The two long wings combined with the U of the central block,Paragraph
resulted in an open style of construction that had been hitherto,Paragraph

"served three functions: it housed the King, the royal family,",Paragraph
and the ministries of France. Building activity on these,Paragraph
immense residential quarters was carried on at its greatest,Paragraph

were employed on the work. The interval in question corre-,Paragraph
sponds exactly to the rise of the absolute monarchy. At the,Paragraph
"same time, Roman baroque architecture underwent the last",Paragraph
phase of its development in the work of Borromini and,Paragraph
Guarini.,Paragraph
What is the significance of Versailles? What is the important,Paragraph
constituent fact it embodies? It is the close contact it effects,Paragraph
"with nature. An immense complex of buildings, more than two",Paragraph
"thousand fect long, has been directly confronted with nature;",Paragraph
"the grounds are a real part of the structure itself, and form with",Paragraph
it a whole of great power and grandeur.,Paragraph
Lorenzo Bernini had not been permitted to carry out his,Paragraph
"project for the Louvre; nevertheless, when Louis XIV began",Paragraph
"the new enlargement of Versailles in 1668, Roman grandeur,",Paragraph
"grandezza, scored a success. Straight lines and flat roofs",Paragraph
replaced the crabbed medieval silhouette. In the simplicity of,Paragraph
"a long straight line, used without deviation, there lies a tre-",Paragraph
mendous courage and self-assertiveness. The whole edifice is,Paragraph
the architectural response to a new sociological demand: the,Paragraph
"demand for a new setting for the personal, the ceremonial, and",Paragraph
the governmental life of an absolute king. The major functions,Paragraph
combined under its one roof have already been noted. Less,Paragraph
"important ones were likewise provided for; the salons, for",Paragraph
"example, for all their mythological names, were acLually in-",Paragraph
"tended for gambling, dancing, and musical entertainments.",Paragraph
But the interesting thing is still the manner in which great,Paragraph
"complex buildings for social, residential, and administrative",Paragraph
purposes have been welded together and closely juxtaposed,Paragraph
with nature (fig. 27). Versailles is important not because of,Paragraph
its royal splendor but because it clearly reveals the solution to,Paragraph
a problem of living. Nature had been mastered before by,Paragraph
"man’s will, but never before had so large a community been",Paragraph
"housed under one roof, in open country, away from any big",Paragraph

Place des Vosges (1612). Louis XIV did not build his first,Paragraph
square until thirty years after Bernini’s colonnades of St.,Paragraph
"Petcr’s, and twenty-five years after the beginning of his reign.",Paragraph
This was the Place des Victoires (1685-87). It had the form of,Paragraph
"a circle flattened on one side, and was quite modest in its",Paragraph
dimensions. But it was the first circular place in Paris intended,Paragraph
as a meeting point for streets.,Paragraph
The first really large public square built in the Paris of this,Paragraph
"period was the Place Vendéme, constructed at the beginning of",Paragraph
the cighteenth century. It is worthy of note that the Place,Paragraph
Vendéme was not built until after the completion of Versailles.,Paragraph
"The architect of Versailles, Jules Hardouin-Mansard, now",Paragraph
had time for work on the important places in Paris itself. His,Paragraph
first plan in 1699 provided for a simple rectangle; later its,Paragraph
"corners were cut off, and the new sides that were thus developed",Paragraph
"were bent outward. Seventy years earlier, Boriomini had used",Paragraph
the same treatment in the small cloister-court of San Carlo,Paragraph
alle Quattro Fontane. But the most significant development,Paragraph
"in Paris, one which could not be valued truly at the time, was",Paragraph
the highroad that was carried directly across the countryside to,Paragraph

"the Chateau du Louvre. To this day, the Champs-Elysées",Paragraph

Town planning is always the last department of architecture,Paragraph

society and the ministerial staff. Bath marks the point when a,Paragraph
middle-class development is given the same treatment; Charles,Paragraph

development had become a general mode of expression in,Paragraph

never came into prominence. By the early nineteenth century,Paragraph
the squares and crescents of London extended the baroque,Paragraph
tradition of a juxtaposition of nature and human residences to,Paragraph
"the housing of still lower classes, and made it no longer the",Paragraph
exclusive privilege of wealthy people.,Paragraph
But just at this time there came a sudden break. The kind of,Paragraph
town planning that was summed up in contemporary architec-,Paragraph
tural knowledge and concretcly exemplified in Bath did not,Paragraph
suit the new condilions created by industry. With its demands,Paragraph
for dignity and proportion it represented only an obstacle to,Paragraph
"a time of chaotic expansion, when towns and industrial",Paragraph
centers were growing up wilh uncontrolled speed. Factory,Paragraph
towns like Manchester and Birmingham have been scenes of,Paragraph
architectural disorder from the day of their inception. From,Paragraph
"the first onset of the new forces of industry, the knowledge",Paragraph
upon which town planning rests was lost with terrifying,Paragraph
rapidily.,Paragraph
This disorganization spread from the industrial Lowns to the,Paragraph
old capital cities. A new and deadly influence was at work; the,Paragraph
pursuit of wealth through the new increase in the power of,Paragraph
production became an end in itself. This led on the one hand,Paragraph
"to the appearance of slums, and on the other lo the building of",Paragraph

"Rhone, near Tournon, in 1824 (fig. 53). Marc Seguin, its",Paragraph
"constructor, was a nephew of Montgolfier and had already",Paragraph
invented the tubular boiler which made long railway runs,Paragraph

models for Seguin’s work at Tournon. These bridges were,Paragraph
suspended on hemp or rawhide ropes; Seguin used wire cables,Paragraph
instead. This was the first time wire rope had been employed °,Paragraph
"for such a purpose in Europe, and Seguin made careful scien-",Paragraph
Lific tests of its strength before starting his project. The new,Paragraph
material made possible constructions of an extreme elegance,Paragraph

were eventually erected.,Paragraph

by John Augustus Roebling in his bridges over the Mononga-,Caption
"hela River at Pittsburgh, 1846, and the Niagara River, 1851-55,",Caption
"and in the Brooklyn Bridge, on which the preliminary work",Paragraph
was begun in 1868. And this principle — the transmission of,Paragraph
"all stresses to a continuous, elastic cable running the length",Paragraph
of the structure — still forms the basis for the most daring,Paragraph
"bridges built today. Seguin’s bridge, incidentally, is still in",Paragraph

FROM THE IRON COLUMN TO THE STEEL FRAME,Title
Perhaps the most characteristic feature of nineteenth-century,Paragraph
architecture is its addiction lo “period pieces.” All the,Paragraph
"important buildings, all Lhose edifices from which the spectalor",Paragraph
"imagined himself to gain a serious aesthetic impression,",Paragraph
appeared in elaborate historical dress. The theoretical issues,Paragraph
which received most attention at the time were those raised,Paragraph
"by the various “revivals” - - now classical. now Gothic, Ad-",Paragraph
vances In building technique seem to have brought with them,Paragraph
only the practical problems iuvolyed in using new methods to,Paragraph
produce old effects. Bul even at that early date there were,Paragraph
people who saw that no genuine and distinetiy e tradition could,Paragraph
emerge from the medley of inherited forms that overlaid the,Paragraph
urchilecture of the period. A hundred Years ago critics spoke,Paragraph
"of“ the Harlequin dress of architecture,” and indicated with",Paragraph
thal phrase a disease which is still malignant in our day.,Paragraph
"Nov ertheless, beneath all the masquerade, Londencies of lasting",Paragraph
Importance lay hidden and were slowly gathering strength.,Paragraph
The architecture of Wie present is a continuation of these,Paragraph
tendencies: it is the product of a great stream of development,Paragraph
that has covercd a whole century. The common opinion that,Paragraph
contemporary architecture owes its foundation to a few inno.,Paragraph
"yators appearing around 1900 is both mistaken and superficial,",Paragraph
The seeds of this new archilecLure were planted al the moment,Paragraph
when handwork gave place to industrialized production. Like,Paragraph
"so many other aspects of our civilization, it owes its distine-",Paragraph
tive character to influences stemming from the Industrial,Paragraph
Revolution.,Paragraph
"But why is it that these tendencies, so important to the future,",Paragraph
are to be discovered almost nowhere except in the utilitarian,Paragraph
structures of the nineteenth century? Why was their effect,Paragraph
upon its official architecture so slight? We should of course,Paragraph
expecl technological advances to make themselves felt first in,Paragraph
"the field of industrial construction, but this is not a complete",Paragraph
explanation. ‘The Industrial Revolution may have begun in,Paragraph
science and technology; that is no reason why it should not,Paragraph
have acted upon the arts as well. We have already seen,Paragraph
"how, in baroque days, new scientific discoveries — even the",Paragraph
most abstract and mathematical ones — immediately found,Paragraph
their counterparts in the realm of feeling and were,Paragraph
translated into artistic terms. In the nineteenth century,Paragraph
the paths of science and the arts diverged; the connection,Paragraph
between methods of thinking and methods of feeling was,Paragraph
broken. The mutual isolation of these two kinds of enter-,Paragraph
"prise, far from being a consequence of |their different",Paragraph
"natures, is a phenomenon peculiar to the nineteenth century",Paragraph
and responsible for much about its culture that is otherwise,Paragraph
incomprehensible.,Paragraph
The historical posturing of nineteenth-century architecture is,Paragraph
"simply a special case of this separation, manifested in this field",Paragraph
in the schism between the architect and the engineer. The,Paragraph
architects of Gothic times did not merely employ the new,Paragraph
engineering knowledge; they saw in it possibilities for express-,Paragraph
"ing the aims, emotions, and outlook peculiar to their age.",Paragraph
"Similarly, the progress of mathematics brought something",Paragraph
more into baroque architecture than new instruments of cal-,Paragraph
"culation. In both cases new inventions were, so to speak,",Paragraph
humanized; emotional and intellectual advances paralleled,Paragraph
each olher. The situation with regard to those nineteenth-,Paragraph
century buildings which were expressly meant to symbolize,Paragraph
the spirit of the century is exactly the opposite. Structural,Paragraph
"iron. for example, was simply a new tool enabling one to erect",Paragraph
pscudo-monumental exteriors in the old modes. The new tool,Paragraph
"of course, by its very employment reduced these “ revived *",Paragraph
forms to the status of false fronts.,Paragraph
Bul. as long as scientific and technological advances were used,Paragraph
"in architecture without being absorbed bv it, the engineer",Paragraph
renutined subordinate to and detached from the architect,Paragraph
"The architect, on the other hand, was left isolated from the",Paragraph
most important movemenls going on in the world about him.,Paragraph
Until he suceeeded in coming to terms with the changed,Paragraph
"enviroument, until he recognized the architectonic possibilities",Paragraph
"in modern constructional meLhods, no new tradition relevant",Paragraph
to the age could develop. It was out of those technical,Paragraph
innovations which appear only behind the scenes in nineteenth-,Paragraph
century architeclure that the architecture of the fulure had to,Paragraph
"grow. Construction was, as it were, the subconsciousness of",Paragraph
archileclure; there lay dormant in it impulses that only much,Paragraph

THE SCHISM BETWEEN ARCHITECTURE AND,Title
TECHNOLOGY,Title
We have already spoken in somewhat general terms of the gap,Paragraph
that opened in the course of the nineteenth century between,Paragraph
science and its techniques on the one hand and the arts on the,Paragraph
"other, and hence between architecture and construction. The",Paragraph
previous chapter should lend support to the contention we,Paragraph
made then that the seeds of the architecture of our day were,Paragraph
to be found in technical developments little regarded at the,Paragraph
time of their appearance. The present chapter will handle this,Paragraph
topic in more detail. We shall deal with the question of the,Paragraph
"time at which this schism became evident, and the manner in",Paragraph
which recognition of its existence led to the demand for a new,Paragraph
architecture. Contemporary utterances will enable us to show,Paragraph
that from this situation developed many questions the answers,Paragraph
"to which are still being sought today. [inally, in separating",Paragraph
the constituent facts from the episodic trends of the nineteenth,Title

"In the year 1806 Napoleon founded the Ecole des Beaux-Arts,",Paragraph

had been both complete and spontaneous during the barocue,Paragraph

"this time on, the engineer slowly encroaches more and more",Paragraph
"upon the province of the architect. All unconsciously, the",Paragraph
constructor during the nineteenth century played the role of,Paragraph

pressing upon the architect continually forced the latter to,Paragraph

"tect’s ritualistic and artificial formalism, hammered brusquely",Paragraph
upon the door of his ivory tower. And it remains one of the,Paragraph
chief functions of construction to furnish architecture with the,Paragraph
stimulus and incentive for new growth.,Paragraph
The Demand for a New Architecture,Title
With the quickening of the advance of industry in the middle of,Paragraph
the nineteenth century there becomes evident a feeling on the,Paragraph
part of the architect that his privileged position is menaced,Paragraph
and the traditions of his art outmoded. That anxiety grew in,Paragraph
intensity with the progress of industrialization. But contem-,Paragraph
porary statements of this feeling are of more interest than any,Paragraph
abstract deductions we might make concerning it. Let us first,Paragraph
quote some evidence of the hopes for a new architecture that,Paragraph

"In the nineteenth century, buildings which owe nothing to the",Paragraph
past begin to appear. Their new lines originate in the new,Paragraph
"demands presented by big towns, multiplied means of com-",Paragraph
"munication, and an ever-expanding industry. All these build.",Paragraph
ings have one thing in common: they are intended solely for a,Paragraph
periodic use that involves rapid distribution of large volumes,Paragraph
of merchandise. It is no accident that this type of construction,Paragraph
should embody the solutions to the main architectural prob-,Paragraph
lems of the century. Because Lhese unpretentious buildings,Paragraph
"contain the seeds of so much that followed, we must treat them",Paragraph
at considerable length.,Paragraph
Market Halls,Title
One of the new problems that were arising first finds a solution,Paragraph
"in the great public markets, three examples cf which will be",Paragraph
given. The earliest of such structures Lo require discussion,Paragraph
"here was the market hall of the Madeleine, built in Paris in",Paragraph
1824. (fig. 89). The grace of ils slender cast-iron columns is,Paragraph
reminiscent of Pompeian mural paintings. The lightness of,Paragraph
the construction is unbroken by any purely decorative addi-,Paragraph
tions. This is one of the earliest examples of the attempts,Paragraph
nineteenth-century engineers were making to develop methods,Paragraph
of construction which would combine elegance with economy,Paragraph
of material.,Paragraph
The market which was built in London in 1835 to replace the,Paragraph
old Hungerford Fish Market represents a somewhat greater,Paragraph
"advance, so far as construction alone is concerned. A detailed",Paragraph
description of the new Hungerford Fish Market (fig. 90),Caption
appeared in the Transactions of the Institute of British Archi-,Paragraph
"tects in 1836.2 On sanitary grounds, the use of lumber in this",Paragraph
building had been forbidden. The cast-iron construction,Paragraph
dictated by this provision is particularly noteworthy for the,Paragraph
"wide roof span of thirty-two feet, with its straight line. It has",Paragraph
all the elegance of a much later period. “ The chief particular-,Paragraph
"ity in the construction,” according to the report of 1836, “is",Paragraph
"43 | (1836), 11-16.",Caption
the absence of any tie or lateral abutment.”’ Already we find,Paragraph
"the planes of the roof given an inward slope, so that rain water",Paragraph
might be carried away through the central columns.,Paragraph
"The Grandes Halles of Paris, begun in 1853, had both a more",Paragraph
interesling origin and a greater future influence than either of,Paragraph
"the structures we have just discussed. This market, the first",Paragraph
"designed to serve a population in the millions, was a part of",Paragraph
H aussmann’s great transformation of Paris. The Grandes,Paragraph
[alles consist of two groups of pavilions connected by covered,Paragraph
"passageways. Their designer, Victor Baltard, is not by any",Paragraph
means to be regarded as one of the great architects. His,Paragraph
initial attempt —- a stone pavilion that was built in 1851 —,Paragraph
aroused a public disapproval so clamorous that Haussmann,Paragraph
"then newly appointed prefect, ordered it pulled down.",Paragraph
It was only direct commands by Napoleon ITI and Haussmann,Paragraph
that induced the academic Baltard to turn to iron construction,Paragraph
"in his second attempt (fig. 91). Napoleon III, greatly impressed",Paragraph
"by the recently built Gare de l'Est, had decided that a similar",Paragraph
umbrella-like shelter was all that was required in the projected,Paragraph
"market hall. “ Ce sont de vastes parapluies qu’il me faut, rien",Caption
de plus!’ And the prefect Haussmann thundered at Baltard,Paragraph
“Du fer! Du fer! Rien que du fer!” The final design that,Paragraph
Baltard produced under this pressure was a derivative patch-,Paragraph
"work of other men’s plans; for all that, it had an important",Paragraph
influence on future work.,Paragraph
"The new version, all iron and glass, once again amazed Na-",Paragraph
polcon IIT when Haussmann brought it to him — this time for,Paragraph
"different reasons. “ Is it possible,’’ he asked, ‘“ that the same",Paragraph
architect designed two such contradictory buildings? ” Hauss-,Paragraph
"mann replied, “ The architect is the same, but the prefect is",Paragraph
different.” |,Paragraph
The project actually realized in the Grandes Halles is less,Paragraph
interesting than two designs which were rejected. The first,Paragraph
was the work of Hector Horeau (1801-1872). Hector Horeau,Paragraph
Was one of those architects who never know the satisfaction of,Paragraph
fulfillment. His projects — all on a grand scale —- could not,Paragraph
be exeeuted. Mathematical theory had not yet progressed to,Paragraph
a point where the calculations required for such buildings could,Paragraph

reality.,Paragraph
The second rejected design was the work of Eugéne Flachat,Paragraph

That Flachat was a follower of Saint-Simon is by no means,Paragraph
irrelevant to this recital. The Saint-Simonists took it as,Paragraph
"axiomatic that “ la Société toute entiére repose sur l’industrie,”",Paragraph
and were almost alone in foreseeing the scale and the extent of,Paragraph

"Halles (fig. 93), in its magnitude and social function, was a",Paragraph
typical part of that new age the Saint-Simonists felt them-,Paragraph
"selves destined to call forth. In submitting a plan for it,",Paragraph
Flachat was animated by the same spirit that stood behind his,Paragraph
other more grandiose proposals.,Paragraph
"The design itself, like Horeau’s, features a very wide span —",Paragraph
"one of 260 feet. It could, nevertheless, have been executed with",Paragraph
the means available at the Lime. The Polonceau tie system is,Paragraph
"employed, and, with its minimum of support and widely",Paragraph
"spread horizontal lines, the plan achieves a most pleasing and",Paragraph
functional solution to the problem posed.,Paragraph

THE GREAT EXHIBITIONS,Title
"In the second half of the nineteenth century, with industry",Paragraph
"undergoing its greatest expansion, industrial exhibitions",Paragraph
afforded truly creative architecture its best opportunities.,Paragraph
"‘Toward the end of the century, when industry had come to be",Paragraph
taken as a matter of course and was no jonger looked upon,Paragraph
"as new and marvelous, they lost their creative force. New",Paragraph
problems had emerged in the meantime which demanded new,Paragraph
solutions.,Paragraph
The exhibitions were born almost simultaneously with modern,Paragraph
industry; they appeared at the time when the shift from hand-,Paragraph
work to machine production made itself obvious. Throughout,Paragraph
that period people in many countries were working feverishly,Paragraph
to invent new machines and new processes. The chief purpose,Paragraph
of the early exhibitions was to bring together the resulls of this,Paragraph
"work, to display the new discoveries side by side, and thus to",Paragraph
facilitate their comparison and adoption. The development of,Paragraph
"industry in all its branches was accelerated by these exhibitions,",Paragraph
in which every sphere of human activity was represented: the,Paragraph
"implements, methods, and products of mines, mills, machine",Title
"shops, and farms were on display, together wilh work in the",Paragraph
fine and the applied arts.,Paragraph
The industrial exhibition embodied a synthesis of the as yet,Paragraph
unformulated aims of the nineteenth century. h. foretold the,Paragraph
transformation that was to be effected in man as well as in,Paragraph
"industry, in human feelings as well as in human surroundings.",Paragraph
The exhibitions were a part of the march of industry and were,Paragraph
pound up in its destiny.,Paragraph
The history of the exhibition is divided into two periods.,Paragraph
The earlier of these periods opens and closes in Paris; it begins,Paragraph
with the first industrial exhibition ever held that of 1798 —,Paragraph
and ends with the Paris exhibition of 1849. The exhibitions of,Paragraph
this initial period were made possible by the collapse of the,Paragraph
"guilds in 1791, and were all purely national in character.",Paragraph
The premiére exposition des produils de Uindusirie frangaise,Caption
was opened on the Champ-de-Mars in Paris in September,Paragraph
1798 (fig. 101). It inaugurated an exhibition movement which,Paragraph
was to lead to some of the outstanding achievements of the,Paragraph
nineteenth century. The start made at Paris in 1798 was a very,Paragraph
"modest one. There were some luxury articles displayed, but",Paragraph
the precedent for nearly all future exhibitions was set by the,Paragraph
"central position given to articles of daily use: watches, wall",Paragraph
"paper, cloth, and cotton yarn — yarn which “ was carded and",Paragraph
"spun by means of machinery,” as the catalogue was careful to",Paragraph
state.,Paragraph
There were only a hundred and ten exhibitors at this first,Paragraph
"exposition, but this does not detract from its imporLlance. It",Paragraph
"was primarily intended as a sort of people’s festival, in celebra-",Paragraph
tion of the freedom from guild restrictions that the Revolution,Title
had brought. This festive motive accounted for its location,Paragraph
"in the Champ-de-Mars, the scene of all national celebrations",Paragraph
since the fall of the monarchy. It was the proclamation de,Paragraph
la liberlé da travail in 1791 that first gave every citizen the,Paragraph
right to follow whatever trade he desired. What was more,Paragraph
"important, this proclamation, in according a new liberty to",Paragraph
"production, gave official encouragement to a progress of in-",Paragraph
dustry and invention from which everyone expected great,Paragraph
things. “Ces arts n’avaient pas pu encore se developper A,Paragraph
cause des entraves sans nombre. Mais la liberté les vengerait.,Caption
"... Sous Pégide de la liberté, les arts utiles étaient appelés a",Caption
un brilliant avenir.”’,Paragraph
The second period occupies the latter half of the nineteenth,Paragraph
century and owes its force to the principle of free trade. In,Paragraph
this period the exhibition takes on a new character: it becomes,Paragraph
international in its scope. The national exhibitions of industry,Paragraph
during the first half of the century had followed upon the,Paragraph
abolition of the legal obligation to belong to a guild. Some-,Paragraph
thing else was demanded for an international exhibition; there,Paragraph
was no reason to bring together products from all over the,Paragraph
world unless there existed at the same time the possibility of,Paragraph
selling to the whole world. An international exhibition could,Paragraph
have value only in a world where trade restrictions of all kinds,Paragraph
had been reduced to a minimum. These great exhibitions were,Paragraph
"the product of the liberal conception of economy: free trade,",Paragraph
"free communication, and improvement im production and",Title
performance through free competition.,Paragraph
"The exhibitions also fostered a spirit of rivalry, a desire to equal",Paragraph
or improve upon the last exhibition. Thus risks were taken in,Paragraph
"many departments, not least of all in architecture. Such a",Paragraph
"spirit of rivalry, together with the efficiency it promoted, is",Paragraph
visible in the Crystal Palace world exhibition of 1851.,Caption
The history of exhibitions during the latter half of the nine-,Paragraph
teenth century constitutes at the same time a history of iron,Paragraph
construction. Exhibition buildings were planned for rapid,Paragraph
erection and dismantling: both were facilitated by the use of,Paragraph
"iron. Again, iron parts for such buildings could be fabricated",Paragraph
"in widely separated workshops. Finally, iron was everywhere",Paragraph
regarded at this date as ihe medium of expression most truly,Paragraph
appropriate to the period. But exhibition buildings did not,Paragraph
simply call for the use of iron; the fact that they appeared at,Paragraph
short intervals and were meant to be only temporary encour-,Paragraph
aged the experimental employment of iron in their construction.,Paragraph
The exhibition became the trial ground for new methods. In,Paragraph
all the great international exhibitions — from the first at,Paragraph
"Crystal Palace, London, in 1851 to the last at the end of the",Caption
century — constructors attempted tasks that had never been,Paragraph
faced before. When their experiments succeeded in this special,Paragraph
Geld they became a part of standard building practice. Tt,Paragraph
was in this way that the Eiffel Tower came. to be erected in,Paragraph
"1889, despite the most doleful prophecies of disaster.",Paragraph
The history of the exhibition shows not only the development:,Paragraph
in iron construction during the period but also impo ta t,Paragraph
changes in habits of aesthetic response. The new street al,Caption
treatments of load and support demanded new aesthetic,Paragraph
"reactions. In the past people had grown to expect the basi """,Paragraph

"Exhibitions grew out of the old fairs, familiar to every century.",Paragraph
The first French exhibition in 1798 was essentially a kind of,Paragraph
"people's festival, and all later exhibitions retained this festival",Paragraph
motif.,Paragraph
The nineteenth century marks the point when leisure vanished,Paragraph
from daily life. The ability to develop an original form for,Paragraph
festivals vanished with it. During the second half of the nine-,Paragraph
teenth century the exbibitions remained the great festivals in,Paragraph
"the life of nations. Warehouses, department stores, and office",Caption
buildings remained closely bound up with immediate practical,Paragraph
needs. The exhibitions had their practical function to fulfill,Paragraph
"also, but they operated in an atmosphere far removed from",Paragraph
the rush of everyday life and were able to sustain a festive,Paragraph
character. There was always a sharp contrast between their,Paragraph
festive and their practical or official aspects. The sureness,Paragraph
which appears in the construction of their great halls is not,Paragraph
carried over into the social arrangements in the interiors of,Paragraph
"the halls, for example. But, even so, they represent the",Paragraph
closest approach of the period to an original form of group,Paragraph
celebration.,Paragraph
"Even in the nineteenth century, when architecture was rooted",Paragraph
"in the background of industrial development, it was in these",Paragraph
buildings of a certain festive intent that the great solutions of,Paragraph
the period to the vaulting problem were made.,Paragraph
From the beginning of architecture the vaulting problem has,Paragraph
always brought forth the highest architectural expressions of,Paragraph
every epoch. Thus the barrel vault painted by Masaccio dur-,Paragraph
ing the early Renaissance was developed into a ceremonious,Paragraph
expression of the full Renaissance and early baroque world,Title
"In the late baroque, changes in vaulting once again accom-",Paragraph
panied changes in the outlook of the age.,Paragraph
Solutions to the vaulting problem played the same important,Paragraph
role in the nineteenth century. The haut godi of the nine-,Paragraph
teenth-century style in architecture requires — as we have,Paragraph
already noted more than once — more careful study than it has,Paragraph
"yet been given. But, whatever results such a study may lead",Paragraph
"io, the constituent facts of architectural development will be",Paragraph
found to be those original solutions of the vaulting problem,Paragraph
which first took shape in the large halls of great exhibitions.,Paragraph
Objections to this view could readily be advanced. It might,Paragraph
be said that these exhibition buildings represented nothing but,Paragraph
"the answers to very sober practical needs, while the vaulting",Paragraph
problem had possessed an almost metaphysical significance in,Paragraph
earlier periods. . ° :,Paragraph
"These objections cannot be ignored. Furthermore, it is obvious",Paragraph
that such exhibition buildings were out of direct contact with,Paragraph
human needs. But in a certain sense this remark applies to,Paragraph
the period as a whole. Their indifference to human needs,Paragraph
makes these constructions a true — if harsh -—— expression of,Paragraph
the times. Nevertheless we may succeed in showing that be-,Paragraph

the first half of the nineteenth century. In 1849 the French,Paragraph
Minister of Commerce proposed making the Paris exhibition,Paragraph
of that year an international one. The French chambers of,Paragraph
"commerce, however, lacked sufficient courage to open their",Paragraph
"frontiers to foreign industry. It was not until 1855, four years",Paragraph
"after the international exhibition at the Crystal Palace, that",Paragraph
the first “ exposition universelle des produits de Vindustrie ”,Paragraph
of James Bogardus — an original and genuinely American solution to the problem —,Paragraph
was also rejected (cf. Fig. 71). The beginnings Paxton had made in tbe Crystal Palace,Paragraph
suffered another setback in the London World’s Fair of 1862. Its pseudo-monumental,Paragraph

Machines of 1889.,Paragraph
The exhibition of 1889 centered around the Eiffel Tower,Paragraph
which Eiffel and his engineers had raised on the bank of the,Paragraph
Seine in the short space of seventeen months. The exhibition,Paragraph
buildings were spread out behind the tower. There were two,Paragraph
"wings, one housing the beaux-arls, the other the arls liberauz,",Paragraph
which were joined together by a section devoted lo general,Paragraph
exhibits. The immense metal bulk of the Galerie des Ma-,Paragraph
chines rose in the background to dominate the whole complex.,Paragraph
A kind of traveling crane -— les ponts roulanis — was erected,Paragraph
within the Galerie des Machines (fig. 119). It Wwansported,Paragraph
spectators over the length of the immense hall and enabled,Paragraph
them to inspect all the machinery (much of it in operation),Paragraph
which was displayed on the floor below. On good days as,Paragraph
many as a hundred thousand passengers rode on this crane.,Paragraph
For the last time industry aroused some of the wonder with,Paragraph
which it was viewed at the time of its birth. Four years later,Paragraph
at the Chicago World’s Fair a display of machinery on view,Caption
from ponts roulanis could not have had this degree of success.,Paragraph
But the progress made between 1878 and 1889 was so tremen-,Paragraph

"and in a more unassuming way, J. W. Schwedler had attempted a similar Auflagerung in",Paragraph
The volume of free space included by the 1889 Galerie des,Paragraph

matter. There is no earlier example that is comparable to it,Paragraph
"in this respect. But the glass end walls do not, strictly, close",Paragraph
up the building; they constitute only a thin transparent mem-,Paragraph
brane between the interior and outer space. And it is not as,Paragraph
a building circumscribed within definite limits that the Galerie,Paragraph
des Machines is important. The girders in its skeleton could,Paragraph
have been either more or less numerous without thereby effect-,Paragraph
ing any distinctive alteration. The aesthetic meaning of this hall,Paragraph
is contained in the unionand interpenetration of the building and,Paragraph
"outer space, out of which there grows a completely new limitless-",Paragraph

Each arched truss is made up of two segments. A pin unites,Paragraph
them at a pivotal point high above the center line of the hall.,Paragraph
"Moving downward, the trusses become increasingly atten-",Paragraph
uated until they appear scarcely to touch the ground: moving,Paragraph
"upward, they spread and gain weight and power (jig. 120).",Paragraph
The usual proportions seem to be exactly reversed. These,Paragraph
"triply articulated arches disturb, or rather disrupt, traditional",Paragraph
static feelings with regard to the rational relations of support,Title
"and load. Elongated like immensely drawn-out cantilevers,",Paragraph
the trusses embody movement in all their parts. Nothing,Paragraph
remains of the quiet stone architecture of the barrel vault.,Caption
"A new sort of movement, penetrating space — as new in kind",Paragraph
as that achieved in Borromini’s cupolas — is created here.,Paragraph
There is a further distortion of scale which must be noted:,Paragraph
a section of these trusses would be about five times as deep,Paragraph
as it was wide (three and a half meters deep by seventy-five,Paragraph

It is precisely the features that are criticized which pointed,Paragraph
to later developments. Here construction is unconsciously,Paragraph
moving toward aesthetic feelings which did not find,Paragraph
their equivalents in art and architecture until decades,Paragraph
"later,",Paragraph
In this hall the light pouring in from above swallowed up the,Paragraph
"thin latticework. So far as the optical impression is concerned,",Paragraph
the vault attains a floating or hovering state.,Paragraph
The last hint of the antique colump has disappeared. It is,Paragraph
impossible to separate load and support.,Paragraph
"Bent as though in the act of leaping, the vaulting starts at a",Paragraph
"very low Jevel to take up its load. If we wish, we may regard",Paragraph
this vaulting as our equivalent of the caryatid. It does not,Paragraph
carry its burden with the dignity of the maidens of the Erech-,Paragraph
theum nor does it break down under it like the nude giants on,Paragraph
baroque portals. It springs up against its load to unite with it.,Paragraph
"The ends of the girders, narrowing as they approach the floor",Paragraph
"(fig. 120), are no longer rigidly connected with the ground but",Paragraph
"are left free to move. The girders transmit their own weight,",Paragraph
"plus the horizontal stress of 120,000 kilograms, directly",Paragraph
"through a hinged joint. With this system of support, even",Paragraph
foundation movements could take place without setting up,Paragraph
internal stresses.” This was the only means whereby the play,Paragraph
of forces at all points of the system could be controlled.”,Paragraph
The division between load and support which was still indi-,Paragraph
cated in De Dion’s halls of 1878 is here obliterated. Iron,Paragraph
vaulting has found its true form. The play of enormous forces,Paragraph
"is held in equilibrium, an equilibrium that is floating rather",Paragraph
than rigid.,Paragraph
It is the equilibrium of a balance beam daringly poised against,Paragraph
continually varying forces.,Paragraph
‘A new oscillating harmony is created.,Paragraph
An clastic counterpoise is achieved which absorbs changes in,Paragraph
"the interior, the exterior, and the foundation.",Paragraph
This counterpoise adjusts itself to fluctuations of the ground.,Paragraph

‘There are whole decades in the second half of the nineteenth,Paragraph
century in which no architectural work of any significance is,Paragraph
encountered. Eclecticism smothered all creative energy. Here,Paragraph
and there — especially as the century wore on -—~ voices were,Paragraph
"raised in protest, but they could do nothing to alter conditions.",Paragraph
It was just at this time that an unprecedented wave of building,Paragraph
activity swept over Europe. Its cities took on the shapes from,Paragraph
which we still suffer today.,Paragraph
The painter was able to withdraw from this overpowering,Paragraph
environment. The men who did the important work at this,Paragraph
period gave up all prospects of fame and an audience and,Paragraph
"practiced their art in seclusion. Cézanne and Van Gogh, for",Paragraph
"example, buried themselves in the solitude of Provence. The",Paragraph
architect had no such course open to him; not a single one,Paragraph
managed to escape from the atmosphere of eclecticism.,Paragraph
Dissatisfaction with this almost universal state of affairs,Title
reached its peak around 1890. Toward the end of the century,Paragraph
H. P. Berlage was to produce a building which. would serve to,Paragraph
"purify architecture all over Europe, his Amsterdam Stock",Paragraph
Exchange. In the nineties he was already denouncing the,Paragraph
"prevailing architecture as “ Scheinarchitektur, d-h. Imitation,",Paragraph
"ah. Liige ” (‘‘ Sham architecture; i.e., imitation; iLe., lying”).",Paragraph
"“ Our parents and grandparents as well as ourselves,” Berlage",Paragraph
"wrote, ‘ have lived and still live in surroundings more hideous",Paragraph
"than any known before. . . . Lying is the rule, truth is the",Paragraph
exception.”,Paragraph
The smoldering hatred of eclecticism came to a head in Europe,Paragraph
"with startling suddenness. In the same way, a fish net can be",Paragraph
"hauled for a long time quite uneventfully and then, in a single",Paragraph
"moment, the whole catch shows up all bunched together. This",Paragraph

tance. Ambition revives and brings with it courage and,Paragraph
strength to oppose those forces which had kept life from finding,Paragraph
its true forms. Developments come in one surge afler another.,Paragraph
The diversity of movements with their variety of experimental,Paragraph
gropings indicates the vilality of the period. Individual fail-,Paragraph
ures and the mixture of transitory with constituent facts are of,Paragraph
little imporlance. These are traits of every transitional period.,Paragraph
Much of what was attempted between 1890 and 1930 remained,Paragraph
"fragmentary and incomplete. This period, however, found the",Paragraph
courage to undertake the building up of a tradition of its own.,Paragraph
What Were the Sources of this Movement?,Paragraph
"According to the easy explanation that was advanced later, the",Paragraph
movement developed as the application of two principles: the,Paragraph
"abandonment of historical styles, and — consequent upon this",Paragraph
-— the use of “ fitness for purpose”’ as a criterion. The ex-,Paragraph
"planation is correct, inasmuch as both these factors were in-",Paragraph
"volved, but it does not go far enough. The movement took its",Paragraph
strength from the moral demands which were its real source.,Paragraph
"The cry went up, “ Away with this infected atmosphere! ”",Paragraph
The young painter Henri van de Velde was among those who,Paragraph
attacked the “ infected atmosphere ”’ most vigorously. In the,Paragraph
late nineties he took the lead in the fight for art moderne. He,Paragraph
"campaigned for it first in his native Belgium, next in France,",Paragraph
"and then in a country which, at the time, lay wide open to any",Paragraph
new movement — Germany. He has given the reasons why,Paragraph
"his development took the direction it did in his writings, where",Paragraph
"he preaches, explains, and defends his doctrines. But it may",Paragraph
be that the moral impetus behind the art moderne movement,Paragraph
appears more directly in some remarks which he made only a,Paragraph
short while ago. :,Paragraph
I met van de Velde in Brussels during the summer of 1938.,Paragraph
"A great leader during the nineties, he still remains extremely",Paragraph
"active; he had, in fact, just returned from laying the corner-",Paragraph
stone of the Belgian Pavilion at the New York World’s Fair.,Caption
"Knowing that he had begun his career as a painter, I asked",Paragraph
him how he had come to turn to architecture. He answered by,Paragraph
describing the situation that prevailed around 1890: “ The,Paragraph
real forms of things were covered over. In this period the,Paragraph
revolt against the falsification of forms and against the past,Title
was a moral revolt.” *,Paragraph
"He went on to tell how, shortly before 1890, a nervous break-",Paragraph
down had left him incapable of work. At this point he met a,Paragraph
"woman who gave him renewed courage to face life. Soon after,",Paragraph
he wished to marry and establish his own household. “I told,Paragraph
myself — this was in 1892 — that I would never allow my,Paragraph
wife and family to find themselves in ‘immoral’ surround-,Paragraph
ings.” ? But at that date everything that one could buy on the,Paragraph
open market was smothered under the mensonge des formes,Paragraph
which van de Velde hated. He had to design for himself every-,Paragraph
"thing in his house, from cutlery to doorknobs. Then — since",Paragraph
these articles demanded a setting which would * ward off ugli-,Paragraph
ness” — he was led to build his first house. “You asked me,Paragraph
"how I became an architect. Well, this house pushed me into",Paragraph
architecture.”,Paragraph
“This house” was van de Velde’s home on the Avenue van,Paragraph
"der Raye in Uccle, a suburb of Brussels.? It showed a remark-",Paragraph
able freedom in the treatment of the roof and in the way in,Paragraph
which the windows were cut out to meet the special require-,Paragraph
ments of each room. The revolution this house provoked when,Paragraph
it was completed in 1896 derived from its pronounced simplic-,Paragraph
"ity, in strong contrast with the over-fanciful facades to which",Paragraph
people were accustomed. In this respect van de Velde’s earli-,Paragraph
est work pointed farther into the future than Horta’s house in,Paragraph
the Rue de Turin.,Paragraph
A generation earlier the same disgust with the falsification of,Paragraph
forms in all objects of trade had led William Morris to create,Paragraph
"and equip his ‘* Red House ” at Upton in Kent, England. Ac-",Paragraph
"cording to one of Morris’ biographers, Red House had much",Paragraph
the same history as van de Velde’s house in Uccle: “ During,Paragraph
"the year 1858, William Morris plodded on as a painter with a",Paragraph
1 © Toutes les formes étaient cachées. A cette époque la révolte contre les mensonges des,Caption
formes ct le passé était une révolle morale.”,Paragraph
26 Je me disais-e’était en 1892 — jamais je ne veux pas admettre que ma femme et ma,Caption
famille se trouvent dans un milieu qui est immorale.”,Paragraph

"rapher and Maecenas, Karl Ernest Osthaus: Van de Velde (Hagen }. W, 1920).",Caption
growing dejection over the work accomplished despite the fact,Paragraph
"that he sold one picture for £70. But Morris’ wedding, in",Paragraph
"April 1859, turned his mind again and more intensely to those",Paragraph

"ices as architect. . .. The name of the house, which is built",Paragraph
"of red brick and tiles, expressed a revolt against the prevailing",Paragraph
and tyrannous formula of stucco walls and slate roofs.” 4,Caption
Does this parallel mean that van de Velde simply followed the,Paragraph
example Morris had already set? We do not think so. The,Paragraph
parallel springs from the fact that the disorder introduced into,Paragraph
human life by industry made itself felt in England more than,Paragraph

"there appeared the creations of the Morris group, as well as a",Paragraph

So once more it was Brussels which was the starting point,Paragraph
from which the arts and crafts movement spread over the,Paragraph

and as the evangelist of the art nouveau — carried his version,Paragraph
of the findings arrived at in Brussels first to Paris (1896) and,Paragraph

"As he himself points out, Berlage sought to impart to this",Paragraph
building something of “the quality which distinguishes old,Paragraph
monuments from the buildings of today: quiet!’ With the,Paragraph
"least compromise possible at the time, he gave Lhe wall —",Paragraph
until then cither chaotically dismembered or deceptively,Paragraph
patched together — the reconquered unity of the flat surface.,Paragraph
The wall as a flat surface was soon to become the starting,Paragraph
"point for new principles in architecture, not merely in Holland",Paragraph
but everywhere.,Paragraph
Berlage’s conscious asceticism — called barbarism by some of,Paragraph
his contemporaries — joined with his fanatical zeal for truth,Paragraph
at any price to produce in the Amsterdam Stock Exchange a,Paragraph
building which served as a guidepost to many. He gave an,Paragraph
example of the honorable treatment of a problem in building.,Paragraph
No other building accords so well with the demand that lay,Paragraph
behind the movement in architecture at that time — the,Paragraph
demand for morality.,Paragraph
"In Europe, where the entire previous generation had taken an",Paragraph
"altogether different line, the purity of the wall came with the",Paragraph

reasons that we shall discuss later in some detail. At this,Paragraph
"point, however, some related work by an American architect",Paragraph
may be mentioned.,Paragraph

"It might scem that these two men, in taking over Romanesque",Paragraph

the direction of their choice. The majority of these eclectics,Paragraph
appropriated classical and Gothic shapes. And certainly their,Paragraph
followers — those of Richardson particularly — returned to,Paragraph
the familiar path of historical imitation. The rows of little,Paragraph
"houses, each like a tiny Romanesque castle, which sprang up",Paragraph
some years later in America and Europe demonstrate this.,Paragraph
But the history of the nineteenth century is complicated. T he,Paragraph
"new aims derived from their study of Romanesque buildings,",Paragraph
and not the fact that Berlage and Richardson used somewhat,Paragraph
"Romanesque shapes, are what matter. The time was not ripe",Paragraph
for the outright invention of new forms derived from a new,Paragraph
"space conception, and they turned — very naturally — to",Paragraph
history for help. Romanesque methods started them on the,Paragraph
way toward the new forms their own period still awaited.,Paragraph
The same relation exists between the Romanesque and their,Paragraph
best buildings that links modern painting with primitive art.,Paragraph
Picasso did not copy the patterns of African masks; he learned,Paragraph
from them a new way of looking at his subjects. There was an,Paragraph
aflinity between that art and the not fully conscious endeavor,Paragraph
of his own period to compose in terms of planes. To a certain,Paragraph
extent Berlage and Richardson also found in the Romanesque,Paragraph
uot simply another transitory fashion but an inner affinily,Paragraph
which aided them in moving toward the still-veiled expressions,Paragraph
of their own period.,Paragraph
When we penetrate to what is significant in the Amsterdam,Paragraph
Stock Exchange we understand why Berlage became the,Paragraph
"admirer az. 1 the European advocate of American architecture,",Caption
particularly that of Frank Lloyd Wright. Berlage came to,Paragraph

he himself had been fighting for so passionately in complete,Paragraph

Otto Wagner and the Viennese School,Title
In the year 1894 Otto Wagner (1841-1918) was made professor,Paragraph
of architecture at the Academy of Vienna. The Academy at,Paragraph
the time appeared to have lost its attraction for the younger,Paragraph
"generation, and Wagner seemed the man to restore it. He was",Paragraph
then just past fifty. He was a successful and energetic archi-,Paragraph
tect whose buildings in the manner of early Florentine and full,Paragraph
Renaissance work were celebrated for their excellent plans.,Paragraph
The Academy could expect to gain in luster from his presence.,Paragraph
"Just at the moment of his election, however, a metamorphosis",Paragraph
which had long been preparing showed itself in his work.,Paragraph
It was in that year — 1894 — that he began a small book for,Paragraph
his students with the title Modern Architecture.” Soon trans-,Paragraph
"lated into many languages, it became the textbook of the new",Paragraph
moyement. In it Wagner asserted that “ our starting point for,Paragraph
"20 This paper is preserved in the archives of the C.LAM., Zurich.",Caption

effect of Wagner’s writing was increased by the rare mixture of,Paragraph

"tion, his readers felt that mature experience in architecture",Paragraph
stood behind his every word.,Paragraph
In this small book there is condensed the experience that,Paragraph
every nineteenth-century artist underwent from the moment,Paragraph
he set himself against accepted standards. Wagner makes it,Paragraph
plain that he no longer hopes for help from the state in any new,Paragraph
developments.” His disparagement of the layman's judgment.,Paragraph
"“ which always has been, and is, disastrous in its influence »",Paragraph
"reflects bitter experience of his own.""* He holds with Goethe’s",Paragraph
dictum: the artist must create what the public ought to like,Paragraph
not what it does like.,Paragraph
This book speedily disillusioned the official circles responsible,Paragraph
for Wagner’s appointment. “A fully developed architect has,Paragraph
become a mere experimenter with art — a sensation-monger,Paragraph
a train-bearer of fashion” — this judgment appears in a,Paragraph
pamphlet of 1897.,Paragraph
"in the year of his election to the Academy, Wagner built the",Paragraph
system of elevated and underground railways which encircles,Paragraph
Vienna on its outskirts. The elevated stretches were carried on,Paragraph
heavy brick arches like a Roman aqueduct. Wagner carried,Paragraph
"out all the details involved in this railway, including the",Paragraph

Wagner did not merely continue the work of the French: he,Paragraph
introduced new elements of bis own. In 1894 he prophesied,Paragraph
"that ‘the new architecture will be dominated by slablike,",Paragraph
tabular surfaces and the prominent use of materials in a pure,Paragraph
state.” 2° In the Karlsplatz station he himself used thin marble,Paragraph
"slabs for the outer walls, securing them with angle irons which",Paragraph
are left visible. This treatment shows the wall as simply a,Paragraph
"slablike screen, with no load to carry.",Paragraph
Ten years later in the Vienna Postal Savings Building (1904-,Caption
06) he stressed still more the function of the wall as a plane,Paragraph
surface. The facade of this bank is covered with marble slabs,Paragraph
attached by massive aluminum bolts whose heads can be scen,Paragraph
plainly.,Paragraph
The interior of the Postal Savings Building (fig. 137) reveals,Caption
an astonishing purity of design. It is without doubt one of the,Paragraph
most uncompromising rooms of the first years of the twentieth,Paragraph
century. It is very characteristic of the work of Wagner (and,Paragraph
of his contemporaries as well) that this purity follows upon the,Paragraph
contact with new materials. Wagner gave this bank a glass-,Paragraph
roofed interior court. Such courts had been common since,Paragraph
the middle of the nineteenth century. Here in the white hall,Caption
"of the Postal Savings Building, however, the glass and iron",Paragraph
vaulting does not merely fulfill all functional requirements,Paragraph
but also blends into and becomes a part of a whole architectonic,Paragraph
expression.,Paragraph
In the pure and abstract forms of this glass and iron hall the,Paragraph
touch of the architect is no longer apparent; yet his hand is,Paragraph
"everywhere present, in its curves, its colors, and the modeling",Paragraph
of its space.,Paragraph
The Continental successes of these architectural pioneers were,Paragraph
won mainly by surprise attacks. Wagner’s experience fol-,Paragraph

"the new dircctions set in, and his later projects — for museums,",Paragraph

they never achieved work of his standard. One of his students,Paragraph
"3° Moderne Architektur, p. 136.",Caption
"was the architect Josef Hoffmann, who was the founder of the",Paragraph
"Wiener Werkstatte for handicrafts. Another, who died quite",Paragraph
"young, was Joseph Olbrich. Wagner showed these young men",Paragraph
"the direction they should take, but they were all more directly",Paragraph
influenced by Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Glasgow,Paragraph
sroup. This was especially true of Hoffmann and the W ork-,Paragraph
statte circle. This meant that in Austria around 1900 the,Paragraph
movement was from handicrafts Lo architecLure and not from,Paragraph
archilecture to handicrafts.,Paragraph
It resulted in the sort of overconcentration on decorative aims,Paragraph
which appears also in Joseph Olbrich’s “Secession” gallery in,Paragraph
Vienna (1898). This was bitterly denounced by Adolf Loos,Paragraph
"This Viennese architect had lived in England and America,",Paragraph
and had learned to recognize the importance of the anonymous,Paragraph
work being done in those countries in the production of,Paragraph
articles of everyday life —from clothing to bathtubs and,Title

The invention of the balloon frame really coincides with the,Paragraph
improvement of sawmill machinery as well as with the mass,Paragraph
production of nails (fig. 157).,Paragraph
Several machines for cutting and heading nails were developed,Paragraph
in both England and the United States toward the end of the,Paragraph
eighteenth century. Thomas Clifford patented such a device,Paragraph
"in 1790, and about the same time a similar machine was in-",Paragraph

mark them off one from the other.,Paragraph
Historical styles are particularly uninformative with regard to,Paragraph
what was actually going on in America. They arrived here,Paragraph
fully grown and give little insight into the constituent facts of,Paragraph
the native American development.,Paragraph
During the eighties European architecture lost more and more,Paragraph
of its dignity. The closer it clung to historical forms in the,Paragraph
search for security the more insecure it really became. In,Paragraph
barely fifty years the whole architectural inheritance of the,Paragraph
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was lost in a weller,Paragraph
of transitory detail. The inner unrest and uncertainty of the,Paragraph
period appears time and again in unbalanced treatments of the,Paragraph
wall and of the ground plan. The whole organism of architec-,Paragraph

American independence of Europe showed itself in the develop-,Paragraph
"ment of new and logical forms for tools and furniture, and in",Paragraph
the informal and flexible ground plan of the American house.,Paragraph
In the same way the wall maintained its unity and balance in,Paragraph
America throughout this whole period of European uncer-,Paragraph
tainty and confusion. America produced its share of grotesque,Paragraph
"work during these years, but —in contrast to Europe —",Paragraph
attention never entirely strayed from the basic elements of,Paragraph
architecture. These elements always remained dominant in,Paragraph

new architectural solutions were reached in America earlier,Paragraph
than they were abroad.,Paragraph

The simple clapboard wall ( fig. 161) has remained a constituent,Paragraph

The Flexible and Informal Ground Plan,Title
American architecture has been marked by one tendency since,Paragraph
the arrival of the earliest settlers: the American house is given,Paragraph
a ground plan which can be enlarged whenever new social and,Paragraph
economic conditions make it desirable. This contrasts very,Paragraph
sharply with European procedure. In Europe a farmhouse is,Paragraph
"planned as a solid, cubical unit from the very beginning.",Paragraph
"Sometimes the interior is left unfinished, to be fitted up by",Paragraph
later generations when they come to need larger living quarters.,Paragraph
The American practice of adding new units to the original one,Paragraph
can be seen in those New England houses which survive from,Paragraph
the seventeenth century.*’ All these heavily timbered houses,Paragraph
"began as one and a half or (at most) two-story structures, with",Paragraph
"a single room on the ground floor. The next generation, with",Paragraph
"improving circumstances, enlarged this ancestral nucleus both",Paragraph
horizontally and vertically. A new roof was spread over all,Paragraph
"these additions, quite asymmetrically. But the important",Paragraph
"thing was the addition of wings, which was very general.",Paragraph
"The L-shaped ground plan, the beginning of the flexible and",Paragraph
"informal layout, developed from this sort of planning.",Paragraph
Houses were not invariably enlarged. Sometimes — as in the,Paragraph
"William Pepperell house at Kittery, Maine — they proved too",Paragraph
big for a later generation and were cut down. ‘ This family,Paragraph
"mansion was then much more imposing than at present, being",Paragraph
10 feet longer at cach end and surrounded by a beautiful park.,Paragraph

It was precisely the things which still impress European ob-,Paragraph
servers that surprised Bode almost fifly years ago. He notes,Paragraph
that “‘ rooms along the hallway are fitted with sliding doors or,Paragraph
partitions — often half as wide as their walls — and that these,Paragraph
doors are nearly always left open.” In this way it is possible,Paragraph
to look into the various rooms of the house.” The Continental,Paragraph

a space-saving treatment strikingly similar to the Frankfort,Paragraph
kitchen of about 1920 (fig. 168). The later design was supposed,Paragraph

THE CHICAGO SCHOOL “,Title
During the eighties a whole colony of buildings suddenly sprang,Paragraph
"up in Chicago — to heights of twelve, fourteen, sixteen, and",Paragraph
twenty-three stories. These buildings were erected not in,Paragraph
"isolation, as they were in other cities, but in close proximity to",Paragraph
each other. Each had its own individual appearance and its,Paragraph
"own name, and yet the aggregate appearance was not chaotic.",Paragraph
American buildings are commonly so short-lived that in a few,Paragraph
"decades, perhaps, these buildings will all have disappeared.",Paragraph
Many of the best specimens have gone already and many more,Paragraph
are destined to go soon.,Paragraph
The strongest growth of the Chicago school is to be found,Paragraph
between 1883 and 1893. Two contemporary voices may in-,Paragraph
form us of the state of development at the beginning and at the,Paragraph
end of this period.,Paragraph
“ In no period since 1830 has the ciLy experienced such wonder-,Paragraph

In the eighties the Loop — the business center of the city —,Paragraph
became the perfect illustration of American audacity in the,Paragraph
direct assault that was made upon its problems. Whole streets,Paragraph
"were developed in a way that had never been seen before,",Paragraph
"Walking through the Loop, one is struck by the impression",Paragraph
that Chicago is an outpost for the immense areas which are,Paragraph
"spread out behind it. At the time its great buildings went up,",Paragraph
Chicago was the real point of concentration for the products of,Paragraph
"the West and Middle West, and not merely an enormous stock",Paragraph
"exchange, like New York. The rapid growth of this great",Paragraph
"center led to sudden enlargements of its needs. To meet them,",Paragraph
"the urge grew up to use the new potentialities of construction,",Paragraph
potentialities which had hitherto been exploited only in bridges,Paragraph
and industrial structures of various kinds.,Paragraph
Large office buildings for business firms and insurance com-,Paragraph
panies were the first to appear. Buildings of equal power soon,Paragraph
appeared to meet other demands — immense hotels for the,Paragraph
travelers who passed through the city and combination office-,Paragraph
theater-hotel buildings like the Adler and Sullivan Auditorium.,Paragraph
At the same time the problem of the modern apartment house,Paragraph
—which still remains unsolved — was attacked with great,Paragraph
consistency and daring.,Paragraph

future architects of Chicago received their training in Jenney’s,Paragraph
office. William Le Baron Jenney played much the same role,Paragraph
in the training of the younger generation of Chicago architects,Paragraph
"that Peter Behrens did in Germany around 1910, or Auguste",Paragraph
Perret in France. He gave young architects the preparation,Paragraph
they needed to tackle the new problems for which the schools,Paragraph
could offer no solutions.,Paragraph
Today William Le Baron Jenney’s imagination and courage,Title
are not sufficiently recognized. Even Louis Sullivan describes,Paragraph

freedom from compromise were far above the average.,Paragraph

French engineering combined with the methods of his German,Paragraph
"specialists in ornament to produce a curious mixture. In 1873,",Paragraph
"as a young beginner, Louis Sullivan worked in this studio and",Paragraph
had his eyes opened to ‘ suppressed functions ** in architecture.,Paragraph
Besides Sullivan (who stayed here no longer than he did most,Paragraph
places) Jenney’s staff at one time or other included many of,Paragraph
"the future builders of Chicago: Martin Roche, Holabird, and",Paragraph
even Daniel Burnham — later the partner of John Root.,Paragraph
Jenney’s hand first showed itself clearly in a warehouse which,Paragraph

American architecture came under many different influences,Paragraph

The 1893 World’s Fair elicited a variety of responses. The,Paragraph

"light. While I was in Chicago, one architect who had worked",Paragraph
on it quoted from memory the rather ironical comment of,Paragraph

and mortgage one’s soul to go there; it is esteemed such a,Paragraph
"revelation of beauty. People cast away all sin and baseness,",Paragraph
"burst into tears, and grow religious, etc., under the influence.”",Paragraph
Some European observers were more sceptical. The extremely,Paragraph
well-informed Belgian constructer Vierendeel found both its,Paragraph
staff architecture and the construction it enveloped timid and,Paragraph
secondhand — as we saw toward the end of our discussion of,Paragraph
the great nineteenth-century exhibitions.,Paragraph
The lonely American voices raised against the unexampled,Title
seduction of the public taste underlying the Fair’s pseudo-,Paragraph
splendor went unheard. Louis Sullivan said bitterly that “ the,Paragraph
damage wrought to this country by the Chicago World’s Fair,Title
will last half a century.” At the time this may have seemed,Paragraph
only the exaggerated expression of an outraged artist; it turned,Paragraph
out to be a precise prophecy of what was actually to follow.,Paragraph
"Public, artists, and literary people believed themselves to be",Paragraph
witnessing a splendid rebirth of the great traditions of past,Paragraph
ages. The immense appeal of this re-created past in “ the,Paragraph
White City ” can only be laid to a quite unnecessary national,Paragraph
inferiority complex. It was the same feeling — reinforced by,Paragraph
the prestige of the Paris exhibition of 1889 — which gave the,Paragraph
French academicians a dominating role at this Chicago fair.,Paragraph
The contemporary biographer of John Root expresses it,Paragraph
quite clearly: “At that time few hoped to rival Paris; the,Paragraph
artistic capacity and experience of the French made us dis-,Paragraph
"irustful of ourselves. We should have a great American fair,",Paragraph
but in points of grouping and design we must expect inferiority,Paragraph
to French taste.” 1 And it was to France that the builders of,Paragraph
the Fair turned in their search for beauty. Its beautics were,Paragraph
taken out of the preserve jars of the Académie des Beaux-Arts,Caption
-— where they had been laid up during what was certainly its,Paragraph
"worst period. Grand prix de Rome facades were copied, and",Paragraph
men like Burnham (who had assisted in raising the Chicago,Paragraph
school to a level much higher than the Academy’s) acted like,Paragraph
docile children in the presence of the French masters. All,Paragraph
this is another instance of the split between thought and feeling,Paragraph
in the nineteenth century. Only Louis Sullivan had sufficient,Paragraph
inner strength to hold fast in the midst of a general surrender.,Paragraph
But his Transportation Building for the Chicago fair marked,Paragraph
the beginning of his unpopularity as an architect.,Paragraph
Mercantile classicism had been developing and gaining sLrength,Paragraph
"in New York since the eighties, but it won its country-wide",Paragraph
ascendency at the World’s Columbian Exhibition of 1893.77,Caption
The spirit behind it had now come to possess authority for,Paragraph
"American architecture as a whole.”* The Fair should, indeed,",Paragraph
have stood in New York; it so thoroughly represented the in-,Paragraph

enthusiasm of the city was set on its mettle; an aggressive,Paragraph

school; he did not carry over the use of the new materials —,Paragraph
the iron skeleton and the great glass surfaces of the office,Caption
buildings — into his own sphere: housing. Instead he was,Paragraph
rather conservative; in many respects he followed Richardson,Paragraph
"more than Sullivan. It was not until as late as the thirties,",Paragraph
when European architects were already utilizing the inherent,Paragraph
"possibilities of ferroconcrete to the fullest, that Wright, as he",Paragraph
"says himself, used it for the first time to any great extent for",Paragraph
one of his houses.*! This was duc not to any lack of technical,Paragraph
ability but to his own will and character.,Paragraph

by the generation which was responsible for the modern move-,Paragraph
"ment. In 1908 he was visited by Kuno Francke, then a German",Paragraph

What is the explanation of the fact that Wright is the only,Paragraph
"architect so far ahead of his own generation, a man who is even",Paragraph
today creating works that have a strong impact? The answer,Paragraph
is rather simple: he had less debris to clear away than the,Paragraph
"Europeans. He had been born in the Middle West, within the",Paragraph
shadow of the place possessing the greatest architectural vital-,Paragraph
ity of the period: Chicago.,Paragraph
From the outset Wright devoted himself to the problem which,Paragraph
was to be his life interest — the house as a shelter. He had at,Paragraph
"his disposal the anonymous American tradition, the example of",Paragraph
"Sullivan, and the conscious artistry which Richardson had",Paragraph
cultivated in home building. The secret of Wright’s work is,Paragraph
that he saw in the tradition of the American house those ele-,Paragraph
ments which could be used as a basis for the future. He takes,Paragraph
"these basic elements and adds new ones, enlarging — with all",Paragraph
the force of genius-— the structure of the house delivered to,Paragraph
him.,Paragraph
The objection may be advanced that the English had been,Paragraph
working on the problem of the dwelling house since 1860. But,Paragraph
the English at this time had no architects of the stature of,Paragraph
Sullivan or Richardson. Philip Webb and Norman Shaw are,Paragraph
not to be compared with the two Americans. The crux of the,Paragraph
difference between the English and American architects lies,Paragraph
in their point of departure: the Englishmen began with a re-,Paragraph

"Before I had seen any of Wright’s houses, I stopped once for a",Paragraph

"stone chimney which stood massively in its center, rising the",Paragraph
entire height from the ground up through the roof. The in-,Paragraph
"terior space was undivided, except for a partition which cut",Paragraph
"off the kitchen and the sleeping room. There was no ceiling,",Paragraph
but simply open rafters from which hung fox and bear skins.,Paragraph
At that moment I began to understand the way Wright con-,Paragraph
ceives his interior spaces. He works fundamentally and as far,Paragraph
as possible with the house as one room. Its inner space is dif-,Paragraph
"ferentiated to meet special needs. As he points out, he “ de-",Paragraph

"ous portions in the big room, for certain domestic purposes —",Paragraph
"like dining or reading, or receiving a formal caller.”’ 87",Paragraph
In organizing his plans Wright goes back to the seventeenth,Paragraph
century in the use of the Jarge chimney in the center of the,Paragraph
house as starting point for the whole layout. He spreads out,Paragraph
the different rooms from this massive kernel. What first im-,Paragraph
"pressed European architects was his “‘ windmill” plan, so",Paragraph
called because of the way the rooms were extended outward,Paragraph
from the center like the vanes of a windmill (fig. 189). This,Paragraph
"“windmill ” plan is really cruciform, an interpenetration of",Paragraph
"two parts of the house, which cut each other transversely to",Paragraph
form a cross. Often they are of different heights; then the,Paragraph
effect is of one crossbar superimposed upon and penetrating,Paragraph
the other.,Paragraph
This early American practice of using a central chimney as the,Paragraph
"core of the house, as the point about which the whole is or-",Paragraph
"ganized, was kept alive also through the nineteenth century",Paragraph
(fig. 187). Again we may cite as evidence one of those unknown,Paragraph
writers who reflect the common taste. In one of the small,Paragraph
popular books on suburban and country houses in the early,Paragraph
"seventies, there is proposed a country house built completely",Paragraph

Wright himself never abandoned the idea of the house spread,Paragraph
out from a central core. When in 1939 he built a low-cost four-,Paragraph

"193),°° he separated the different apartments by brick walls",Paragraph
crossing at right angles. At the central core he put not a chim-,Paragraph
"ney but all the utilities — plumbing, heating, electricity, and",Paragraph
ventilation — so that they were concentrated in the darkest,Paragraph
spot in the building.,Paragraph
"When it is possible, Wright likes to spread his structures out",Paragraph
freely over the ground. In the introduction to the study of his,Paragraph
"work published in Berlin in 1910, he points out that the first",Paragraph
floor was often built principally as a cellar. The main living,Paragraph
"quarters lie in the upper story on one floor, as in the Coonley",Paragraph
"house (1911), where only the entrance hall and the game room",Paragraph
"are on the ground floor; in Taliesin, his own house, they are",Paragraph
set into and connected with the ground. This led him to the,Paragraph
flexible and informal ground plan so deeply embedded in the,Paragraph
American architectural development from its beginning. As a,Paragraph
consequence of this development Wright now let the different,Paragraph
"rooms flow out horizontally, just as, in houses like the Isabel",Paragraph
"Roberts house, he had molded them vertically.",Paragraph
By 1910 Wright had achieved a flexibility of open planning,Paragraph
unapproached hitherto. In other countries at that time the,Paragraph
flexible ground plan and the flexibly molded interior and ex-,Paragraph
terior were almost unknown. Wright’s realization of a flexible,Paragraph
treatment of the inner space of a building is probably his,Paragraph

From the beginuing Wright treated the inner as well as the,Paragraph
outer wall as a plane surface. It never occurred to him to do,Paragraph
what European architects did about 1896 —- replace rococo,Paragraph

From the beginning Frank Lloyd Wright has faced toward an,Paragraph
organic perception of the world.,Paragraph
Wright’s whole career has been an endeavor to express himself,Paragraph
"in what he calls “ organic architecture,” whatever that may be.",Paragraph
fe likes to work within the shadow of this feeling. As recently,Paragraph
"as January 25, 1940, when he lectured in Jackson Hall, Boston,",Paragraph
he devoted his entire discussion to this problem of his life. He,Paragraph
"tried by a sort of Socratic dialogue, a give-and-take between",Paragraph
"himself and his audience, to define and explain it. But his",Paragraph
"effort was fulile. It was clear, finally, that no explanation was",Paragraph
"possible in words, that what he meant by organic architecture",Paragraph
could be revealed only in his work.,Paragraph
"Around 1900 Louis Sullivan, in his Kindergarten Chals,™ sought",Paragraph
to arrive at “ the true meaning of the words ‘ Organic Architec-,Paragraph

At the time when he was isolated in his profession and without,Paragraph

"even built houses in the folds of the earth, so that they seem to",Paragraph

"begins. There are also contemporary sculptors, like Hans Arp,",Paragraph
who would prefer to set their works in the midst of the forest,Paragraph
"so that, like a part of nature, they cannot be distinguished",Paragraph
from other stones.,Paragraph
This urge toward the organic may partly explain why Wright,Paragraph
"prefers to use materials taken directly from nature, rugged",Paragraph
"stone walls, rough granite floors, and heavy unfinished timbers.",Paragraph
Throughout his Chicago period he made no use of the skeleton,Paragraph
either of iron or ferroconercte; °° he is most reticent in the use,Paragraph
"of glass and of while, and so cautious with openings that it is",Paragraph
sometimes difficult even to find the entrance door. Likewise,Paragraph
his urge toward the organic accounts for his developing his,Paragraph
"flexible, open plan — in the age of central heating — from the",Paragraph
huge chimneys of the early colonial house.,Caption
The usual criticism of the houses of his Chicago period — the,Paragraph
"Martin house in Buffalo (1904), for example, and even the",Paragraph
Robie house (1908) — is that they are rather dark. They have,Paragraph

and its heavily glassed-in areas. In his houses and even his,Paragraph
administration buildings he seeks to make a spatial unit of the,Paragraph
"structure, but to seal it rather than to open it up.",Paragraph
Behind this cautiousness in the use of new materials and this,Paragraph

The Larkin Building stands a resolutely independent mass,Paragraph

Influence of Frank Lloyd Wright,Title
Frank Lloyd Wright is not only an architect. He belongs,Paragraph
among the great preachers of his country; he has by nature,Paragraph
"the will and the courage to protest, Lo revolt, and to persevere.",Paragraph
He carries on in architecture that tradition of sturdy individ-,Paragraph
ualism of which in the middle of the last century Walt Whit-,Paragraph
man and Henry Thoreau were the literary spokesmen. He,Paragraph
"regards this tradition as part of himself. As prophet, preacher,",Paragraph
"and agrarian individualist, he preaches hatred of the city and",Paragraph
"return to the soil and to the productive, self-sufficient. com-",Paragraph
munity — in a land where man’s relation to the soil is too often,Paragraph
"remote and impersonal; where at the same moment, according",Paragraph
"to the varying demands of the economic trend, forests are being",Paragraph
changed into farms and acres of growing grain changed hack,Title
into forests; where food to a great extent comes to the table,Paragraph
out of tins; and where now it is even being advocated that,Paragraph
tomatoes should be grown in water treated with chemical,Paragraph
salts.,Paragraph
"Frank Lloyd Wright belongs, in one sense of the word, to a",Paragraph
"sacrificed generation. When he began building, he had every",Paragraph
prospect of commercial success; he built more houses in his,Paragraph
early period than any of his European precursors. But what he,Paragraph
built was only for the individual client. Not that his houses —,Paragraph
all of them erected in the Middle West and the West '™* — are,Paragraph
"purely local, limited by the region and the personal tastes and",Paragraph
"requirements of the single client; like any work of art, they",Paragraph
embody something that overreaches all restrictions of place,Paragraph
and personal ownership. But they have had no influence on,Paragraph
the country; they have not become an impelling creative force.,Paragraph
The reason is that Wright began work at the very moment,Paragraph
when American archilecture was undermined by the most dan-,Paragraph
gerous reaction since the time of its origin. The classic and,Paragraph
Gothic fashions which in those years overwhelmed the con-,Paragraph
"stituent facts of American architecture had, of course, nothing",Paragraph

"skyscrapers in sacred Gothic shapes, these people could hide",Paragraph
their inner uncertainty. This had its deplorable consequences,Paragraph
or the business of architecture. The architect who wished to,Paragraph
live by his profession had to conform to the vogue or give up.,Paragraph
"During this dominance of classic and Gothic imitations, which",Paragraph

and Louis Sullivan had to live almost as exiles in their own,Paragraph

"In this period he and Sullivan became, in the eyes of their",Paragraph

"the country which had lost, for later on it was the country, and",Paragraph

the definitive publication of his buildings appeared in Berlin,Paragraph

Whoever as an architect has Lricd to imitate or even to follow,Paragraph

"Wright’s direct influence is his significance as an index, as a",Paragraph
"sort of signpost of new directions, for no equivalent could be",Paragraph
found for his work in Europe between 1900 and 1910.,Paragraph
After 1910 the best brains of Europe began to understand what,Paragraph

introduced Wright’s work extensively into Europe through his,Paragraph
own exhibitions and lectures. By his moral authority he en-,Paragraph
sured the next Dutch generation a stimulus to their own devel-,Paragraph
opment.'* The Dutch people were best prepared to receive,Paragraph
help from Wright’s impulse. In this connection we are not,Paragraph
"thinking so much of the work of Dudok in Hilversum, who in",Paragraph
the early twenties had a great success with his sentimentalized,Paragraph
"buildings, but rather with such a sensitive and fine-spiriled",Paragraph
"architect as Robert van t’ Hoff, who built two massive concrete",Paragraph
"houses at Huisterheide in 1914-15. These houses, the only",Paragraph
"ones van tHoff ever built, were a direct reflection of Wright's",Paragraph

nevertheless they performed a clarifying function there. They,Paragraph
were made known to the European advance guard in 1919 by,Paragraph
"an article of Theo van Doesburg in his review, Style.",Paragraph
"In the early work of several Dutch architects, and also in some",Paragraph
"projects of J. J. P. Oud, it was undoubtedly the stimulus that",Paragraph

"ance; science and industry made steady advances, but in the",Paragraph
now detached realm of feeling there was nothing but a vacil-,Paragraph
lation from one extreme to the other.,Paragraph
The scope and strength of the emotions are both greater than,Paragraph
we sometimes suppose. Emotion or feeling enters into all our,Paragraph
"affairs — speculation is never completely “‘ pure,” just as",Paragraph
"action is never entirely practical. And, of course, we are far",Paragraph
from having free choice in this matter of feeling. Large tracts,Paragraph
of our emotional life are determined by circumstances over,Paragraph
which we have no control: by the fact that we happen to be,Paragraph
"men, of such or such a kind, living at this or that period. Thus",Paragraph
a thoroughly integrated culture produces a marked unity of,Paragraph
"feeling among its representatives. For example, a recognizable",Paragraph
common spirit runs through the whole baroque period. It,Paragraph
makes itself felt in activities as distinct from each other as,Paragraph
painting and philosophy or architecture and mathematics.,Paragraph
"This is not particularly surprising. Techniques, sciences, the",Paragraph
arts — all these are carried on by men who have grown up,Paragraph
"together in the same period, exposed to its characteristic in-",Paragraph
fluences. The feelings which it is the special concern of the,Paragraph
artist to express are also at work within the engineer and the,Paragraph
mathematician. This emotional background shared by such,Paragraph
otherwise divergent pursuits is what we must try to discover.,Paragraph
Do We Need Artists?,Title
Some people question whether any pervasive unity of feeling is,Paragraph
possible in a period like ours. They regard science and industry,Paragraph
"as inimical to art and feeling: where the former prosper, the",Paragraph
"latter decline. Or they see science taking over the arts, opening",Paragraph
up new means of self-expression which make us independent of,Paragraph
them. There is some basis for views like these. It is obvious,Paragraph
that the serious artist plays no very important role in con-,Paragraph
temporary life — usually he cannot even make a living by his,Paragraph
"work. At the same time, this civilization is too intimately a",Paragraph
"part of us to be simply abandoned. Do we, then, really need",Paragraph
artists any longer?,Title
"In any civilization, feeling continues to filter through every",Paragraph
activity and situation. An environment whose chief aspects,Paragraph
remain opaque to feeling is as unsatisfying as one which resists,Paragraph
practical or intellectual control. But just this sort of emotional,Paragraph
frustration has prevailed for a long time past. An official art,Paragraph
has turned its back upon the contemporary world and given up,Paragraph
the attempt to interpret it emotionally. The feelings which,Paragraph
"that world elicits have remained formless, have never met with",Paragraph
those objects which are at once their symbols and their satis-,Paragraph
faction.,Paragraph
"Such symbols, however, are vital necessities. Feelings build",Paragraph
up within us and form systems; they cannot be discharged,Paragraph
through instantaneous animal outcries or grimaces. We need,Paragraph
to discover harmonies between our own inner states and our,Paragraph
surroundings. And no level of development can be maintained,Paragraph
if it remains detached from our emotional life. The whole,Paragraph
machinery runs down.,Paragraph
This is the reason why the most familiar and ordinary things,Paragraph
have importance for the genuinely creative artists of our gen-,Paragraph
"eration. Painters like Picasso, Juan Gris, the lyricist. of cub-",Paragraph
"ism, and Le Corbusier have devoted themselves to the common",Paragraph
"objects of daily use: bowls, pipes, bottles, glasses, guitars.",Paragraph
Natural materials have received the same attention: stones,Paragraph
"holNowed out by the sea, roots, bits of bark — even weather-",Paragraph
bleached bones. Anonymous and unpretentious things like,Paragraph
"these scarcely figure at all in our normal consciousness, but",Paragraph
they attain their true stature and significance under the artist’s,Paragraph
"hand. They become revealed as objets & réaction poéliques, to",Paragraph
"borrow Le Corbusier’s phrase. Or, to put it somewhat dif-",Paragraph
"ferently, new parts of the world are made accessible to feeling.",Paragraph
The opening up of such new realms of feeling has always been,Paragraph
the artist’s chicf mission. A great deal of our world would lack,Paragraph
all emotional significance if it were not for his work. As re-,Paragraph
"cently as the eighteenth century, mountain scenery was felt to",Paragraph
exhibit nothing except a formless and alarming confusion.,Paragraph

on. Right now there are great areas of our experience which,Paragraph

THE RESEARCH INTO SPACE: CUBISM,Title
"In many places, about 1910, a consciousness thal the painter’s",Paragraph
means of expression had lost contact with modern life was,Paragraph
"beginning to emerge. But it was in Paris, with cubism, that",Paragraph
these efforts first attained a visible result. The method of,Paragraph
presenting spatial relationships which the cubists developed,Paragraph
has furnished the plastic principles of present-day visual,Paragraph
approach.!,Paragraph
The half-century previous to the rise of cubism had seen paint-,Paragraph
ing flourish almost nowhere outside of France. It was the high,Paragraph
cullure of painting that grew up in France during this period,Paragraph
which formed the fostering soil for our contemporary art.,Paragraph
"Young people of talent — whether Spanish like Picasso, or",Paragraph
"Swiss like Le Corbusier — found their inspiration in Paris, in",Paragraph
the union of their powers with the artistic tradition of that,Paragraph
city. The vitality of French culture served to the advantage of,Paragraph
"the whole world. Among the general public, however, there",Paragraph
was no sympathetic response to this achievement. It was from,Paragraph
a form of art which the public despised that nineteenth-century,Paragraph
"painting drew its positive strength. Cubism, growing up in",Paragraph
"this soil, absorbed all its vigor.",Paragraph
"Picasso has been called the inventor of cubism, but cubism",Paragraph
is not the invention of any individual. It is rather the expres-,Paragraph
sion of a collective and almost unconscious attitude. A painter,Paragraph
who participated in the movement says of its beginnings:,Paragraph
"“ There was no invention. Still more, there could not be one.",Paragraph
Soon it was twitching in everybody’s fingers. There was a,Paragraph
"presentiment of what should come, and experiments were made.",Paragraph
We avoided one another; a discovery was on the point of being,Paragraph
‘We shall treat contemporary movements in act here only so far as their methods are,Paragraph
"directly related to the space conceptions of our period, and in order to understand the",Paragraph
"common background of art, architecture, and construction. For an understanding of",Paragraph
"these movements the elaborate catalogues of the Museum of Modern Art, New York,",Paragraph
"are very useful. Cf. Alfred UH. Barr, Jr., Cubism and Abstract Art (New York, 1936),",Paragraph

From the Renaissance to the first decade of the present cen-,Paragraph
tury perspective had been one of the most important constit-,Paragraph
uent facts in painting. It had remained a constant element,Paragraph
through all changes of style. The four-century-old habit of,Paragraph
"secing the outer world in the Renaissance manner — that is,",Paragraph
in terms of three dimensions — rooted itself so deeply in the,Paragraph
human mind that no other form of perception could be imag-,Paragraph
ined. This in spite of the fact that the art of different previous,Paragraph
cultures had been two-dimensional. When earlier periods es-,Paragraph
tablished perspective as a constituent fact they were always,Paragraph
able to find new expressions for it. In the nineteenth century,Paragraph
perspective was misused. This led to its dissolution.,Paragraph
The three-dimensional space of the Renaissance is the space,Paragraph
of Euclidean geometry. But about 1830 a new sort of geometry,Paragraph
"was created, one which differed from that of Euclid in employ-",Paragraph
ing more than three dimensions. Such geometries have con-,Paragraph
"tinued to be developed, until now a stage has been reached",Paragraph
where mathematicians deal with figures and dimensions that,Paragraph
cannot be grasped by the imagination.,Paragraph
These considerations interest us only in so far as they affect,Paragraph
"the sense of space. Like the scientist, the artist has come to",Paragraph
recognize that classic conceptions of space and volumes are,Paragraph
"limited and one-sided. In particular, it has become plain that",Paragraph
the aesthetic qualities of space are not limited to its infinity,Paragraph
"for sight, as in the gardens of Versailles. The essence of space",Paragraph
"as it is conceived today is ils many-sidedness, the infinite poten-",Paragraph
tiality for relations within it. Exhaustive description of an,Paragraph
"area from one point of reference is, accordingly, impossible; its",Paragraph
characler changes with the point from which it is viewed. In,Paragraph
order to grasp the true nature of space the observer must pro-,Paragraph
ject himself through it. The stairways in the upper levels of,Paragraph
the Eiffel Tower are among the earliest architectural cxpres-,Paragraph
sion of the continuous interpenetration of outer and inner,Paragraph
space.,Paragraph
Space in modern physics is conceived of as relative to a moving,Paragraph
"point of reference, not as the absolute and static entity of the",Paragraph
"baroque system of Newton. And in modern art, for the first",Paragraph
"time since the Renaissance, a new conception of space leads to",Paragraph
a self-conscious enlargement of our ways of perceiving space.,Paragraph
It was in cubism that this was most fully achieved.,Paragraph
The cubists did not seek to reproduce the appearance of objects,Paragraph
"from one vantage point; they went round them, tried to lay",Paragraph
hold of their internal constilution. They sought to extend the,Paragraph
"scale of feeling, just as contemporary science extends its de-",Paragraph
scriptions to cover new levels of material phenomena.,Paragraph
Cubism breaks with Renaissance perspective. It views objects,Paragraph
"relatively: that is, from several points of view, no one of which",Paragraph
has exclusive authority. And in so dissecting objects il sees,Paragraph
"them simultaneously from all sides — from above and below,",Paragraph
from inside and outside. It goes around and into its objects.,Paragraph
"Thus, to the three dimensions of the Renaissance which have",Paragraph
"held good as constituent facls throughout so many centuries,",Paragraph
there is added a fourth one—time. The poet Guillaume,Paragraph
"Apollinaire was the first to recognize and express this change,",Paragraph
around 1911. The same year saw the first cubist exhibition in,Paragraph
the Salon des Indépendants. Considering the history of the,Paragraph
"principles from which they broke, it can well be understood",Paragraph
that the paintings should have been thought a menace to the,Paragraph
"public peace, and have become the subject of remarks in the",Paragraph
Chamber of Deputies.,Paragraph
The presentation of objects from several points of view intro-,Title
duces a principle which is intimatcly bound up with modern,Paragraph

"proach, of a new spatial representation, and the means by",Paragraph
which it is attained.,Paragraph
This new representation of space was accomplished step by,Paragraph

"in realistic position, are in fundamental contrast to the lines of",Paragraph
"perspective, which converge to a single focal point.",Paragraph

Color no longer had the exclusive function of naturalistic,Paragraph

Cubism originated among artists belonging to the oldest cul-,Paragraph

was nourished by the elements of bygone periods. Its symbols,Paragraph

to artistic imagination in other fields. Following upon the first,Paragraph

"Common to them was an attempt to rationalize cubism or, as",Paragraph

"cedure was sometimes very different in different groups, but all",Paragraph
moved toward rationalization and into architecture.,Paragraph
When Ozenfant and Jeanneret (Le Corbusier) came together,Paragraph
"as young painters in 1917, they called their painting Purisme",Paragraph
(fig. 232). In comparison with the movements preceding it,Paragraph
"(constructivism in Russia or neo-plasticism in Holland), pur-",Paragraph
"ism, coming out of French soil, was the closest of all to the aim",Paragraph

Two years after the exhibition of the cubists in the Salon des,Paragraph

eliminated the object. It was a flight from and a protest,Paragraph

fundamentally only pure interrelationships. Flatly extended,Paragraph

for which there is no true human measure.,Paragraph
"Interrelation, hovering, and penetration form the basis of",Paragraph
"Malewitsch’s half-plastic architectural studies, which he calls",Paragraph

The small circle of young artists who gathered around Theo van,Paragraph

THE RESEARCH INTO MOVEMENT: FUTURISM,Title
In the first decade of this century the physical sciences were,Paragraph
"profoundly shaken by an inner change, the most revolutionary",Paragraph
"perhaps since Aristotle and the Pythagoreans. It concerned,",Paragraph
"above all, the notion of time. Previously time had been re-",Paragraph

"going on and existing without an observer, independent of the",Paragraph
existence of other objects and without any necessary relation,Paragraph
"to other phenomena; or subjectively, as something having no",Paragraph
existence apart from an observer and present only in sense,Paragraph
experience. Now came another and new way of regarding,Paragraph
"time, one involving implications of the greatest significance,",Paragraph
the consequences of which cannot today be minimized or,Paragraph
ignored.,Paragraph
"As was stated at the beginning of this book, it was in 1908",Paragraph
"that Hermann Minkowski, the great mathematician, speaking",Paragraph

"change of conception. ‘‘ Henceforth,” he said, “ space alone",Paragraph
or time alone is doomed to fade into a mere shadow; only a,Paragraph
kind of union of both will preserve their existence.”,Paragraph
Concurrently the arts were concerned with the same problem.,Paragraph
"Artistic movements with inherent constituent facts, such as",Paragraph
"cubism and futurism, tried to enlarge our optical vision by",Paragraph
introducing the new unit of space-time into the language of,Paragraph

In the early days of reinforced concrete the same methods of,Paragraph
construction were used as were employed with timber and iron.,Paragraph
"Timber, being the trunks of trees, has length, just as iron has",Paragraph
when rolled into long girders. One dimension always domi-,Paragraph
"nates, which is the one that transmils the load. As Maillart",Paragraph
himself puts it: * The engineer was so accustomed to using those,Paragraph
basic materials which provide only one-dimensional support,Paragraph
"that they became second nature to him, and restrained him",Paragraph
from exploiting other possibilities. This was the state of affairs,Paragraph
"when reinforced concrete was introduced, and at first no",Paragraph

Maillart was a pupil of Hennebique;’ and Hennebique’s rein-,Paragraph

"Like all great constructors, he has consistently followed a single",Paragraph
line of thought which he has progressively developed and ex-,Paragraph
panded in the course of his career.,Paragraph
In designing a bridge Maillart began by eliminating ali that,Paragraph
was nonfunctional; thus everything that remained was an im-,Paragraph
mediate part of its structure. He did this by improving the,Paragraph
reinforced concrete slab until he had turned it mto a new,Paragraph
structural element. What Maillart has achieved since then is,Paragraph
based on one idea: that it is possible to reinforce a flat or,Paragraph
curved concrete slab in such a manner as to dispense with the,Paragraph
need for beams in flooring or solid arches in bridges. It is very,Paragraph
difficult to determine the forces present in slabs of this nature,Paragraph
by calculation alone. To obtain positive results entailed a,Paragraph

Maillart had embodied this principle in a bridge as early as,Paragraph

"his construction of all disguise. The Tavanasa bridge (span,",Paragraph

A bridge is like a house. Each bridge and cach house is a,Paragraph

"As we have seen, Maillart conceived different systems for the",Paragraph

more beautifully realized than in the curved Schwandbach-,Paragraph
"Briicke (figs. 214, 215) led to almost eggshell-thin members,",Paragraph
"Unfortunately, none of his later projects employing the stif-",Paragraph

"constructions, the least verifiable by calculation and the most",Paragraph
opposed to the ruling taste.,Paragraph
Another system which he used for narrow and long spans,Paragraph
with heavy loads is based on the principle of the continuous,Paragraph
beam. This he further enhanced by hollowing out the heavy,Paragraph
structure so that it gave an aspect of astonishing lightness. He,Paragraph
built several very interesting smaller bridges in this way (for,Paragraph
"instance, the oblique river crossing at Giindlischwand, Berner",Paragraph
"Oberland, 1937) but reached highest perfection in the bridge",Paragraph
over the Rhone at Aire-la-Ville-Peney in 1937. Here the,Paragraph
slablike columm supports merge with the platform and the,Paragraph
"arches, which seem to be imbued with the elasticity of a steel",Paragraph

was never executed. A jury incapable of judgment rejected it.,Paragraph
"From his-early beginnings — about 1901 — to his last bridges,",Paragraph

1905 Cfig. 213a) was the first conceived out of a pure form.,Paragraph
The Salginatobel Bridge built in 1929-30 (fig. 213b) uses this,Paragraph

This early indifference to the machine and the factory followed,Paragraph

There was nothing that resembled William Morris’ work in,Paragraph

About 1900 there was another sudden change in Germany of,Paragraph
quite a different kind. In the seventies there had been a great,Paragraph

Henri van de Velde was invited to exhibit there in 1897 and,Paragraph

Walter Gropius,Title
Walter Gropius entered upon his career in the Germany of the,Paragraph
Werkbund period. After finishing his studies he worked in the,Paragraph

Behrens was engaged on the turbine plant of the General Elec-,Paragraph

which helped to crystallize his ideas “ as to what the essential,Paragraph

"should take part in the building that went on in the twenties,",Paragraph
when Germany sect oul to make up its shortage of middle- and,Paragraph
working-class dwellings. Gropius built a large number of such,Paragraph

work in this field was a scheme for a government institute for,Paragraph

The fact thal so many of his works — even those of his youth,Paragraph
— have retained all their original freshness is evidence of,Paragraph
Gropius’ creative force. This holds true not only for his,Paragraph
"archilectural productions — the Fagus works, for example",Paragraph
but for his work in other fields as well. Gropius designed a,Paragraph

The spirit of Le Corbusier’s houses shows an absolute identity,Paragraph
with the spirit that animates modern painting. The floating,Paragraph

teclure Comes to the Front,Title
The 1927 international competition for the League of Nations,Title
Palace at Geneva is one of the most illuminating episodes in,Paragraph
the history of contemporary architecture. For the first time,Paragraph
present-day architects challenged the routine of the Academy,Paragraph
"ina field which it had dominated for generations, the design of",Paragraph
monumentally impressive state buildings. The Academy won,Paragraph
"this particular engagement, but its victory injured the prestige",Paragraph
of its methods.,Paragraph
The conventional routines showed themselves incapable of,Paragraph
producing architectonic solutions to problems of modern,Paragraph
organization. The proof of that helplessness did much to,Paragraph
break down popular resistance to modern treatments.,Paragraph
"It was plain from the start that, among the 337 projects sub-",Paragraph
"mitted, one — the work of Le Corbusier and Pierre Jcanneret",Paragraph
-— was peculiarly important and significant. Later develop-,Paragraph
ments verified this first judgment.,Paragraph
What made it important? It unexpectedly forced high officials,Paragraph
from everywhere in Europe to consider seriously a kind of,Paragraph
architecture which they had always dismissed as aesthetic,Paragraph
trifling. For decades there had been an established style for,Paragraph
the stately official building — an international style that,Paragraph
hardly varied from country to country. Custom had made its,Paragraph
"validity seem guaranteed for all time, and the official element",Paragraph
automatically turned to it when the matter of their Geneva,Paragraph
"setting came up. The scheme that came to the forefront, how-",Paragraph
"ever, shockingly disregarded the stylistic approach in order to",Paragraph
"tackle, quite openly, the specific problems which the building",Paragraph
raised.,Paragraph
The idea of a league of nations is one which we encounter time,Paragraph
"and again in history. Its realization, however — the actual",Paragraph
establishment of a neutral center where representatives of,Paragraph
every country might meet to maintain the equilibrium of the,Paragraph
world — was a completely new thing and brought a highly,Paragraph
complex institution into being. [ts varied functions required a,Paragraph
"division of its headquarters into three main parts: a secretariat,",Paragraph
where the daily work of its administration could be carried on;,Paragraph
amecting place for committees of various sorts whose sessions,Paragraph
occurred intermittently (the Conseil and the Grandes Commis.,Paragraph

into the whole complex.,Paragraph

ence as the determining factors. It had to be possible to hear,Paragraph
"and see perfectly from every one of its seats. To eusure this,",Paragraph
the ceiling was given a nearly parabolic curvature. This was,Paragraph
"on the advice of the specialist, Gustave Lyon.* But the ceiling",Caption
is not simply introduced into the design as an acoustical aid:,Paragraph
it is taken up into and influences the whole form of the hall.,Paragraph
Le Corbusier conyerts what was offered simply as a technical,Paragraph
expedient into aesthelic means.,Paragraph
In the treatment of the ceiling Le Corbusier unconsciously,Paragraph
followed the example of earlier men. Thus Davioud in the,Paragraph
seventies used a parabolic ceiling in a project for a theater of a,Paragraph
capacity of five thousand. The Adler and Sullivan Auditorium,Caption
of 1887 in Chicago — the finest assembly hall of its period --,Paragraph
"is similarly modeled by considerations of acoustics, but to an",Paragraph
even greater extent than in the Grande Salle at Geneva.,Paragraph
Le Corbusier’s plans show a thoroughly considered treatment,Paragraph
of the traffic problem. The problem was acute when the,Paragraph
"General Assembly was in session, and it had to be possible to",Paragraph
move great streams of cars in short order. The rear entrance,Caption
of the Assembly Building accordingly took its form from an,Paragraph
everyday solution to the same difficulty — the sheltered rail-,Paragraph
way platform set between two transit lines (fig. 240). But once,Paragraph
again a purely utililarian development is transmuted into an,Paragraph
expressive means.,Paragraph
34 Lyon had already constructed the Salle Pleyel at Paris. Le Corbusier’s hall was de-,Paragraph
signed before the loud-speaker cate into use and simplified the problem of hearing.,Paragraph
"Such methods may be called for again in the future, however. We can reasonably expect",Paragraph
a revived demand on the part of the public for the natural tones of the human voice.,Paragraph
unaltered by electrical transmission.,Paragraph
Ju the requirements of the Secretariat simply as an office,Paragraph
"building, in the need for making it possible to hear from every",Paragraph
"bench in the Grand Salle, in the traffic problems that arose",Paragraph
"al general sessions—in the needs of contemporary life, that",Paragraph
is — Le Corbusier and Jeanneret found incentives to artistic,Paragraph
creation.,Paragraph
But it was exactly those requirements which proved stum-,Paragraph
bling blocks to the architects who adopted the familiar monu-,Paragraph
mental routine. As a consequence there is no need to consider,Paragraph
"which of these composilions was, ag a whole, the best — for",Paragraph
all alike were incapable of functioning. The requirements of a,Paragraph
complex new social organism like the League of Nations could,Paragraph
not be met by schemes whose general outline was determined in,Paragraph
cailyance by the need for a certain type of impressive external,Paragraph
appearance. Everything was smothered by the ostentatious,Paragraph
"exterior of the building, as impossible here as plate armor for",Paragraph
a man driving a car. And an architecture which cannot,Paragraph
mold itself to the essential needs of its own time has lost its,Paragraph
vital force.,Paragraph
The conventionally monumental schemes broke down in an-,Paragraph
"other respect. AU Versailles, where a great building complex",Paragraph
"was first juxtaposed to nature, unlimited space was available,",Paragraph
and the absolute will behind this endeavor stamped ils own,Paragraph
imyprint upon the surrounding landscape. At Geneva the site,Paragraph
"was strictly limited. Moreover, in this period we no longer",Paragraph

bring it and our buildings into harmonious unity. This the,Paragraph
academic schemes were unable to do; they found no way of,Paragraph
"avoiding extensive terracing of the site, which destroved its",Paragraph
natural contours and left the huge bulk of the Palace perched,Paragraph
upon a ridiculously small pediment of lawn.,Paragraph
The Le Corbusier -Jeanneret project would have preserved the,Paragraph

The pavilion of the Swiss dormitory is one of Le Corbusier's,Paragraph

"slabs (figs. 242, 243) 3",Caption

own preference. To avoid the impression of endless rows of,Paragraph
"patients, small partition walls have been introduced so that",Paragraph
the patients can be divided up into these small groups (fig.,Paragraph
245h). The top floor is used as a rest hall and runs the whole,Paragraph
length of the building (fig. 245f). At the point where the,Paragraph
"main building and the rest hall intersect, Aalto links them",Paragraph
together by giving the shelter an undulating curve. From the,Paragraph
lounge chairs one can look into the tops of near-by fir trees and,Paragraph

"trees in tubs along the balconies, to soften Lhe concrete planes,",Paragraph
"When I saw them, in the autumn of 1918. they looked strong",Paragraph

The Undulating Wall,Title
One of the few buildings in which Aalto could freely express,Paragraph
"himself was the Viipuri Library, built with difficulty between",Paragraph
1927 and 1934. It was damaged in the first Russo-Finnish,Paragraph
war and almost razed to the ground in the following conflict.,Paragraph
"It consisted of the library proper, which had carefully con-",Paragraph
"structed circular overhead lights, and an unusually shaped",Paragraph
lecture hall with a spacious connecting vestibule.’,Paragraph
Aalto’s treatment of the undulating wooden ceiling of the,Paragraph
lecture hall is of great historical importance. The architect,Paragraph

hall.,Paragraph
today appears nowhere so hesitant as in the region of the,Paragraph
"ceiling, above the reach of everyday functions. Ilere, to a",Caption
"large extent, is a freedom of opportunity to excite the plastic",Paragraph
imagination of an artist. The solution of the problem of,Paragraph
spanning space has always been an indication of the crealive-,Paragraph
ness of a period.,Paragraph
"*For a complete description see Alfred Roth, The New Architecture (Zurich, 1940),",Caption
"pp. 181-194,",Caption
"Alvar Aalto is, like Le Corbusier, one of the few architects",Paragraph
who in our times has tried anew to attack the vaulting problem,Paragraph
in a way peculiar to this period.* In the intimate hall of the,Caption
Viipuri Library the irrational curves of the ceiling glide,Title
through space like the serpentine lines of a Miro painting,Paragraph
"(fig. 2455). From the floor behind the speaker, narrow strips",Caption
"of redwood sweep upward, curving irrationally along the glass",Paragraph
"wall. Of course, the architect himself can prove, with metic-",Paragraph
"ulous acoustic diagrams, that the undulating form he gave the",Paragraph
ceiling enables sound to reach the human ear more perfectly.,Paragraph
"Here, therefore, scientific reasoning and artistic imagination",Paragraph
have merged to free architecture from that rigidity which is,Paragraph
today an ever present menace.,Paragraph
Aalto treated the walls of his Finnish Pavilion with even,Paragraph
greater freedom. This was without doubt the most daring,Paragraph
piece of architecture in the New York World’s Fair of 1939:,Caption
an inclined wooden screen three stories high embraces the,Paragraph
interior space in a freely drawn curve. The screen consists of,Paragraph
"three sections,*each cantilevered over the other; at the same",Paragraph
"time the whole structure leans forward, intensifying thereby",Paragraph
the impression of continuous movement. A series of vertical,Paragraph
ribs and the rhythm of their changing shadows animate the,Paragraph
surface of the huge screen (fig. 245k).,Caption
Each detail has a well-reasoned explanation. In the tech-,Paragraph
"nique of poster display, the undulating surface provides more",Paragraph
space for large photographs; the forward tilting brings the,Paragraph
uppermost pictures closer to the angle of vision; the series of,Paragraph
vertical ribs thrust the photographs forward; the cantilever of,Paragraph
"the upper stories, which so intensifies the impression of hov-",Paragraph
"ering movement, provides room for a concentrated display",Paragraph
of objects.,Paragraph

though we ourselves are perhaps not even quite sure what-a,Paragraph

uation: that our imagination begins to freeze as soon as,Paragraph
problems of integration are involved.,Paragraph
What is Aalto’s contribution in the field of town planning?,Paragraph
We can only touch on a few points here. The same qualities,Paragraph
which enliven his buildings are even more obvious in his plan-,Paragraph
ping schemes. With the same freedom that he has employed,Paragraph
"to loosen up the structure of walls and ceilings, he loosens up",Paragraph
the rigid framework of the human settlement. Rows of,Paragraph
houses scattered in all directions seem to have been strewn,Paragraph
"by the wind, and yet they are held together by an invisible",Paragraph
"force, like filings in a magnetic field.",Paragraph
"In the layout of Sunila, 1937-39 (fig. 245t), Alvar Aalto’s",Paragraph
approach to town planning is already manifest. ‘The whole,Paragraph
sequence of his later schemes will reflect the same principles.,Paragraph
These may be briefly described as establishing an equipoise,Paragraph
between the primary demands for a human environment: an,Paragraph
"equipoise between the living area, the center of production,",Paragraph
and nature.,Paragraph
"To secure the right of the individual to privacy, to a simple",Paragraph
"community life, and to the most intimate contact with the",Paragraph
earth is today the preoccupation of every planner. This aim,Paragraph
is no longer original. Today these demands have become a,Paragraph
matter of course. What is still lacking is their realization.,Paragraph
"We will not easily find, as early as 1937, many achievements",Paragraph
"like Sunila, where both the production area and the living",Paragraph
area have been conceived in such a way that each has been,Paragraph
given its necessary rights without disturbing the other. The,Paragraph
grasp of a town planner can be felt in the layout of one-family,Paragraph
houses upon the narrowest strip of the available Jand; in the,Paragraph
grouping of row houses freely in the forest; in the slight varia-,Paragraph
"tions of the engineers’ row houses, which lie nearer to the",Paragraph
"waterfront and are arranged in a slight curve, to ensure the",Paragraph
utmost privacy for each dwelling. It goes without saying that,Paragraph
the necessary social facilities (especially several saunas —,Paragraph
communal bathing houses) are located at strategic intervals.,Paragraph

The Human Side,Title
One cannot speak about Aalto the architect without speaking,Paragraph
about Aalto the man. People are at least as important to him,Paragraph
"as architecture. Aalto is interested in every human being, in",Paragraph
"each of their particular desires and experiences, no matter",Paragraph
where they come from or to what social class they belong. He,Paragraph
draws incentive and stimulation from contact with men of,Paragraph
"varied callings, much as James Joyce did. Indeed, Aalto can-",Paragraph
not set foot outside his door without becoming involved in,Paragraph
some human episode. He approaches people directly and,Paragraph
"without inhibitions, in the same way that he approaches the",Paragraph
organic material wood.,Paragraph
"When Aalto first appeared, unknown to the rest of us, within",Paragraph
"the circle of the newly formed CIAM, in Frankfurt in 1929,",Paragraph
he did not talk about his buildings but instead told us of a,Paragraph
delicate adventure that had befallen him at nine o’clock that,Paragraph
"morning, on his way from the station to the hotel. In 1933,",Paragraph
when he was traveling from Finland to the Athens Congress,Paragraph

architecture has traditionally been decked with pseudo-,Paragraph
gothic or colonial forms.,Paragraph
Aalto’s relationship with man in his completeness cannot be,Paragraph

"life. However, immediately he appears, his tales, flavored by",Paragraph
"a whimsical understanding of human situations, and the",Paragraph
"radiance of his whole being, make it seem as though he had",Paragraph
only left the day before.,Paragraph
There are certain architecls whose work develops almost of,Paragraph
itself. Aalto’s work is of a different kind. Each line tells of,Paragraph
his close contact with human destiny. This may be one of the,Paragraph
reasons why his architecture encounters less difficulty in,Paragraph
overcoming the resistance of the common man than that of,Paragraph
others of his contemporaries.,Paragraph

THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONTEMPORARY,Title
ARCHITECTURE,Title
It would be a complete misunderstanding to suppose that con-,Paragraph
temporary architecture has been evolved by a few isolated,Paragraph
"geniuses. Vigorous artists, creative spirits strong enough to",Paragraph
"push beyond the dominant conventions — without these, of",Paragraph
"course, nothing could have been achieved. But contemporary",Paragraph
architecture is no longer dependent upon a few individuals; it,Paragraph
has its roots deep in the life of our day. It grows more and,Paragraph
more anonymous; innumerable workers in every part of the,Paragraph
world contribute to its nourishment and progress.,Paragraph
"The emphasis falls increasingly upon solutions, rather than",Paragraph
upon the individual architect. This is the difference between,Paragraph
the generation of the pioneers and the generation that has come,Title
"afler them. Individual crealive work remains necessary, but",Paragraph
the complicated problems which have to be solved (along with,Paragraph
a growing unity of expression) are leading to more and more,Paragraph
collaborative work. Architects are collaborating not only,Paragraph
wilh other architects but also with specialists of every de-,Paragraph
"scription — landscape gardeners, physicians, statisticians, and",Paragraph
many others.,Paragraph
This inspired a new collectivity and united the leading archi-,Paragraph
tects of many countries in the CIAM (the Congrés interna-,Paragraph
tionaux d’architecture moderne)... The CIAM sets itself to,Paragraph
analyze and work out problems which no solitary worker could,Paragraph
handle. It dealt first with the problem of dwellings for the,Paragraph
"lower income classes (Frankfort, in 1929), went on to the",Paragraph
"treatment of block units (Brussels, 1930), and then to town",Paragraph
"planning (Athens, 1933).",Paragraph
The principles governing the attack upon these problems were,Paragraph
always the same. To gain a universal insight into actual facts,Paragraph
"and conditions, groups in various countries carried out careful",Paragraph
"analyses. The same methods were used by each group, the",Paragraph
"same modes of representation, the same scale. Low-cost",Paragraph
"* June 1928, at the instigation of Mme Héléne de Mandrot de la Sarraz, who offered",Paragraph
the association every possible help and made available the old Chateau de la Sarraz for,Paragraph
its first meeting.,Paragraph
"housing, block units, and town layouts were studied in Europe",Paragraph
and elsewhere.,Paragraph
Architecture has ceased to be the concern of passive and busi-,Paragraph
nesslike specialists who build precisely what their clients bar-,Paragraph
gain for. Architecture has cast off this passivity; it has gained,Paragraph
"the courage to deal actively with life, to help mold it. It starts",Paragraph
"with intimately vital questions, inquiring into the needs of",Paragraph
"the child, the woman, and the man. It asks, “What kind of",Paragraph
life are you leading? Are we responsible for the conditions you,Paragraph
have to put up with? How must we plan — not just in the,Paragraph
"case of houses, but clear through to regional areas — so that",Paragraph
you may have a life worthy of the name? ”,Paragraph
"When we go to the bottom of questions like these, we see that",Paragraph
contemporary architecture takes its start in a moral problem.,Paragraph
Architecture has emerged from the realm of narrow specializa-,Paragraph
tion to plunge into the realities of ordinary life. And by taking,Paragraph
"off his specialist’s blinders, the architect has greatly extended",Paragraph
his influence. Architecture is a highly complex activity; it,Paragraph
works in the boundary area halfway between the regions of,Paragraph
aesthetic feeling and practical doing. But this is just the reason,Paragraph
why we look to it to give us the kind of surroundings that will,Paragraph
express the life of our period.,Paragraph
Modern painters have enlarged our visual experience by work-,Paragraph
ing with relations between objects which we had never taken,Paragraph
"cognizance of in our ordinary, half-automatic seeing. Con-",Paragraph
temporary architects have been just as willing to anticipate,Paragraph
public understanding. They too have refused to wait until,Paragraph
they could be sure of universal approbation for their work.,Paragraph
"Following an impulse which was half ethical, half artistic,",Paragraph
they have sought to provide our life with its corresponding,Paragraph
shell or framework. And where contemporary architecture,Paragraph
has been allowed to provide a new setting for contemporary,Paragraph
"life, this new setting has acted in its turn upon the life from",Paragraph
which it springs. The new atmosphere has led to change and,Paragraph
development in the conceptions of the people who live in it.,Paragraph
This is understandable enough if we regard architecture as,Paragraph
"Louis Aragon does painting: as a language, and not as a mere",Paragraph
matter of taste.,Paragraph
In the past (and to some extent even now) really creative art,Paragraph
has met with resistance from a public whose conceptual de-,Paragraph
yelopment had outdistanced its emotional growth. The fight,Paragraph
which contemporary architecture in Europe had to wage to,Paragraph
establish itself was due to just this gap between thinking and,Paragraph
feeling. That fight would never have succeeded if architecture,Paragraph
had waited for other branches of knowledge to arrive at a,Paragraph
"coordinated and universal outlook. Builders, sociologists,",Paragraph
"economists, political theorists — none of these have as yet",Paragraph
fulfilled all their aims. Meanwhile the architects have,Paragraph
worked with whatever means were at hand — sometimes,Paragraph
"yery primitive ones, with which completely satisfactory",Paragraph
solutions were impossible — to establish the contours of a,Paragraph
new kind of life.,Paragraph
Many different countries have contributed to the development,Paragraph
which we have been discussing. It would be interesting to,Paragraph
"observe the spread of the new movements, through Holland,",Paragraph
"France, Germany, Sweden, England, and elsewhere; to see",Paragraph
what direction was taken in each of these countries and the,Paragraph
special dangers which each involves; to note the influence of,Paragraph
environment and tradition upon the solution of architectural,Title
problems. Such local differences have a more than superficial,Paragraph
importance. Those countries which accepted contemporary,Paragraph
architecture as a kind of universal coinage — a collection of,Paragraph
particular shapes which retained their full value wherever they,Paragraph
were transplanted — invited architectural bankruptcy. Mod-,Paragraph
ern architecture is something more than a universally appli-,Paragraph
cable means of decoration. It is too much the product of our,Paragraph
"whole period not to exhibit some universal tendencies, but, on",Paragraph
"the other hand, it is too much concerned with problems of",Paragraph

tions: Was the highly developed late baroque art of town,Paragraph
planning continued during the nineteenth century? «What,Paragraph
"arose to take its place afterwards? Finally, whal new solutions",Paragraph
has the twentieth century to offer?,Paragraph
In times when there is a universal vision resting on a long and,Paragraph
"solid tradition, town planning is taken as a matter of course.",Paragraph
We have considered some eighteenth-century solutions which,Paragraph
were interesting for their farsightedness and for the feeling,Paragraph
for space which they manifest. Many of an amazingly high,Paragraph
"quality are the work of anonymous architects, even of specu-",Paragraph
lators. It is important to notice that solutions which come out,Paragraph
of the universal vision of the eighteenth century still remain,Paragraph
valid long after the death of the society —- or the ideal of a,Paragraph
"society — for which they were formulated, and after changes",Paragraph
in circumstance which the designers could never have fore-,Paragraph
seen. But when the vision of a period is predominately in-,Paragraph
"lluenced by spectalists, the solutions arrived al do not even",Paragraph
satisfy the needs of the time of their creation.,Paragraph
The late baroque showed a magnificent power of dominating,Paragraph
outer space. This period was thoroughly aware of the different,Paragraph
relationships that held between one building and another and,Paragraph
between buildings and nature: between constructions and,Title
organisms.,Paragraph
The feeling from which baroque town planning sprang — one,Paragraph
made natural by its social life. - limited attention to the con-,Paragraph
nections between palatial residences and to the spatial treat-,Paragraph
ment of the beautiful plazas of the great towns.,Paragraph
Late baroque town planning is the expression of two-absolut-,Paragraph
"isms: the first produced by the Counter Reformation, the",Paragraph
second by monarchy. All the constructions which benefited,Paragraph
from the great fund of experience of the period were built for,Paragraph
"the Church, for the king, or for those who helped these two to",Paragraph

The lodgings of the common people did not enter into these,Paragraph
"schemes; they were not thought of as presenling anv problem,",Paragraph
The people formed the invisible foundation and support of the,Paragraph
"state; all that rose above the ground was meant, without",Paragraph
"question, for the ruling class. People of great experience and",Paragraph
"wide vision - - like Vauban, Louis XIV’s great military en.",Paragraph

upon the people. But Vauban’s Projet d'une dizme royale,Paragraph
(1709) cost him the monarch’s favor by its assertion that,Paragraph
“ what is wrongly called the dregs of the people ” merited the,Paragraph

How did the London squares originate? This question requires,Paragraph
an answer only in so far as it will help us to understand better,Paragraph
the architectural inheritance which is theirs. The desire for,Paragraph
green spaces within London reaches back to Gothic times. In,Paragraph

of that luxuriant greenery which natural growth brought in due course of time. “Queen,Paragraph

"three sides by good houses, having an extensive garden in the center.... The north side",Paragraph
formerly commanded fine views of Hampstead and Ilighgate.” (°Ackermann’s Repository,Paragraph
"of Arts,” September 1812.)",Paragraph
the fifteenth century the court of Lincoln’s Inn was laid out,Paragraph
as a lawn and converted into walks. At the same time a piece,Paragraph
"of land outside the town, Moorfields, was being used by the",Paragraph
inhabitants as a recreation ground for archery and other,Paragraph

"tant of the popular parks, Hyde Park — far out of London, and",Paragraph
the property of the Crown — was opened to the public.*,Paragraph
Tt was in the seventeenth century also that the first squares,Paragraph
were built. They originated in the desire of various noble,Paragraph
landowners to build up portions of their estates. These con-,Paragraph
structions followed the baroque pattern of places rather than,Paragraph

streets. About 1630 the Earl of Bedford gave over seven acres,Paragraph
of his land to building purposes. The result was the first,Paragraph
London square: Covent Garden. It has often been pointed,Paragraph
"out that this first square — never quite completed, by the",Paragraph
way — resembles the Place des Vosges in Paris (1612). Both,Paragraph

arcades running through the ground floor of the houses. As a,Paragraph
matter of course they were open to the public and devoid of,Paragraph

work was another essay in the free disposition of large build-,Paragraph

example of the London squares as that line which begins with,Paragraph
Versailles and continues through the Bath crescents and the,Paragraph
arrangement of some other English towns.,Paragraph
Regent's Park lies along the axis of the Adams’ Portland Place,Paragraph
(1778). Connecting it and Portland Place with Piccadilly,Paragraph
"Circus in the heart of London is Regent Street, also Nash's",Paragraph
work. This imposing London business street was built around,Paragraph
"1820, being finished just as the Regent’s Park terraces were",Paragraph
begun. The two are the English counterpart of Napoleon’s Rue,Paragraph
de Rivoli. Nash had started his Park Crescent in 1812 (fig.,Paragraph
"261) at the end of Portland Place. The time, however, was not",Paragraph
"yet ripe; Napoleon was still unbeaten, commercial conditions",Paragraph
"were unsellled, bankruptcies were frequent. But by 1825",Paragraph

It was,Paragraph
We have already mentioned the lact that Napoleon LIT had,Paragraph
outlined the transformation of Paris before Haussmann was,Paragraph
called in. He had even begun actial operations on sonte of his,Paragraph

the work on the extension of the Rue de Rivoli led to serious,Paragraph
difficulties later on. The start on the great markets was not,Paragraph
much more encouraging. We have already seen that the first,Paragraph
stone pavilion had to be torn down.,Paragraph
In these matters Napoleon behaved as he did in politics: he,Paragraph
"drew up great schemes, but when serious difficulties arose he",Paragraph
tried to twist his way through by making numerous petty,Paragraph
concessions. This instinctive attempt to bargain his way out,Paragraph
at the cheapest price was what undermined his regime from,Paragraph

The second fundamental principle aimed at “ the amelioration,Paragraph
of the state of health of the lown through the systematic,Title

The central part of Paris was littered with these dreadful,Paragraph
alleys. Many of them (including the one in which Gérard,Paragraph

"combination the lot of the people will be improved, and they",Paragraph
will be rendered less disposed to revolt.” This point shows,Paragraph
even more clearly than the others why the Second Empire,Paragraph
took such pains to build wide streets.,Paragraph
Haussmann’s fourth principle was “ to facilitate circulation,Paragraph

which will lead travelers straight to the cenLlers of commerce,Paragraph
"and pleasure, and will prevent delay, congestion, and acci-",Paragraph

of the first or second and might be completed before these,Paragraph
were.*#,Paragraph
The first réseau was in full swing when Haussmann took office.,Paragraph
"It was financed, withoul any difficulties, by the state and the",Paragraph
"city of Paris jointly, under the act for the prolongement of",Paragraph
the Rue de Rivoli (18419). The chief work under this act was the,Paragraph

years 1854-55.,Paragraph
Haussmann began with the Rue de Rivoli. Demolition and,Paragraph
"consLruction went on piece by piece, first as far as the Pavillon",Paragraph
"de Marsan, then to the Louvre. Forty-seven houses were",Paragraph
"pulled down, then twenty more, then a group of one hundred",Paragraph
seventy-two (to clear the Palais-Royal and the Louvre on both,Caption

sides of the Rue de Rivoli). [If we consider in this connection,Paragraph
the entirely new market halls (fig. 91) which were constructed,Paragraph
"near-by, it may be said that a new district and not merely a",Paragraph
new street was organized.,Paragraph
The Rue de Rivoli was next carried to the Hotel de Ville - the,Paragraph
starting point of all Parisian revolts. The confusion of narrow,Paragraph
streets in front of the Hétel de Ville was cleared away; on their,Paragraph
"site appeared the Place du Chatelet (fig. 267), soon to connect",Paragraph
with the Boulevard Sébastopol (1858).,Paragraph
The first réseate also included the transformation of the Bois de,Paragraph
Boulogne into a place of recreation for the elegant world. In,Paragraph
connection with this there were also built the Longchamp race,Paragraph
"track and the magnilicent approach to the Bois de Boulogne,",Paragraph
"the Avenue de l'Impératrice, today the Avenue Foch (fig. 269).",Paragraph
Haussmann was responsible for its great width of nearly four,Paragraph
"hundred feet, three times as wide as its architect had proposed",Paragraph
making It.,Paragraph
In the second réseau the city was required to provide the,Paragraph
"greater part (threc-quarters) of the cost. A decree of March 18,",Paragraph
"1858, authorized the slate to pay the remaining fraclion, pro-",Paragraph
vided that the total amount did not exceed a hundred and.,Paragraph
"eighty million francs, and thal all the work was finished within",Paragraph
ten years. This particular piece of legislation became known,Paragraph
as “ the decree of the hundred and eighty millions.”,Paragraph
With the second réseau north to south communications re-,Paragraph
ceived further extension: Haussmann led the Boulevard,Paragraph
Sébaslopol across the Seine to the fle de la Cité and the Latin,Paragraph
Quarter on the Left Bank. From there it was continued as Lhe,Paragraph
Boulevard Saint-Michel (fig. 268). The extension transformed,Paragraph
ihe Lle-de Ja Cité into an administrative center. The adapta-,Paragraph
tion to working-class use of the Bois de Vincennes (1860) —,Paragraph

nanced under the same arrangements. Another of the works in,Paragraph
this réseau was the percement de lest; the interlacing of the,Paragraph

"of this clearance, the Hétel de Ville seems almost to float in",Paragraph

ensure its safety.,Paragraph
The final stage was the extension of the Rue de Rivoli de-,Paragraph

Haussmann’s operations over a seventeen-year period had,Paragraph

penditures. The sum had been raised without creating any,Paragraph
new taxes or increasing the old ones. And was not Paris,Paragraph
becoming more prosperous daily? Its population was growing,Paragraph
at an unheard-of rate: within a bare two decades it had almost,Paragraph
doubled. The five or six hundred million francs beyond what,Paragraph
was actually on hand would certainly be found. The cost of,Paragraph
the work could be paid off through annuities based on the in-,Paragraph
creasing revenues of the city. Nothing was involved except,Paragraph
time.,Paragraph
Two parks— Montsouris in the south and the Buttes-,Paragraph
"Chaumont in the north — were created by the third réseau,",Paragraph
Both were conversions of useless and neglected areas; the,Paragraph
Buttes-Chaumont replaced an abandoned quarry.,Paragraph
The suburbs needed more and more streets. Streets leading,Paragraph
"out from Paris were extended, and new crosswise roads were",Paragraph
made. In this manner the budget for the suburbs increased to,Paragraph
double the amount estimated.,Paragraph
Haussmann pressed rapidly on with the development of Paris,Paragraph
as though he knew there was no time to be wasted. To the,Paragraph
west was a field for new town planning. The old toll barriers,Paragraph
marked the western edge of the city; beyond them stretched,Paragraph
the open country. The Champs-Elysées led up to the toll,Paragraph
barriers. Just behind them stood the Arc de Triomphe de,Paragraph
"l’Etoile in its circular place. From the thirties on, the Champs-",Paragraph
Elysées was one of the places where Parisians with any claim to,Paragraph
smartness were expected to make an appearance.,Paragraph
Haussmann could work with a free hand in this district. There,Paragraph
was open land for the twelve avenues which he led out from,Paragraph
the Place de I’Etoile; no demolition was necessary. His ene-,Paragraph
mies accused him of running these avenues out into the open,Paragraph
country and destroying the graintfields of Passy. But once,Paragraph
more Haussmann’s foresight was justified; the Paris of 1900,Paragraph
was to stand on this area.,Paragraph
The interconnection of the various streets that pierced Paris,Paragraph
greatly occupied Haussmann. Thus he insisted that the Ruc,Paragraph
Lafayette should reach a length of five kilometers so that it,Paragraph
might lead travelers from the north and east railway stations to,Paragraph
the Opéra and the Grands Boulevards in the heart of the city.,Paragraph
"The Avenue Napoléon, now the Avenue de l’Opéra, is his",Paragraph
master work in town planning. Besides being a magnificent,Paragraph
"270. Boulevard Richard-Lenoir, 1861-63. Planned by Haussmann to cover an old canal.",Caption
"Behind the regular and endless street fronts a tremendous disorder is crammed, as though",Paragraph
in a wardrobe.,Paragraph
"street in itself, it functions as a traffic bridge between several",Paragraph
main thoroughfares. The Rue de Rivoli and the opposite bank,Paragraph
"of the Seine achieve direct contact, through this avenue, with",Paragraph
the Grands Boulevards and the northern parts of the city.,Paragraph
None of Haussmann’s schemes appeared so foolish to his con-,Paragraph
temporaries as this comparatively short street. So far as they,Paragraph
"Os,",Paragraph
"could see, it could only serve to connect the ThéAtre Francais",Paragraph
with the Opéra - - and who could possibly want to attend both,Paragraph
"on the same evening? Actually, if it were not for this street,",Paragraph
the circulation of traffic in Paris in the present day would be,Paragraph
impossible (fig. 271).,Paragraph
Haussmann built only the beginning and the end of this,Paragraph
thoroughfare. Between the two sprawled a network of streets,Paragraph
which was not cleared away until much later. The whole,Paragraph
"length of the Avenue de Opéra was opened to traffic in 1879,",Paragraph
"This was under the Third Republic, long after Haussmann had",Paragraph
left office.,Paragraph
If Haussmann anywhere succeeded in leaving a monument,Paragraph

We have observed the interrelations since the seventeenth,Paragraph
"century between groups of buildings and nature, and since the",Paragraph
eighteenth century between squares and greenery. [t is true,Paragraph
that in Lhe transformation of Paris other questions are in Lhe,Paragraph
"foreground, but we must not overlook the great efforts made to",Paragraph
save the city from becoming simply a vast acreage of asphalt,Paragraph
and masses of stone. In discussing this work it is necessary Lo,Paragraph
distinguish between the layout of squares with their gardens,Paragraph
and the old and new parks and pleasure grounds.,Paragraph
"As a refugee in London, Louis Napoleon was much impressed",Paragraph
"hy the English squares and parks. When he came to power, he",Paragraph
desired to provide his capital with similar open green spaces —,Paragraph
immense romantic parks and squares planled with trees and,Paragraph
shrubs. Both were unknown in Paris. From the point of view,Paragraph
"of town planning, too, the squares of Paris differed from those",Paragraph
of London in one important respect: the London squares were,Paragraph
"isolated from traflic, whereas those in Paris were no more than",Paragraph
"the enlargement of streets. For example, the Place des Arts-",Paragraph
el-Métiers was a broadening of the Boulevard Sébastopol;,Paragraph
"that around the ‘Tour Saint-Jacques (fig. 266), of the Rue de",Paragraph
"Rivoli. The houses were so placed in straight, continuous lines",Paragraph
along the streets as to permit no free spaces apart from paye-,Paragraph
nents and traffic passages.” It was inevitable that the small,Paragraph
"parks created out of these squares, quite unlike those of Lon-",Paragraph
"don, should be set amidst the noise and dust of traffic.",Paragraph
No innovation in urban planning was more generally imitated,Paragraph
in the years immediately following than this arrangement of,Paragraph
squares filled with greenery in the midst of traffic. Jsspecially,Paragraph
pleasing and completely new to people was the fact that they,Paragraph

in avoiding mistakes. The architects were of singularly little,Paragraph
help. They could not even adjust themselves to the scale of,Paragraph
his projects; on many occasions he had to send their work,Paragraph
back and insist upon its enlargement. He remarks that the,Paragraph
Second Empire was unfortunate in not producing a single,Paragraph
artist equal to the problems of the demps nouveau. Fauss-,Paragraph
mann seems to have resigned himself to this fact. The Bureau,Paragraph
of Architects with its staff of academicians and celebrities was,Paragraph
the one department which he left almost undisturbed when he,Paragraph

and too extensive for Lhese men to handle; as Henri Labrouste,Paragraph
