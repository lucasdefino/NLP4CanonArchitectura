Modern Architecture: A Very Short Introduction,Title
Chapter 1,Title
Introduction,Title
"Somewhere between 1910 and 1970, architecture changed. Now that",Paragraph
modern architecture is familiar—and we’ve seen how it became both,Paragraph
celebrated and vilified—it’s hard to imagine how novel it once seemed.,Paragraph
"Expensive Western buildings became transformed from ornamented fancies,",Paragraph
"which referred to the classical and medieval pasts, into strikingly plain",Paragraph
"reflections of novel materials, technologies, and ideas. It’s equally hard to",Paragraph
"remember how modem architecture promised transformation, seemingly",Paragraph
"poised to turn dirty, overcrowded cities—characterized by packed slums",Paragraph
and Satanic mills—into spacious realms of generous housing and clean,Paragraph
"mechanized production, set in parkland. At certain times and in certain",Paragraph
"cultures, modern architecture stood for the liberation of the future from the",Paragraph
past.,Paragraph
The phrase ‘modern architecture’ describes a spectrum of buildings and,Paragraph
"ideas. From Shakespeare’s times until the 19th century, ‘modern’ in English",Paragraph
meant ‘up to date’. The idea of progress became important in the 19th,Paragraph
century and that made the modern ‘progressive’: part of an apparently,Paragraph
"predestined course from an impoverished past, to a still inadequate present,",Paragraph
"towards an idealized future. More recently however, the term modern",Paragraph
largely came to describe a specific time in the 20th century when many,Paragraph
"people, especially in the West, seemed persuaded that a better future was on",Paragraph
its way.,Paragraph
"For some historians, modern architecture refers primarily to stark white",Paragraph
"buildings from the 1920s and 1930s: crisp, hovering edifices which, so the",Paragraph
"story goes, reflected honestly their internal functions on the outside,",Paragraph
"illustrating how they were put together, highlighting the ‘shock of the new’.",Paragraph
"For others, the idea of a modern architectural future had a longer history. It",Paragraph
"dated back to the Paris World’s Fair of 1889, or John Ruskin’s 1849",Paragraph
exhortations about how medieval Gothic cathedrals expressed structure,Title
honestly in stone.,Paragraph
"Just as it’s possible to argue about the beginnings of modern architecture, its",Paragraph
"demise has been much debated. For various commentators, modern",Paragraph
architecture is over. It was supplanted by ‘postmodernism’ in the 1980s and,Paragraph
"1990s, when architects became less interested in the expression of function,",Paragraph
and returned to historical motifs (like the 1991 extension to London’s,Paragraph
"National Gallery, designed by Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates), or",Paragraph
striking shape-making of various kinds (like the sinuous Guggenheim,Paragraph
"Museum, Bilbao, 1997, designed by Frank O. Gehry’s studio). For others,",Caption
modern architecture—as the expression of contemporary building,Paragraph
"technologies, as the idea of making construction legible and transparent—",Paragraph
"remains current, no matter that other disciplines insist on the demise of",Paragraph
modernity in their fields.,Paragraph
"I’ll take a long and broad view of modern architecture here, examining what",Paragraph
"Harold Rosenberg called ‘the tradition of the new’, arguing that it didn’t",Paragraph
"just emerge fully formed in the 1910s and 1920s, or as the consequence of",Paragraph
"19th-century pioneers, but was instead the product of two centuries of",Paragraph
"industrialization, and the global spread of industrial culture. I set out neither",Paragraph
"to promote nor condemn modern architecture. Rather, my aim is to illustrate",Paragraph
how it was produced out of—and reflected—the cultures that constructed it.,Paragraph
"I explore it in all its strangeness and thoughtfulness, as designed by some",Paragraph
"curious, obsessive characters.",Paragraph
The organization of this book,Title
Certain famous modern architects were skilled self-publicists. Memorable,Paragraph
"aphorisms, like Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s ‘less is more’, and Le",Paragraph
"Corbusier’s ‘the house is a machine for living’, entered the lexicons of",Paragraph
"popular quotation. Less widely known, but chortled-at by generations of",Paragraph
"architecture students, is Louis Kahn’s 1971 conversation with a brick:",Paragraph
"If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, ‘What do you want, Brick?’ And Brick says to you ‘I",Paragraph
"like an Arch’. And if you say to Brick ‘Look, arches are expensive and I can use a concrete",Paragraph
lintel over you. What do you think of that Brick?’ Brick says ‘I like an Arch’.,Paragraph
This image of architect in communion with brick illustrates a point which,Paragraph
preoccupied modern architects: that different building materials imply their,Paragraph
"own inherent logics. How particular materials go together, Kahn suggested,",Paragraph
"make certain combinations of structure, wall, and building assembly seem",Paragraph
inevitable: brick wants to make arches; timber wants to make lattices of,Paragraph
beams and posts; steel wants to make frames; reinforced concrete wants to,Paragraph
"make frames too, and also thin planes and big spans. You can persuade",Paragraph
"those materials to behave otherwise, but why—Kahn implied—as a",Paragraph
"thoughtful modern architect, would you do that? This was not new. In 1863,",Paragraph
Parisian architect Eugéne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc wrote that any ‘change,Paragraph
of material must bring about a change of forms’. The contemporaneous,Paragraph
"German writer Gottfried Semper argued that brick, wood, and iron should",Paragraph
be treated according to their ‘statical laws’. Both responded to Ruskin’s,Paragraph
ideas about honesty to materials and the honest visual expression of the,Paragraph
uses of a building. Their earnest morality persisted into modern,Paragraph
architecture. And the idea that materials have their own inherent logics,Paragraph
explains how I’ve organized this book.,Paragraph
Historians often gave architects more credit than they deserved for shaping,Paragraph
modern architecture. Moder architects’ imaginations were hugely,Paragraph
extended by material innovations. Developments in steel and reinforced,Paragraph
"concrete radically altered possibilities for shaping buildings, as did new",Paragraph
"systems for electric lighting and handling air. These technical innovations,",Paragraph
"in turn, emerged from new cultures of industrial production. Thus, my story",Paragraph
is organized around the technical innovations that opened up the cultural,Paragraph
and intellectual opportunities for modern architecture to happen.,Paragraph
This isn’t to say that architects were involved in the invention of new,Paragraph
"technologies—most weren’t, and many disapproved at first—but, as Adrian",Paragraph
"Forty has argued, architects’ special ability was to conjure up images for",Paragraph
new technologies that made them seem striking and appealing. Architects,Paragraph
"didn’t create steel and reinforced concrete, or fluorescent tubes and air",Paragraph
"conditioning, but they appreciated how those technologies could make the",Paragraph
world look and feel different. And they designed knowingly in relation to,Paragraph
"imagery from other spheres, like modern art and industrial design. The",Paragraph
British modern architect Wells Coates wrote in 1931 that there was a choice,Paragraph
between ‘the use of the new ... materials as prisoners—the slaves—of old,Paragraph
"habits, old social prejudices, old visual prejudices; or as the means to new",Paragraph
"forms, new habits of life, a new vision’.",Paragraph
"My story thus explores the architectural consequences of iron and steel,",Paragraph
"reinforced concrete, brick, air conditioning, and electric light to illustrate",Paragraph
how modern architecture produced powerful cultural images expressing the,Paragraph
potential of the future. These new technologies were not adopted by,Paragraph
"architects in a linear sequence but, to some extent, in parallel. So, each",Paragraph
chapter here—while organized broadly in chronological order—shifts back,Paragraph
in time to begin before the previous one ends.,Paragraph
Some definitions,Title
I define modernity here as the condition of living in an industrialized,Paragraph
society. Industrialized societies are those shaped by modern science and,Paragraph
"consumer technologies: by mass production, mass markets, mass",Title
"consumption, mass education, and mass media; by novelty and fashion; and",Paragraph
by accelerating globalization fuelled by the power of global finance.,Paragraph
Underpinning industrialized societies was an idea that perpetual scientific,Paragraph
"progress operated hand in hand with economic growth, and also—",Paragraph
"sometimes—amulti-party democracy. Alongside industry, work, and",Paragraph
"changing patterns of domestic life, the category of modernity encompassed",Paragraph
"ideas from art, literature, film, theatre, media, music, philosophy, and",Title
"architecture: cultural endeavours reflecting modern societies, and shaping",Title
"them through the reflections they offered. Modern technology, and the",Paragraph
"cultures it produced, seemed poised to liberate people from rigid constraints",Paragraph
"traditionally imposed by their gender, class, or ethnicity. But the same",Paragraph
progress could also seem alienating—disrupting traditional communities,Paragraph
and ways of life. Modernity thus mixed optimism about the social,Paragraph
opportunities of technology with deep unease about its consequences. The,Paragraph
peak of modernity occurred between the late 19th and mid-20th centuries in,Paragraph
"the West. Indeed, modernity extended beyond the West in different places at",Paragraph
"different times, sometimes associated with colonization in the 19th and 20th",Paragraph
"centuries, and sometimes with postcolonial societies.",Paragraph
"More recently, faith in perpetual progress was shaken. Science and",Paragraph
technology appeared fallible. Power structures linking the funding of,Paragraph
"science and political parties with industry, finance, and military endeavours",Title
became more apparent. The operation of these power structures in service,Paragraph
"of people of a particular class, ethnicity, and gender, from particular comers",Paragraph
"of the globe, was highlighted. And the vast consumption of energy and",Paragraph
disposable goods was questioned in terms of sustainability. For these,Paragraph
"reasons, it’s widely assumed that modernity—as an idea about progress—",Paragraph
"ended during the latter part of the 20th century, or at least became much",Paragraph
more complicated. The term ‘postmodern’ was coined to describe what,Paragraph
followed.,Paragraph
I define modern architecture here as architecture produced out of the,Paragraph
"condition of modernity. In particular, it’s architecture that contributed to",Paragraph
"modernity, because the images of its buildings seemed to express what",Paragraph
modernity stood for.,Paragraph
"Modern architecture’s champions referred to ‘the modern movement’,",Paragraph
associating it with radical movements in art. The term also implied,Paragraph
connections with radical political movements that its characters,Paragraph
"occasionally hooked up with, in Russia and Italy in the 1910s, and Germany",Paragraph
and France in the 1920s. Only when tidied up by sympathetic historians in,Paragraph
"retrospect, however, did it look like a coherent movement. There were",Paragraph
always multiple modern architectures and the term meant different things to,Paragraph
"different people at different times. In his 1896 book Modern Architecture,",Paragraph
architect Otto Wagner associated the idea with the rational and honest,Paragraph
"expression of materials, structure, and function, and with the purging of",Paragraph
"unnecessary decoration—themes familiar as late as the 1970s. In the 1910s,",Paragraph
"however, quite different architectures of ‘Art Nouveau’, characterized by",Paragraph
"swirling floral motifs, would also have been called modern, alongside the",Paragraph
‘expressionist’ crystalline shapes of Bruno Taut’s ‘Crystal Chain’ group. By,Paragraph
"the late 1930s, however, these counted as modern less frequently. At that",Paragraph
"time, modern architecture became more tightly defined around buildings",Paragraph
"evoking glamorous technologies of the age: cars, ocean liners, and",Paragraph
"aeroplanes. This was the so-called International Style, matching white",Paragraph
"planes with flat roofs, open plans, extensive glazing, horizontal windows,",Paragraph
"and blocks you could see below or through. By the late 1950s, multiple",Paragraph
"modern architectures proliferated again, reconsidering what then became",Paragraph
seen as the ‘early modern’ architecture of the 1930s. Certain architects at,Paragraph
"that time hoped to make modern architecture more humane, dramatic,",Paragraph
"monumental, or systematically scientific. Despite these differences, the idea",Paragraph
of a single modern movement persisted. It sounded glamorous and sold,Paragraph
textbooks.,Paragraph
Modern architecture was also defined by how architects designed it. There,Paragraph
"are three primary kinds of scaled architectural drawing: the elevation,",Paragraph
"depicting a facade; the section, a vertical cut from roof to foundations",Paragraph
"showing floors stacked up; and the plan, a horizontal cut showing the layout",Paragraph
"of rooms on a floor. Where architects previously agonized over elevations,",Paragraph
"often adapting plans and sections around decisions made about the facades,",Paragraph
modern architects prioritized the plan. They claimed that the layout of,Paragraph
"rooms—the best functional arrangement for a house, library, or office—",Paragraph
"should come first, and that elevations should be secondary. The most",Paragraph
"famous modern architect, Le Corbusier, wrote that ‘the plan is the",Paragraph
generator’. Louis Sullivan’s catchy aphorism ‘form ever follows function’,Paragraph
"was a slogan for this way of working. In the writings of Adolf Loos, it",Paragraph
"became elevated to a moral imperative. By the 1930s, most modern",Paragraph
architects believed there was something truthful about designs prioritizing,Paragraph
"function, and something dishonest about designs emphasizing a building’s",Paragraph
"artistic decoration. Despite the rhetoric, however, modem architects",Paragraph
"remained deeply concerned with the imagery of their buildings. Indeed,",Paragraph
numerous modern buildings can be understood as architectural images,Paragraph
dedicated to undermining the idea of architectural imagery.,Paragraph
"From the 1930s, modern architecture increasingly became called",Paragraph
"‘Modernism’, making it sound like a cause. The term allowed historians to",Paragraph
characterize modern architecture as a style like other architectural styles,Paragraph
"(Neo-Classicism or Gothic Revivalism, for example). It also helped them",Paragraph
link it to other modernisms in art and literature that similarly responded to,Paragraph
"technological cultures, industrialization, and globalization. This appealed to",Paragraph
critics who made reputations out of classifying trends. But many modern,Paragraph
"architects thought they were isolating honest, timeless ways to design—not",Paragraph
indulging in something as fleeting as a style—and vigorously rejected the,Paragraph
idea.,Paragraph
Modernism appears with and without a capital ‘m’. Some advocates of,Paragraph
modern architecture used the capital letter to sort out buildings they felt,Paragraph
were special symbols of the movement from buildings that were merely,Paragraph
new. Others used it to elevate Modernism to the status of other nouns,Paragraph
"capitalized in English, like Church or God. You won’t see Modern or",Paragraph
Modernism written with a capital ‘m’ again here. And I'll use modernism,Paragraph
sparingly. I don’t want to make modern architecture seem more important,Paragraph
than other architectures. Nor do I find obsessing about which famous,Paragraph
buildings fit into which stylistic categories particularly fruitful. When,Paragraph
"studying architecture, it seems more interesting to think instead about",Paragraph
"buildings themselves: how they work, what they do, and what they say.",Paragraph
"Having reflected on the ‘modern’ in ‘modern architecture’, it’s worth",Paragraph
"pausing on ‘architecture’. Nikolaus Pevsner, the prominent modern",Paragraph
"historian, famously made a distinction between architecture and building:",Paragraph
"‘A bicycle shed is a building’, he wrote, ‘whereas Lincoln Cathedral is a",Paragraph
work of architecture’. Distinctions like this are widespread but obstructive.,Paragraph
"All buildings—bicycle shed or cathedral, banal office building or",Paragraph
obsessively detailed museum—offer insights into the values of the people,Paragraph
"and cultures which produced them, illustrating the ideas informing their",Paragraph
"design, construction, and use. All are valid objects of scholarly attention.",Paragraph
"I’ve included (big) sheds and bridges in this book, alongside churches and",Paragraph
"high-rise towers, because they all yielded important architectural images of",Paragraph
modernity. If anything distinguishes the buildings I’ve included here from,Paragraph
"others, it’s that they became famous because they proved inspiring or",Paragraph
troubling enough for people to have projected ideas about modernity onto,Paragraph
them.,Paragraph
"Most histories of modern architecture bring the story up to date. But,",Paragraph
"because I contend that modernity transformed into something else, my story",Paragraph
"closes in the 1970s, accepting that architecture transformed with it. This end",Paragraph
point coincides with a time when building regulations introduced in the,Paragraph
West made the idea of truth to materials harder to achieve at the level of,Paragraph
architectural detail. While ideas from modern architecture remain doggedly,Paragraph
"persistent, and numerous architects still practice as paid-up modernists, ours",Paragraph
is now the architecture of another time which will attract its own histories in,Paragraph
due course.,Paragraph
Histories of the future,Title
Modern architecture owed as much to its storytellers as its buildings. Le,Paragraph
Corbusier’s 1923 book Towards a New Architecture—which became,Paragraph
admired in the Anglosphere in the 1930s—tried to establish moral and,Paragraph
"visual principles for modern architecture. Meanwhile, certain historians",Paragraph
"rewrote architectural history to make modernism its logical consequence,",Paragraph
"including Hitchcock and Johnson, whose 1932 term ‘International Style’",Paragraph
"I’ve already mentioned, and Pevsner, whose Pioneers of Modern Design,",Paragraph
"1936, sought to persuade sceptics inclined towards the past that modern",Paragraph
architecture actually emerged from a long history. Sigfried Giedion,Paragraph
illustrated in 1941 how architecture could be understood in terms of time,Paragraph
"and space. And in the 1960s, (Peter) Reyner Banham—historian of the",Paragraph
immediate future’—extended the category of architecture to include all,Paragraph
"sorts of industrial structures, technologies, and gadgets. Robert Venturi’s",Paragraph
"Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture, 1966, reminded readers that",Paragraph
"history always infused modern architecture, and anticipated the",Paragraph
postmodernism that followed. It’s a curious quirk that modern architecture,Paragraph
—whose most extreme forms rejected the past—was so extensively,Paragraph
consolidated by its historians.,Paragraph
Architectural histories have strange conventions. Buildings are usually,Paragraph
"designed in studios full of architects and technicians, with clients, builders,",Paragraph
"engineers, and regulations that help to shape them. Nevertheless, historians",Paragraph
"mostly attribute famous buildings to a single architect—usually male,",Paragraph
"white, and Western, like most of the historians themselves—even if that",Paragraph
individual hardly spent any time on the project. I’ll use this pervasive,Paragraph
"convention here, albeit guardedly, with this reminder not to forget who it",Paragraph
conceals. Another convention—as old as the book The Lives of the Artists,Paragraph
"by architect Giorgio Vasari, 1550—depicts famous architects as visionary",Paragraph
"geniuses working against the odds. This idea persists, and certain modern",Paragraph
architects became elevated into superheroes who could do no wrong. I'll,Paragraph
"highlight one such anointed superhero in each chapter, recalling the",Paragraph
celebrity worship that still pervades architectural culture.,Paragraph
Few architectural history books stray from sites of financial and cultural,Paragraph
power. Most discuss buildings that were novel when they were constructed,Paragraph
"becoming models for others that followed, built in places with the wealth",Paragraph
"necessary to make them, the cultural sensibilities that prized their novelty,",Paragraph
and celebrated by local critics influential enough to get them widely,Paragraph
"noticed. Architectural historians now worry about this, about repeatedly",Paragraph
"retelling dominant but partisan stories. To compensate, they’ve worked to",Paragraph
"make their histories more diverse and inclusive, to illustrate who has the",Paragraph
"power to build what, when, where, how, and for whom, A very short book",Paragraph
"like this inevitably has to omit far more than it includes, so I’ve focused",Paragraph
here on a small selection of buildings that also account for bigger cultural,Paragraph
"ideas. I emphasize what modern architecture was like, why it was like that,",Paragraph
"and how it was imagined, more than the global patterns of where and when.",Paragraph
This approach helps me to argue that buildings themselves should be the,Paragraph
primary source of architectural research: that every building—cathedral or,Paragraph
"bicycle shed, glamorous gallery or your own home—contains architectural,",Paragraph
"cultural, technical, and historical knowledge. It also emphasizes the",Paragraph
buildings that you need to know to talk knowledgably with others who,Paragraph
"think they already know about modern architecture. Its consequence,",Paragraph
"however, is to reinforce the Euro-American mainstream, omitting buildings",Paragraph
and characters from other contexts. I’ve tried to mitigate this by including,Paragraph
some less familiar projects and introducing some familiar examples in less,Paragraph
"familiar ways. Ultimately though, I hope this book will encourage you to",Paragraph
"read further, to go beyond buildings designed largely by white Western men",Paragraph
in the most powerful countries in the world to explore less-charted but,Paragraph
equally important moder architectures.,Paragraph
Chapter 2,Title
Iron and steel,Title
A bridge to modernity,Title
My story about modern architecture begins with an iron bridge completed,Paragraph
"in 1779 (Figure 1). It’s only questionably modern and, for that matter, only",Paragraph
questionably architecture. But it illustrates the industrial cultures where,Paragraph
modern architecture started to form.,Paragraph
"1. Iron Bridge, Ironbridge, Shropshire, UK, completed 1779. A",Caption
"technological wonder of its time, which displayed and promoted a set",Paragraph
of emerging ideas about what later became called modernity. While,Paragraph
built from a new material—iron—it still subscribed to the traditional,Paragraph
image of a bridge built in masonry. (Fabricator: Abraham Darby III;,Caption
Architect: Thomas Pritchard.),Caption
"The bridge was made from five arched cast-iron ribs, spreading their load to",Paragraph
"two masonry abutments, assembled without using nuts and bolts. The",Caption
"bridge became so famous, because its construction was so novel, that the",Paragraph
"town forming around it took its name. Ironbridge, sat in a mineral-rich",Paragraph
"gorge in England’s West Midlands, became the crucible of the 18th",Paragraph
century’s Industrial Revolution.,Paragraph
"The Iron Bridge was proposed by an architect, Thomas Pritchard—and it",Paragraph
bears his ornamental flourishes—but it was executed under the direction of,Paragraph
"a fabricator, Abraham Darby III. The Darby family’s Coalbrookdale",Caption
foundry was then a world leader in iron production. The first Abraham,Paragraph
"Darby had worked out how to use coked coal, rather than charcoal made",Paragraph
"from timber, to raise temperatures in the blast furnaces where iron was",Paragraph
"made. This yielded consistently higher quality iron at lower cost, made in",Paragraph
large furnaces that could run continuously. Coalbrookdale’s innovations in,Paragraph
"the volume production of iron, and growing experience in fabricating iron",Paragraph
"components, contributed not just to the bridge but to the whole Industrial",Paragraph
Revolution.,Paragraph
The Iron Bridge introduces four themes that recur throughout this book.,Paragraph
"First, it indicates the beginnings of a shift in global culture, over two",Paragraph
"centuries, from artisan manufacturing towards mass production. While the",Paragraph
"components of the bridge were sourced nearby—using local ironstone, clay,",Paragraph
"sand, limestone, coal, and water—it was assembled from a limited number",Paragraph
of repeated components. This anticipated a huge cultural shift. New,Paragraph
"technologies enabled cheaper and quicker manufacturing, opening up",Paragraph
industrial production in fields—like textiles and furniture—that were,Paragraph
previously the province of artisans. This new industrial culture usually,Paragraph
"separated design from making. Where seamstresses or joiners, for example,",Paragraph
"made design decisions with their tools in hand, based on their experience of",Paragraph
"working materials, designers began to emerge in various fields who",Paragraph
"imagined artefacts and drew them for others to make. In consequence,",Paragraph
makers’ skills became increasingly channelled into the accurate,Paragraph
reproduction of given designs. While the figure of the architect emerged,Paragraph
well before mass production—out of ancient origins rediscovered in the,Paragraph
15th century—the modern idea of the professional who draws buildings got,Paragraph
shaped in association with this emerging idea of design. The modern notion,Paragraph
"of construction as an industry emerged with it, gradually replacing old",Paragraph
priorities of art and craft in building with new ideas about efficiency and,Paragraph
predictability.,Paragraph
"Second, the Iron Bridge illustrates the emergence of the idea of a single",Paragraph
"global culture. Early mass production, like that in the Severn gorge, quickly",Paragraph
"exceeded the stock of local raw materials. The hunger of new factories,",Paragraph
"from blast foundries to textile mills, and the hunger of their owners for",Paragraph
"profit, meant that materials and workers were sought elsewhere as local",Paragraph
supplies dwindled. Associated ideas about raw materials being,Paragraph
"commodities, and individual workers combining into a collective called",Paragraph
"labour, started to form the modern habit of imagining the world in terms of",Paragraph
resources to be exploited.,Paragraph
"The more the machines produced, and the greater the demand for their",Paragraph
"cheaper products, the wider the distribution of those products. Transport",Paragraph
"infrastructures were constructed to bring in material and labour resources,",Paragraph
"and to ship out manufactured ones. For example, in a short time at the end",Paragraph
"of the 18th century, the River Severn flowing through Ironbridge became",Paragraph
"linked to other rivers via a canal network connecting British cities, joined",Paragraph
"with ports linked to global shipping. By the middle of the 19th century,",Paragraph
these canals were supplanted by railways that could move more goods and,Paragraph
"people at higher speeds. In the later 20th century, railways themselves",Paragraph
"became overtaken by motorways, air transport, and containerization. Thus,",Paragraph
the transport infrastructures made necessary by industry expanded and,Paragraph
accelerated during the modern period. They produced in their wake a global,Paragraph
"culture where industry flourished, and where global consumption and mass",Paragraph
travel seemed to shrink distances and cultural differences.,Paragraph
"This alliance of trade, industry, and shipping fuelled Western countries’",Paragraph
"colonization of parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas during the 18th and",Paragraph
"19th centuries. For example, in northeast England, on the River Tyne rather",Paragraph
"than the Severn, Lord Armstrong’s Elswick Works produced munitions,",Paragraph
"ships, and hydraulic construction equipment. These were sold without",Paragraph
"scruple to armies, militia, governments, and corporations including—",Paragraph
famously—both sides of the same conflict. Fuelled by technocratic,Paragraph
"enterprises like Armstrong’s, colonialism opened up what became imagined",Paragraph
as the material and human resources of conquered lands to the new,Paragraph
industries. It brought enormous wealth to European and North American,Paragraph
"captains of industry, and often significant suffering to the places and",Paragraph
peoples plundered. The novel goods and values exported by new industries,Paragraph
"celebrated global commerce, market forces, and the idea of industry as",Paragraph
progress—which then seemed to become their inevitable consequence.,Paragraph
Just as the idea of a single global culture is latent in the reproduced,Paragraph
"components of the Iron Bridge, so too are modern ideas of economy and",Paragraph
"technology. Taken together, these constitute the third theme I argue that the",Paragraph
bridge illustrates. New industries—like Coalbrookdale Foundry—produced,Paragraph
massive social and cultural change in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The,Paragraph
"population of England’s West Midlands, like much of Western Europe and",Paragraph
"later the USA, shifted largely from rural agricultural work to urban",Paragraph
industrial work. Growing urban populations sustained industrial production,Paragraph
and encouraged the consumption of its outputs. The massive changes that,Paragraph
"successive generations observed—the emergence of labour-saving devices,",Paragraph
"for example, from the mangle to the fridge; or wonder drugs from",Paragraph
anaesthetics to antibiotics—became inextricably linked in people’s minds,Paragraph
with the idea of technology. And this association of technology with,Paragraph
"progress, popularized through novel innovations, became inseparable from",Paragraph
modernity.,Paragraph
The reach of manufacturing industries and transport infrastructures,Title
increasingly extended into almost every facet of everyday life. And the,Paragraph
global economy on which the modem idea of progress relied became,Paragraph
increasingly pervasive. The word ‘economy’ once referred to the frugal,Paragraph
"management of a household, to an ancient villa and its land, sustaining a",Paragraph
"society of people living and working there, standing for the idea that just",Paragraph
"enough was sufficient. But the substantial costs of industrial production,",Paragraph
"and the extravagant profits to be made from it, made loan finance—once",Paragraph
condemned as the evil of ‘usury’—more culturally acceptable. The,Paragraph
financiers made the biggest profits of all. In the late 19th and early 20th,Paragraph
"centuries, colonialism and transport globalized finance at least as much as",Paragraph
they globalized the new industries.,Paragraph
"The Iron Bridge also introduces a fourth idea, about architectural",Paragraph
‘imageability’. Whether or not it was the first iron bridge in the world—,Paragraph
that’s been debated—it was the first whose image became widely,Paragraph
"distributed. At the time, its spindly see-through structure looked remarkable",Paragraph
to eyes accustomed to brick or stone. How could something so apparently,Paragraph
fragile be evidently so strong? The structure drew artists intrigued to depict,Paragraph
"it. An exhibition celebrating the bridge’s bicentenary in 1979, held at",Paragraph
"London’s Royal Academy, collected over fifty images made between 1750",Paragraph
"and 1830. Pictures of the bridge, sat in its picturesque gorge, symbolized",Caption
the wonder of technology. And new media technologies—like engraving,Paragraph
"and printing—allowed the widespread distribution of its imagery, lending it",Paragraph
"global significance. Like many famous works of modern architecture,",Paragraph
images of the Iron Bridge seemed to surpass the structure’s own physical,Paragraph
"presence. Its depiction, in paintings and engravings, acquired a currency",Paragraph
"beyond the original, admired by a much bigger audience than had seen the",Paragraph
"bridge first hand, making it a striking symbol of the idea of the new.",Paragraph
"The Iron Bridge also illustrates imageability in another way. Made in iron,",Paragraph
"assembled from multiple components, it’s constructed in the same form as a",Paragraph
"masonry arch. Effectively, it took what was then the known image of a",Paragraph
bridge—the arch—and reproduced it in a new material. Arches suit how,Paragraph
brick and stone behave in compression (when loaded with weight from,Paragraph
"above), distributing loads evenly from central keystones to the ground. Iron,",Paragraph
"meanwhile, has different properties. Made into chain links and cables, it",Paragraph
performs better in tension (where forces tend to pull it apart). This was,Paragraph
exploited in 1801 in the inventor James Finlay’s design for Jacob’s Creek,Paragraph
"Bridge in Westmorland County, Pennsylvania, suspending a deck from iron",Caption
trusses and establishing the basic components of the modern suspension,Paragraph
"bridge. Later structures, like engineer Thomas Telford’s Menai Bridge in",Paragraph
"North Wales, 1820, and Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s Clifton Suspension",Title
"Bridge in Bristol, UK, 1834, consolidated a new logic for iron construction",Paragraph
and a new image for iron bridges derived more directly from the logic of,Paragraph
"the material. While Ironbridge’s Iron Bridge was innovative, it was",Paragraph
nevertheless constrained in its designers’ imaginations by their prevailing,Paragraph
idea of what a bridge ought to look like.,Paragraph
This raises an important point—that there remain deeply embedded cultural,Paragraph
assumptions about the imagery of certain types of buildings and structures.,Paragraph
Children learn culturally coded images so they can distinguish a living,Paragraph
"room from a street, for example, or a house from an office, and people think",Paragraph
they know what buildings look like after that. But these codes become so,Paragraph
"powerful that designers take time to challenge them. More significantly,",Paragraph
they become so powerful that people find it hard to accept new architectural,Paragraph
images when familiar ones are challenged.,Paragraph
I want to mention one last way that the Iron Bridge anticipated modern,Paragraph
architecture. Recent surveys of the bridge showed how its repeated,Paragraph
"components were adjusted individually, during manufacturing, to fit their",Paragraph
"neighbours. There is, it’s been shown, tens of millimetres’ difference",Paragraph
between seemingly identical components. The ideal of mass production in,Paragraph
architecture has always been that: an ideal. Despite ongoing enthusiasm for,Paragraph
"industrialization, particular builders usually constructed modern buildings",Paragraph
"on particular sites for particular clients, from the drawings of particular",Paragraph
"designers. During the 20th century, it grew less common for architects to",Paragraph
design every detail of buildings and more common for them to specify,Paragraph
"mass-produced components, like prefabricated doorsets, roof trusses, or",Paragraph
"kitchen units. Only rarely, however, were whole buildings mass produced.",Paragraph

The modern idea of science—seeking mathematical descriptions of natural,Paragraph

and 17th centuries. It was popularized by the reputations of figures like,Paragraph
"Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543), who proposed in 1549 that the Earth",Paragraph
"revolved around the sun and not vice versa, and Isaac Newton (1642-1727),",Paragraph

architecture could be a vital expression of culture.,Paragraph
St Geneviéve Library was controversial in mid-19th-century Paris. It,Paragraph
"rejected the prevailing idea, promoted by that city’s famous architecture",Paragraph
"school, L’Ecole des Beaux-Arts, that architecture should involve the artful",Paragraph
composition of decorative forms derived from scholarly study of the orders,Paragraph
of classical architecture. The library instead appeared strikingly plain.,Paragraph
Structure and decoration were effectively separated out. Decoration was,Paragraph
"applied to panels set into, and between, the primary structure, expressing",Paragraph
the structural design of the building visually. These ideas chimed with,Paragraph
"emerging architectural thinkers, notably John Ruskin, whose book Modern",Paragraph
Painters (first published anonymously in 1843) argued that art should be,Paragraph
honest to the realities of nature; expanded in his Seven Lamps of,Paragraph
"Architecture, 1849, which promoted truth—including the honest expression",Paragraph

emerging modernity in another way.,Paragraph
"Labrouste knew the novelist Victor Hugo, who remains famous for The",Paragraph

"was set when the invention of the printing press, by Johannes Gutenberg in",Paragraph
"1436, allowed the widespread distribution of books. But Hugo made a",Paragraph
"contemporary point. He claimed, via Frollo, that architecture was",Paragraph
"understood before printing, before mass production, not just in terms of",Paragraph
shelter or as a container of human activities but instead as a form of,Paragraph
knowledge. And that knowledge—carved in stone in the great buildings of,Paragraph
human culture—was a kind of cultural currency that could be read by the,Paragraph
"people whose lives those great buildings touched. Architecture, he",Paragraph
"suggested, was a force for social integration because it expressed shared",Paragraph
symbols. Hugo’s character argued that architecture was losing its uniting,Paragraph
"power to the page, prophesizing that the spread of Copernican and",Paragraph
"Newtonian science, through printing, would encourage the culture of",Paragraph
industrialization to take over every facet of human life. Hugo thus took aim,Paragraph
"at the Beaux Arts architects who derived their designs from book learning,",Paragraph
"copying, and recopying forms from the Greeks and Romans, forgetting, he",Paragraph
"thought, how to think for themselves. They made empty copies of ancient",Paragraph
"architecture, he implied, in a city where Notre Dame showed how",Paragraph
"architecture once embodied the latest knowledge, and where it could do that",Paragraph
again.,Paragraph
"The historian Neil Levine argued that Labrouste’s design for his strange,",Paragraph
plain library—with its spindly iron vaults and resistance to Classical style—,Paragraph
was an optimistic response to Hugo’s criticism: an attempt to make,Paragraph
"architecture a cultural force again, this time reflecting the 19th century’s",Paragraph
emerging knowledge. The library’s plain stone facades were carved with,Paragraph
"810 names in twenty-seven panels, presenting a roll call of thinkers",Caption
"collected in the library (all male), organized in chronological order from the",Paragraph
"Old Testament figure Moses to the Swedish scientist Bezelius, who died in",Paragraph
1848 when the names were carved. The architecture of the library thus,Paragraph
echoed and celebrated the printed page. If the book had killed ancient,Paragraph
"architecture, as Hugo supposed, then St Geneviéve Library suggested that",Paragraph
architecture could be made afresh out of the new scientific world of the,Paragraph
book. The names on the library’s fagades described the huge intellectual,Paragraph

The library highlighted an apparent tension emerging at that time between,Paragraph

the next century.,Paragraph
Space and industrial culture,Title

Paxton devised a system of structural iron elements holding the largest,Paragraph
"sheets of glass then available, fixed into timber ‘Paxton gutters’ supported",Paragraph

machined in the foundry to save filing them smooth on site. And special,Paragraph
machines were designed to produce several grooved and bevelled sash-bars,Paragraph
at once out of a single plank of timber. The shell of the Crystal Palace—,Paragraph
then the largest enclosed space in the world—was erected in just four,Paragraph
"months. Opening panels were added at high level to extract rising hot air,",Paragraph
and a timber slatted floor allowed cool air to be drawn in to replace it at low,Paragraph

Crystal Palace also anticipated the modern idea of space. Visitors circulated,Paragraph
"inside its grid of slender columns and spidery trusses, with countless",Paragraph
glimpses appearing and disappearing in a perpetual interlacing of structure.,Paragraph
"In long perspective, the grids of columns and glazing bars stretched almost",Paragraph
to infinity. The palace’s volume thus exemplified the mathematical,Paragraph

torch-bearing arm outwards from her body.,Paragraph
Eiffel’s tower was the centrepiece of another temporary exhibition of,Paragraph
technological wonders—the 1889 Paris World’s Fair—housed in pavilions,Paragraph
"around its base. Designed for rapid construction, it tapped his previous",Paragraph
experience. The tower was effectively a giant bridge pylon without the,Paragraph

sodden ground.,Paragraph
"Opened at a time when few aviators had flown, and aerial views were",Paragraph

"themselves at the forefront of technology. Glimpses soared skyward,",Paragraph
framing distant prospects: a cinematic experience before the popularization,Title
of cinema. Spiral stairs—sometimes locked deep in the structure and,Paragraph
sometimes flying precariously outside—became panoramic viewing,Paragraph
"devices. The tower was not universally popular, especially among Paris’s",Paragraph
elite—one of whom quipped that he preferred to eat at its restaurants,Paragraph
because it was only there that he couldn’t see it on the skyline. Sensitive to,Paragraph
"such criticism, Eiffel talked up the tower’s patriotic role for making military",Paragraph
"observations in the event of invasion, and topped it with a meteorological",Paragraph
laboratory to associate the tower with scientific enterprise. And it quickly,Paragraph
"became a tourist staple, now characterizing Paris in countless depictions,",Paragraph
"models, and novelty paperweights.",Paragraph
"Around the time the Eiffel Tower was imagined, the idea of space was",Paragraph
being contested in German language art criticism by theorists like Conrad,Paragraph
"Fiedler, Gottfried Semper, and August Schmarsow. In 1846, Karl Bétticher",Paragraph
had understood architectural style as an integration of systems of,Paragraph
"production and symbolization, proposing a new, similar, integration for",Paragraph

"monumentally, the structures of society. Architecture, he believed, should",Paragraph
"give order to culture, and symbolize culture, particularly through its",Paragraph
"Bekleidung, meaning ‘clothing’ or ‘cladding’. That word ‘cladding’ became",Paragraph
important. It helped modern architects to imagine facades as curtains hung,Paragraph
"around spaces, rather than as heavy structures enclosing them. Meanwhile,",Paragraph
"Schmarsow’s ‘room theory’, 1893, argued that dynamic bodily movement",Paragraph
around space offered a better way to appreciate architecture than the static,Paragraph
viewing of forms.,Paragraph
Adrian Forty has highlighted that such theories about space—which entered,Paragraph
English-language debates about modern architecture only in the 20th,Paragraph
"century via writers including Adolf Loos, Alois Riegel, and Siegfried",Paragraph
"Giedion—were adopted only imprecisely by modern architects, who",Paragraph
conflated them awkwardly. Forty reflected how modern architects came to,Paragraph
"understand space—imprecisely—as both something static, contained within",Paragraph
"walls, and something dynamic, flowing through architecture. They",Paragraph
imagined it as an abstract mathematical grid but also understood it from the,Paragraph
bodily viewpoint of individuals moving around. They saw space as,Paragraph
"simultaneously tightly bounded, and with infinite extent. And they",Paragraph
"imagined it both as an abstract idea, and as ‘stuff’ that architects could",Paragraph
shape. The emerging vocabulary of space in modem architecture was thus,Paragraph
sometimes muddled. But it’s no coincidence that it began forming when the,Paragraph
"fleshless skeletons of the early railway terminals, Crystal Palace, and Eiffel",Caption
"Tower were constructed, because the heightened experiences of those",Paragraph
structures illustrated vividly how the idea of space could be imagined.,Paragraph
"Sullivan, Wright, and the separation of wall from structure",Title
A sequence of innovations in the latter part of the 19th century transformed,Paragraph
"iron technology, resulting in the widespread production of a less brittle",Paragraph
variant called mild steel. The inventor Henry Bessemer successfully blew,Paragraph
"cold air through molten iron at his London bronze-powder factory in 1856,",Paragraph
"wholly ‘decarburising’ it. He licensed his process to manufacturers, but it",Paragraph
tumed out that his innovation relied on low-phosphorous iron ore—which,Paragraph
wasn’t widely available—and it stalled. It took amateur chemist Sidney,Paragraph
Gilchrist Thomas to resolve how to remove phosphorous from iron to solve,Paragraph
"the problem, successfully producing a batch of steel in April 1879. Parallel,",Paragraph
"developments in iron rolling—by John Alleyne, for example, to fabricate",Paragraph
"sections of St Pancras station’s roof—matured through the 1860s. By 1890,",Paragraph
the combination of the basic Bessemer process with improved rolling mills,Paragraph
—alongside other refinements—resulted in bigger sections and longer,Paragraph
lengths of steel whose chemistry could be controlled to achieve different,Paragraph
"material properties. In architecture, this meant that trusses and arches made",Paragraph
"of smaller, brittle iron components could be replaced, up to certain lengths,",Paragraph
"by single, ductile steel beams or columns. And trusses made of mild steel",Paragraph
"elements could cover longer spans. Steel construction thus became easier,",Paragraph
"faster, and cheaper than iron. The new material eventually yielded new",Paragraph
"architectural imagery, but it took architects decades to work that out.",Paragraph
"By 1890, technical initiative in steel production had shifted from Europe to",Paragraph
"America. Chicago was an important centre; characterized, into the 20th",Paragraph
"century, by sparks from its Bessemer converters puncturing night-time",Paragraph
views of Lake Michigan. Various architects from Chicago’s substantial,Caption
"German immigrant community knew Semper’s ideas, but the rapid",Paragraph
development of steel-framed buildings there owed more to commercial,Paragraph
motivations than theoretical ones. Chicago was destroyed in a catastrophic,Paragraph
"fire in 1871. As reconstruction gathered pace, soaring land values",Paragraph
"encouraged developers and architects to build high, maximizing the lettable",Paragraph
area on each plot to maximize revenues. After the inventor Elisha Otis,Paragraph
"made hydraulic elevators safe, increasing the number of floors that could be",Paragraph
"accessed easily, the primary constraint on tall buildings became the capacity",Paragraph
for structural masonry to bear load. The eighteen-storey Monadnock,Caption
"Building in Chicago’s downtown ‘Loop’, 1893, designed by Burnham and",Caption
"Root, demonstrated the limits of what was possible in brick, its massive",Paragraph
flared plinth illustrating the bulk of masonry needed to support the walls,Caption
above.,Paragraph
The idea that steel frames could exceed the height limits of brickwork came,Paragraph
not from architects but the local steel industry. The first building to hang its,Paragraph
external walls from a Bessemer steel frame was the Home Insurance,Paragraph
"Building in the Loop, designed by William LeBaron Jenney, 1885; followed",Caption
"by Holabird and Roche’s Tacoma Building, 1888. Rapid construction was",Paragraph
"achieved by suspending brick, stone, and terracotta work from the frame,",Paragraph
permitting its completion in advance of the external walls. Those walls—no,Paragraph
longer loadbearing—thus became separated conceptually from the,Paragraph
"building’s structure, echoing Semper’s ideas about cladding. Louis Sullivan,",Paragraph
"of Chicago firm Adler and Sullivan, developed this approach in the",Paragraph
"Wainwright Building, St Louis, 1890, and the Guaranty Building, Buffalo,",Caption
"1895. However, just as Ironbridge’s iron bridge took the shape of a masonry",Paragraph
"arch, early steel-framed buildings designed by Chicago architects seemed",Paragraph
constrained by established architectural imagery. Sullivan initially,Paragraph
understood these projects primarily as a decorative problem about the,Paragraph
"proper expression of tall buildings, more than an opportunity for a new",Paragraph
architectural logic.,Paragraph
"Adler and Sullivan’s substantial, complex, intricately detailed Auditorium",Paragraph
"Building in Chicago’s Loop was completed in 1889, wrapping an opera",Paragraph
"house with offices, hotel rooms, and a seventeen-storey tower. Its ingenious",Paragraph
"section, constructed in steel frame within masonry walls, resolved",Paragraph
practically the differing needs of diverse accommodation. The theatre was,Paragraph
"the first lit by electric light, also employing a novel system to circulate air.",Paragraph
And its innovative steel and concrete ‘raft’ foundations were loaded up with,Paragraph
weights that were removed while the building was constructed to avoid,Paragraph
different parts settling at different rates. Integrating its framed structure,Paragraph
"with new building services, the Auditorium Building seemed to be",Paragraph
imagined as a technological machine.,Paragraph
"Critic Colin Rowe argued in a 1956 essay, ‘Chicago Frame’, that—although",Paragraph
Sullivan and his contemporaries didn’t grasp the full implications of what,Paragraph
they were doing—they changed architecture. They integrated new,Paragraph
"technologies into building, valuing practicality, simplicity, and innovation.",Paragraph
"More importantly, they pointed the way towards a new steel-framed",Paragraph
"architectural logic, illustrating the separation of cladding from structure.",Paragraph
Rowe emphasized the significance of this. “The frame has come to possess,Paragraph
"a value for contemporary architecture,’ he wrote,",Paragraph
equivalent to that of the column for classical antiquity and the Renaissance ... The frame,Paragraph
"establishes throughout the building a common ratio to which all the parts are related; and, like",Paragraph
"the vaulting bay in the Gothic cathedral, it prescribes a system to which all parts are",Paragraph
subordinate.,Paragraph
Rowe linked the innovations of downtown Chicago’s steel-framed,Paragraph
‘skyscrapers’ with the work of another architect working in that city’s,Paragraph
"suburbs, Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright, who assisted Adler and Sullivan with",Paragraph
"the Auditorium Building, tested a set of ideas through a sequence of brick-",Paragraph
"and timber-built houses. These included: the Ward Willits House, Highland",Caption
"Park, Illinois, 1901; Darwin Martin House, Buffalo, 1904; and Frederick",Caption
"Robie House, Chicago, 1907. Before modernity, most buildings in the West",Caption
were constructed from masonry and timber: a combination controlled by the,Paragraph
"timber sizes that could be cut efficiently from logs, preferring floor spans of",Paragraph
6 metres or less. Masonry and timber thus tend to produce groups of,Paragraph
"rectangular rooms enclosed by loadbearing walls holding up the floors, their",Paragraph
architectural logic implying a series of cellular rooms surrounded by heavy,Paragraph
"walls with small openings. Wright’s designs tested, within the constraints of",Paragraph
"those materials, how far conventional four-square masonry boxes could be",Paragraph
dissolved. He experimented with: interlocking spaces at the corners of,Paragraph
"rooms, achieved using concealed steel lintels; a central hearth expressed as",Paragraph
a ‘pinwheel’ around which those interlocking spaces were arranged;,Paragraph
horizontal lines expressed in roofs and window strips to cheat the,Paragraph
appearance of weighty masonry; and interior spaces linked to their,Paragraph
surrounding landscape by loggias and plane walls extending outwards from,Paragraph
the buildings.,Paragraph
Images of Wright’s work were published in Germany in 1911. They became,Paragraph
"influential in Europe, like images of Chicago’s steel-framed towers had",Paragraph
"previously, and both contributed to the slow emergence of a distinctive",Paragraph
architectural expression for the steel frame there during the first half of the,Paragraph
20th century. While the frame developed quickly as a commercial and,Paragraph
"technical expedience in America, straightforwardly symbolizing trade and",Paragraph
"industry, Rowe argued, European architects only embraced it slowly,",Paragraph

New images of modernity,Title
The architectural idea of the steel frame became represented strikingly in,Paragraph
"Vladimir Tatlin’s Monument to the Third International, 1920—an unbuilt",Caption
project for which only a handful of drawings and model photographs,Paragraph
"survive. The Monument followed the 1917 Russian Revolution, when",Paragraph

collective living. It was claimed for ‘constructivism’: a movement calling,Paragraph
"for art to ‘go into the factory, where the real body of life is made’, rejecting",Paragraph
"elite art to propose instead ‘non-utilitarian constructions’, fusing life with",Paragraph
art through industry and mass production. Far from the rectangular grids of,Paragraph
"office buildings in Chicago, Tatlin’s tower proposed a leaning spiral of",Paragraph
"columns and diagonal bracing, propped on an inclined pylon, with three",Caption

"would revolve once a month. On top of that, a cylinder, rotating once a day,",Paragraph
"would issue forth newspapers, proclamations, and pamphlets (spinning the",Paragraph
spin doctors!). The tower’s form derived from structural logic but was,Paragraph

"Babel, and the Eiffel Tower, substituting their supposedly static images with",Paragraph

rectilinear floors and rooms but instead became a remarkable three-,Paragraph
dimensional volume. The image of Tatlin’s tower was unique in modern,Paragraph
"architecture, sticking in architects’ imaginations.",Paragraph
Another image of the steel frame that became a key reference was the,Paragraph
"administration block of the Fagus shoe-last factory at Afeld, Germany,",Paragraph
"1913, designed by Walter Gropius and Hannes Meyer (Figure 4). It’s the",Paragraph

hailed (inaccurately) as the first glass ‘curtain wall’—named after Semper’s,Paragraph

"right at the junction. At a time when masonry walls were normal, always",Paragraph
"thickest at corners for structural reasons, this detail—linked to Wright’s",Paragraph
"opening up of corners—appeared strikingly light and free-floating,",Paragraph
apparently suggesting that interior and exterior spaces could flow into one,Paragraph

technology—became another key element of modern architecture.,Paragraph
"4. Administration block for the Fagus factory, Afeld, Germany, 1913.",Caption
A key reference for early modern architects. Its distinctive components,Paragraph

Hannes Meyer.),Paragraph
"Inspired by Wright’s houses, architects continued to test how spaces could",Paragraph
be imagined if rigid masonry rooms became dissolved and walls became,Paragraph

"enclosing a series of cells, walls could thus be reimagined as screening but",Paragraph

Chicago—European thinking about the steel frame as a symbol of,Paragraph
"modernity, with American talent for steel fabrication, in conjunction with",Paragraph
"the planar thinking previously cultivated by Wright, Gropius, and Rietveld.",Paragraph
Mies and his colleagues treated the IIT project like a scientific experiment.,Paragraph
"They sought a rational planning grid for the whole site, testing alternative",Paragraph
"geometries for combinations of laboratories, lecture theatres, and",Paragraph
"classrooms, eventually determining that a 7.3-metre grid could",Paragraph
accommodate them all successfully. This grid was laid across the twelve-,Paragraph

pursued. Some saw the studio as a blank canvas accentuating the vibrancy,Paragraph
"of human life within. Others understood its abstract qualities, and its",Paragraph
"tendency to make its inhabitants self-police their behaviour, as rigid and",Paragraph
autocratic.,Paragraph
It’s seldom done in histories of modern architecture to note that the exposed,Paragraph
"steelwork of Mies’s IIT buildings, paired with thin brickwork panels and",Paragraph
"single-glazed windows, made the buildings perishingly cold in Chicago’s",Paragraph
"freezing winters, and unbearably hot in summer. It’s also rare to mention",Paragraph

authoritarian power.,Paragraph
Mies in the sky,Title
Mies’s talent for making architectural images in steel was strikingly,Paragraph
demonstrated by his office’s high-rise buildings from the 1950s and 1960s.,Paragraph
These drew inspiration from an early project.,Paragraph
"In 1921, Mies entered an architectural competition for a site on",Paragraph
Friedrichstrasse in Berlin with a design for a skyscraper. He made two,Paragraph
striking photomontages celebrating the literal transparency of all-glass,Paragraph
facades: one showing floor to ceiling glazing enigmatically reflecting the,Caption
sky in daylight; the other illustrating its see-through qualities when lit from,Paragraph
"within at night. Although they didn’t win Mies the competition, these",Paragraph
"images later became famous, anticipating the modern tower block.",Paragraph
The first steel towers built to the designs of Mies’s office were twin,Paragraph
"apartment blocks overlooking Lake Michigan, turned at 90 degrees to each",Paragraph
"other, connected with a slender low-level canopy, known as 860-880 Lake",Paragraph
"Shore Drive. Internal ‘cores’ provided the buildings’ structural stability,",Paragraph
"accommodating the elevators and vertical services. Individual flats, eight",Caption
"per floor, were laid out around the cores, designed as open spaces, with",Paragraph
fitted furniture and sliding screens substituting for most walls and doors.,Paragraph
"Structurally, a grid of primary steel columns was placed inside the outer",Paragraph
"edges of the towers’ floors, encased in concrete for fireproofing.",Paragraph
"Prefabricated secondary steel elements were then fixed to the facade,",Paragraph
"expressed as vertical I-sections, four per structural bay. These steels",Paragraph
supported aluminium-framed windows and provided so-called lateral,Paragraph
"bracing, reinforcing the building against wind loads. A small break in the",Paragraph
secondary steels at every floor level illustrated visually on the fagade that,Paragraph
"these secondary steels weren’t continuous, and therefore weren’t primary",Paragraph
"supports for the building. But, to the consternation of Mies fans, every fifth",Paragraph
I-section was fitted directly over a concrete-encased primary steel column.,Paragraph
"These steels thus had no structural purpose, added instead to maintain the",Paragraph
rhythm of the fagade. For good modernists accustomed to Mies’s dictum,Paragraph
"that ‘less is more’, and Sullivan’s ‘form ever follows function’, these steels",Paragraph
"remained unnecessary. They were functionally redundant adornments,",Paragraph
"serving only the visual image of the tower, and they became objects of",Paragraph
controversy among modern architects.,Paragraph
Just as Mies imagined the Minerals and Metals Building as a prototype for,Paragraph
"campus architecture, Lake Shore Drive was envisaged as a prototype for",Paragraph
steel-framed towers. The formula was refined in a series of projects,Paragraph
accommodating diverse functions: further apartments on Commonwealth,Paragraph
"Promenade in Chicago, 1956; courtrooms at the Dirksen Federal Building",Caption
"in Chicago’s Loop, 1964; and offices for distillers Seagram in New York,",Paragraph
1958. The same elements recurred: ‘shell-and-core’ planning (an internal,Paragraph
"core containing services and elevators, surrounded by floorplates), and",Paragraph
‘curtain’ facades characterized by I-section steels.,Paragraph
"The Seagram building, designed with Philip Johnson, was a refined and",Paragraph
expensive variation on the theme (Figure 8). Liquor baron Samuel,Caption
"Bronfman, the client, was egged on by his daughter, Phyllis Lambert, who",Paragraph
trained as an architect at IIT. Rather than stepping back from the street like,Paragraph
"most New York skyscrapers, maximizing the building’s volume within strict",Paragraph
"zoning laws, Seagram was a straightforward rectangular block. Facade I-",Paragraph
sections were special castings in bronze rather than stock steel sections.,Paragraph
Key interior surfaces were clad in marble and travertine. A band of artificial,Paragraph
lighting around the perimeter of each ceiling heightened the drama of the,Paragraph
building’s stacked floorplates when seen from below at night. Glazed,Paragraph
internal office partitions were designed to emphasize the open plan layout.,Paragraph
"Venetian blinds were fitted with only three settings—open, closed, and half-",Paragraph
closed—to present an orderly image to the street. A modern art programme,Paragraph
"commissioned murals, tapestries, and canvases from luminaries including",Paragraph
"Pablo Picasso and Mark Rothko. And a plain granite plaza outside, lifted",Caption
"three steps from the street, made a calm garden. Seagram became the",Paragraph
archetypal steel and glass tower. It became both typical and exceptional: a,Paragraph

"for the modern tower. Both typical and exceptional, it is both a refined",Paragraph
"building for a specific client on a specific site, and a universal symbol",Paragraph
"of corporate modernity, imitated globally. (Architect: Ludwig Mies van",Paragraph
der Rohe.),Paragraph
The details of Mies’s towers—like columns placed for visual effect as,Paragraph
"cladding over structural ones, and decorative steel casings fitted around",Paragraph
structural columns—didn’t always express their structural logic directly.,Paragraph
"But they did always illustrate its idea. Mies’s towers, like most modern",Paragraph
buildings were ‘representational’: they didn’t represent ideas about the past,Paragraph
"like previous architectures had, but engaged instead in self-representation,",Paragraph
expressing—and sometimes subtly enhancing—the imagery of their own,Paragraph
constructional logic to evoke ideas about modernity.,Paragraph
Shaping modern culture in steel,Title
"In 1831, Victor Hugo had anticipated a modern architecture reflecting",Paragraph
"scientific culture, arguing for special buildings, which people could identify",Paragraph
with as symbols of the age. Mies believed that his work fulfilled this,Paragraph
"promise. Indeed, his fans likened the I-section steels of Lake Shore Drive to",Paragraph
"the tracery of medieval Gothic cathedrals. ‘True architecture,’ Mies",Paragraph
"claimed, ‘is always objective and is the expression of the inner structure of",Paragraph
"our times, from which it comes’. He didn’t just think he was designing",Paragraph
individual buildings for individual sites and clients. He thought he was,Paragraph
"isolating the universal forms of architecture itself, paring down the logic of",Paragraph
steel—and building types like campus buildings and high-rise towers—to,Paragraph
"their essential images. Mies imagined himself not as inventing a style, but",Paragraph
"as identifying the authentic, timeless architectural expression of the future.",Paragraph
"Once the job of isolating these forms was done, Mies imagined he would",Paragraph
pass the images and techniques to others for repeating and refining. He,Paragraph
imagined he was designing bespoke prototypes for others to mass produce.,Paragraph
"Indeed, he lavished attention on the first campus buildings and towers",Paragraph
designed in his office but—once he felt the archetypes were established—,Paragraph
left later versions to his associates.,Paragraph
"Easily imagined as a kit of columns and beams, like the construction toy",Paragraph
"Meccano, iron and steel nurtured ideas about a perfected modern",Paragraph
architecture. Philosopher Walter Benjamin noted in 1935 how the imagery,Paragraph
of iron architecture was derived ‘dialectically’ out of the conflict between,Paragraph
"old symbolic codes developed for stone and wood, and new forms of",Paragraph
structural technology. Iron and steel frames encouraged the integration of,Paragraph
"structure with services, and ideas of ‘space’ with industrial production,",Paragraph
assembling buildings from sophisticated engineered components to express,Paragraph
ideas about technological modernity. The emphasis on the rational,Paragraph
structural calculation of components shifted design attention from the whole,Paragraph
"building to the part, just as scientific cultures shifted Western thinking from",Paragraph
traditional holistic religious views to a greater focus on the individual. Such,Paragraph
shifts were as latent in the Iron Bridge and Eiffel Tower as they were at,Paragraph
"Crown Hall and Seagram. The job of the architect-genius, as Mies",Paragraph
"‘modestly’ understood himself in later life, was to work through the cultural",Paragraph
"and social consequences of new logics of production, to determine the true",Paragraph
"architectural forms of modernity. For him, the material best suited to those",Paragraph
labours was steel.,Paragraph

storey villa for his family in the Parisian suburb of Bourg-la-Reine in 1904,Paragraph
"(Figure 9), demonstrating his firm’s talents with the material that made his",Paragraph
"fortune. Architectural critics were snobbish about the house’s eccentricities,",Paragraph
but it remains an object of fascination because of Hennebique’s global,Paragraph
domination of reinforced concrete construction at the start of the 20th,Paragraph
century.,Paragraph
"9. Villa Hennebique, Bourg-la-Reine, Paris, France, 1904. A show-off",Caption
"house designed by an entrepreneur for his family, displaying novel uses",Paragraph
for reinforced concrete. It reflected Hennebique’s global domination of,Paragraph
reinforced concrete construction at the beginning of the 20th century.,Paragraph
(Designer: Francois Hennebique.),Caption
Reinforced concrete lends itself to a structural form called the cantilever—,Paragraph
"where a slab or bear is hung outwards from one side, suspended without",Paragraph
"columns, counter-weighted by a mass of structure behind. The Hennebique",Caption
villa incorporated every kind of cantilever possible at that time. Its floors,Paragraph
"stepped down to the rear as a series of terraces, covered with soil and",Paragraph
"densely planted as ‘hanging gardens’, illustrating concrete’s substantial",Paragraph
"load-bearing capacity. By contrast, the terrace balustrades showed how",Paragraph
"delicate concrete elements could become. Looming above the house,",Paragraph
"cantilevered out from it, was a sculptural concrete water tower, which",Paragraph
neighbours nicknamed ‘the minaret’. The villa’s external walls followed an,Paragraph
"innovative construction method, where concrete was poured in situ between",Paragraph
3-centimetre-thick precast concrete slabs. These slabs provided permanent,Paragraph
"formwork for structural concrete poured in behind, replacing the sacrificial",Caption
timber shuttering normally used to make temporary moulds for concrete,Paragraph
"construction. They served to conceal the concrete poured on site, whose",Paragraph
"finish could be unreliable, giving a more reliable precast finish, and were",Paragraph
"hand tooled to reveal the flint aggregate used in the mix, so they looked like",Paragraph
stone from a distance.,Paragraph
Hennebique didn’t invent reinforced concrete but commercialized it,Paragraph
"ingeniously. The ancient Romans had used concrete 2,000 years before,",Paragraph
working out how to make mortar by mixing kiln-dried lime with sand and,Paragraph
"water, adding stone dust to produce a paste that set hard when it dried in the",Paragraph
"air. They subsequently found that, by adding a natural compound of iron",Paragraph
"oxide and silica alumina, mortar could harden in large quantities",Paragraph
independently of the air. We now call this cement. Large quantities of,Paragraph
cement poured around broken bricks and fragments of stone were employed,Paragraph
to make the first concrete walls in Rome in the 2nd century BCE (although,Paragraph
"the name concrete, describing cement combined with masonry aggregate,",Paragraph
didn’t emerge until the 19th century). The most significant Roman,Paragraph
invention—when concrete started to find its own architectural logic—was,Paragraph
"the vaulted concrete floor, an important invention for the Roman empire",Paragraph
because of its scarcity of timber. And the most spectacular survival of,Paragraph
"Roman concrete is the soaring dome of the Pantheon in Rome, (probably)",Paragraph
completed in 125 cE.,Paragraph
"Historically, concrete was strong in compression but poor in tension. It",Paragraph
"proved itself as a material for walls, vaults, and domes—which carry loads",Paragraph
in compression—but not for beams and spans—reliant on tension. And,Paragraph
"because the outcome of each concrete pour could be temperamental,",Paragraph
"depending on the precise mix, the temperature and humidity when it was",Paragraph
"poured, as well as the builder’s skill in achieving a reliable outcome,",Paragraph
concrete wasn’t widely used between Roman and Victorian times.,Paragraph
The structures required by 19th-century industries and infrastructures,Paragraph
"revived interest in concrete, however. As skills in working the material",Paragraph
"gradually improved, inventors tried combining it with iron. Iron was",Paragraph
stronger in tension but weaker in compression—the opposite properties to,Paragraph
"concrete—and the combination of materials held promise. In 1854, a",Paragraph
"plasterer called William Boutland Wilkinson from Newcastle-upon-Tyne,",Paragraph
"UK, patented a method for inserting iron barrel hoops as tension rods at the",Paragraph
"crown of concrete vaults. In 1875, William Henry Lascelles, a London",Caption
"building contractor, filed a patent for strengthening concrete panels with",Paragraph
"iron rods, and strengthening concrete floors with wire mesh. In 1877,",Paragraph
"Thaddeus Hyatt, a New York manufacturer, published an account of fifteen",Paragraph
"years’ experimentation with reinforced concrete, establishing that iron",Paragraph
reinforcement added to the bottom of a concrete beam would cope with,Paragraph
"tension, while concrete at the top would handle compression, countering",Paragraph
what engineers call ‘bending moments’ to produce rigid structural elements.,Paragraph
He also established that iron covered with concrete would remain,Paragraph
"undamaged in fire, promoting ‘ferro-concrete’ as a fireproof material.",Paragraph
Experiments and patents multiplied towards the end of the 19th century.,Paragraph
Hennebique’s own innovations weren’t extraordinary. He substituted steel,Paragraph
"reinforcement for iron, and spaced steel straps closer together near the ends",Paragraph
of beams where structural loads were greater. It was his patents filed in,Paragraph
"1892, however, that established his fortune. His genius lay in recognizing",Paragraph
the commercial opportunities those patents established. As soon as they,Paragraph
"were signed, Hennebique sold his contracting concern and established a",Paragraph
reinforced concrete construction consultancy. It provided engineering,Paragraph
"drafting services, licensing only reliable contractors to construct its designs.",Paragraph
"And it guarded its intellectual property jealously, challenging infringements",Paragraph
"with legal action. In 1892, the Hennebique firm employed two engineer-",Paragraph
"draughtsmen in Paris, growing by 1894 to fifty-six engineers supplying",Paragraph
"drawings to fifty-five licensed contractors, and by 1909 to sixty-two",Paragraph
drafting offices around the world. If a client wanted a steel-reinforced,Paragraph
"concrete-framed building at the beginning of the 20th century, they had",Paragraph
"little choice but to use a patented system, among which Hennebique’s was",Paragraph
most prominent. The firm’s magazine Le Beton Armé (Reinforced Concrete),Caption
promoted its technical expertise and extended concrete’s aura of innovation.,Paragraph
Hennebique thus established the idea of the professional construction,Paragraph
"consultancy, which was as important to the emergence of modern",Paragraph
architecture as any of the buildings discussed in this book.,Paragraph
Hennebique’s house thus indicated how reinforced concrete could,Paragraph
"symbolize the new, prefiguring the emergence of a technically oriented",Paragraph
construction industry. It anticipated the higher status and value that,Paragraph
gradually became accorded to design skills over craft skills. It also,Paragraph
illustrates how entrepreneurial modern architects and engineers learnt they,Paragraph
could monetize intellectual property and professional expertise—be it,Paragraph
technical prowess or visual innovation—as much as designing buildings.,Paragraph
Ethics of production and living,Title
"Beginning as a gloopy liquid but setting hard, reinforced concrete is a",Paragraph
"troublesome commodity. In philosophy, ‘concrete’ refers to something",Paragraph
"immediately present. However, as Adrian Forty has shown, many thinkers",Paragraph
have struggled with the contradictory qualities of this demanding material.,Paragraph
"Famous for making dramatic forms, concrete has no form of its own,",Paragraph
merely shaped by the formwork into which it is poured. Seemingly,Paragraph
"substantial, cement only becomes strong when combined with aggregate",Paragraph
"and steel. While the ingredients of concrete are natural, it grew to",Paragraph
"symbolize the human-made world. And, while it’s been imagined as",Paragraph
"timeless, concrete frequently came to represent the new because of its",Paragraph
difference from other materials. It was attributed a moral rightness because,Paragraph
its finished surfaces bear ‘honest’ traces of how they were worked. Less,Paragraph
"legible than steel’s kit of parts, however, concrete became a curious",Paragraph
architectural symbol of technological modernity.,Paragraph
American architect Albert Kahn matched Francois Hennebique for,Paragraph
"commercial nous, remarking that ‘architecture is 90% business and 10%",Paragraph
"art’. His office, mixing architects and engineers, designed no-nonsense",Paragraph
"buildings for industry, developing early expertise in reinforced concrete.",Paragraph
Concrete stood for an ethic of production in the early factories his,Paragraph
organization designed.,Paragraph
"In 1909, Kahn’s office designed the Automobile Assembly Building for",Paragraph
"motorcar pioneer Henry Ford’s Highland Park plant in Detroit, Michigan",Caption
(Figure 10). It was laid out around the production line for Ford’s ‘Model T’;,Paragraph
"the vehicle, produced between 1908 and 1927, which opened up motoring",Paragraph
to ordinary Americans. Early cars were made using traditional,Paragraph
"coachbuilding techniques, where the vehicle stayed in one place, worked on",Paragraph
by a sequence of skilled trades. Ford instead refined a method of keeping,Paragraph
"trades and machines static while cars moved between them, calculating",Paragraph
assembly processes around the space needed for each task and the time,Paragraph
taken to execute it—which became elevated into the so-called Fordist,Paragraph
theory of industrial production. Ford’s thinking promoted the methodical,Paragraph
process of goods through a workshop and the consignment of tasks to,Paragraph

"After being deposited by their chauffeur, the Savoyes entered the lobby,",Paragraph
"enclosed floor to ceiling with industrial glazing, as reminiscent of a factory",Paragraph
as of a house. A washbasin was placed here symbolically. It had multiple,Paragraph
"meanings, standing for: the modern preoccupation with health and hygiene;",Paragraph

that artist René Duchamp displayed controversially in an art gallery in,Paragraph
"1917, entitled ‘Fountain’, and claimed as a ‘readymade’ ‘object-type’ as",Paragraph
"culturally significant as any artwork. From here, the Savoyes ascended a",Paragraph
steep ramp cut through the centre of the house to reach the first floor. This,Paragraph
storey appeared solid from the outside—characterized by a horizontal strip,Paragraph
of windows running around all four elevations—but it was partly hollowed,Paragraph
out to provide an open sundeck accessed from the living spaces and,Paragraph
"bedrooms. The appearance of solidity was maintained because the facades,",Paragraph
"and their window strips, sailed across the front of the deck. The house’s",Paragraph
living spaces were strikingly light-filled in comparison to conventional,Paragraph
"masonry buildings. Finishes blended industrial and domestic imagery,",Paragraph
evoking the decks of ocean liners and train interiors. The bathroom,Paragraph
associated with the master bedroom was expressed as a shrine to cleanliness,Paragraph
"and ‘primitiveness’, centred on a sinuous recliner for naked relaxation.",Paragraph
The second flight of the ramp led to a roof terrace with a highly modelled,Paragraph
"enclosing wall. Notionally a windbreak, this curved plane served a",Paragraph
"primarily sculptural purpose when seen from outside, as a cylinder placed",Paragraph
artfully above the rectangle of the first floor.,Caption
There are as many interpretations of Villa Savoye as there are numerous,Paragraph
academic texts about it. It’s been seen as a fulfilment of two formulas for,Paragraph
modern architecture promoted by Corbusier in the 1920s. The first was the,Paragraph
cinematic idea of ‘architectural promenade’—extending Schmarsow’s,Paragraph
"theories, and discussed in Corbusier’s 1923 book Towards a New",Paragraph
Architecture—claiming that space is primarily appreciated by moving,Paragraph
"around it. In this context, Villa Savoye’s ramp can be understood as a",Paragraph
"promenade device, unfolding the house’s sequence of rooms. The second",Paragraph
"formula it exemplified was Corbusier’s ‘five points for a new architecture’,",Paragraph
"published in The New Spirit in 1926, attempting a scientific categorization",Paragraph
of modern architecture’s ‘teenage uniform’ into key elements:,Paragraph
"1. The replacement of loadbearing masonry walls with a grid of reinforced concrete columns,",Caption
called piloti;,Paragraph
"2. The free plan, imagining walls as planes in space liberated from their structural function by",Caption
interior columns;,Paragraph
"3. The free facade, recognizing that structural columns liberate elevations from bearing loads;",Caption
"4. The horizontal window, made possible because non-loadbearing elevations allow openings to be",Caption
"placed differently, supposedly lighting rooms evenly, and;",Paragraph
"5. Roof gardens, compensating for the green space that a building consumes by replacing it on top",Caption
as a flat roof.,Paragraph
"Villa Savoye exemplified these points. Perched on piloti, with its roof",Paragraph
"garden highlighted by the sculptural windbreak, its columns were",Paragraph
"conspicuously detached from the walls, illustrating the ‘free plan’. And the",Paragraph
horizontal window strips emphasized how the walls above didn’t transfer,Paragraph
their loads to the ground but instead to the columns behind. Although,Paragraph
"Corbusier later moved away from these ‘five points’, architecture students",Paragraph
"love a formula, and they’ve remained doggedly persistent.",Paragraph
"Villa Savoye has also been read as a ship, a machine, an Arcadian",Paragraph
"landscape, a macho fantasy, and a bourgeois villa in socialist clothing.",Paragraph
"Others have seen it as a reinvention of a Greek temple: sat on a hilltop, with",Paragraph
"its facade divided—tike temple fronts—into three parts, with elevations",Paragraph
judiciously proportioned (according to a system Corbusier devised called,Paragraph
"‘regulating lines’). Like the ritual route to a temple’s sanctuary, climbing",Paragraph
Villa Savoye’s ramp has been seen as symbolizing an ascent to the gods.,Paragraph
The critic Sigfried Giedion emphasized that the house coincided with the,Paragraph
increasing acceptance of Albert Einstein’s theories of relativity—published,Paragraph
in 1905 and 1916—reimagining space and time as a single interdependent,Paragraph
continuum. Giedion linked architectural promenade—imagining buildings,Paragraph
"as experiences unfolded in space and time—to relativity, as an illustration",Paragraph
"of the idea of time being inseparable from space. Later historians, interested",Paragraph
"in theories of the body, emphasized instead the cleanliness demanded by the",Paragraph
"house, and its fixation with the naked figure.",Paragraph
Commentaries on Villa Savoye were conducted in building as well as,Paragraph
writing. Although Irish designer Eileen Gray’s house E.1027 was finished,Paragraph
"before Villa Savoye, in 1929, she knew it from prepublished drawings.",Paragraph
E.1027 was an alphabetic code combining Gray’s name with that of her,Paragraph
"collaborator Jean Badovici, editor of the magazine Living Architecture.",Paragraph
"Built for their use together, perched above the sea at Roquebrune-Cap-",Paragraph
"Martin near Monaco, the house initially subscribes to the ‘five points’",Paragraph
"(Figure 13). It was lifted on piloti with ribbon windows, a roof garden, and",Paragraph
internal walls expressed as planes detached from structural concrete,Paragraph
columns. But Gray challenged Corbusier’s work: the image of hygiene ‘to,Paragraph
"bore you to death’, and the ‘poverty’ of modern architecture stemming",Paragraph
‘from the atrophy of sensuality’. E.1027 was intimately tuned to its,Paragraph
"inhabitants, its bespoke furniture choreographing daily life. Materials were",Paragraph
chosen to enhance how the building was touched. Cupboards were tailored,Paragraph
"around their contents, selectively hidden or revealed. Light fittings and",Paragraph
radiators were integrated thoughtfully. Gray designed a gramophone trolley,Paragraph
"that could be wheeled outside, another with a cork surface to stop tea cups",Paragraph
"rattling, plus special chairs—some soft, some hard—for particular purposes.",Paragraph
"Light and shadow were thoughtfully composed, and windows were located",Paragraph
to frame views when inhabitants stood or sat in certain places. Combining,Paragraph
"elements from Villa Savoye and the Schréder House, E.1027 was more",Paragraph
mature than both: a striking image of architectural function fitted intimately,Paragraph
to the micro-rituals of daily life. The historian Beatriz Colomina has,Paragraph
"suggested that Corbusier visited and was jealous, struggling to accept that a",Paragraph
woman designed such an accomplished modern house. Staying there in,Paragraph
"1938, after Gray moved out, he exacted weird psychological revenge,",Paragraph
"Colomina argued, daubing eight murals depicting sexualized female figures",Paragraph
which changed E.1027’s character by dematerializing certain planes,Paragraph
visually: an act understood as vandalism.,Paragraph
"13. E.1027, Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, 1929. Combining",Caption
"elements from Villa Savoye and the Schréder House, this villa was",Paragraph
more mature than both: a striking image of architectural function,Paragraph
fitted intimately to the micro-rituals of daily life. Light and shadow,Paragraph
"were thoughtfully composed, with windows located to frame views",Paragraph
when inhabitants stood or sat in certain places. (Architect: Eileen,Paragraph
Gray.),Paragraph
"Other critiques of Villa Savoye included, in the 1980s, a series of houses",Paragraph
obsessively designed by architect Peter Eisenman around variations of grid,Paragraph
"and promenade. In 2001, the Australian practice ARM collaged a distorted",Paragraph
black replica of the Villa Savoye into the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres,Caption
"Strait Islander Studies in Canberra, to make a point about Western",Paragraph
colonists’ emasculation of indigenous traditions.,Paragraph
Some historians portrayed the planar white houses of early modern,Paragraph
architecture as stark and banal: as crude functionalism. But the artistry of,Paragraph
Villa Savoye and E.1027 illustrate how this argument is simplistic. Their,Paragraph
"imagery drew from supposedly everyday functional artefacts: aeroplanes,",Paragraph
"boats, trains, cars, and factories. But they also simultaneously manipulated",Paragraph
"and heightened those images, appreciating their significance as talismans of",Paragraph
"the age, reinventing them in architecture to advocate that high culture",Paragraph
should embrace global modernity.,Paragraph
The International Style,Title
"By the 1930s, enough buildings had been built with enough in common for",Paragraph
critics to claim a distinctive modern architecture. Two influential books set,Paragraph
"out genealogies, or studies in family resemblance.",Paragraph
"The International Style, published in 1932, catalogued an exhibition at New",Paragraph
"York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), presenting photographs and plans",Paragraph
of buildings that more or less complied with Corbusier’s ‘five points’. His,Paragraph
"work was shown alongside that of Mies and Gropius, their reputations only",Paragraph
emerging at that time. Other buildings given comparable emphasis were,Paragraph
designed by architects who became less effective self-publicists and have,Paragraph
"been largely forgotten including: Uno Ahren, Ludwig Kysela, J.J.P Oud,",Caption
"Lily Reich (the only woman), Nicolaiev & Fissenko, and Manora Yamada.",Paragraph
The show emerged from European road trips taken by MoMA’s director,Paragraph
"Alfred Barr with critic Henry-Russell Hitchcock and a history graduate,",Paragraph
Philip Johnson (who later retrained as an architect and collaborated with,Paragraph
Mies on the Seagram offices).,Paragraph
"Barr, Hitchcock, and Johnson argued that the buildings they depicted shared",Paragraph
an aesthetic resemblance. They presented them as progenitors of a,Paragraph
distinctive architectural style. Style in architecture was effectively a 19th-,Paragraph
"century idea, popularized by German writer Alois Riegel. It described a",Paragraph
predominantly visual approach to buildings where certain shapes and forms,Paragraph
characterize the architectures of particular historical epochs—no matter that,Paragraph
individual buildings get produced in different places at different times by,Paragraph
"different people under different social, cultural, and political conditions.",Paragraph
"‘Classical’, ‘Baroque’, ‘Gothic’, and ‘Gothic Revival’ styles have been",Paragraph
"defined, for example, spanning extensive time periods and geographies.",Paragraph
Styles are thus ideas projected back onto architectures of the past by,Paragraph
historians. The International Style claimed modern architecture as a style,Paragraph
"like other styles, characterizing it as functional, following three principles:",Paragraph
[an] emphasis on volume—space enclosed by thin planes or surfaces as opposed to the,Paragraph
suggestion of mass and solidity; regularity as opposed to symmetry or other kinds of obvious,Paragraph
"balance; and, lastly, dependence on the intrinsic elegance of materials, technical perfection",Paragraph
"and fine proportions, as opposed to applied ornament.",Paragraph
The idea that modern architecture could be depicted as a style was disputed,Paragraph
"by establishment architects of the time, who subscribed to older styles,",Paragraph
offended by what they saw as modernism’s blunt crudeness. Modern,Paragraph
"architects, on the other hand, disliked the show’s emphasis on aesthetics",Paragraph
"over function, thinking it over-simplified their work, believing instead that",Paragraph
"their designs demonstrated timeless technical and social principles. Indeed,",Paragraph
they suspected that characterizing modern architecture as a style sowed the,Paragraph
"seeds of its destruction, making it transitory, opening up space for",Paragraph
something else to follow.,Paragraph
Art historian Nikolaus Pevsner arrived in Britain from Germany shortly,Paragraph
"after MoMA’s show, sacked from Gottingen University by the Nazis for his",Paragraph
Jewishness. He brought enthusiasm for modernism—which he understood,Paragraph
as the true architectural expression of the age—and a desire to promote it to,Paragraph
"a sceptical British public, reflected in his book The Pioneers of Modern",Paragraph
"Architecture: From William Morris to Walter Gropius, 1936. Pevsner’s",Caption
story located the origins of modernism in the art theories of William Morris,Paragraph
and John Ruskin—who examined how mechanized industry was changing,Paragraph
"society, and argued that art and architecture should change in response.",Paragraph
"Pevsner identified provisional responses to this problem in the flowing,",Paragraph
naturally inspired shapes of Art Nouveau and the so-called Arts and Crafts,Paragraph
movement led by Morris—which sought to return to the handmade crafts of,Paragraph
preindustrial architecture—and also in 19th-century engineering structures,Paragraph
like railway sheds. But these were only transitional responses to,Paragraph
"industrialization, Pevsner argued, either rejecting modemity’s consequences",Paragraph
or failing to understand the full implications of industrial production. Only,Paragraph
"in the work of Gropius and the Bauhaus, he argued—in buildings like those",Paragraph
collected in The International Style—had the proper architectural,Paragraph
"expression of modernity been achieved. Although they didn’t get on, Barr,",Paragraph
"Hitchcock, and Johnson saw how Pevsner was reinforcing modern",Paragraph
"architecture by equipping it with a history and, in 1942, MoMA republished",Paragraph
an expanded edition of his book retitled The Pioneers of Modern Design.,Paragraph
These influential texts gave modern architecture momentum in the 1930s,Paragraph
and 1940s. But they also over-simplified it. They admitted modernism into,Paragraph
"the realm of high culture, but only through a 19th-century, premodern idea",Paragraph
"of architectural history as a sequence of visual styles. Nevertheless, the",Paragraph
arguments of these books became so pervasive that they continue to shape,Paragraph
how modern architecture remains understood.,Paragraph
Cities of tomorrow,Title
Modernity transformed Western cities through industrialization in the 19th,Paragraph
and early 20th centuries. Populations shifted from agricultural labour to,Paragraph
"industrial production, from dispersal on the land to concentrations around",Paragraph
"new work in offices and factories. Established cities grew substantially, and",Paragraph
"more were built. Much of this growth was unplanned and opportunistic,",Paragraph
driven by market forces and short-term necessities. Early industrial cities,Paragraph
"were frequently characterized by cramped living conditions, polluted air",Paragraph
"and water, little sanitation, bad health and hygiene, poor sunlight, and a lack",Paragraph
of green space. Infrastructures were often provided only in retrospect—,Paragraph
"railways, for example, retrofitted to shift goods and commuters, or paved",Paragraph
roads to accommodate motor traffic—choking urban life and public space.,Paragraph
"City ‘slums’ became widely condemned, often by well-to-do philanthropists",Paragraph
who associated bad conditions with moral depravity among the poor.,Paragraph

crescents and circuses of Georgian Bath; from the boulevards cut through,Paragraph
19th-century Paris by Baron Haussmann to the gridirons of Manhattan and,Paragraph
Chicago.,Paragraph
British inventor Ebeneezer Howard published a proposal for ‘Garden Cities,Paragraph
"of To-morrow’ in 1898, inspired by ideas about social reform and the",Paragraph
"authenticity of nature. He envisaged circular-plan ‘slumless, smokeless’",Paragraph
"towns of 32,000 people dispersed across an agricultural landscape,",Paragraph
"supposedly combining the best of town and country. Industry, retail, and",Paragraph
residential areas would be separated into concentric zones to promote,Paragraph
"public health. No Garden Cities were built following Howard’s formula, but",Paragraph
"some ‘garden villages’ and ‘garden suburbs’ were constructed in the 1910s,",Paragraph
"comprising picturesque cottages with gardens, designed by Arts and Crafts",Paragraph
architects. Their romantic imagery was later exploited by property,Paragraph
developers in the 1920s and ’30s who mass produced cheap copies as,Paragraph

"d’ Architecture Moderne), which included Gropius, Meyer, Mies, and",Paragraph
Rietveld. The group held its fourth meeting on a liner cruising from,Paragraph
"Marseilles to Athens, where they agreed principles for ‘the functional city’.",Paragraph
Corbusier wrote up these principles as the so-called ‘Athens Charter’ to suit,Paragraph
his own ends. It repeated familiar tropes: densifying accommodation into,Paragraph
slabs around green space; liberating the ground from traffic for parkland;,Paragraph
and separating out uses (like housing from industry and transport). In,Paragraph
"Radiant City, however, Corbusier added an extendable grid plan, organizing",Paragraph
the city’s functions according to the metaphor of a human body. The,Paragraph
business and administrative centre would be placed at the top of the plan as,Paragraph
"the ‘head’ of Radiant City. Residential areas below would form the ‘lungs’,",Paragraph
"set out in grid squares separated by major highways, with housing blocks",Paragraph
enclosing giant courtyards and gardens. The cultural centre comprised the,Paragraph
"‘heart’, beneath which was heavy industry, the ‘feet’. This time, everyone—",Paragraph
workers and managers—shared similar housing as part of an egalitarian,Paragraph
"technocratic society supposedly balancing urban and rural, work and family,",Paragraph
capitalism and centralized planning.,Paragraph
The closest that Radiant City came to realization was at the new city of,Paragraph
Chandigarh in India. When India and Pakistan were partitioned after,Paragraph
"independence in 1947, so was the state of Punjab. Its capital, Lahore, was",Paragraph
"allocated to Pakistan, and Indian Punjab decided to build a new capital.",Paragraph
Corbusier was appointed masterplanner after the original American,Paragraph
"architect died in 1951, and his designs for Chandigarh followed Radiant",Paragraph
"City principles. Its Parliament, High Court, and Secretariat buildings (also",Paragraph
"designed by Corbusier) are at the head, with various grid-plan ‘sectors’",Paragraph
"below containing housing, culture, commerce, and industry, separated by",Paragraph
highways. It may have been counter-intuitive at that time to design a car-,Paragraph
"oriented city for a population then with few cars, and to appoint a Western",Paragraph
"architect for a postcolonial capital, but Chandigarh has now become a",Paragraph
highly liveable city.,Paragraph
The ideals of Ville Contemporaine—planning cities around infrastructure,Title
with access for all to hygiene and green space; concentrating urban life into,Paragraph
"dense blocks; separating uses, and separating pedestrians from traffic; plus",Paragraph
the underlying conceit that an ideal city could be planned at all—remained,Paragraph
"largely polemical in the early 20th century. Garden City, Radiant City, and",Paragraph
"their counterparts were provocations: against slums, unplanned spraw],",Paragraph
"deprivation, and insanitary conditions; for the potential of modern",Paragraph
"technology, and planned infrastructure, to alleviate urban problems. In",Paragraph
"postwar times, however, after the extensive destruction of European, Soviet,",Paragraph
"and Asian cities, Corbusier’s provocations started to look plausibly",Paragraph
"buildable, inspiring numerous postwar reconstructions. Corbusier never",Paragraph
took Plan Voisin as seriously in 1925 as certain Western and Soviet planners,Paragraph
did after 1945. Some of them actually did collage likenesses of Ville,Paragraph
Contemporaine into the remains of historic cities. And they frequently did it,Paragraph
"too quickly and cheaply. The results were widely vilified. Indeed, disorder,",Paragraph
"density, and the restriction of planning—condemned in the early 20th",Paragraph
century—became reappraised in the early 21st as symbolizing urban,Paragraph
"spontaneity, vigour, and human freedom.",Paragraph
Brutal images,Title
The significant artistic and cultural outpouring following the First World,Paragraph
"War was decisive in the emergence of modern architecture, including the",Paragraph
"early projects of Gray, Rietveld, Mies, and Corbusier. But the aftermath of",Paragraph
the Second World War was different. Widespread destruction—and stark,Paragraph
memories of genocide—meant that the project of rebuilding seemed more,Paragraph
"raw in 1945 than it had in 1918. In places most affected, there was less",Paragraph
"desire to rethink, more an impetus simply to put life back together and forge",Paragraph
"a new normal. In urban design, this involved reaching for interwar",Paragraph
"templates that held promise. These included the idea of town planning and,",Paragraph
"sometimes, the formula of Ville Contemporaine. It also involved the",Paragraph
widespread adoption of modern architecture. The rise of conflict—,Paragraph
"particularly the rise of fascism—emerged, at least partly, out of ordinary",Paragraph
people’s disaffection with elites. Authorities wanted to highlight that the,Paragraph
"postwar world could be different, that renewed communities could be built",Paragraph
out of the ashes. And prewar experiments in modern architecture were,Paragraph
"already there, ripe for reconstruction, as readymade symbols of the new.",Paragraph
"Reinforced concrete—open to resculpting, always ambiguous enough to",Paragraph
have new meanings projected onto it—became an important medium for,Paragraph
refreshed architectural experiment.,Paragraph
Corbusier’s architecture caught the imagination of critics once more in the,Paragraph
"postwar years, despite his ambiguous wartime record (which involved",Paragraph
collaborating with the Nazi-sympathizing regime of Vichy France and also,Paragraph
being rejected by it). The reinvention of both his work and modern,Paragraph
architecture became symbolized by his studio’s so-called Unité,Paragraph

inaugurated in 1952 (Figure 15).,Paragraph

"While Corbusier primarily imagined the Unité as an idea about community,",Paragraph
"architectural critics focused instead on its appearance, shocked by its rough",Paragraph
concrete finishes. No attempt was made to hide the grain traced by,Paragraph
"individual boards of the concrete formwork, to reduce the number of so-",Paragraph
"called ‘blow holes’ pockmarking the surface, to polish-out marks where wet",Paragraph
"concrete slopped around the top of each ‘lift’ of formwork, or to repair",Paragraph
imperfections. Corbusier argued these decisions were economic—,Paragraph
"disingenuously, given that he was allowed to exceed standard state budgets",Paragraph
—and reflected human characteristics:,Title
"The defects shout at one from all parts of the structure! Luckily, we have no money! ...",Paragraph
"Exposed concrete shows ... incidents of the shuttering, the joints of the planks, the fibres and",Paragraph
"knots of the wood. [In] men and women do you not see the wrinkles and birthmarks, the",Paragraph
crooked noses ... ?,Paragraph
The commission was a sop to Corbusier when the French government was,Paragraph
"awarding big projects, including the rebuilding of war-damaged towns like",Paragraph
"St Dié and Le Havre, to other architects, The latter went to Auguste Perret,",Paragraph
for whom Corbusier had worked in the 1920s and who sought to refine,Paragraph
concrete surfaces as ‘poured stone’ in the tradition of Hennebique. The,Paragraph
"Unité rejected Perret’s perfectionist values, and Corbusier instead revelled",Paragraph
"deliberately in crude, gloopy concrete—named béton brut in French—",Paragraph
claiming he was elevating economic necessity into a symbol of the age.,Paragraph
Critics were also exercised by the Marseille Unité’s sculptural imagery.,Paragraph
"Gone were the delicate piloti of modernism’s early ‘uniform’, pumped up",Paragraph
instead as massive splayed legs. Gone were the sheer white planes with thin,Paragraph
"sills and drips, flattening elevations in an illusion of machine production,",Paragraph
replaced with deep brises soleil in primary colours. Gone was the curved,Paragraph
"plane of Villa Savoye’s sundeck, superseded by a roofscape of enigmatic",Paragraph
"concrete objects: funnels, a shell vault, blocks, and steps. The Unité",Paragraph
"illustrated a renewed concern for form, texture, and colour, echoing the",Paragraph
swelling shapes of Corbusier’s latest artworks inspired by full-bodied naked,Paragraph
"figures, and the so-called ‘primitive’ art of folk cultures. Architects who",Paragraph
subscribed to the ‘teenage uniform’ became troubled by what they saw as,Paragraph
"the Unité’s gratuitous ‘formalism’, and the ambiguity of its shapes.",Paragraph
Those shapes pursued what we would now call ‘intertextuality’. They,Paragraph
"played games with visual clues, hinting at forms—artistic, natural, and",Paragraph
industrial—which themselves hinted at other forms. The Unité’s imagery,Paragraph
"shared visual sources with interwar modernism, like factories, trains, and",Paragraph
"boats. But there was also another layer of subtler, stranger visual codes at",Paragraph
work which were altogether harder to place. These included echoes of,Paragraph
prehistoric sculptures and paintings—imagined as being timeless and before,Paragraph
"style, and associated with classlessness—acknowledging the war’s",Paragraph
disruption of traditional hierarchies and cultural codes. They also included,Paragraph
"references to wartime concrete bunkers and bomb shelters, and to Picasso’s",Paragraph
painting and sculpture (the artist spent a day with Corbusier discussing the,Paragraph
Marseille drawings). The Unité illustrated the idea that altered images of,Paragraph
modernity seemed necessary to express a revised postwar understanding of,Paragraph
"society and technology. Following mechanized warfare, incendiary bombs",Paragraph
—and especially the Nazi Holocaust and atomic bombs dropped on,Title
"Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 1945—technology no longer seemed such an",Paragraph
innocent emblem of progress. Numerous modern architects with little,Paragraph
"opportunity to build in wartime, or rejected by fascist regimes that favoured",Paragraph
"romanticized nationalistic imagery, had spent time strategizing for postwar",Paragraph
reconstruction at all scales: from Corbusier’s ideal cities to Jane Drew’s,Title
"designs for ideal kitchens. And, for Corbusier, the Unité’s béton brut, brises",Paragraph
"soleil, sculptural forms, and vivid colours fulfilled the promise of such",Paragraph
"strategies, yielding a revised imagery for postwar modern architecture,",Paragraph
proposing a kind of technological prehistory.,Paragraph
Intertextual imagery also characterized the other most striking postwar,Paragraph
"Corbusier project: the Chapel of Notre Dame du Haut, Ronchamp, 1949, on",Caption
"a hilltop surveying the Vosges mountains, replacing a chapel destroyed in",Paragraph

pulpit with an icon of the Virgin Mary skewered on a rod in a window,Caption
above. The chapel works on the levels of raw experience and academic,Paragraph
"sophistication, ambiguous enough to keep offering fresh meanings.",Paragraph
(Architect: Le Corbusier.),Caption
"The chapel was engineered to achieve the forms Corbusier wanted, rather",Paragraph
than following the logic of its materials. Its seemingly weighty roof was,Paragraph
actually constructed like an aeroplane wing from slender struts. The walls,Paragraph
"were not solid concrete, as they first appear, but instead concrete frame",Paragraph
"infilled with rubble from the previous chapel, or reinforcement mesh onto",Caption
"which cement was sprayed, all covered over with white render.",Paragraph
The chapel pursued Corbusier’s enigmatic ideas about order and balance.,Paragraph
"Charles Jencks likened its shape to ‘a nun’s cowl, a monk’s hood, a ship’s",Paragraph
"prow, praying hands ... [all] suggested ... and denied at the same time’. Its",Paragraph
"towers have been imagined as standing stones, Neolithic funerary",Paragraph
"monuments, and vessels. Its forms have been read in the erotic terms of the",Paragraph
"naked body, as bellies, buttocks and breasts, and its sprayed concrete as",Paragraph
human skin. The multiple meanings of its shapes echo Corbusier’s,Paragraph
"paintings, made concrete in search of poetic potential for postwar modern",Paragraph
"architecture. To his champions, the chapel represented a profoundly",Paragraph
"evocative rumination on human spirituality, its strange forms articulating",Paragraph
enigmatically the ineffable mysteries of existence.,Paragraph
"As with other kinds of intertextuality in film and literature, the more you",Paragraph
"know—in this instance about art, architecture, theology, and philosophy—",Paragraph
the more the chapel gives back. This is not to say that ‘clever’ readings are,Paragraph
"right and ‘unknowing’ readings are wrong. Rather, it works on the levels of",Paragraph
"both raw experience and academic sophistication, done with sufficient",Paragraph
ambiguity to keep offering fresh interpretations.,Paragraph
"Like the Unité, the chapel again broke the tentative conventions of modern",Paragraph
architecture. British architect James Stirling suggested that it prompted a,Paragraph
"‘crisis of rationalism’, its striking ‘plastic’ forms requiring committed",Paragraph
modernists to revisit the principles of their work. Ronchamp and the Unité,Paragraph
took concrete from a straightforward expression of modernity—replacing,Paragraph
loadbearing walls with frames and planes—to something altogether more,Paragraph
"complex, simultaneously modern and prehistoric. Both buildings spawned",Paragraph
"imitations, from close copies to comparable intertextual exercises.",Paragraph
"Corbusier built five more Unités in France and Germany, but it was the",Paragraph
Marseille block that became the model for swathes of Cold War housing in,Paragraph
both the free-market West and communist East. Despite being widely,Paragraph
"copied, it was rarely understood well by its imitators. Raw concrete, which",Paragraph
"fared adequately in Marseille’s hot dry climate, survived less well in",Paragraph
climates with damaging cycles of freeze and thaw. The Unité’s community,Paragraph
"facilities—shops, recreation roofscape, concierge, and lift attendants—",Paragraph
"rarely figured in the copies, producing housing silos that were often",Paragraph
"isolating, failing to mitigate anti-social behaviour. The Unité model thus",Paragraph
became condemned as a failure.,Paragraph
"In postwar decades, béton brut, and the intertextual form-making associated",Paragraph
"with it, symbolized a decisive rejection of the terror wrought by fascism. It",Paragraph
described a new beginning—imagined partly in relation to ancient,Paragraph
"beginnings—which aspired to recombine community, technology, and",Paragraph
"architecture with a renewed sense of purpose. Today, however, that",Paragraph
aspiration has been largely forgotten. Béton brut got tainted by the,Paragraph
reputation of failed high-rise housing. And that failure continues to colour,Paragraph
"how people think about concrete architecture, and—indeed—modem",Paragraph
architecture altogether.,Paragraph
Global brutalisms,Title
Using the term ‘brutalism’ to celebrate the architecture of béton brut must,Paragraph
rate as one of the worst promotional ideas ever. Banham popularized the,Paragraph
term in his 1966 book The New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic? It emerged,Paragraph
from young British architects’ reactions against postwar housebuilding,Title
"there, where cheap moderm-ish picturesque cottages became branded ‘the",Paragraph
new humanism’. Banham’s book collected the work of young architects,Paragraph
"who found this bland and who, inspired by the imagery of the Unité and",Paragraph
"Ronchamp, parodied it with a Corbusian ‘new brutalism’. Banham’s subtitle",Paragraph
illustrated how Brutalists believed their architecture had both a distinctive,Paragraph
"look and a moral purpose, adding expressive materials and bold shapes to",Paragraph
the interwar modern imagery of function and structure. Brutalism meant,Paragraph
"dramatic silhouettes, the clear display of structure, ‘primitive’ traditions in",Paragraph
"art, celebrating the ‘essences’ of materials in their raw ‘as-found’ state—not",Paragraph
"only, but importantly, reinforced concrete—and the nickname, ‘Brutus’, of",Paragraph
one of Banham’s friends: the male half of architect duo Alison and Peter,Paragraph
Smithson. The Smithsons’ own evolving definition focused more on,Paragraph
"Brutalism’s ‘ethic’, emphasizing concerns with people’s everyday lives.",Paragraph
"When Brutalism fell out of favour, the name allowed its detractors to",Paragraph
dismiss its buildings as brutal in their treatment of people. That’s how,Paragraph
"Brutalism is popularly remembered, forgetting how the term once declared",Paragraph
"ambitions for postwar rebuilding. Indeed, modern architecture’s detractors",Paragraph
have since expanded the term beyond what was recognized as Brutalism at,Paragraph
the time to dismiss pretty much any modern building they don’t like.,Paragraph
Banham’s British examples of Brutalism came from the offices of the,Paragraph
"Smithsons, Stirling and Gowan, Denys Lasdun, and Erné Goldfinger,",Paragraph
"adding examples from Western Europe, Japan, and the Americas. The term",Paragraph
"caught on, also employed to describe buildings from the offices of Paul",Paragraph
"Rudolph and Louis I. Kahn in the USA, and notably Kallmann, McKinnell,",Paragraph

"international than the International Style ever was, although influential",Paragraph
Western critics struggled to acknowledge its global diversity.,Paragraph
Brazil’s modern architecture did get noticed in the West following a MoMA,Paragraph

recognize that the trade in ideas was clearly mutual. Costa’s projects of the,Paragraph

Almost two-thirds of African nations were liberated from Western,Paragraph
colonizers between 1957 and 1966. Brutalism and béton brut frequently,Paragraph

Dutch architect John Habraken claimed the megastructure was a political,Paragraph

the state should provide infrastructure for housing—the ‘supports’—and,Paragraph
that people should construct buildings themselves within those supports. He,Paragraph
promoted ‘self-build’: empowering people to construct their own homes.,Paragraph
The image of Habraken’s megastructures diverged from Tange’s Brutalist,Paragraph
"consistency. They were characterized instead as a chaotic, spontaneous",Paragraph
assembly of homes expressing individual character. Habraken’s vision,Paragraph

"into megastructures, structure communities, and be formed with a profound",Paragraph
sense of human purpose. It could constitute the sleek surfaces of the five,Paragraph

"stemmed primarily from its potential to assume novel forms, and its",Paragraph
"capacity to portray intertextual references. Somehow, reinforced concrete",Paragraph

"long history of brick as a material. Brick, in the work of architects like",Paragraph
"Team 10, denoted that modernity might be understood less as a new",Paragraph
beginning for human history than as an extension of it.,Paragraph
Many global cultures have traditions of clay or mud brick construction.,Paragraph
Evidence exists of the use of fired brick as long ago as 5000 BcE in,Paragraph
"Mesopotamia, and of decorative brickwork in Babylon in approximately",Paragraph
"2300 BcE. In Ancient Rome, fired clay bricks were first used for",Paragraph
"strengthening the corners of buildings and openings in walls, then for whole",Paragraph
buildings from the Age of Augustus (63 BCE-14 CE). The use of cement,Paragraph
paste mortars to bind bricks together has been traced to 500 BcE in Ancient,Paragraph
"Greece, although modern mortars—mixed with Portland Cement—became",Paragraph
widespread only in mid-19th-century Europe.,Paragraph
"Until the 19th century, brickmaking in northern Europe was largely",Paragraph
seasonal. Farmers shaped clay bricks in wooden moulds when there was,Paragraph
"little other work in winter. The firing of those bricks, requiring temperatures",Paragraph
"between 900 °C and 1,100 °C, involved as much luck as judgement. Each",Paragraph
brick’s hardness depended on its proximity to the flames and the heat of the,Paragraph
"fire. The hardest, most burnt, bricks were waterproof, called ‘foundation’,",Paragraph
"‘cellar’, or ‘arch’ bricks, reflecting where they were used. The least baked",Paragraph
"‘salmon’ bricks were soft, set aside for internal partitions. And regular",Paragraph
"baked bricks, ‘commons’, were employed for external walls.",Paragraph
These basic brick types persisted after production was industrialized in the,Paragraph

added so-called ‘wire cut’ bricks—trimmed from clay extruded by,Paragraph
machines—and sharp-edged ‘dry press’ bricks—made from clay forced into,Paragraph

"accurately. Reliable firing improved the predictability of brickmaking, and",Paragraph
"increased the range of hardnesses available. At the same time, modern",Paragraph
excavation techniques yielded a greater variety of clays in different colours,Paragraph
and textures. This extended the possibilities available to architects for,Paragraph
"expressing brick surfaces, supplementing variety in the ‘pointing’ of mortar",Paragraph
"joints (e.g. mortar smeared flush with the bricks, or raked out to create",Paragraph
"shadows, or expressed as broad or fine lines).",Paragraph
Brick became so important to the advocates of ‘another tradition’ in modern,Paragraph
architecture that their alternative history became more-or-less a collection,Paragraph
of famous brick buildings from the period of modernity. That history tended,Paragraph
to start with 19th-century Arts and Crafts architecture in Britain;,Paragraph
"specifically the Red House, Bexleyheath, 1859, designed by Philip Webb",Caption
"for writer, artist, and industrialist William Morris, sometimes promoted as a",Paragraph
progenitor of the modern free plan. It emphasized Frank Lloyd Wright’s,Paragraph

"Wright-inspired brickwork of Klint and Klint’s Grundtvig Church,",Paragraph
"Copenhagen, Denmark, 1927, and Willem Dudok’s Hilversum Town Hall,",Caption
"the Netherlands, 1931, alongside Haring’s cowshed and barn. Their story",Paragraph
was that the simplistic visual prescriptions of the International Style,Paragraph
overtook modern architecture’s original purpose: to rethink architecture for,Paragraph
the age of modernity and industrial production. They argued that this,Paragraph
alternative lineage—contrasting Gut Garkau with Corbusier’s almost,Paragraph
contemporary project for a Radiant Farm—showed how modern,Paragraph
architecture shouldn’t be understood as the refinement of a static set of,Paragraph
"forms towards perfection, as in Mies’s work, but should be understood",Paragraph
"instead as an ongoing negotiation with diverse localities, peoples, and",Paragraph
cultures. It should illustrate a continuing dialogue with ever-changing shifts,Paragraph
"in modernity, they felt, not be frozen as a static repertoire of forms.",Paragraph
"In Chapters 2 and 3, I showed how technical innovations in iron, steel, and",Paragraph
reinforced concrete produced new possibilities for organizing architecture,Paragraph
"and new architectural images, and I highlighted architectural theories",Paragraph
emerging in relation to the new imagery. The role of brick in modern,Paragraph
"architecture was different, however. It was a familiar rather than novel",Paragraph
"material, and its inherent organizational logic was already well known. The",Paragraph
adoption of brick into modern architecture represented instead a challenge,Paragraph
"to the hard-line view of modernity as a rejection of history, understanding",Paragraph
modern architecture differently as a continuation of history.,Paragraph
The local and the national,Title
Critics found a definitive example of this moder brick imagery on the,Paragraph
"island of Saéynatsalo in rural Finland, in a civic building completed in 1951",Caption
"for a small community centred on a plywood mill, which incorporated a",Paragraph
"town hall, library, and shops (Figure 21). Its architect, Alvar Aalto, is",Paragraph
"remembered as the leading light of Scandinavian modern design, combining",Paragraph
warm materials with simple shapes to make objects imagined as available to,Paragraph
"all. Aalto designed mass-produced stools, chairs, light fittings, and",Paragraph
glassware in this spirit as well as buildings. His work became characterized,Paragraph
"as ‘expressionist’, discussed in terms of ‘organic’ geometries.",Paragraph
"21. Saynatsalo Town Hall, Finland, 1951. Steps lead from the street to",Caption
"a courtyard surrounded by low roofs, and a council chamber above",Paragraph
expressed with a distinctive ‘butterfly’ roof. The imagery of the,Paragraph

"and low culture, recalling the everyday spaces of local farmers and (no",Paragraph

Aalto.),Paragraph
Sdayndtsalo Town Hall was located on a hillside in a forest clearing. It,Paragraph
"appeared initially unassuming, arranged around a courtyard with low roofs.",Paragraph
"The council chamber, rising above the low roof ridges, was expressed as a",Paragraph
tower with a distinctive ‘butterfly’ roof that accentuated its height and,Paragraph
"emphasized its civic role. The courtyard was wrapped with a glazed cloister,",Paragraph
reached by a grand stair leading up from the street. The buildings were,Paragraph
constructed from pressed red bricks which Aalto instructed the bricklayers,Paragraph
"to set slightly out-of-line, giving the walls an undulating rustic quality,",Paragraph
playing shadows across their surface in low northern sunlight. The roof of,Paragraph
"the council chamber, reached by a brick-lined and brick-floored staircase,",Paragraph
was supported with timber trusses shaped like upturned hands.,Paragraph
"The complex was intense for its diminutive size, accentuated by Aalto-",Paragraph
"designed fixtures including handles, handrails, and light fittings. Doors",Caption
were understood not just as openings but as thresholds between realms.,Paragraph
Windows were imagined as frames to the forest. Sequences of spaces were,Paragraph
"conceived as journeys through light and dark, compressing people through",Paragraph
smaller spaces and releasing them into larger ones. The experience of the,Paragraph
building was carefully choreographed and its details thoughtfully calibrated.,Paragraph
"Its orderly plan and section were derived from functional needs, and also",Paragraph
"carefully adapted to local culture, climate, and the topography of the site.",Paragraph
Aalto made plenty of intertextual references. He did this differently to,Paragraph
"Corbusier, looking more to architectural traditions and the ancient classical",Paragraph
past than to industrial forms and artistic shape-making. Saéyndtsalo Town,Paragraph
Hall’s organization around a courtyard recalled local farmsteads and the,Paragraph
"cloisters of historic monasteries. Sat into a slope, it can be read as both a",Paragraph
classical temple on a plinth and a fragment of a picturesque Italian hill,Caption
town. Vertical timber slats fixed to doors and windows hinted at both the,Caption
fluting of columns in classical architecture and the tree trunks of the,Paragraph
"surrounding forest. The red brick, here, referred more to humble industrial",Paragraph
"buildings than grand public ones, and to long traditions of brickmaking.",Paragraph
"Thus, the building played artful double games. Its imagery combined",Paragraph
"references to both modernity and history, to so-called high culture and low",Paragraph
"culture, recalling the everyday spaces of local farmers and (no less!) the",Paragraph
Greco-Roman tradition of human civilization. It evoked a northern romance,Paragraph
"about Mediterranean life, alongside an idea of the forest as psychological",Paragraph
retreat that remains prominent in Finnish culture. Critics understood the,Paragraph
"building as a synthesis of global modernism with local sensibilities,",Paragraph
claiming it as an image of modern Finnishness and Scandinavianness.,Paragraph
Identity claims like these relate to a strand of architectural history which,Paragraph
"seeks national characteristics reflected in buildings, trying to isolate, say,",Paragraph
"authentically Finnish, or Australian, or Korean architectures. Such histories",Paragraph
have usually celebrated premodern buildings—valorizing traditional,Paragraph
construction techniques that worked local materials in response to local,Paragraph
climates. They tend to identify indigenous characteristics and understand,Paragraph
"them to be threatened by globalized finance and industry, and by the",Paragraph
international industrial building materials which have grown to dominate,Paragraph
construction.,Paragraph
Political historian Benedict Anderson argued in his book Imagined,Paragraph
"Communities, 1983, that ideas of nation and nationalism were themselves",Paragraph
products of modernity. Anderson linked the modern importance of the,Paragraph
nationstate to the overthrow of absolute monarchies in the 18th and 19th,Paragraph
centuries in the West. He attributed ideas of the nation to the simultaneous,Paragraph
rise of print media and literacy. He connected them to a loss of shared,Paragraph
religious values coinciding with the rise of modern science and new,Paragraph
economic interests at the time of the Industrial Revolution. It was no,Paragraph
"coincidence, Anderson argued, that the creation of republics in the Western",Paragraph
hemisphere between 1776 and 1838 paralleled the emergence and,Paragraph
"widespread consumption of national languages, distributed by burgeoning",Paragraph
printing presses.,Paragraph
"This new notion of nation, associated with ideas of patriotism, took root",Paragraph
"rapidly. In the 19th century, the construction of museums telling national",Paragraph
"stories, the first mappings of national territories, and the collection of",Paragraph
"census data, consolidated formations of nation. Emerging stories about",Paragraph
"national identities usually included some groups and excluded others,",Paragraph
making claims about who belonged and who didn’t. Anderson argued that,Paragraph
conceptions of nation associated people with others they hadn’t yet met by,Paragraph
encouraging them to imagine themselves together as a collective. The,Paragraph
power of the idea became illustrated by people’s willingness to risk their,Paragraph
lives for it in war.,Paragraph
Claims about national architectures have always been freighted with,Paragraph
"difficult questions: what—and therefore who—gets included in, and",Paragraph
"excluded from, particular national histories; how does architecture get used",Paragraph
politically to claim certain ideas of nationhood and reject others? In some,Paragraph
"postcolonial countries, and in minority nations asserting their identity, the",Paragraph
project of cataloguing and producing national architectures has been seen as,Paragraph
vital in curating national identity. Examples include the early 20th-century,Paragraph
"buildings of Antoni Gaudi, linked to Catalan identity, or Oscar Niemeyer’s",Paragraph
projects symbolizing modern Brazil. Bombastic claims to national,Paragraph
"architectures have also been made by fascist regimes, who used buildings to",Paragraph
"aggrandize power and emphasize military might. These included, for",Paragraph
"example, the puffed-up projects of Albert Speer for Nazi Germany,",Paragraph
associated with that regime’s sinister nationalist rhetoric of ‘blood and soil’.,Paragraph
The dark shadows cast by Speer’s architecture—and what it stood for—,Paragraph
"illustrate the risks of any claims to national architectures. Yet, among the",Paragraph
"champions of the ‘other tradition’, attempts persisted to claim a role for",Paragraph
"local identities, cultures, and histories in modernity. They hoped to illustrate",Paragraph
that the emergence of global cultures didn’t necessarily involve the,Paragraph
rejection of local ones. This thinking crystallized in the 1990s around the,Paragraph
term ‘critical regionalism’—coined by Liane Lefaivre and Alexander,Paragraph
"Tzonis, and popularized by Kenneth Frampton—which described the idea",Paragraph
"of indigenous modern architectures sensitive to site, culture, history, and",Paragraph
"identity. However, champions of critical regionalism have had to work very",Paragraph
hard to claim that such architectures—like Saynatsalo Town Hall—are,Paragraph
somehow more authentic because they respond to a local sense of place,Paragraph
while simultaneously navigating dangerous associations with bombastic,Paragraph
nationalisms.,Paragraph
Monumentality and order: Louis I. Kahn,Title
The most striking images of modern brickwork were found in the buildings,Paragraph
"of Louis I. Kahn (1901-74; no relation to Albert Kahn), the third superhero",Paragraph
of modern architecture I’ll introduce. If Mies was modernism’s obsessive,Paragraph
"perfectionist, and Corbusier its establishment iconoclast, then Kahn was its",Paragraph
zen mystic. Kahn wrote—reminiscent of Taoist philosophy—that a great,Paragraph
"building ‘must begin with the unmeasurable, must go through measurable",Paragraph
"means when it is being designed, and in the end must be unmeasurable’.",Paragraph
"Kahn’s aura of spirituality was captured in aphorisms like this, which",Paragraph
pervaded his accounts of his buildings and his teaching. Like Team 10’s,Paragraph
"members, Kahn emphasized modern architecture’s insistence on the",Paragraph
"expression of structure, material, and function, while also challenging the",Paragraph
"idea of an International Style as dry and prescriptive. Also like Team 10,",Paragraph
Kahn sought to reconnect modem architecture with older ideas about,Paragraph
"human culture and social life. But, while Team 10 looked to anthropology",Paragraph
"and ‘structuralist’ ideas for inspiration, seeking timeless patterns in human",Paragraph
"behaviour, Kahn looked to architectural history and to mystical ideas about",Paragraph
the origins of human imagination. He believed that timeless insights,Paragraph
"remained present in the mysterious flickers of creative intuition, and in the",Paragraph
traces of ancient civilizations found in historic ruins. ‘What was has always,Paragraph
"been,’ he wrote, ‘what is has always been, and what will be has always",Paragraph
been’.,Paragraph
Kahn was born Itze-Leib Schmuilowsky on a Baltic island now called,Paragraph
"Saaremaa, then in Russia but now in Estonia. His family emigrated to",Paragraph
America in 1906—to Philadelphia—changing their names to suit their,Paragraph
"English-speaking environment. From a poor background, scarred by",Paragraph
"childhood burns, Kahn was reputedly a shy teenager. But his prodigious",Paragraph
talents for drawing and piano playing became noticed. He trained as an,Paragraph
"architect in his beloved adopted city, at the University of Pennsylvania,",Paragraph
whose curriculum was inspired by the classicism of Paris’s Ecole des,Paragraph
"Beaux-Arts. Following a year travelling in Europe in 1928, sketching",Paragraph
"ancient sites in Italy, Kahn embraced modem architecture. But it was",Paragraph
another grand tour—a few months at the American Academy of Rome in,Paragraph
1950/1—that apparently transformed his thinking. Kahn had become,Paragraph
prominent in the US architectural profession by the 1950s: a charismatic,Paragraph
"presence in the T-Square Club for architects in Philadelphia, chair of a",Paragraph
"Federal Public Housing Agency committee, teaching at Yale University. But",Caption
"it was only in his 50s that Kahn became famous, claiming finally to have",Paragraph
found his architectural identity.,Paragraph
The building Kahn credited with this self-discovery was superficially,Paragraph
unremarkable: a bath house for the Trenton Jewish Community Center in,Caption
"Ewing Township, New Jersey, 1959, which became a diminutive prototype",Paragraph
for subsequent projects (Figure 22). It was designed in collaboration with,Paragraph
"Anne Tyng, whose deep appreciation of geometry had a decisive influence",Paragraph
"—although, like many women of modern architecture, her substantial",Paragraph
contribution went unrecognized for many years. The plan of the bath house,Paragraph
formed a cross comprised of five squares. The central square was an,Paragraph
"unroofed courtyard, an ‘unprogrammed?’ space initially containing a shallow",Paragraph
circular basin. The four surrounding squares were topped with their own,Paragraph
"sloping ‘hipped’ roofs. These roofs, with square holes open to the sky at",Paragraph
"their centres, sat on dumpy square columns containing small spaces. The",Paragraph
"roofs did not quite touch at the comers, and appeared poised slightly above",Paragraph
the columns.,Paragraph

"simple structure, built from bare blocks with mortar smeared across",Paragraph
"their surface, topped with cheap felt roof tiles. The original circular",Paragraph
basin at the centre of this ‘unprogrammed’ space was subsequently,Paragraph
paved over. The Bath House produced an improbably monumental,Paragraph

monumental buildings designed by Louis I. Kahn’s office indebted to,Paragraph
"architectural history. (Architects: Louis I. Kahn, in collaboration with",Caption
Anne Tyng.),Paragraph
"The Trenton bath house seemed humble, built from bare concrete blocks (a",Paragraph
"sibling of clay brick), with mortar smeared flush with their surface rather",Paragraph
"than neatly raked out, topped with cheap felt roof tiles. But its effect was",Paragraph
improbably monumental. What Kahn meant when he said he’d discovered,Paragraph
"himself, Neil Levine remarked, is that he’d found a new way to integrate",Paragraph
structure and space by reinterpreting architectures of the distant past. The,Paragraph
roofs were imagined as the poor but noble cousins of ancient domes. For,Paragraph
"architects in the know, they referred to the Pantheon in Rome, 126 cE, with",Paragraph
its open ‘oculus’ at the centre. The columns recalled the significance of the,Paragraph
"column to architecture’s classical origins. The result, nevertheless, was",Paragraph
inescapably modern. Vincent Scully later claimed an ‘archaic force’ for,Paragraph
"Kahn’s newly found architecture, arguing that it accepted ‘no preconditions,",Paragraph
"fashions, or habits of design without questioning them profoundly’. The",Paragraph
"bath house, he believed, rethought architecture from first principles. Levine",Paragraph
reflected on its ‘abject poverty’ and ‘the opposition between the archetypal,Paragraph
"sources of the forms [and] their finish, or lack thereof ... that made the",Paragraph
structure so provocative’.,Paragraph
"Yale University Art Gallery—also designed with Tyng, 1953—developed",Paragraph
the approach in a substantial commission. The concrete-framed building,Paragraph
"had a pared-down plan layout. It appeared superficially Mies-ian, its",Paragraph
external walls expressed straightforwardly as planes of brick and glass.,Paragraph
"Where Mies’s college buildings demonstrated an obsession with lightness,",Paragraph
"however, the Yale gallery revelled in heaviness. It crossed Mies’s",Paragraph
"preference for purity with Corbusier’s massive postwar concrete, done more",Paragraph
precisely than gloopy béton brut. The gallery’s floor slabs were over a,Paragraph
"metre deep, their ceilings expressed as a striking pattern of triangular",Paragraph
"indentations, or ‘coffers’. These ‘coffered slabs’ made the structure more",Paragraph
"efficient by using less concrete, and they provided space for building",Paragraph
"services: the pipes, cables, ducts, stairs, and toilets needed to make the",Paragraph
"building work. The mass of these ceilings dominated the interiors,",Paragraph
producing a weighty sense of calm. Their insistent triangular geometry—,Paragraph
"matched with one rectangular and one circular stairwell, punched through",Paragraph
the floorslabs—tapped the ancient power of primary shapes. The gallery’s,Paragraph
plan was a geometrical diagram so sophisticated that it came right round,Paragraph
"again to simplicity. To architects, it demonstrated the pure integration of a",Paragraph
building’s driving geometric idea with optimized structure and servicing.,Paragraph
The Yale gallery got noticed by the global architectural media. But Kahn’s,Paragraph
international reputation was consolidated through two laboratory buildings,Paragraph
"completed in 1965: the Medical Research Towers, later Alfred Newton",Paragraph
"Richards Building, on the University of Pennsylvania campus; and the Salk",Caption
"Institute, on the edge of the Pacific Ocean at La Jolla in Torrey Pines,",Caption
"California. The Richards Laboratories, constructed in reinforced concrete",Caption
"and clad in brick, proposed an elegant solution to the containment of all the",Paragraph
building services needed to make labs work—which became widely copied.,Paragraph
Kahn’s plans and sections expressed and separated-out ‘servant’ space (the,Paragraph
"pipes, cables, ducts, stairs, and toilets) from ‘served’ space (the laboratories",Paragraph
"themselves, conceived like artists’ studios with panoramic corner",Paragraph
"windows). The concrete floor was again hollow, so pipes and ducts could",Paragraph
run through it. The structure was expressed on the facgades with a beam that,Paragraph
"stepped up between the main vertical columns and the corner, expressing",Paragraph
"the structural load path in the beam, while serving to enlarge the scientists’",Paragraph
comer windows. Kahn imagined this as an elegant fusion of lighting and,Paragraph
structural engineering with architectural expression. The underlying,Paragraph
"diagram of the building, again, was admirably refined.",Paragraph
"These ideas were extended at the Salk Institute, famous for its astonishing",Paragraph
"courtyard—paved starkly in travertine, a stone favoured by the Romans—",Paragraph
whose smooth surface was interrupted only by a line of water leading the,Paragraph
eye to the ocean horizon beyond. This courtyard’s radical simplicity,Paragraph
highlighted shadows cast on the surrounding structures by intense,Paragraph
Californian sun. Kahn reflected gnomically that ‘the sun never knew how,Paragraph
great it was until it hit the side of a building’. He felt scientists needed both,Paragraph
their labs in ‘stainless steel and glass’ and separate studies with ‘the oak,Paragraph
"table and rug’, expressing these rooms of differing qualities clearly in plan",Paragraph
"and section. ‘The room is the place of the mind,’ Kahn ruminated,",Paragraph

describing the complex as ‘a realm of spaces ... connected by ways of,Paragraph

leading past an (unrealized) open amphitheatre to a proposed dining room.,Paragraph
"Further cloisters, arranged on 45-degree diagonals, led from the tree-shaded",Paragraph
plaza at the top of the ramp to rows of dormitories. These were triangular,Paragraph
four-storey houses arranged around so-called tea rooms: cool,Paragraph
‘unprogrammed’ places for impromptu conversations. Each house had,Paragraph
twenty individual rooms with linked ‘servant’ towers containing kitchens,Caption
and toilets. Further tree-shaded courts were laid out between. The plan was,Paragraph
highly ordered but the experience of moving through it was rich and,Paragraph
"intense, animated by surprising diagonal glimpses and movement between",Paragraph
intense sun and deep shade. These sequences echoed Team 10’s thinking,Paragraph
"about maintaining ‘labyrinthine clarity’ in dense, complex buildings, about",Paragraph
"the importance of thresholds in enlivening architectural experiences, and",Paragraph
exploiting the social potential of ‘in-between’ spaces. Kahn’s sources were,Paragraph
"largely Western: monastic courtyards, the historic quadrangles of Oxford",Paragraph
"and Cambridge universities, and dramatic 18th-century etchings of Roman",Paragraph
"ruins made by Giovanni Battista Piranesi. Nevertheless, as William Curtis",Paragraph
"has remarked, the building became understood in relation to Indian sources:",Paragraph
"to the dense urban fabric of Ahmedabad and Jaisalmer, to the linked open",Paragraph
"spaces of Rajput fortresses, and the spatial sequences of Fatehpur Sikri.",Paragraph
"The complex was concerned with light, shadow, and breeze. Kahn imagined",Paragraph
"that sunlight brought architecture to life, understanding architecture as a",Paragraph
"canvas for the tracking sun. ‘Structure is the maker of light,’ he wrote: ‘a",Paragraph
column and a column brings light between.’ It was the prevailing wind,Paragraph
"direction, though, that drove the 45-degree geometry and the design of",Paragraph
cloisters and tea rooms as breeze catchers. Kahn echoed Victor and Aladar,Paragraph
"Olgyay’s 1963 book Design with Climate, subtitled Bioclimatic Approach",Paragraph
"to Architectural Regionalism, which discussed the adaptation of modern",Paragraph
architecture to local climates. The buildings’ various openings were,Paragraph
"understood, like Corbusier’s brises soleil, as shadow makers,",Paragraph
"acknowledging how shade and breeze facilitate sociability, creating places",Paragraph
for people to stop and talk.,Paragraph
While Kahn believed that this promotion of social life was central to his,Paragraph
"designs, it was their imagery that primarily attracted the critics’ attention.",Paragraph
Kahn was reputedly unhappy with the Miesian elevations of the Yale Art,Paragraph
"Gallery, expressed as thin planes of brick and glass. He believed he’d",Paragraph
brought monumentality to the interiors there but not the fagades. The Indian,Paragraph
Institute of Management’s elevations represented Kahn’s solution to this,Paragraph
perceived problem: plain brick surfaces with giant geometric perforations—,Paragraph
"circles, arches, and rectangles. These perforations spanned multiple floors",Paragraph
"with smaller openings behind, recessed in shadow. Where there were",Paragraph
"window frames, these were set deep so they disappeared into darkness.",Paragraph
"Alongside the shading function, this made the brickwork appear",Paragraph
"monumental, recalling Kahn’s favourite Roman ruins. While circles,",Paragraph
"triangles, and rectangles had become established in Kahn’s architectural",Paragraph
"vocabulary by this time, they also recalled the geometries of the 18th-",Paragraph
century Jantar Mantar observatories in Delhi and Jaipur.,Caption
The Institute’s giant circular openings were understood as an arch sat on top,Paragraph
"of an inverted arch. The arch represented, to Kahn, what brick wanted to be,",Paragraph
demonstrating the structural logic of the material: an inherent illustration of,Paragraph
"how structural loads get transmitted to the ground through masonry. But, in",Paragraph
"this earthquake zone, Kahn imagined the circle to be a structural idea just as",Paragraph
"powerful as the arch. Here, the inverted arch comprising the bottom half of",Paragraph
"the circle would occasionally be called upon, in a quake, to bear loads in the",Paragraph
same way that a conventional arch does in normal conditions. Earthquakes,Paragraph
also justified Kahn’s inclusion of so-called blind arches (arches infilled with,Paragraph
"brick) to reinforce and animate some of the walls, and characterful concrete",Paragraph
lintels inserted into the base of certain arches to provide extra strength.,Paragraph
"These lintels were a knowing reference, for architects, to the gateway at the",Paragraph
"Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans, France, 1776, designed by Claude",Caption
Nicolas Ledoux. They served to highlight the structural nature of the brick,Paragraph
"walls, reinforcing brick’s material logic by highlighting where brick wasn’t",Paragraph
"able to perform as well structurally: in tension, where the base of an arch",Paragraph
wants to spread outwards as loads push down on it. The concrete lintels,Paragraph
"here were the exception that proved the rule for Kahn, highlighting the",Paragraph
masonry logic of brickwork.,Paragraph
"Kahn’s geometric openings, like the Institute as a whole, illustrated his",Paragraph
distinctive idea of modern architecture. They represented an intense,Paragraph
"conjunction of structure and space, combining material and structural",Paragraph
"logics; engaging light, shadow, monumentality, and order; fusing pure",Paragraph
geometries and ancient architectural images through creative intuition into,Paragraph
"buildings that seemed simultaneously new, archaic, and timeless.",Paragraph
Kahn’s buildings became respected for their intellectual integrity but were,Paragraph
less copied than those of Mies or Corbusier. American architect Peter,Caption
Eisenman later argued that Kahn’s work sowed the seeds of modern,Paragraph
"architecture’s destruction. Kahn, he claimed melodramatically, ‘murdered",Paragraph
modern architecture’ through his return to monumentality and historic,Title
"motifs. Whether or not this claim has validity, Kahn’s designs reinforced",Paragraph

between the forces of global modernity and the particular sites and social,Paragraph

Refashioning architecture from first principles,Title
If Kahn’s work illustrated how modern architecture could remain a way of,Paragraph
"thinking rather than a formula, then the Church of St Peter at Klippan,",Paragraph
"Sweden, 1966, illustrated how idiosyncratic such thinking could be. There’s",Paragraph
"a story about its reclusive architect, Sigurd Lewerentz, standing on site",Caption
holding a handful of nails contemplatively. Asked what he was going to do,Paragraph
"with them, he apparently replied ‘I don’t know yet, but I’m not just going to",Paragraph
nail two pieces of wood together.’ Every architectural element was,Paragraph
"rethought at St Peter’s, making familiar things strange again. At a time",Paragraph
when construction and building components were becoming increasingly,Paragraph
"industrialized and mass produced, Lewerentz was on site almost daily,",Paragraph
inventing bespoke details with the foreman and bricklayers.,Paragraph
"The church seems low on first approach, its horizontal roofline punctured",Paragraph
only by a chimney. Visitors navigate almost completely around the building,Paragraph
"to find the door, their path enclosed by an ‘L’-shaped wing containing the",Paragraph
parish hall and offices: a laborious entrance sequence reputedly expressing,Paragraph
the difficulty of finding God. The interior of the church appears like a dark,Paragraph

illusion achieved by omitting window frames altogether and instead fixing,Paragraph
glass sheets over the outer face of the wall with bronze clips.,Caption
"24. Church of St Peter, Klippan, Sweden, 1966. Most aspects of the",Caption
"church’s construction were rethought afresh, although there was little",Paragraph
attempt to be fashionable. The font is a giant reclaimed sea shell,Paragraph
continuously dripping into a gutter in the floor. Brick vaulted ceilings,Caption
"were supported by a steel column and beam formed into a ‘T’,",Paragraph
recalling the symbol of the cross. And windows were formed from,Paragraph
sheets of glass simply clipped outside openings in the brick walls.,Paragraph
(Architect: Sigurd Lewerentz.),Caption
The empty church echoes to the sound of water dripping continuously from,Paragraph
"the font—a giant sea shell fixed to a metal frame—into a gutter in the floor,",Paragraph
apparently recalling life’s distant origins in water. Not only were its,Paragraph
"unadomed walls, undulating floors, and vaulted ceilings made from the",Paragraph
"same slim brown brick, so were certain seats, tables, and—notably—the",Paragraph
"altar. This furniture seemingly emitted from the floor, giving the impression",Paragraph
that the whole church was carved from a giant block of brickwork. The,Paragraph
brick vaulted ceilings were supported by a steel column and beam formed,Paragraph
"into a “T’—unmistakeably, if not immediately, recalling the symbol of the",Paragraph
cross. Its square plan rejected the traditional ‘basilica’ church plan (divided,Paragraph
"into nave, aisles, and sanctuary), recalling instead a myth about the earliest",Paragraph
Christian services as a group of worshippers gathered in an arc around a,Paragraph
priest.,Paragraph
Bricks are usually laid in a regular pattern called a ‘bond’. In accepted,Paragraph
"bricklaying practice, if you stand beneath a brick wall and look straight up,",Paragraph
the vertical edges of the bricks (the ‘perpends’) should line-up.,Paragraph
"Traditionally, thin mortar joints are a sign of fine craft, with exceptionally",Paragraph
skilled bricklayers able to reduce the normal 10 millimetre joint to as little,Paragraph
as 3 millimetres. But the brickwork at St Peter’s overturns these,Paragraph
"conventions. Here, bricks swim in a soup of thick mortar—walls are more",Paragraph
mortar than brick in places—and perpends rarely line up. Lewerentz,Paragraph
imagined the individual bricks to symbolize individual members of the,Paragraph
"congregation, representing the body of the church, and he imagined them so",Paragraph
precious that he declared no bricks could be cut. It was this rule which,Paragraph
"produced the unusual bricklaying logic, where mortar expands to fill spaces",Paragraph
left between uncut bricks. Lewerentz’s strange brickwork thus recalled the,Paragraph
"first Roman concrete, where masonry served as aggregate in cement. It",Paragraph
"appeared almost geological, like a natural formation, becoming what",Paragraph
Jeremy Till later called ‘the brickiest of bricks and the walliest of walls’.,Paragraph
Little was normal at St Peter’s. While there was scant attempt to be,Paragraph
"fashionable, most aspects of the church’s construction were thought afresh.",Paragraph
Ordinary materials and details were reinvented in an attempt to imbue them,Paragraph
with meaning. Like other buildings claimed for an alternative tradition of,Paragraph
"modern architecture in brick, the church didn’t do this by returning to local",Paragraph
"architectures of the past, but instead by attempting to update traditional",Paragraph
elements in relation to current realities of industrialization and,Paragraph
globalization. St Peter’s thus stands as a powerfully idiosyncratic,Paragraph
illustration of the idea of another modern architecture: one imagined as an,Paragraph

This ‘suspended ceiling’—designed by Saarinen’s office with GM,Paragraph
"technicians, plus consultants Smith Hinchman & Grylls—indicated a fresh",Paragraph
organizing logic for moder architecture. Most buildings had previously,Paragraph
remained relatively narrow in plan—rarely more than 12 metres across—,Paragraph
because interior spaces had to be lit by the sun and ventilated using opening,Paragraph

satisfactory lighting and ventilation to be provided artificially rather than,Paragraph
"naturally. Accommodation could thus be placed further from windows,",Paragraph

"reduced in relation to the overall floor area. Various office cells at GM, in",Caption
"the 1951 Engineering Group Building for example, had no external",Paragraph

suspended ceiling—which since became consolidated as a global standard,Paragraph
"grid, familiar from countless offices, hospitals, and schools—stood for the",Paragraph
substitution of natural light and air with mechanical provision. Air-,Paragraph
conditioning and fluorescent light thus became combined to produce a,Paragraph
deep-plan architectural logic.,Paragraph
American engineer Willis Haviland Carrier is credited with combining,Paragraph
existing technologies to produce modern air-conditioning in the 1900s.,Paragraph
"Scottish chemist Joseph Black had worked out, in 1760, that heat gets",Paragraph
"absorbed when liquid evaporates into vapour, and released when vapour",Paragraph
"condenses into liquid, but the consequences were only later exploited. By",Paragraph
"the mid-19th century, American trade in ice—shipped south from northern",Paragraph
climes for a range of uses from medical treatments to refrigerating ships’,Paragraph
cargoes—grew so profitable that inventors started experimenting with,Paragraph
turning water into ice mechanically using chemical refrigerants.,Paragraph
"Simultaneously, experiments were being undertaken in theatres to circulate",Paragraph
ice- or water-cooled air—or to draw cool air from underground chambers—,Paragraph
"to reduce overheating in summer, although these were mostly ineffective or",Paragraph
produced very humid environments. Carrier worked out that air temperature,Paragraph
could be controlled by adjusting moisture levels: drawing air through a,Paragraph
"spray of cooled or heated vapour, supplied by coils filled with hot or cold",Paragraph
water. He used historical weather records to calibrate temperature and,Paragraph
moisture levels in order to mitigate excessive humidity. The resulting air-,Paragraph
conditioning was initially used in factory spaces processing delicate,Paragraph
"materials, like celluloid film and pharmaceutical capsules. The first fully",Paragraph
air-conditioned building was completed in 1929: the Milam Building in San,Paragraph
"Antonio, Texas, USA, where a network of ducts hung in corridors",Caption
introduced cooled or warmed air into offices.,Paragraph
"The earliest artificial lighting systems, meanwhile, burned coal gas. Gas",Paragraph
light infrastructure became widespread in European and American cities,Paragraph
"during the late 19th century. In the 1870s, however, American engineer",Paragraph
Charles Francis Brush developed one of the first viable systems for electric,Paragraph
"rather than gas light, connecting a steam-powered dynamo to arc lamps",Paragraph
with copper cables. A major development was the invention and,Paragraph
"improvement of incandescent lightbulbs in the 1890s, in different forms by",Paragraph
Thomas Edison and Joseph Swan. As power stations and electric supply,Caption
networks became constructed in cities during the early 20th century (Milan,Paragraph
"was an early adopter), electric lighting overtook gas.",Paragraph
The precursor of modern fluorescent lighting was developed by American,Paragraph
"engineer D. McFarlan Moore, who invented an electric-powered, gas-filled,",Paragraph

"best illumination. Georges Claude tried neon gas in the 1910s and, although",Paragraph
"the orange light it emitted was unsuitable for lighting rooms, it made",Paragraph

contributed to the image of International Style buildings. The 1939 New,Paragraph
"York World’s Fair spurred two American companies, General Electric and",Paragraph
"Sylvania, to produce white, low voltage, fluorescent lamps. These proved",Paragraph
"phenomenally successful, shipping large volumes in the US after the",Paragraph

"heat at that time, and only a fifth to light, with bulbs producing around 40",Paragraph
"per cent of the cooling demand in the first air-conditioned buildings. So,",Paragraph
"fluorescent light, producing significantly less heat, became an obvious",Paragraph
partner for air-conditioning.,Paragraph
"By the 1950s, ‘air-con’ became widespread in America, not just in factories",Paragraph
"but also in theatres, offices, and rail cars, and fluorescent lighting also grew",Paragraph
more widely employed. GM’s campus illustrated an early example of their,Paragraph

GM’s campus also illustrated the translation of ideas about highly,Paragraph

cultures—away from a traditional idea of civic life conducted in the streets,Paragraph
and squares of the city towards a new preference for the private realms of,Paragraph
"office, car, home, and TV.",Paragraph
GM’s campus also anticipated the idea of a network society. Its office,Paragraph
"workers were mostly distributed across open-plan offices, their desk layouts",Paragraph
reflecting the network diagrams of management structures. Complex,Paragraph

networked urban infrastructures.,Paragraph
Historian Reinhold Martin has argued that these projects were connected,Paragraph
"directly into Cold War politics via ‘systems thinking’, which understood",Paragraph
"everything in the world as complex, interconnected, mathematically model-",Paragraph
able systems. Martin noted the postwar Western alliance of new military,Paragraph
technologies with commercial industrial expertise—sometimes called the,Paragraph
‘military-industrial complex’—linking corporations with states and their,Paragraph
"armies, automotive with aeronautical design, and computing with",Paragraph
innovations in warfare. Martin argued that the GM campus—alongside,Paragraph
Saarinen’s headquarters for IBM and Bell—stood for the global power of,Paragraph
this ‘military-industrial complex’. He illustrated the point by referring to the,Paragraph

While the postwar years saw a new deep-plan architectural logic emerge,Paragraph
"from air-conditioning and artificial lighting, it had already become accepted",Paragraph
that modern buildings should look light and airy. This imagery was helped,Paragraph
by new glass technology which enabled the fabrication of bigger panes: so-,Paragraph
"called ‘float glass’, formed into continuous sheets by rolling hot liquid glass",Paragraph
onto molten tin. Glass never produced its own architectural logic like steel,Paragraph
"and reinforced concrete had, despite experiments to design structural glass",Paragraph

"possible, arranged in the most efficient way, to transmit loads to the ground.",Paragraph
Geodesic domes seemed impossibly light and strong. An image of the,Paragraph

"1951, North Carolina State College, 1952, and the University of Oregon,",Caption
"1953, before the awarding of a patent in 1954. He had domestic",Paragraph

"stilts, finished with a lightweight transparent insulating plastic skin.",Paragraph
Fumiture would be arranged on a platform at the base of the dome and only,Paragraph
the most private functions would be separated out into enclosed boxes.,Paragraph
Fuller enthused that transparent domes like this would dissolve the,Paragraph
"traditional idea of the house, likening them to living under the sky. Wall and",Paragraph
"roof, here, were to be combined into an almost-invisible layer of high",Paragraph
"performance plastic. While no such plastic was viable at that time, Fuller",Paragraph
and his student collaborators tested several innovative materials including,Paragraph
"Mylar, receiving free samples from DuPont and other corporations.",Paragraph
Most of the geodesic domes realized were commissioned by the US,Paragraph
"military. In 1949, Fuller installed a prototype at The Pentagon, Washington,",Paragraph
DC—headquarters of the US Department of Defense—for use in conflicts,Paragraph
and disaster-relief. Another dome—a lightweight timber lattice covered in,Paragraph

"architects Norman and Wendy Foster in 1978, he enquired memorably:",Paragraph
‘How much does your building weigh?’ Fuller implied: why shouldn’t,Paragraph
buildings be cheap and portable? Why shouldn’t they provide technological,Paragraph
liberations like those offered by cars and televisions? His structures went,Paragraph
beyond the idea that modern architecture ought simply to look light and airy,Paragraph
"to realizing highly lightweight, almost transparent structures. Indeed, his",Paragraph
"anti-architectural, anti-establishment thinking inspired a diverse group of",Paragraph
"architects, critics, engineers, and ‘drop outs’ in the 1960s and 1970s.",Paragraph
Bubbles and blimps,Title
Fuller’s geodesics proposed stripping architecture back to basic human,Paragraph
"shelter. In a 1960 book, Theory and Design in the First Machine Age,",Paragraph
Banham (again) argued that form never really did follow function in,Paragraph
‘International Style’ modernism. Its buildings offered superficial images of,Paragraph
"modernity, he argued, but didn’t tap the full potential of new technologies.",Paragraph
"In the spirit of Fuller, and Mies’s dictum that ‘less is more’, Banham argued",Paragraph
"that mechanical and electrical services—artificial lighting, air-conditioning,",Paragraph
"and power supply—represented the basic components of shelter, ideally",Paragraph
supplemented only by the most minimal of enclosures.,Paragraph
A 1965 article by Banham in the magazine Art in America was illustrated,Paragraph
"by artist Francois Dallegret. Together, they proposed ‘The Unhouse’.",Paragraph
"Dallegret’s section depicted a double-skinned, inflated transparent plastic",Paragraph
"bubble on a plinth, showing a group of greyed-out naked Banhams and",Caption
Dallegrets collaged around a central technological ‘totem-pole’. That totem,Paragraph
"held lamps, a TV screen, stereo speakers, fridge, cooker, and air supply.",Paragraph
"Meanwhile, the architecture became reduced to two thin lines representing",Paragraph
plastic membranes. The proposal was inspired by technologies then being,Paragraph
"developed for early space exploration, for the artificial environmental",Paragraph
bubbles of rocket ships and space suits. Banham and Dallegret described,Paragraph
the Unhouse as a ‘living package’ that would do away with the weighty,Paragraph
"encumbrances of buildings, and their associated social and cultural",Paragraph
"baggage, indicating new ways of life. The naked figures in the drawing",Paragraph
"referred to the 1960s idea of sexual liberation, supposedly occasioned by",Paragraph
the newly invented female contraceptive pill. They also referred to,Paragraph
"‘primitive man’ [sic], proposing a return to an idea about architecture’s",Paragraph
"ancient origins: a circle of people gathered around a fire, as described in the",Paragraph
"oldest surviving architecture book—Vitruvius’ De Architectura, 1st century",Caption
CE.,Paragraph
"Several designers explored this reduction of architecture to clear, inflated",Paragraph
plastic membranes. Examples included: Michael Webb’s experimental,Paragraph
"‘Cushicle’ bubble, and his plastic ‘Suitaloon’ fitted to the human body,",Paragraph
"1967; Haus-Rucker-Co’s (self-explanatory) ‘Balloon for Two’, also 1967;",Paragraph
"‘Mobile Office’, an inflated drum where the architect Hans Hollein sat at a",Paragraph
"drawing board, 1969; Ant Farm’s ‘Clean Air Pod’, 1970; and the ‘Restless",Paragraph
Sphere’ that the Austrian collective Co-op Himmelb(])au rolled around the,Paragraph
"streets of Basel, Switzerland, 1971. In such projects, membranes became",Paragraph
"second skins for human figures, whose blurry contours appeared through",Paragraph
their surface reflections. These architects took lightness and airiness to an,Paragraph
extreme at a time when Tange and Safdie were simultaneously designing,Paragraph
"heavyweight megastructures, and Kahn was seeking a new monumentality",Paragraph
"for modern architecture. In contrast, their anti-monumental projects",Paragraph
questioned whether architecture should involve buildings at all. These,Paragraph
inflatable fantasies deliberately challenged architecture’s traditional,Paragraph
associations with permanence. But their designers also diverged somewhat,Paragraph
from Banham and Dallegret’s vision of the Unhouse: they understood their,Paragraph
bubbles not as an extension of total environmental control—as proposed by,Paragraph
"Banham, and as embodied in Saarinen’s GM campus where fluorescent",Paragraph
lighting and air-conditioning substituted for natural light and air—but,Paragraph
instead as a parody of total environmental control. The inhabitants of these,Paragraph
"bubbles were not imagined as enclosed by technology, so much as",Paragraph
imprisoned by it.,Paragraph
"A spirit of satire informed these young architects’ work, partly in response",Paragraph
to the counter-culture of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Various anti-,Paragraph
establishment movements first flourished across Europe and the US in,Paragraph
association with the coming-of-age of the postwar ‘baby boomers’. They,Paragraph
"played to the soundtrack of the Beatles and Rolling Stones, relaxed with",Paragraph
"(what Banham called) ‘wonder-drugs and new domestic chemistries’,",Paragraph
"championed equal rights for all genders and ethnicities, and looked up to a",Paragraph
"new creative class of celebrities, artists, and designers. ‘Hippie’",Paragraph
incarnations of these movements in the late 1960s reacted specifically,Paragraph
against the Vietnam War and the draft of young Americans to fight. Their,Paragraph
thinking endorsed a new environmentalism—as highlighted by Fuller—,Paragraph
acutely aware of the fragility of planet Earth and the destruction of life by,Paragraph
human activity. Student groups associated with the counter-culture were,Paragraph
"highly political, imagining mainstream figures—including their teachers—",Paragraph
"as a complacent, reactionary establishment. Their frustrations boiled over",Paragraph
"into demonstrations in 1968—in Paris, New York, Prague, and West Berlin,",Paragraph
for example—challenging what they saw as the imperial ambitions of,Paragraph
"warmongering anti-democratic regimes, championing instead freedom and",Paragraph
civil rights. These demonstrations—some violently suppressed—didn’t,Paragraph
"represent a coherent global movement, but they did connect local, national,",Paragraph
and international concerns with wider protest and trade union groups.,Paragraph
"Some radicals decided to ‘drop out’ of mainstream society, to reject the",Paragraph
"establishment and money culture, collecting together to live communal",Paragraph
"subsistence lives. In 1965, four art students—styled as Curly, Jo, Lard, and",Paragraph

"sufficiency, ecology, and radical education with reviews of building",Paragraph

alternative living. Steve Jobs—who founded the Homebrew Computer Club,Paragraph
in California before founding Apple Computers—later described it as ‘like,Paragraph
"Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google’. Jobs highlighted that,",Paragraph
"while communes never became mainstream, they incubated ideas about",Paragraph
sharing and information economies that later informed the emerging,Paragraph
Internet.,Paragraph
Mainstream postwar modern architecture gradually became seen as part of,Paragraph
the establishment problem. It got associated with top-down comprehensive,Paragraph
redevelopment involving the clearance of settled communities—for,Paragraph
"example, the imposition of housing and office blocks constructed in the",Paragraph
West in the 1960s on the lines of Corbusier’s Ville Contemporaine—driven,Paragraph
by local and national authorities. This growing perception was strengthened,Paragraph
"by author, activist, and sociologist Jane Jacobs’s 1961 book Death and Life",Paragraph
of Great American Cities. Jacobs studied lively traditional neighbourhoods,Paragraph
"with strong communities and a vibrant street life, including Boston’s North",Paragraph
"End, then slated to be cleared, showing how they figured better in health,",Paragraph
"crime, and education measures than replacement modern neighbourhoods.",Paragraph
Such perceived failures of modern architecture became symbolized by the,Paragraph
"demolition of the troubled Pruitt-I[goe housing blocks in St Louis, Missouri,",Caption
"USA, in 1972. Memorable images of their demolition illustrated a growing",Paragraph
"disillusionment with modern architecture, which became perceived as an",Paragraph
"accessory of top-down control. The bubbles of Banham, Co-op",Caption
"Himmelb())au, Drop City, and others can be understood in this context as a",Paragraph
rejection of centralized planning and industrial construction; conceived,Paragraph
instead as recovering the supposed early promise of modern architecture to,Paragraph
express Straightforwardly new technologies and new social configurations.,Paragraph
"Rightly or wrongly, the fantastical drawings of the Archigram group",Paragraph
became seen as defining images of 1960s counter-culture. Archigram began,Paragraph
as a group of British students and architects comprising Michael Webb,Paragraph
"(whose Cushicle and Suitaloon have been mentioned earlier), Warren",Paragraph
"Chalk, Peter Cook, Dennis Crompton, David Greene, and Ron Herron. The",Paragraph

mashed-up clip-outs from advertising and film posters with sci-fi comic,Paragraph

"spontaneous, and radical.",Paragraph
Beaubourg brought together the deep-plan logic of air-conditioning and,Paragraph
fluorescent lighting with ideas of spontaneity evoked by Archigram’s,Paragraph
"bubbles and blimps. It comprised a substantial steel frame, supporting",Paragraph
"broad, highly serviced free-plan floorplates without intermediate columns.",Caption

"comprised a web of brightly coloured pipes and ducts, feeding service voids",Paragraph
in the suspended ceilings and raised floors behind (Figure 29). Putting the,Paragraph
ducts on the outside helped keep the floorplates free of disruptive service,Paragraph
zones. But it also conferred the building a radically novel image—a,Paragraph
dramatized expression of structure and servicing technology—which,Paragraph
historians subsequently categorized as its own architectural style: ‘high-,Paragraph
tech’.,Paragraph

architectural imagery ‘high-tech’. (Architects: Renzo Piano and,Paragraph
Richard Rogers.),Paragraph
Beaubourg’s attempts to express informality and spontaneity weren’t so,Paragraph

container; Archigram’s imagery; the 19th-century engineering of Paxton,Paragraph
"and Eiffel; and a 1960s proposal for a flexible ‘Fun Palace’ in London,",Paragraph
imagined by theatre director Joan Littlewood with architect Cedric Price. It,Paragraph
"was distinguished from comparable proposals, however, by the fact of",Paragraph
"getting built, albeit with compromises: the escalator tubes later became",Paragraph
"privatized, incorporated into the paid-for gallery ‘experience’ rather than",Paragraph
"free to the public, and curators later built permanent rooms on certain",Paragraph
floorplates to save the cost of refitting them for every exhibition.,Paragraph
"When it was finished, Beaubourg was as unpopular with the Parisian elite",Paragraph
as Eiffel’s tower had been a century before. The philosopher Jean,Paragraph
Baudrillard thought it illustrated: ‘the image of a culture flattened by its,Paragraph
"own weight’, ‘generated ... by logicians of the establishment wholly",Paragraph
"lacking in critical spirit’. Beaubourg sold out its radical potential, he",Paragraph
"believed, by freezing promises of dynamism and spontaneity into a fixed",Paragraph
institution. Moreover—with unashamed elitism—Baudrillard criticized,Paragraph
Beaubourg as being a machine to mass produce art for the masses. He,Paragraph
abhorred how its imagery—expressing the guts of its building services—,Paragraph
honoured mass production more than it honoured the cultures of artistic,Paragraph
"craft. To Baudrillard, Beaubourg rejected the idea of artistic endeavour as",Paragraph
the pinnacle of human thought and civilization—which he thought a,Paragraph
cultural building should celebrate—standing instead for banal industrial,Paragraph
modernity.,Paragraph

"structure, services, and maintenance gantries, and even secondary rooms",Paragraph
like WCs and storerooms. Between the two double skins was a vast room,Paragraph
"for exhibitions without any intermediate columns, 30 metres wide, 7.5",Caption
metres high and 130 metres long. Two mezzanine levels for the university’s,Caption
"fine artists, plus a basement for delivery, workshop and conservation areas,",Paragraph

"equally sleek glass walls, supported on glass fins, over-sailed by the space",Paragraph
frame to form porticoes overlooking the landscape.,Paragraph
Beaubourg and the Sainsbury Centre were both conceived as highly,Paragraph
serviced containers of art. But their architectural imagery diverged. The first,Paragraph
"expressed the guts of its structure and servicing—beams, pipes, ducts, and",Paragraph
lifts—while the second concealed the same servicing inside a sleek double,Paragraph
"skin, revealing it only in tantalizing glimpses through glazed panels. Both",Paragraph
sought an imagery of light and air. Both highlighted the complex structure,Paragraph
and servicing required to build sports-hall-like spaces for art. Both traded,Paragraph
on the rhetoric of flexibility and spontaneity. However—as illustrated by,Paragraph
"the permanent rooms retrofitted to Beaubourg’s floorplates, and",Paragraph
reconfigurable panels at the Sainsbury Centre that were never reconfigured,Caption
—both also overstated their flexibility. These ‘high-tech’ buildings were set,Paragraph
apart from Saarinen’s GM campus and Fuller’s geodesics by their visual,Paragraph
exaggeration of their technological credentials—illustrated by technicolour,Paragraph
ducts and a double skin containing significantly more space than strictly,Paragraph
necessary.,Paragraph
Previous modern buildings I’ve discussed in this book questioned the merits,Paragraph
"of architectural decoration, understood by their architects as arbitrary,",Paragraph
"unnecessary, and morally wrong. But Beaubourg and the Sainsbury Centre,",Paragraph
"by contrast, renewed concern for amplified imagery. They moved beyond",Paragraph
"ideas about deriving plan form, for example, and the placement of",Paragraph
"windows, straightforwardly from functional necessities. They didn’t only",Paragraph
"express technology, they ‘fetishized’ it (as critics said at the time).",Paragraph
Beaubourg’s web of ducts became a kind of ornamentation. As did the sleek,Paragraph
"surfaces of the Sainsbury Centre, artfully caricaturing ordinary roadside",Caption
"sheds, and expensively reinventing typical components. Both buildings took",Paragraph
"the expression of technology beyond, say, E.1027 or Seagram, and beyond",Paragraph
the rhetoric of functional logic. Previous modern buildings emphasized,Paragraph
"technology visually, where Beaubourg and Sainsbury artfully exaggerated",Paragraph
"it, engaging in technologically inspired embellishment.",Paragraph
This distinction is subtle but important. It shows how Beaubourg and,Paragraph
Sainsbury extended the functional ethos of modern design but also went,Paragraph
"beyond it. Arguably, these buildings rejected Ruskin’s insistence on truth to",Paragraph
"materials by accentuating functional necessities for visual effect, flouting",Paragraph
Loos’s insistence that ‘ornament is a crime’ and Mies’s dictum that ‘less is,Paragraph
more’.,Paragraph
These buildings’ complex imagery reflected the growing complexities of,Paragraph
the time. The 1973 Energy Crisis—when Middle Eastern oil companies,Paragraph
refused to supply fuel to certain Western countries because of a war with,Paragraph
"Israel—highlighted connections between burgeoning oil consumption,",Paragraph
"global politics, and ecological concerns. The crisis highlighted the fragility",Paragraph
of energy supply at a time when its reliability had become taken for granted.,Paragraph
It renewed postwar apprehensions about the value of technology for society.,Paragraph
And it coincided with a prolonged economic downturn causing the decline,Paragraph
"of established industries, and communities around them, in the West.",Paragraph
"Meanwhile, the Cold War threat of imminent nuclear destruction persisted.",Paragraph
A growing popular sense emerged that the modern promise of perpetual,Paragraph
progress—linking technology and democracy with ever-increasing living,Title
"standards—had halted. Art, literature, and film increasingly reflected this",Paragraph
"emerging scepticism. Meanwhile, prominent philosophers and cultural",Paragraph
theorists challenged the fundamental basis of scientific and technological,Paragraph
"thinking. They illustrated how the supposedly objective realities, and",Paragraph
"absolute truths, of science and technology conveniently reflected the values",Paragraph
"of a prosperous, white, Western, male elite, Feminism, civil rights,",Paragraph
"ecological activism, and studies of global power (‘postcolonialism’)",Title
"highlighted links between global finance, political authority, and the",Paragraph
"priorities of industry and military technologies, questioning the motivations",Paragraph
of the powerful global technocratic establishment. It’s now widely assumed,Paragraph
that modernity came to an end in the 1980s and 1990s because of this,Paragraph
"growing loss of faith in the ideas of progress and technology, highlighting",Paragraph
the increasingly complicated problems of so-called developed societies.,Paragraph
"These complexities can be seen reflected in the subtle, if fundamental, shift",Paragraph
from modern architectures which expressed technology to those like,Paragraph
Beaubourg and Sainsbury which heightened it.,Paragraph
Beaubourg and Sainsbury were transitional. They remained statements of,Paragraph
"faith in the social promise of technology. But, as philosopher Walter",Paragraph
"Benjamin reflected, every age dreams its successor, and their ‘high-tech’",Paragraph
"imagery also anticipated the so-called postmodem architecture of the 1980s,",Paragraph
"which rejected modern moralizing about honest architectural expression,",Paragraph
and re-embraced heightened imagery. While the underlying structural logic,Paragraph
"of postmodern buildings usually remained straightforwardly modem, their",Paragraph
surfaces became ornamented with decoration derived from architectural,Paragraph
"history, swooping or jagged ‘deconstructed’ forms or, indeed, high-tech",Paragraph
"motifs. Thus, Beaubourg and Sainsbury stand both for late modernity and",Paragraph
the emergence of what followed. They conclude this story about modern,Paragraph
"architecture. However, they could equally begin another story about",Paragraph
postmodern architecture.,Paragraph
Chapter 6,Title
Conclusion,Title
"Bessemer steel, Portland cement, concrete reinforcement, and electric light",Title
—all key technical ingredients of architectural modernity—were products,Paragraph
of the 19th century. The distinctive architectural moralities concerning,Paragraph
"‘truth’ to materials and functions, which became associated with them, were",Paragraph
"also consolidated in the 19th century, deriving from the theories of Ruskin,",Paragraph
"Semper, Viollet-le-Duc, and others. Their future combination into what later",Paragraph
became recognized as modern architecture was not obvious at the time. It,Paragraph
"looked inevitable only in retrospect, when historians like Russell-",Paragraph
"Hitchcock, Pevsner, and Banham—with their own agendas—arranged",Paragraph
buildings and ideas into coherent stories. It took until the first half of the,Paragraph
"20th century for architects to mature their ideas, in conjunction with new",Paragraph
"materials, into the distinctive imagery that’s now recognized as modern",Paragraph
architecture. But that imagery was only the outward sign of new ways of,Paragraph
"organizing structure, space, and surface: integrating architecture with",Title
services; exploring novel logics of frames and planes; and testing free- and,Paragraph
open-plans.,Paragraph
Modem architects only gradually learnt to talk about their designs in,Paragraph
"today’s familiar terms, emphasizing function, simplicity, order, space, place,",Paragraph
"light, and air. That emerging vocabulary didn’t encourage them to discuss",Paragraph
what their buildings looked like. Nor did it help them to acknowledge their,Paragraph
"intertextual references to art, engineering, or industrial design. Instead, most",Paragraph
modern architects promoted the myth that their buildings’ appearance was,Paragraph
"merely a consequence of functional planning, and the organizational logics",Paragraph
inherent in the materials they employed.,Paragraph
"Many postmodern architects, however, remembered that—just like the Iron",Paragraph
Bridge was shaped as an arch because that’s what bridges were expected to,Paragraph
look like—people maintained deep-seated preferences about how buildings,Paragraph
"should appear. Despite efforts, by Mies for example, to design definitive",Paragraph
"modern college and office buildings, most people’s preferred architectural",Paragraph
"imagery remained premodern, and specific to familiar cultures. According",Paragraph
"to postmodern theorists, notably Léon Krier, these preferences were related",Paragraph
"to particular building types, like houses, schools, or hospitals. For example,",Paragraph
"in Britain, the lasting popular image of the house seems to have remained in",Paragraph
"brick or stone, with a pitched roof and pretty decorative porch. In West",Caption
"German cities, the image of home remains flats in courtyard blocks, with",Paragraph
their particular pattern of communal living. It seemed that people were most,Paragraph
comfortable with the imagery of modern architecture only in building types,Paragraph
"most closely associated with modern technologies, like railway stations, car",Paragraph
"parks, and motorway service areas. In the 1980s, this thinking chimed with",Paragraph
"ideas from the study of language, from ‘semiotics’, which examined how",Paragraph
the word-labels attached to things remain separate from the things,Paragraph
"themselves. Why do we call a tree a tree, semioticians asked (or an arbol or",Paragraph
"a $f), and not a kudfgaefjkd? Similarly, postmodern architects speculated",Paragraph
"about the appearance of architecture in terms of visual languages. What, for",Paragraph
"example, makes a mosque look like a mosque and not a garage?",Paragraph
"Some modem architects—such as Aalto, Carlo Scarpa, or George Pace—",Paragraph
abstracted traditional architectural forms to produce modem ones which,Paragraph
"nevertheless seemed familiar, making intertextual references to older",Paragraph
architectures. But postmodern architects instead frequently covered their,Paragraph
buildings with facades that pasted in traditional ‘signifying’ forms. For,Paragraph
"example, big urban buildings like shopping malls were frequently collaged",Paragraph
with a variety of historic (or historic-ish) elevations to make them look like,Paragraph
traditional city blocks comprising multiple buildings. Modern architects,Paragraph
"would have dismissed this as inauthentic, concealing the inherent logic of",Paragraph
the building and its materials. The engineering behind postmodern facades,Paragraph
"like these usually remained stubbornly modern, however, comprising steel",Paragraph
and concrete frames optimized to suit the building’s functions. In numerous,Paragraph
"examples like this, ghosts of modern architecture—in the traces of modern",Paragraph
ideas and organizational logics—have remained tenaciously persistent.,Paragraph
Ghosts of modern architecture,Title
The current strand of expert architectural practice which subscribes most,Paragraph
"closely to modern values is digital design, often called ‘parametricism’",Paragraph
because it sometimes employs computer modelling to test design,Paragraph
parameters. Its architects continue to pursue new technologies towards,Paragraph
"distinctive imagery, but they work with technologies of design process more",Paragraph
than novel materials. Innovative software allows such architects to model,Paragraph
"extraordinarily elaborate shapes. In parallel, experimental manufacturing",Paragraph
has transformed the fantasy of mass production into a new fantasy of ‘mass,Paragraph
"customization’, where elaborate shapes can be fabricated from individual",Paragraph
components mass produced digitally as one-offs. Examples include projects,Paragraph
"from the offices of NOX, Jiirgen Mayer, Zaha Hadid Architects, and Gehry",Paragraph
Partners.,Paragraph
Ghosts of ideas about truth to materials and function remain—through their,Paragraph
rejection—in projects by OMA with Rem Koolhaas: extensions to IIT’s,Paragraph
"Mies-designed Commons building, 2003, for example; and Casa da Musica,",Caption
"Porto, Portugal, 2005. These projects matched cheap materials with crude",Paragraph
"fixings, rejecting the obsessive detailing of Mies and Lewerentz, whose",Paragraph
apparently simple elements required huge effort to make. OMA did this,Paragraph
both to critique modern architecture and to illustrate how present-day,Paragraph
"concerns—like increased developer profits, mass-produced building",Paragraph
"components, and diminishing craft skills—mean that architectural detailing,",Paragraph
"as once understood, can seem largely impossible. OMA’s deliberately ‘bad’",Paragraph
"details remain as considered, however, as any they criticize.",Paragraph
The plans of famous modern buildings could often be summarized in simple,Paragraph
"organizational diagrams, so-called ‘parti sketches’, like Mies’s Crown Hall",Paragraph
—a steel pavilion sat on a base—or Kahn’s Yale Center for Fine Art—a,Paragraph
stack of floorplates punctured with vertical volumes. Another strand of,Paragraph
"contemporary practice emphasizes clear, if not always so straightforwardly",Paragraph
"functional, plan or section diagrams. Kazuyo Sejima + Ryue",Caption
"Nishizawa/SANAA’s Leaming Centre in Lausanne, Switzerland, 2010,",Caption
"provides an example, conceived as a giant free-plan space sandwiched",Paragraph
between undulating floor and roof planes with circular courtyards drilled,Paragraph
"through. MVRDV’s Market Hall, Rotterdam, 2014, enclosed stalls under a",Caption
"vast hoop of flats. Such projects are defined by the logic of their diagrams,",Paragraph
which control characteristic aspects of the architecture.,Paragraph
The idea of regionalism—associated with Gut Garkau Farm and Saynatsalo,Paragraph
Town Hall—persists among architects who seek to adapt forces of,Paragraph
"globalized construction to local conditions, pursuing contemporary national",Paragraph
architectures. Such thinking underpins otherwise hugely divergent designs,Paragraph
"from the offices of Wang Shu and Lu Wenyu in China, for example,",Paragraph
"Rogelio Salmona in Colombia, and Glenn Murcutt in rural Australia.",Paragraph
Ideas from the 1960s counter-culture also persist. Ongoing interest in self-,Paragraph
"build is exemplified by projects facilitated in Chile by architects Elemental,",Paragraph
and in Burkina Faso by Diébédo Francis Kéré. Evidence about climate,Caption
change caused by human activity has renewed Fuller’s concerns about the,Paragraph
urgency of ecological design. Responses range from technological,Paragraph
approaches—inventing devices to reduce the energy consumption of other,Paragraph
"devices, as in the ‘eco-tech’ practice of T.R. Hamzah & Yeang from",Paragraph
"Malaysia, and later work from Foster’s office—to those rejecting complex",Paragraph
"technologies—like buildings at the Centre for Alternative Technology,",Paragraph
"Machynlleth, Wales.",Caption
"Various strands of contemporary practice, occasionally called ‘neo-",Paragraph
"modern’, trade in the imagery of modern architecture without subscribing",Paragraph
so strictly to its moralities. Examples include the ‘crafted boxes’ of Gigon,Paragraph
"Guyer’s practice in Switzerland, and the white architectures of Alvaro Siza",Paragraph
"and Eduardo Souto da Moura in Portugal enlivened with thoughtful,",Paragraph
"whimsical details. Similarly, Peter Zumthor’s sensory modern architecture",Paragraph
enriches simple forms with evocative materials to engender emotive,Paragraph
atmospheres. Such projects aspire to the imagery of truth to materials,Paragraph
"without necessarily achieving it, seeking to maintain the illusion of simple",Paragraph
construction after new regulatory regimes have made architectural,Paragraph
simplicity significantly harder to achieve.,Paragraph
Regulation and risk,Title
It might seem curious to turn to the emergence of building regulations in,Paragraph
"concluding this book, but they were decisive in both the demise of modern",Paragraph
"imagery, and the simultaneous consolidation of modern values in the",Paragraph
present-day construction industry.,Paragraph
Building regulations multiplied in most Western countries during the latter,Paragraph
part of the 20th century as a cultural consequence of the forces of industrial,Paragraph
production. Regulatory regimes burgeoned in a postwar context of state,Paragraph
"paternalism and increasing professionalization, seeking to regularize non-",Paragraph
"professionals, and to protect the public from excesses of profit-driven",Paragraph
"developers, consultants, and landlords. They also responded to a loss of",Paragraph
construction skills following an increasing decline in architectural,Paragraph
ornamentation. This decline diminished cultures of craft and artisanal care,Paragraph
"in building, alongside a corresponding proliferation of industrial building",Paragraph
"products—including window, door, and roofing components—understood",Paragraph
as technical systems. Clients increasingly began to insist upon the,Paragraph
"warranties that came with such systems, giving architects increasingly",Paragraph
fewer opportunities to invent evocative details—like Aalto did—,Paragraph
"progressively rendering designers as shoppers for, and coordinators of,",Paragraph
mass-produced parts.,Paragraph
Building regulations progressively made modemism unworkable at the,Paragraph
level of detail. Increasing requirements for greater insulation necessitated,Paragraph
"ever more complex interfaces between components, serving to thicken-up",Paragraph
"previously simple, slender connections. Likewise, structural rules required",Paragraph
"additional factors of safety in steel and concrete sizing, frustrating the",Paragraph
"imagery of lightness. Also, certain accessibility regulations have dictated",Paragraph
"contrasting surfaces to assist people with visual impairments, outlawing",Paragraph
visual simplicity by multiplying textures and colours—additionally,Paragraph
prohibiting the modern detail where wall materials continue as floor,Paragraph
"materials, as at St Peter’s, Klippan.",Paragraph
"In contrast, however, building regulation regimes have also consolidated",Paragraph
other priorities of modern architecture. They usually required the,Paragraph
"submission of structural calculations, which had the effect of promoting",Paragraph
steel and concrete frames—that engineers find easier to analyse—over,Paragraph
timber and masonry. They have often specified consistent light levels—in,Paragraph
classrooms and offices for example—requiring artificial lighting even,Paragraph
where windows are present because natural light is deemed too unreliable,Paragraph
"for healthy screen use. Similarly, rules quantifying the number of air",Paragraph
changes needed per hour in certain spaces have frequently discounted,Paragraph
"natural ventilation as unpredictable, dictating mechanical air handling.",Paragraph
"Regulations like these deal largely in technical performance and, as such,",Paragraph
"their values clearly derive from modem architecture—focused on function,",Paragraph
with little to say about what buildings look and feel like.,Paragraph
These values inherent in building regulation regimes resonate with the,Paragraph
"current international construction industry. Fuelled by global finance,",Paragraph
"consuming mass-produced building products, resourced by multinational",Paragraph
"consultants, that industry has become highly risk-averse. It tends to prefer",Paragraph
quantitative data about the timely and profitable delivery of buildings over,Paragraph
"wearisome considerations about their visual qualities, cultural meanings,",Paragraph
"and atmospheres. Indeed, surveyors, project managers, and engineers—",Paragraph
"frequently more adept than architects in the language of reliable delivery,",Paragraph
like Paxton and Eiffel more than a century before—have assumed the bulk,Paragraph
"of project management from architects in numerous national contexts. Thus,",Paragraph
innovative architectural imagery has regularly become understood as,Paragraph
"unnecessarily risky. Architects—preoccupied with design ideas, frequently",Paragraph
more concemed with the qualities of finished buildings than management,Paragraph
processes used to deliver them—can struggle to get heard in contemporary,Paragraph
construction. Dominant industry values have become so unshakeably,Paragraph
"modern—rooted in technical criteria, ambivalent to visual, social, and",Paragraph
"atmospheric qualities—that architects, many of whom now question",Paragraph
"modern priorities, can regularly feel they don’t belong.",Paragraph
Multiple modernities,Title
"In retrospect, it’s easy to caricature modern architecture as symbolizing the",Paragraph
"idea of modernity as an unquestioned good: promoting technology, industry,",Paragraph
"and novelty as progress; celebrating the globalization of trade, finance, and",Paragraph
"culture. It’s also easy to caricature, in opposition, a renewed preference for",Paragraph
"traditional architectures—romanticizing a return to historical motifs, local",Paragraph
"materials, and time-honoured crafts—as symbolizing a rejection of",Paragraph
modernity in favour of reclaiming a sentimental idea of the pre-industrial,Paragraph
"past. However, these positions are false opposites. Modernity and modern",Paragraph
architecture were always double-edged. The popular uptake of new,Paragraph
technologies was always accompanied by anxieties about the effects of,Paragraph
industrialization and globalization. These contradictions were exemplified,Paragraph
by the medieval imagery of suburban villas constructed by British,Paragraph
"developers in the 1930s, which were nevertheless kitted-out with electric",Paragraph
"light, radios, telephones, and kitchen devices, Over time, there have been",Paragraph
"numerous global equivalents of these houses, fitting versions of Fuller’s",Paragraph
technological environments inside traditional-looking architectural cloaks.,Paragraph
"Architects and critics, schooled in modern ideas about architecture as an",Paragraph
"honest reflection of the age, usually scorn them. But such buildings stand as",Paragraph
preliminary attempts to reconcile modernity with previous cultures and,Paragraph
"priorities of everyday life, just like the architectures of Aalto, Kahn, and",Paragraph
"Lewerentz did more artfully. They reflect complex, provisional settlements",Paragraph
"between ideas of future and past, progress and history, global and local,",Paragraph
"industrial and pastoral, universal and particular, individual and civic, and",Paragraph
"mass produced and artisan. They stand, awkwardly, for the simultaneous",Paragraph
popular acceptance and rejection of modernity and its priorities. The,Paragraph
continuing prevalence of such architectures illustrates ongoing difficulties,Paragraph
"in grasping what modernity was, and negotiating what its implications",Paragraph
"continue to be. It’s clear that, for much of the 20th century, modern",Paragraph
architecture stood for the place of the future—as related to the past—in the,Paragraph
"present. But the associations of those ideas about future, present, and past",Paragraph
"always remained complex, changing, and contested.",Paragraph
"For all its global effects, modernity was never a unified phenomenon.",Paragraph
"Aspects of the experience of modernity were shared, characterized by new",Paragraph
"technologies which accelerated change in urbanization, work, and domestic",Paragraph
"life. However, modernity was experienced differently by different people in",Paragraph
different places at different times: hardly the same in Soviet Romania as in,Paragraph
"Canada, or at the end of the 18th century as in the middle of the 20th.",Paragraph
"Indeed, it felt different depending on the opportunities, or lack of them,",Paragraph
"afforded by people’s wealth, class, gender, and ethnicity. Just as experiences",Paragraph
"of modernity were complex and diverse, so the famous modern buildings",Paragraph
I’ve introduced here had ideas in common and others that separated them.,Paragraph
"In various ways, however, they all exhibited faith in the social promise of",Paragraph
"technology. They celebrated architectural innovation, imagining that a",Paragraph
"changed architecture was necessary to represent a changed world, at a time",Paragraph
when the rate of social and industrial change kept increasing. Their images,Paragraph
expressed optimism that modemity could transform people’s lives for the,Paragraph
better. And there were times and places when that optimism seemed,Paragraph
infectious.,Paragraph
