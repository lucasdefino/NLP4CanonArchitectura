Introduction,Title
Rosemarie Haag Bletter,Title
Adolf Behne’s Der moderne Zweckbau (The Modern Functional Building) pre-,Paragraph
"sciently unmasked many of the ideologies of functionalism, rationalism, and",Paragraph
European Modernism of the 1920s. Written in 1923 (though not published,Paragraph
"until 1926), it preceded the later German publications of Walter Gropius,",Paragraph
"Ludwig Hilberseimer, Walter Curt Behrendt, and Bruno Taut and sheds much",Paragraph
light on them.? Today the Anglo-American audience remains largely familiar,Paragraph
with European Modernism through the narrow focus of Henry-Russel,Paragraph
"Hitchcock and Philip Johnson’s The International Style, 1932, although Hitch-",Paragraph
"cock’s earlier Modern Architecture: Romanticism and Reintegration, 1929, had",Paragraph
presented a somewhat more varied picture of recent developments. By con-,Paragraph
"trast, arguments about Modernism were articulated in surprisingly rich and",Paragraph
complex ways in the aforementioned European works of the 1920s.,Paragraph
Behne's Der moderne Zweckbau is crucial for understanding modernist,Paragraph
"polernics contextually, especially those later subsumed under the notion of",Paragraph
"functionalism. In a general sense, the increasing concern with purpose and",Paragraph
"Sachlichkeit in early Modernism signifies the change from older, aristo-",Paragraph
cratic value systems to an emphasis on everyday and common experience,Paragraph
as the new paradigm. Behne’s text is also helpful in reconsidering some of,Paragraph
"the standard assumptions and questions about this period, especially the",Paragraph
presumption of a visually coherent style. Instead of emphasizing the exter-,Paragraph
"nal appearance of buildings, German texts dealing with Modernism in the",Paragraph
19208 identified the new architecture through its underlying conceptua,Paragraph
premises. Contemporary expression was therefore seen as a reflection of,Paragraph
"philosophical attitudes toward modernity, and this view allowed for greater",Paragraph
visual diversity— perhaps only because an exact correspondence between,Paragraph
idea and form was difficult to establish.,Paragraph
The three-year delay in the publication of Der moderne Zweckbau reveals,Paragraph
much about the competitive nature of early Modernism. Gropius had sought,Paragraph
Behne’s assistance in preparing the Bauhaus exhibition Internationale Archi-,Paragraph
tektur in 1923; but when Behne in turn asked Gropius to change the con-,Paragraph
tent or delay the publication date of the book of the same title (the first entry,Paragraph
"in the Bauhausbiicher, or Bauhaus book series, which was projected for",Paragraph
"publication in 1924) because of its similarity to Behne’s own work, Gropius",Paragraph
refused. Gropius’s decision to start a book series hampered Behne’s efforts,Paragraph
on other fronts as well. When Behne shortly thereafter approached J. J. P.,Paragraph
Oud (whose work Behne had promoted in 1922 in his monograph on Dutch,Paragraph
"architecture) and asked him for material for his own book, Oud responded",Paragraph
that he would prefer to have his work published in the Bauhaus book series.,Paragraph
He clearly expected more publicity and credibility given the Bauhaus’s insti-,Paragraph
tutional backing.,Paragraph
"Nevertheless, books such as Gropius's Internationale Architektur, 1925,",Paragraph
portrayed contemporary architecture —as did Behne —in an astonishingly,Paragraph
varied way. Frank Lloyd Wright's Larkin Building and Erich Mendeisohn’s,Paragraph
equally massive-looking double house in Berlin were included among Inter-,Paragraph
nationale Architektur’s illustrations. Hilberseimer’s Internationale neue Bau-,Caption
"kunst (New international architecture), which appeared in 1927 under the",Paragraph
"auspices of the German Werkbund, was similarly diverse in scope. Its exam-",Paragraph
"ples ranged from an apartment house by Jan Wils to housing by Taut, in",Paragraph
addition to unexecuted schemes by Russian Constructivists. In Die neue,Paragraph
Baukunst in Europa und Amerika (simultaneously published in English as,Paragraph
"Modern Architecture), 1929, Bruno Taut was also extraordinarily inclusive in",Paragraph
his selection of examples.,Paragraph
Whereas several of these books alluded to the perceived internationalism,Paragraph
"of contemporary architecture, only Behrendt’s Der Sieg des newen Baustils",Paragraph
"The victory of the new building style), 1927, treated the new architecture as",Paragraph
"a style, as would Hitchcock and Johnson’s later study.* Notwithstanding his",Paragraph
"title, even Behrendt presented a varied picture of contemporary architecture,",Paragraph
"one that included works by Hans Poelzig, Mendelsohn, and Willem Dudok.",Paragraph
ie saw Wright's Robie House and Henry van de Velde’s theater at the Werk-,Paragraph
bund exhibition of 1914 as the key precedents to modern architecture; and,Paragraph
he presented an organic plan by Hugo Haring next to Ludwig Mies van der,Paragraph
Rohe’s De Stijl-inspired plan for a brick country house so that side-by-side,Paragraph
they appeared as equally central examples of the new style. But because Ger-,Paragraph
man proselytizers of Modernism tended to downplay the aesthetic aspects,Paragraph
"of architecture, their criteria depended less on visual elements than did",Paragraph
Hitchcock and Johnson’s work. Reinforcing this attitudinal difference was,Paragraph
the fact that contemporary architecture was commonly referred to in Ger-,Paragraph
"many as “Neues Bauen” (new building), just as in Holland it was known as",Paragraph
“Nieuw Bouwen.”5,Caption
It is not entirely clear why the term Neues Bawen became prevalent in the,Paragraph
"19208. The word modern was more commonly used prior to 1923, as for",Paragraph
"example in Karl Scheffler’s Moderne Baukunst, 1907, or, for that matter,",Paragraph
Behne’s Der moderne Zweckbau.’ Possibly under the influence of the general,Paragraph
"Expressionist conception of the new man, and more specifically the Neues",Paragraph
"Bauen exhibition of 1920 at J. B. Neumann's gallery in Berlin,’ and the popu-",Paragraph
larization after 1923 of Gustav Hartlaub’s “Neue Sachlichkeit” (conceived by,Paragraph
"him as a further evolution of Expressionism, nota reaction to it), the term new",Paragraph
attained wide currency among the German avant-garde. Taut’s Die neue Woh-,Paragraph
"nung (The new dwelling), 1924, suggests the link to Expressionism.® Neu",Paragraph
seems to have implied change and the progressivism associated with the,Paragraph
new movement more clearly than the term modern. The latter seerns almost,Paragraph
to have been perceived as a neutral chronological marker synonymous with,Paragraph
contemporary. Behne himself signifies the shift from modern to neu in his,Paragraph
"Neues Wohnen — Neues Bauen (New dwelling — New building), 1927, and the",Paragraph
emphasis on the new is apparent in the titles of Hilberseimer’s Interna-,Paragraph
"tionale neue Baukunst, Behrendt’s Der Sieg des neuen Baustils, or Taut’s Bauen—",Paragraph
"Der neue Wohnbau (Building — The new domestic architecture), 1927.°",Caption
It is also possible that neu carried political overtones that had prewar,Paragraph
origins in Germany. The weekly newspaper of the Social Democrats was,Paragraph
called Die neve Zeit. Behne wrote an essay for this paper in 1914 on the rep-,Paragraph
resentation of workers in art. His first book (subsequent to publication of,Paragraph
his doctoral thesis) was titled Zur neuen Kunst (Toward the new art) and was,Paragraph
published in 1915 by Der Sturm. Modern in a political context may have,Paragraph
"meant simply “of the present time,” whereas neue Zeit — and by implication",Paragraph
neu — suggested a rupture with past times.,Paragraph
Such contextual or regional shifts in terminology do not apply in the,Paragraph
"same way to the Anglo-American sphere, where modern continued to be the",Paragraph
preferred term. It is significant that Taut’s Die neue Baukunst in Europa und,Paragraph
"Amerika, 1929, appeared in its English edition of the same year under the",Paragraph
"title Modern Architecture. And Behrendt, the author of Der Sieg des neuen",Paragraph
"Baustils, 1927, later, while living in America, wrote Modern Building, 1937.1",Caption

out.'! Whereas in England in the 1950s the avant-garde of the 1920s was,Paragraph
generally referred to as the Modern Movement — suggesting a degree of,Paragraph
"activism and ongoing development — today we tend to prefer Modernism, a",Paragraph
word that seems to denote a historical period.,Paragraph
To understand the ideology and intricacies of the modernist debate that,Paragraph
"fueled the Neues Bauen, one needs to study more closely the polemics of",Paragraph
books by the aforementioned German authors. For this purpose Behne’s Der,Paragraph
moderne Zweckbau is the most revealing text. It fully explores and carefully sets,Paragraph
the stage for later arguments and for the development of concepts such as,Paragraph
"Sachlichkeit (objectivity, functionalism) and Zweck (purpose, function). In this",Paragraph
respect Behne’s role is comparable to that of Hartlaub in the staging of the,Paragraph
"exhibition of 1925 on the Neue Sachlichkeit in painting.’ Beyond that, Behne,",Paragraph
"a critic of both art and architecture, was also an astute observer of the con-",Paragraph

"well as the work of close friends. He was not a practicing architect, yet he",Paragraph
was not exactly a completely detached observer. Bene was a major partici-,Paragraph

close acquaintance with nearly all of the principal architects of his time.,Paragraph
Adolf Bruno Behne was born in Magdeburg on 13,Paragraph
"uly 1885, the son of an",Paragraph
architect. When he was a year old his parents moved with him and his two,Paragraph
"older brothers, Erich and Karl, to Berlin. He grew up",Paragraph

in one of the working-,Paragraph

house) and attended a Gymnasium from which he graduated in 1905. His,Paragraph
academic training commenced with the study of architecture at the Techni-,Paragraph
"sche Hochschule (Polytechnic school) in Berlin-Charlottenburg, but in 1907",Paragraph
he decided to study art history at the Friedrich-Wilhelm Universitat. After a,Paragraph
"stay in Italy, he produced his dissertation, “Der Inkrustationssti] in Toscana”",Paragraph
"(The incrustation style in Tuscany), in 1912. Among his teachers were Hein-",Paragraph
"rich Wolfflin (with whom Giedion had also studied) and Georg Simmel, the",Paragraph
great philosopher and sociologist. Thereafter he taught in a Hochschule as,Paragraph
"well as a Volkshochschule (an adult education program), and he became part",Paragraph
of the Volksbildungsbewegung (People’s education movement). This move-,Paragraph
ment was concerned with furthering education outside of academic institu-,Paragraph
"tions, and it remained an interest for Behne throughout his career. In 1913",Paragraph
"he married Elfriede Schneider, the daughter of a railroad engineer, whom he",Paragraph
had met through the mathematics club at the university. They had two,Paragraph
"daughters — Karla, born in 1913, and Julia, born in 1921.4",Caption
"Before the war Behne also belonged to the Choriner Kreis (Chorin circle),",Paragraph
"a group of young writers, artists, and architects that met on weekends for",Paragraph
walks in the woods around the small town of Chorin near Berlin. Max,Caption
"Beckmann and Taut were also members of the group, and Behne formed a",Paragraph
4,Title
long-lasting friendship with Taut.!* Among Behne’s earliest articles were,Paragraph
"those in Die Hilfe—the weekly journal published by Friedrich Naumann, a",Paragraph
"politician, former Protestant pastor, and one of the key organizers of the",Paragraph
Werkbund. Naumann had founded Die Hilfe in 1894 as the organ of the pro-,Paragraph
gressive wing of the Christian-Social movement. He had been interested in,Paragraph
using the arts to improve the quality of products because he believed that,Paragraph
"doing so “would raise the value of labor, improve the worker's status,",Paragraph
"increase his joy in work, and thus reverse the trend to proletarianization",Paragraph
"hitherto associated with the advance of capitalism.”""5 Together with the soci-",Paragraph
"ologist Max Weber, with whom he was closely associated, Naumann rejected",Paragraph
the Marxist view that economics is the central factor in social change. Both,Paragraph
men stressed the plurality and interdependence of causes.,Paragraph
Behne’s name appears for the first time as a member of the Werkbund in,Paragraph
"1913, the year after he received his doctorate. Before World War 1 he published",Paragraph
articles on the work of Peter Behrens and Taut. His articles appeared in Der,Paragraph
"Sturm, Die Welibiihne, Sozialistische Monatshefte, and Das neue Frankfurt,",Caption
among many other periodicals. He wrote frequently on the role of the museum,Paragraph
in the general education of the public and more specifically on the ambigu-,Paragraph
ous nature of the framed picture in the museum setting. Since the museum,Paragraph
"imposes a change in context on all works of art, he saw the common concern",Paragraph
with “original” art as a false issue. In his essay “Das reproduktive Zeitalter”,Paragraph
"(The reproductive era} of 1917, he seems to prefigure Walter Benjamin’s well-",Paragraph
known thesis about the effect of mass produced images on art.'¢ Behne was,Paragraph
also interested in advertising and its wide-ranging effects on culture: he,Paragraph
once referred to Mendelsohn’s urban buildings as Reklamearchitektur (adver-,Paragraph
"tising architecture). He did not, however, see eye-to-eye with the prevailing",Paragraph
Werkbund policy imposing aesthetic standards on all aspects of daily life.,Paragraph
"Advertising, he wrote in 1924, was as central to a modern economy as",Paragraph
"money, and any attempt to control it through aesthetic regulations was",Paragraph
bound to be counterproductive in that it would treat advertising as a purely,Paragraph
"formal problem. On the one hand, Behne did not believe that using art to",Paragraph
"mask a subject was necessarily good.'? On the other hand, he wrote about",Paragraph
"films as art as early as 1921, and he included the important role of film in",Paragraph
his discussion of pedagogy.'®,Paragraph
"As noted above, Behne’s first book, Zur neuen Kunst was published in",Paragraph
"1915 by Der Sturm, the major disseminator of contemporary, and particu-",Paragraph
"larly Expressionist, art. An excerpt from the book titled “Expressionistische",Paragraph
Architektur” appeared in the magazine Der Sturm in the same year. This,Paragraph
"essay was among the earliest attempts to define Expressionism, and it",Paragraph
certainly was the first to do so within the context of architecture. Behne’s,Paragraph
"description of Expressionism was not narrowly Germanic or medievalizing,",Paragraph
and his essay included Cubism and Futurism as equally important aspects,Paragraph
of this contemporary expression.’,Paragraph
In 1915 Behne also wrote an article in Die Tat entitled “Der Hass der,Paragraph
"Neutralen” (The hatred of the neutrals), in which he complained about the",Paragraph
lack of support for Germany during the early war years. He returned the,Paragraph
idea of an “avant-garde” to its original military meaning when he wrote that,Paragraph
those who did not commit themselves were fearful of the new. Behne was,Paragraph
hardly alone in this attitude. The sociologist Weber described the war as,Paragraph
"“great and wonderful,” and Thomas Mann saw it as “purification, liberation",Paragraph
...an immense hope.”2¢,Paragraph
Behne’s position during the war years has led to a diverse set of assess-,Paragraph
ments concerning his political beliefs. lain Boyd Whyte in his otherwise,Paragraph
"exceptionally informative Bruno Taut and the Architecture of Activism, 1982,",Caption
uses this essay and Behne’s association with the Choriner Kreis (among,Paragraph
other things) to show that he (and Taut) were essentially conservative.?! Fol-,Paragraph

Lukacs’s reductive argument was countered in the late 1930s by one of,Paragraph
"his former friends, the Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch (they had met in",Paragraph
Simmel’s seminar). Bloch wrote that Lukacs’s opinions were based primarily,Paragraph
"on literary Expressionism, as opposed to painting and architecture. He",Paragraph
argued further that Expressionism did in fact question basic social values,Paragraph
and asserted the constructive value of utopianism. Bloch also found the,Paragraph
Expressionists' inclusion of folk art from many countries more meaningful,Paragraph
than the Neoclassicism that Lukacs had endorsed.*® Most contemporary,Paragraph
Neo-Marxist historians such as Manfredo Tafuri and Francesco Dal Co cite,Paragraph
"only Lukacs and not Bloch, thereby overlooking the vigorous debate and dis-",Paragraph
agreements about a politically engaged art that took place in the 1920s and,Paragraph
"19308.” Possibly because of Lukacs’s influence on recent literary criticism,",Paragraph
his opinions about Expressionist literature have been carried over into the,Paragraph
"other arts of the period with which, however, he was not as familiar.",Paragraph
Whyte is correct when he maintains that a shift in beliefs took place as,Paragraph
"World War 1 progressed. Some, like Taut, became pacifists. Behne joined",Paragraph
the alternative service as a medical orderly during the war. As early as 1914,Paragraph
three of Behne's lectures were published by the educational committee of,Paragraph
"the Social Democratic Party (spp), and he wrote for the party’s weekly, Die",Paragraph
"neue Zeit.’” In 1917, on the other hand, he wrote a book that was published",Paragraph
"under the auspices of the Diirerbund, a fairly conservative educational asso-",Paragraph
ciation for the appreciation of art founded in 1902. In 1917 he also wrote an,Paragraph
essay in praise of the Russian Revolution.’8 It is clear that at the beginning,Paragraph
of his career his interest in a populist approach to art colored most of his,Paragraph
"associations. However, sometime during these early years he joined the spp,",Paragraph

"cized the international socialist movement. After the war he joined the uspp,",Paragraph
the Independent Social Democratic Party and the schismatic left wing of the,Paragraph
majority Socialists; this group had been founded in 1917 to call for an end to,Paragraph
the war and to help politicize the labor force.29,Caption
"Lukacs, in fact, had coupled his critique of Expressionism with an attack",Paragraph
"on the uspp. In his opinion the uspn’s attitude toward revolution, like that of",Paragraph
"the Expressionists, was half-hearted. Lukdcs’s scorn directed at Expression-",Paragraph
ists and the uspp reflects the uneasy alliance between these groups and the,Paragraph
Spartacists — from 1919 on the Communists (krp}—and their later extreme,Paragraph
doctrinal split. By the late 1920s the kpp and the uspp had become arch-,Paragraph
enemies. But in the last year of the war the Spartacists were loosely asso-,Paragraph
"ciated with the uspp,’° and in reality the uspp participated in the mislabeled",Paragraph
“Spartacus Uprising” of January 1919. Both the spp and the KPD were,Paragraph
"working-class parties. The kpp, however, contained more unskilled and",Paragraph
unemployed workers. The parties’ respective social programs reflected the,Paragraph
differences in their makeups. The Social Democrats sought to develop,Paragraph
orthodox Marxism into a Volkssozialismus (popular socialism) and Kultur-,Paragraph
sozialismus (cultural socialism) within the capitalist system; the Com-,Paragraph
"munists, however, demanded radical change and regarded any reform as",Paragraph
illusory. Much of the energy of the labor movement was dissipated by the,Paragraph
intense enmity between these parties. After 1928 the change of policy of,Paragraph
the Soviet Communist Party and the Comintern imposed complete sepa-,Paragraph
"ratism on the xpp, which became openly confrontational with the spp.?! If",Paragraph
one talks about the fate of the Weimar Republic and the responsibility for,Paragraph
"the onset of fascism, a great deal of blame can be meted out not just to con-",Paragraph
servatives but also to the Communists for their refusal to form an alliance,Paragraph
with the Socialists.,Paragraph
Lukécs’s simultaneous attack of Expressionism and the uspp in 1934,Paragraph
must therefore be viewed not just in contrast with Bloch’s response but,Paragraph
even more as an instance of the hard-left approach of the German xpp and,Paragraph
"its ongoing internecine struggle with the competing workers’ party, the",Paragraph
Social Democrats. By the end of the war Behne had become unquestion-,Paragraph
ably associated with the uspp. In rg19 he complained in an article titled,Paragraph

"no break with old attitudes of nationalist arrogance.}? At the same time,",Paragraph
"Behne, although often critical of German society, retained the Social Demo-",Paragraph
crats’ belief in the possiblity of reform. While some of his books were,Paragraph
"addressed to a cultural elite, many more of his publications in the 1920s",Paragraph
were directed to a larger audience. Among these were his introductions,Paragraph
"to art and contemporary art respectively, both published in 1925 by the",Paragraph
"Arbeiter-Jugend Verlag, Die Uberfahrt am Schreckenstein: Eine Einfithrung",Title
in die Kunst (The passage to the Schreckenstein: An introduction to art) and,Paragraph
Von Kunst zur Gestaltung: Eine Einfithrung in die moderne Kunst (From art,Title

tural socialism.*?,Paragraph
Does Modernism Equal Functionalism?,Title
"For many architectural historians, even those who are well acquainted with",Paragraph
"German developments in the 1920s, Modernism and functionalism have",Paragraph
become nearly synonymous.** Within the comparatively brief period of,Paragraph
"Modernism, however, functionalism assumed many guises. Although it is",Paragraph
not within the scope of this essay to do justice to the complexity of function-,Paragraph
"alist beliefs in modern architecture, some arguments about functionalism",Paragraph
are useful to consider in order to understand both the underlying conven-,Paragraph
tions of functionalism in the 19208 and the considerable misunderstand-,Paragraph
ings that have become embedded in postmodern discussions.,Paragraph
Two extreme positions regarding functionalism help to introduce suc-,Paragraph
cinctly the conflicting issues of the history of the term and current reac-,Paragraph
tions to it. Characteristic of the positive view of functionalism in the 1950s,Paragraph
is Edward Robert de Zurko’s excessively broad and uncritical history Origins,Paragraph
"of Functionalist Theory, 1957. Typical of the early postmodernist reaction",Caption
against functionalism is David Watkin’s rather narrowly conceived Morality,Paragraph
"and Architecture, 1977. The shared assumption in both works is that func-",Paragraph
tionalism is synonymous with Modernism.,Paragraph
"Using a rather circular argument, de Zurko writes that “the literature",Paragraph
of functionalism consists largely of the writings of recognized functional-,Paragraph
"ists (such as Horatio Greenough, Louis Sullivan, and Taut).”3* Whereas de",Paragraph
"Zurko’s book is perhaps too inclusive regarding ideas of purpose and utility,",Paragraph
Watkin’s tone is that of a postmodern scold. He belittles Le Corbusier's Vers,Paragraph
"une architecture, 1923, because, in Watkin's words, “What is simple, suppos-",Paragraph
"edly functional, and materialistic in aim, light in colour, and immediately",Paragraph
apprehensible in form enjoys advantages in terms of health and morality,Paragraph
over other different or more complex solutions. Thus it must be imposed on,Paragraph
society as soon as possible if we are to avoid revolution.” He goes on to insist,Paragraph
that the apocalyptic overtones of Le Corbusier’s functionalist argument were,Paragraph
"later exaggerated by Taut in his Modern Architecture, 1929, and cites the fol-",Paragraph
lowing passage from Taut to prove his point:,Paragraph
"If everything is founded on sound efficiency, this efficiency itself, or rather its",Paragraph
"utility, will form its own aesthetic law. A building must be beautiful when seen",Paragraph
from outside if it reflects all these qualities... The architect who achieves this,Paragraph
task becomes a creator of an ethical and social character; the people who use the,Paragraph
"building for any purpose, will, through the structure of the house, be brought",Paragraph
9,Caption
to a better behaviour in their mutual dealings and relationship with each,Paragraph
other. Thus architecture becomes the creator of new social observances.**,Paragraph
If Watkin himself takes on a moralizing voice in his critique of moralizing,Paragraph
theories (in this instance a Puginian trust in social control through architec-,Paragraph
"ture), de Zurko is more open-minded than most modernist historians in his",Paragraph
belief that “modern discussions of functionalism show a dual approach: the,Paragraph
rational and the poetic.” He cautions also that “the frequency of statements,Paragraph
by modern architects regarding functionalism indicates that functionalism,Paragraph
"is neither a clear and unchallenged law of architecture nor a spent force, but",Paragraph
a vital concept requiring clarification.”,Paragraph
Important for understanding modern functionalism and Behne’s attempt,Paragraph
to categorize the various tendencies is de Zurko’s discussion of two major,Paragraph
nineteenth-century functionalist trends: the mechanical and the organic,Title
analogies. The former uses machines as a paradigm for aesthetic theory and,Paragraph
is a response to the Industrial Revolution. Although the latter trend draws,Paragraph
its references from nature and the former employs models of mechanical,Paragraph
"production, both could be invoked together. A clear and early example is the",Paragraph
"theory of the American sculptor Horatio Greenough, who in 1843 proposed",Paragraph
a functionalist approach to architecture in order to create what he thought,Paragraph
"of as a tabula rasa, or hedge against the influence of the older European",Paragraph
styles. He believed that functionalism could foster an indigenous American,Paragraph
"approach to design and recommended, “Let us consult nature, and in the",Paragraph
assurance that she will disclose a mine richer than was ever dreamed of by,Paragraph
the Greeks.” He went on to say that “the law of adaptation is the fundamen-,Paragraph
"tal law of nature in all structure.” Together with this organic justification,",Paragraph
Greenough drew a parallel between natural selection and the production of,Paragraph
"man-made artifacts in general and machines in particular, “If we compare",Paragraph
the form of a newly invented machine with the perfected type of the same,Paragraph
"instrument, we observe, as we trace it through the phases of improvement,",Paragraph
"how weight is shaken off where strength is less needed, how functions are",Paragraph
"made to approach without impeding each other, how straight becomes curved,",Paragraph
"and the curve is straightened, till the straggling and cumbersome machine",Paragraph
becomes the compact effective and beautiful engine.”*,Paragraph
"In addition to the organic and mechanical paradigm, Greenough, through",Paragraph
"his close relationship with Ralph Waldo Emerson, gave his ideas an ethical",Paragraph
dimension as well. Behne would also address all three functional concepts,Paragraph
"present in Modernism — the organic, the mechanical, and the social — but",Paragraph
10,Title
"whereas he described the first two in his role as a historian of the 19208, he",Paragraph
only advocated a type including a social dimension. His advocacy of a social,Paragraph
"functionalism, in fact, resembles Louis Sullivan's polemics.",Paragraph
"Sullivan’s dictum “form follows function,” stated first in 1888, employed",Paragraph
two components of Greenough’s functionalism. Its Lamarckian organi-,Paragraph
"cism is the most evident, and disregarding Greenough's mechanical anal-",Paragraph
"ogy, Sullivan gave the ethical aspect of functionalism greater importance.",Paragraph
"Although initially indebted to Transcendentalism as much as to Greenough,",Paragraph
Sullivan came under the influence of Chicago School pragmatic realism,Paragraph
and John Dewey’s utilitarian instrumentalism in the 1890s. These philoso-,Paragraph
phies assumed a complex interrelationship between human thought and,Paragraph
action and the environment. This interrelationship contrasts with the simple,Paragraph
"behaviorist model of Pugin, in which the environment affects human action",Paragraph
but not vice versa. Hugh Dalziel Duncan explains the Chicago School and,Paragraph
"Sullivan's dictum thus, “Forms arise in attempts to solve problems in social",Paragraph
"action, form and function are real, not because of their relationship to an",Paragraph
"essence outside of or beyond action, but within action in society”?",Paragraph
The distinctly utilitarian ethics of “form follows function” do not seem,Paragraph
to have—on the surface at least—a direct relationship with Central Euro-,Paragraph
"pean ideas in the early twentieth century. However, Beline’s stress on the",Paragraph
"social implications of functionalism, despite his rejection of “utilitarian-",Paragraph
"ism” as he understood it, cannot be divorced altogether from the social",Paragraph
meaning of utilitarianism or from Sullivan’s understanding of function as a,Paragraph
social tool.,Paragraph
"Because “form follows function” is such an easy-to-recall, alliterative,",Paragraph
"and concise phrase, it has unfortunately been remembered far too often. In",Paragraph
"popular usage throughout the second half of the twentieth century, it has",Paragraph
"usually been forgotten that the phrase was coined by Sullivan, and today it is",Paragraph
"frequently associated with European Modernism in general or, just as often,",Paragraph
"with the Bauhaus specifically. In fact, “form follows function” and “Bauhaus",Paragraph

19,Title
"Despite the Artists’ Colony’s shortcomings, Behrens’s contact with",Paragraph
"this group was important for his subsequent career change. At Darmstadt,",Paragraph
Behrens was the only artist who was allowed to design his own house; all,Paragraph
other buildings were designed by Olbrich. Without even an architectural,Paragraph
"apprenticeship, Behrens made the transition from painting and arts and",Paragraph

of the Kunstgewerbeschule (Arts and crafts school) in Diisseldorf. During,Paragraph
"his Diisseldorf period Behrens met the wealthy, young Karl Ernst Osthaus,",Paragraph
who quickly replaced Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig as a more “modern” patron,Paragraph

"Today, however, the Bauhaus is known for its “Bauhaus style” and “Bauhaus",Paragraph

"Bauhaus styles, suggesting an eclectic amalgam of several modernisms.",Paragraph
27,Title
Behne's relationship with Gropius and the Bauhaus was an uneasy one. As,Paragraph
early as 1923 Behne criticized Gropius and the first Bauhaus exhibition for,Paragraph
its superficial use of several styles at the same time.,Paragraph
When Gropius had a chance to design a new building for the Bauhaus in,Paragraph
"Dessau, he was asked by his patron, the mayor of that city, to include space",Paragraph
"for the local crafts schoo!. Thus, he could have brought together in a real sense",Paragraph
"traditional crafts training with Bauhaus instruction, but by the mid-1920s",Paragraph
his pedagogical paradigm had become more technocentric. The two schools,Paragraph

"Werkbund’s attempt to bring art to bourgeois, commercial, and political",Paragraph

of the Jugendstil and of the Darmstadt Artists’ Colony (which continued to,Paragraph

"to the everyday object does not bring about an improvement in quality, he",Paragraph
"went on to argue, but turns it into kitsch. Somewhat perversely he stated",Paragraph
that he preferred kitsch to the imposition of “art” on ordinary objects. He,Paragraph
concluded (and here his argument is revealed as proto-Expressionist) that,Paragraph
art should always remain a separate enterprise.“ His belief suggested the,Paragraph
"bifurcation of art and the everyday, so common in Expressionism and",Paragraph
probably best known in Gropius's assertion that art cannot be taught.,Paragraph
in 1920 Behne criticized the Werkbund again in the pages of Sozialistische,Paragraph
Monatshefte. Once more he complained about its obsession with everything,Paragraph
"artistic, from “artistic norms” to “artistic advertisements.” He hoped that the",Paragraph
"new members on its executive committee (twenty altogether, including",Paragraph
"Gropius, Osthaus, Taut, Bernhard Pankok, César Klein, and Poelzig as direc-",Paragraph

28,Title
correct in rejecting Scheffler’s “Ein Arbeitsprogramm fir den Deutschen,Paragraph
"Werkbund” (A working program for the German Werkbund), which had",Paragraph
insisted on a boycott of all foreign products.%,Paragraph
After the war Behne became closely associated with the Arbeitsrat fiir,Paragraph
"Kunst, which was founded in 1918, initially under Taut’s leadership, and",Paragraph

Behne became the business manager of the Arbeitsrat in 1919 and wrote the,Paragraph
texts of several of its publications.** Although the Arbeitsrat maintained the,Paragraph
"Expressionist interest in mysticism, utopianism, and art as a transfiguring",Paragraph
"enterprise, it also became concerned with bringing art to a wider public by",Paragraph
sponsoring exhibitions in the taverns of Berlin's working quarters. In March,Paragraph
1919 the Arbeitsrat followed a suggestion made by Taut and Behne and,Paragraph
proposed a joint venture with the Werkbund to help with the reconstruction,Paragraph
of northern France.* This idea for helping war-torn France is a succinct,Paragraph
example of the groups’ activist pacifism and especially of Taut’s constructive,Paragraph
"utopianism. Behne, however, was not hopeful about the success of this",Paragraph
"effort. He was afraid that if German architects were sent to France, the",Paragraph
French might wrongly assume that the Germans believed that the French,Paragraph
"did not have qualified architects of their own. The Werkbund, in any case,",Paragraph
voted the project down.,Paragraph
By early 1921 when the artists of the Berlin Dada group had begun to,Paragraph
intensify their critique of Expressionism for its emphasis on individualism,Paragraph
"and for not producing art that appealed to the worker,** the Arbeitsrat had",Paragraph
already disbanded. As it became clear that the Arbeiisrat’s expectations for,Paragraph

Introduction,Title
"of all requirements of comfort, quiet, and clear design. There is no longer",Paragraph
"any trace of symmetry or an axis, simply walls succinctly marking and",Paragraph
accompanying the most comfortable traffic patterns for all the rooms. The,Paragraph
accommodation to living functions goes so far that each piece of furniture,Paragraph
"has its specific place in the floor plan.”® For Behne, Wright's plans “set",Paragraph
Space in motion as asymmetric as life itself.” The description of Wright's,Paragraph
interiors and furniture as accommodating living functions may have,Paragraph
"resulted from Behne’s personal sympathy with this arrangement, but it may",Paragraph
also have been based on his lack of direct experience with Wright's houses.,Paragraph
"Even though their plans are indeed fluid and asymmetrical, there is another",Paragraph
sort of stasis and control in assigning every piece of furniture and built-in,Paragraph
"elements a fixed place, and this makes Wright’s interiors actually quite",Paragraph
"inflexible. For Behne, as for Le Corbusier, the plan, rather than the eleva-",Paragraph
"tion, has the most important value for contemporary architecture (Hitch-",Paragraph
cock and Johnson also state that functionalism had its strongest influence,Paragraph
on the plan).,Paragraph
"Behne then moves on to a discussion of industrial buildings, which he,",Paragraph
"like other modernists, believes are the most impressive in the United States.",Paragraph
"He quotes extensively from Henry Ford’s Autobiography, which had just",Paragraph
appeared as a best-seller in a German translation in 1923. The popularity of,Paragraph
Ford’s book was but an indication of the cult of Amerikanismus that swept,Paragraph
Germany in the mid-i920s.* Ford’s description of factory buildings seemed,Paragraph
to combine the toughness of the demanding industrialist with Taylorism,Paragraph
and an almost surreal emphasis on the Protestant work ethic and clean-,Paragraph
"liness. It is, in fact, a succinct example of the devolution from the Protestant",Paragraph
work ethic to capitalism that Weber had described so convincingly in his,Paragraph
Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism of 1920. Behne quotes Ford thus:,Paragraph
"“Our machines... are scientifically arranged, not only in the sequence of",Paragraph
"operations, but so as to give every man and every machine every square",Paragraph
"inch that he requires and, if possible, not a square inch... more than he",Paragraph
requires.... The dark corners which invite expectoration are painted white.,Paragraph
One cannot have morale without cleanliness.”*! Behne also cited Ford’s opin-,Paragraph
ion on art: “We need artists who master industrial relationships. We need,Paragraph
"masters of industrial methods,” and “We will not put up elaborate buildings",Paragraph
as monuments to our success. The interest on the investrnent and the cost,Paragraph
of their upkeep would only serve to add uselessly to the cost of our products,Paragraph
—so these monuments of success are apt to end as tombs.” Although,Paragraph
"Behne may not have agreed with Ford in general, by using this (and the",Paragraph
41,Title
architecture of Behrens for the akc in particular) as his introduction to the,Paragraph
"design of German factories, he is able to highlight Behrens’s aesthetic inter-",Paragraph
"pretation of form, which Behne earlier had criticized as exhibiting too",Paragraph
much pathos.®? Henry Ford’s phrase “monuments of success are apt to end,Paragraph
as tombs” is thus left in place as a signpost to Behne’s interpretation of,Paragraph
Behrens’s turbine factory.,Paragraph
"Behrens, in Behne’s opinion, defines the machine as a pseudoaesthetic",Paragraph
"form. On the other hand, he regarded van de Velde as the first representa-",Paragraph
"tive of a romantic machine cult, in which function is expressed as “dra-",Paragraph
matic” form. Behne detects van de Velde’s continuing influence with younger,Paragraph
"architects, such as Mendelsohn. In Mendelsohn's work the decorative self-",Paragraph
satisfaction of Hermann Finsterlin’s organic projects is transformed into an,Paragraph
engineerlike tension and energy. The attenuated character of Mendelsohn’s,Paragraph
Einstein Tower borders on anthropomorphism and is “dramatic” in the,Paragraph
sense of van de Velde’s work. Behne agrees with the Dutch architect J. F.,Paragraph
"Staal that the tower is more memorial than workshop. However, he finds",Paragraph
Mendelsohn’s Luckenwalde Hat Factory more sachlich with a purposeful,Paragraph
organization of its production spaces.,Paragraph
"Behne then further defines his concept of the functional plan, which he",Paragraph
had touched upon in discussing the work of Wright. He describes orthogo-,Paragraph
nal space not as a functional form but as a mechanical one. Organic life is,Paragraph
not determined by the right angle. He gives as examples designs by Haring,Paragraph
"and Hans Scharoun, which on first sight are reminiscent of Finsterlin but",Paragraph
have none of that painter’s romantic willfulness. He also concedes that only,Paragraph
"an approximate, rather than absolute, adaptation to the natural fluidity of",Paragraph
movement is possible.,Paragraph
He makes his expanded notion of functionalism even clearer when he,Paragraph
"goes on to insist that although the functionalist can be extremely practical,",Paragraph
he is not to be confused with the utilitarian. Whereas the solutions of func-,Paragraph
"tionalists and utilitarians on some occasions may be related, their attitudes",Paragraph
toward the problem of function are quite different:,Paragraph
Functionalists are concerned with solving a problem of general significance to,Paragraph
our culture. The utilitarian only asks: “What is the most practical way for me to,Paragraph
act in this case?” But the functionalist asks: “How do I act most correctly in,Paragraph
principle?” Their attitude inclines toward philosophy and has a metaphysical,Paragraph
"basis.... There is no question but that the functionalists, even the most [sach-",Paragraph
"lich] ones, could more readily be classified as romantics than as rationalists.™",Paragraph
42,Title
Behne’s functionalism at its most extreme would turn the building into a,Paragraph
pure tool and negate form (play) entirely. Would such an ultimate function-,Paragraph
alism not lead to a dead end? He responds that the functionalist is right only,Paragraph
as long as he is concerned with the individual room. Invoking his earlier,Paragraph
"description of the organic functionalist plan, he writes that it is correct that",Paragraph
"orthogonal space is not economical, that the curve describes functional",Paragraph
space with greater precision. But when we group together several such,Paragraph
"“functional” rooms there is a loss of space because of poor tessellation,",Paragraph
Haring’s device of widening and narrowing corridors to accommodate the,Paragraph
"amount of traffic they bear, for instance, is based on the example of organic",Paragraph
"arteries. A building in this sense, however, is not analogous to a living",Paragraph
organism that always performs the same function. Haring’s undulating,Paragraph
corridors assume that they will always carry the same distribution of traffic,Paragraph
"over the life of a building. Behne argues that this type of organic solution,",Paragraph
which appears functional as a specific response at a certain moment in,Paragraph
"time, may also be too individualistic in a larger built context. Thus, from a",Paragraph
"social point of view, orthogonal space may in fact be more functional",Paragraph
because it is more neutral when we consider a series of rooms or a group of,Paragraph
buildings over time. He concludes that the deciding factor must be the gen-,Paragraph
eral attitude of society.,Paragraph
Behne’s argument for a neutral architecture in the public realm resem-,Paragraph
bles the ideas of Loos. Although Behne mentions Loos only in passing in his,Paragraph
"text, he does list several of his books and essays in a footnote and in his rec-",Paragraph
"ommended bibliography. But in an earlier article in Frihlicht of 1921-1922,",Paragraph
Behne had specifically pointed to Loos's centrality in the demands for a sach-,Paragraph
lich architecture.%,Paragraph
Behne is at the same time always insistent that Sachlichkeit and the ques-,Paragraph
tion of a functional architecture must be used to serve people. Staying close,Paragraph
"to postwar Expressionist beliefs, he therefore rejects outright technocentric",Paragraph
justifications or machine metaphors. He writes that Le Corbusier's concept,Paragraph
of a “machine for living” is acceptable if we view the machine as a prototype,Paragraph
for a full-fledged human achievernent. Le Corbusier’s phrase will be misun-,Paragraph
"derstood, according to Behne, if it is applied as a stylistic notion, that is, if it",Paragraph
is used in the name of a falsely understood Constructivism that assumes,Paragraph
"that buildings and furniture must look smooth, cold, and polished, like",Paragraph
"machines. If it is misconceived, we will only arrive at a new subcategory of",Paragraph
"the Jugendstil, that is, a new taste or a new fashion that is nothing but a new",Paragraph
pseudo-Constructivist machine formalism.,Paragraph
43,Title
"Behne further defines the differences between functionalism, rational-",Paragraph
"ism, and utilitarianism:",Paragraph
"When the functionalist refers to the machine, he sees it as the moving tool, the",Paragraph
perfect approximation to an organism.,Paragraph
"When the utilitarian refers to the machine, he sees it as an economic prin-",Paragraph
"ciple of saving work, power, and time.",Paragraph
"When the rationalist refers to the machine, he sees it as the representative",Paragraph
and patron of standardization and typification.**,Paragraph
His description of the functionalist as someone who interprets the machine,Paragraph
as an organic model is not much different from Greenough’s mid-nineteenth-,Paragraph
century functionalism. He does not suggest that functionalism is preferable,Paragraph
to rationalism but instead describes the pitfalls of both these positions: the,Paragraph
"rationalist, who is concerned first of all with general principles (he places Le",Paragraph
"Corbusier in this category}, must guard against becoming a rigid formalist.",Paragraph
"The functionalist, who is concerned with the specific principle, must be",Paragraph
careful not to fall into the trap of individually expressed functions.,Paragraph
In his summary of German architecture in the context of European,Paragraph
"developments, Behne writes that Germany “is somewhat inclined to devote",Paragraph
itself to an extreme that changes fairly frequently and then gives way to the,Paragraph
"opposite extreme — the consequence of an inner uncertainty.""°” He sees Rus-",Paragraph
sia (the East) and France (the West) as countervailing forces to Germany's,Paragraph
persistent individualism: “It is a feature common to the East and West that,Paragraph
...they proceed from the collective. But the collective is fundamentally dif-,Paragraph
"ferent here and there: France has a structurally articulated society, Russia is",Paragraph
"dominated by the masses.” Behne, using a social interpretation of interna-",Paragraph
"tionalism, calls for a fusion of these tendencies. He quotes from Heinrich",Paragraph
Mann to support such a linkage: “We are in the middle and it is our task,Paragraph
to link East and West; one does not shut off nature. In the future we will be,Paragraph
the republic in which representation of class and parliamentarianism are,Paragraph
interlinked.”98,Paragraph
Behne finds that recent Dutch architecture is also a good model: it exhibits,Paragraph
a political realism and confidence that save it from the extremes of German,Paragraph
architecture. He concludes the book with quotations from van Doesburg,Paragraph
and Oud and an illustration of Vladimir Tatlin’s Monwment to the Third Inter-,Paragraph
national. In Der moderne Zweckbau Behne does not allude to the conflict in,Paragraph
"Dutch architecture between the Amsterdam School and De Stijl, although",Paragraph
44,Title
"he had mentioned it in his book Hollandische Baukunst in der Gegenwart, 1922.",Paragraph
"This may have been due to his acquaintance with van Doesburg and Oud, or",Paragraph
more likely to the fact that by 1923 the Expressionist Amsterdam School had,Paragraph
waned in importance in the face of van Doesburg’s concerted efforts to prose-,Paragraph
lytize De Stijl. Behne’s change in emphasis also reflects the shift in Ger-,Paragraph
many from Expressionism to the Neue Sachlichkeit between 1920 and 1923.,Paragraph
"In general, however, his definition of architectural problems as moving",Paragraph
"between form and function, and between East and West in the cultural",Paragraph
"realm, resorts to a dualistic conception. In fact, he recommends a book by",Paragraph
"the German sociologist Alfred Vierkandt, Dualismus im modernen Weltbild",Paragraph
"(Dualism in the modern world picture}, published in 1923. Vierkandt’s",Paragraph
"methodology was phenomenological, not inductive. In this, he followed",Paragraph
Simmel’s sociology of human interaction. Vierkandt also invoked the treat-,Paragraph
ment of community and society as irreducible phenomena in the sense of,Paragraph
Ferdinand Toennies’s Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft (Community and soci-,Paragraph
"ety), 1887.°° In Behne’s use of this dualism one is also reminded of Wolfflin’s",Paragraph
"reliance on a more formalist dualistic model in his first book, Renaissance",Paragraph
"und Barock, 1888. In Der moderne Zweckbau the dualistic paradigm is never",Paragraph
"reduced to a set of rules, however, since Behne investigates the differences",Paragraph
between form and function only in order to draw them together without,Paragraph
ever assuming the possiblity of a complete balance.,Paragraph
Within Behne’s own writings this book was prefigured in his short essay,Paragraph
"“Architekten,” which appeared in Friihlicht, a periodical edited by Taut from",Paragraph
1920 to 1922.' Friihlicht was initially an extension of and a voice for the,Paragraph
Expressionist Glaserne Kette (Glass chain) group and was first published as,Paragraph
an appendix to the periodical Stadtbaukunst alter und neuer Zeit (Art of city,Caption
planning of past and new times). From the fall of 1921 until the summer of,Paragraph
"1922, it was published as an independent journal in Magdeburg, where Taut",Paragraph
"had been appointed that city’s chief planner. During its Magdeburg phase,",Paragraph
"when Behne’s essay was published, the magazine had shifted away from the",Paragraph
utopian Expressionism of the postwar years and increasingly covered issues,Paragraph
of architecture and city planning. The period between 1920 and the stabi-,Paragraph
lization of the runaway inflation at the end of 1923 (after which architectural,Paragraph
"construction resumed a normal level} is, therefore, a transitional period",Paragraph
between Expressionism and what is commonly called the Neue Sachlich-,Paragraph
keit.!°! Friihlicht’s articles during 1922 dealt primarily with urban issues but,Paragraph
also included an essay by Kurt Schwitters and articles about Russian archi-,Paragraph
"tecture, among them one on Tatlin’s Monument to the Third International.",Paragraph
45,Title
Behne's “Architekten” rejects what he calls Expressionism’s “understand-,Paragraph
able utopianism” and is directed instead toward an internationalism that,Paragraph
"became important after 1919, possibly under the influence of the Third",Paragraph
(Communist) International or the revival of the Second International by,Paragraph
more moderate Socialists also in 1919. In this essay he also mentions the,Paragraph
publication of Mendelsohn’s work in Wendingen and a lecture he gave in,Paragraph
"Holland. Loos, Oud, and Le Corbusier are all cited in terms of their demands",Paragraph
for a sachlich architecture. He quotes from Le Corbusier in L’esprit nouveau —,Paragraph
as he was later to do in Der moderne Zweckbau—on the primacy of the plan,Paragraph
"in modern architecture, the banishment of all decoration, as well as the",Paragraph
idiosyncratic.,Paragraph
He believes that the new architecture is collective and supraindividual.,Paragraph
Behne’s anti-individualism also clearly sets this essay apart from his own,Paragraph
earlier Expressionism. The idea of the “supraindividual” seems to be indebted,Paragraph
to van Doesburg’s critique of Expressionism and his stress on apparently,Paragraph
rational forms. What Behne does not address — whereas he exposes many,Paragraph
forms of pseudofunctionalism and pseudorationalism —is De Stijl’s own,Paragraph
"mystical, Platonic component.'” De Stijl represents an ideology of the objec-",Paragraph
tive that effectively disguises its spiritual and transcendent beliefs.,Paragraph
Behne ends his essay by pointing to the transition from belief to action.,Paragraph
He singles out in particular the work of the German cooperative housing,Paragraph
associations that are helping to introduce rationalization and social concerns,Paragraph
"to the building industry. Quoting Martin Wagner, who headed one of these",Paragraph
"cooperative societies, he details the resistance of the larger building industry",Paragraph
to change in conventional building methods.’ He asserts that those forms,Paragraph
belonging to the tradition of handicrafts will change in any case (and here he,Paragraph
uses an economic argument that had been employed by Loos earlier} because,Paragraph
"they are becoming a luxury. Oud, who had distanced himself from De Stijl",Paragraph
"in 1922, became an important architect of social housing in Holland, which",Paragraph
in turn provided a model for German housing. The cooperative building,Paragraph
"societies in Germany, which were generally set up by unions, benefited in",Paragraph
the 1920s from funds that were collected as taxes on speculative building.,Paragraph
"As already noted, in Holldndische Baukunst in der Gegenwart, 1922, Bene",Paragraph
mentions the tension between the Amsterdam School and De Stij] but writes,Paragraph
that he prefers the impersonal and sachlich architecture of Rotterdam.'© In,Paragraph

"As in his Expressionist writings, Behne is openly polemical, but now he",Paragraph
has become an advocate for De Stijl. In his critique of the Werkbund in 1917,Paragraph
he had still argued that the aesthetic aura of art kept it from being applied,Paragraph
"meaningfully to the common, everyday object, and in his Expressionist Die",Paragraph
"Wiederkehr der Kunst (The return of art), 1919, he had proclaimed art as",Paragraph

The Terms of the Debate,Title
Behne's frequent use of Sachlichkeit and Zweck in his book raises questions,Paragraph
concerning the meaning these terms had for him and whether his usage,Paragraph
remained the same in the 1920s. Also of interest is the relationship between,Paragraph
his understanding of these words and that of earlier and later writers. Zweck,Paragraph
"means purpose or function, while Sachlichkeit, although sometimes trans-",Paragraph
47,Title
Brerrer,Title
"lated as function, literally means “thingness.” Sachlichkeit is more properly",Paragraph
"translated as “the simple, practical, straightforward solution to a problem,”",Paragraph
as “matter-of-facmess” and occasionally as “objectivity.” Sachlichkeit simul-,Paragraph
taneously suggests the world of real objects and that of a conceptual ratio-,Paragraph
nalism. The philosophical allusions of Sachlichkeit in fact become more,Paragraph
prevalent in the avant-garde books of the later 19208 and displace to some,Paragraph
"degree the term’s “simple, practical” overtones. Because of its complexity",Paragraph
"and also because of its very particular associations with German culture, we",Paragraph
have retained the German in this text and the translation. Sometimes Behne,Paragraph
also uses the terms Funktion and funktionell. On many occasions he uses,Paragraph
"Zweck, Sachlichkeit, and Funktion interchangeably or as a series. But in his",Paragraph
"larger argument, as explained earlier, he draws a clear distinction between",Paragraph
"functionalism, rationalism, and utilitarianism.",Paragraph
As Harry Mallgrave has shown in his introduction to Otto Wagner’s Mod-,Paragraph
"em Architecture and elsewhere, the architect Richard Streiter used the term",Paragraph
Sachlichkeit as early as 1896 to define realist tendencies that had been a part,Paragraph
of the German debate for nearly a decade.’ Streiter raised the term in con-,Paragraph
"junction with Zweckméafigkeit and Funktion, establishing a linked meaning",Paragraph
"of these concepts from the beginning. Yet, the precise meaning of Sach-",Paragraph
"lichkeit was not altogether clearly defined. Streiter, for instance, used the",Paragraph

"Realismus is made fully transparent in 1899 when Lichtwark, in the course",Paragraph
"of republishing an essay of 1897, changed its title from “Realistische Archi-",Paragraph
tektur” to “Sachliche Baukunst.”!,Paragraph
Stanford Anderson has examined the use of such concepts in the early,Paragraph
twentieth century. He writes that Muthesius did not advocate the pure,Paragraph
"Sachlichkeit of machines but rather a sachliche Kunst, an approach in which",Paragraph
aesthetics seems to be paramount. Anderson has summed up a turn-of-the-,Paragraph

Behne and the Neue Sachlichkeit,Title
Since there was already a degree of variation in the way Sachlichkeit was,Paragraph
"used at the turn of the century, we should not expect that the term ever",Paragraph
assumed a completely uniform connotation. The Neues Bauen in general,Paragraph
and the references in architectural texts to Sachlichkeit have understandably,Paragraph

in his writings in the course of the 19208.,Paragraph
"In Die Wiederkehr der Kunst, 1919, Behne had elevated the study of folk",Paragraph
art even above the study of Albrecht Diirer or any high art. He wrote in char-,Paragraph
acteristic Expressionist fashion that “we must rid ourselves of the rule of,Paragraph
technology. Folk art dies where technique appears.”'4 He also complained,Paragraph
about Behrens’s use of Sachlichkeit as if it could be employed as a template.,Paragraph
"In Behne’s essay “Architekten,” 1921-1922, where he frequently refers to",Paragraph
"Sachlichkeit, his outright rejection of naturalism still has much in common",Paragraph
"with the Expressionists’ opposition to it, rather than with a resurgent real-",Paragraph
ism of the Neue Sachlichkeit. He writes that art is a complete product of the,Paragraph

"tension between the natural and artistic, and he recommends replacing",Paragraph
naturalism with Oud’s belief in man’s spiritual equality with nature. And,Paragraph

In 1927 Behne expanded his definition of Sachlichkeit in Neues Wohnen —,Paragraph
"Neues Bauen, and Zweck no longer appears as often as it had in 1923. He",Paragraph
"writes that Sachlichkeit does not imply, as most assume, dryness, sobriety, or",Paragraph
a solution from a purely mathematical point of view. Sachlichkeit simply,Paragraph
means that the solution is adjusted to the Sache. He then goes on to explain,Paragraph
"what a Sache is: “Each Sache is a nodal point, a crossing point of relations",Paragraph

In a chapter called “Diktatur oder Sachlichkeit” (Dictatorship or Sach-,Paragraph

"points out that while some housing may took welcoming when new, it will",Paragraph
look cramped once occupied because the tenants cannot afford new furni-,Paragraph
ture. Often tenants themselves will add a petit bourgeois feeling to the,Paragraph
interior by adding valances or antimacassars. But he also sees a tendency in,Paragraph
modern architecture toward dictatorship if the building looks too much like,Paragraph

"Behne maintains that if ornament is absent, the tenant feels his habitation",Paragraph
looks like a penal institution and may automatically feel debased to the level,Paragraph
of the proletariat because ornament is associated with the houses of the rich.,Paragraph
He concludes that the architect has a tendency toward dictatorship in his,Paragraph
attitude toward tenants and that tenants are partly right if they expect that,Paragraph
architects are to serve them. At the same time he suggests that the tenant,Paragraph
must be educated to become a “ruling type” just like the architect. His call for,Paragraph
"mutual education is rather characteristic of his trust in public education.""",Paragraph
"In place of the Gothic cathedral of his Expressionist writings, Behne now",Paragraph
turns to the image of a medieval knight encased in cumbersome armor as a,Paragraph
metaphor for the general resistance to the concept of a social Sachlichkeit. In,Paragraph
"addition, he uses the walled city and its moat as an analogy for excluding",Paragraph
"Sachlichkeit in urban issues. He describes the Mietskaserne (literally, rental",Paragraph
"barracks) as the last castle, an example of an isolated, defensive space.132",Paragraph
Though the normal five-story apartment block with forty to sixty families is,Paragraph

"a proper planning unit, it is in his opinion not an economic unit because",Paragraph
ownership may change every twenty meters. There may also be a rigorous,Paragraph

"high capitalism (figs. 10, 11).133",Paragraph
"In his “Von der Sachlichkeit,” 1927, an introduction to a book on the",Paragraph
"work of Max Taut, Behne writes that a building can have many functiona",Paragraph
requirements and that Sachlichkeit is really the disciplined thought required,Paragraph
to weigh them against each other. Here he also launches a very early critique,Paragraph
"of the Zeilenbau, the placement of parallel rows of buildings running north",Paragraph
and south without regard to the site or street configuration. Behne regards,Paragraph
the Zeilenbau method as too dogmatic because hygiene has been allowed,Paragraph
"to become the sole determining factor of architecture. This solution, he",Paragraph
"believes, is completely unsachlich and, in the end, formalistic. Behne and",Paragraph
"Bruno Taut among the modernists (fig. 12) —in contrast to Gropius, May,",Paragraph
"and Hannes Meyer—criticized the Zeilenbau, which was used as a plan-",Paragraph

of 1930 would find fault with Gropius’s Dammerstock Siedlung for this,Paragraph

the statement that the greatest work of art results from the creation of a,Paragraph

"In a competition design of 1910 for an extension to Messel’s building,",Paragraph
Bruno Taut underlined Messel’s principle with greater purity: his smooth,Paragraph
piers are arched above to form the wall supporting the roof.!” In his design,Paragraph
"for a Mittag department store in Magdeburg (1913), the same architect",Paragraph
carried Messel’s idea of verticality to its logical constructional solution by,Paragraph
supporting the roof from above with concrete piers using a system of arches.,Paragraph
Messel’s piers were not really the strong element that they first,Paragraph
appeared but rather the weak element of his building. They were a conse-,Paragraph
quence of the unclear thinking that led Messel to stack five ground floors on,Paragraph
top of one another. The idea of increasing display space fivefold is—looking,Paragraph
"at the matter rationally—a mistake, as only the ground-floor windows are",Paragraph
actually display windows. The upper rows of windows have little or no signifi-,Paragraph
"cance for advertising purposes; in fact, displays were very quickly removed",Paragraph
from them and replaced with screenlike stands. Thus one did not even,Paragraph
take full advantage of an additional light source. This is why we said that,Paragraph
"Messel’s idea, directed solely at light and display space, was not entirely",Paragraph
"sachlich. It led him to stack five floors of display windows atop one another,",Paragraph
and this in turn led to a verticality that brought piers into being as a stop-,Paragraph
gap measure; basically the piers are nothing more than the additive lifting,Paragraph
"above the street level, a fivefold raising of the street elevation — making",Paragraph
Le Corbusier’s remark that modern German architecture is frequently an,Paragraph

became a conscious game with Gothicizing style elements.,Paragraph

ture of the Louvre Department Store in Paris.,Caption
"It cannot be said, however, that this establishes a new type —if there",Paragraph
really is such a thing! The fact that a department store has become much,Paragraph
larger has not changed the basis for the French architect. He thinks per-,Paragraph
haps more conservatively but also genuinely more sachlich. He places large,Paragraph
display windows where they are appropriate and have a purpose: on the,Paragraph
ground floor. On the upper stories there are many windows arranged in,Paragraph
regularly ordered rows. One story is placed above another: not as a repeated,Paragraph
"ground floor but as second, third, fourth, and fifth floor, i.e., with conscious",Paragraph
"emphasis on the horizontal, corresponding to reality. Finally the vaulted roof",Paragraph
with its many skylights and chimneys makes the whole thing look like a,Paragraph
"warehouse, a gigantic storehouse accommodating a large number of things",Paragraph
"at the same time. in brief, the modern department store ultimately finds a",Paragraph
"mode of expression here where it was not being sought, an expression more",Paragraph
genuine and purer than in Messel’s work —simply because the tendency to,Paragraph
"grandiose stylization is absent, a tendency that inclined excessively toward",Paragraph
"art and thus led to a falsely ecclesiastical character, isolating the building",Paragraph
"fram its neighbors, although its purpose is not particularly different from",Paragraph
"theirs. The Louvre Department Store remains entirely a part of the street,",Paragraph
and precisely this is part of its truth. As the department store was built quite,Paragraph
"specifically in, on, and for the street, it is not allowed to be the most alien,",Paragraph
"conspicuous, and isolated building along the entire street, which was the",Paragraph
case with Messel’s store along LeipzigerstraBe.,Paragraph
"Messel’s pointed, one-sided emphasis on a single function —display—",Paragraph
made him untrue to the whole; the building lacked integration.,Paragraph
"If we nevertheless assign Messel’s building such an important place, it is",Paragraph
because it had enormous psychological impact. He gave others the courage,Paragraph
"to break away from conventional schemes, to dare to create new types—",Paragraph
even though his own attempt was far less happy and far less sachlich than it,Paragraph
first appeared.,Paragraph
The modern country-house plan was also developed in the mid-1890s by the,Paragraph

begins somewhere between the plans for the Winslow House in River Forest,Caption

"symmetry or axis, simply walls succinctly marking and accompanying the",Paragraph
most comfortable traffic patterns for all the rooms. The accommodation to,Paragraph
living functions goes so far that each piece of furniture has its specific place,Paragraph
in the floor plan. This plan “unfolds.” The house is not complicated by stairs,Paragraph
ascending to the upstairs —a rudiment of medieval castle and masonry wall,Caption
architecture. The plot of land has space enough to allow the building and,Paragraph
almost all its rooms to develop directly at ground level.,Paragraph
In Wright’s plans the rooms are not inserted next to one another but set,Paragraph
"in motion —as asymmetrically as life itself, strangely enough. Influenced by",Paragraph
"the Japanese, Wright already started building unusually flat roofs, mostly",Paragraph
with wide overhangs. This means suppressing the picturesque and stressing,Paragraph
constructional and cubic elements. It is logical that a house organized as,Paragraph
reely balanced spaces should reject the roof as a hat that unites every-,Paragraph
thing. Even the roof changes from a “motif” into a “function.”,Paragraph

model for all this.,Paragraph
Here are some striking passages from an essay by Peter Behrens for the,Paragraph
"AEG (Plakat, June 1920):",Paragraph
In questions of form for all industrial plants it is always a matter of creating char-,Paragraph
"acter from the very nature of the things to be designed, to discover the type, just",Paragraph
as all past art is seen today to reveal sublime greatness by being typical of the,Paragraph
respective condition of the times. This means no less than that one must address,Paragraph
"all the artistic and technical conditions that a plant imposes, support them,",Paragraph
indeed elevate them to a fundamental principle and let this principle become a,Paragraph
visible expression.,Paragraph
This applies first to the placement of the building. It has to follow the scale of,Paragraph
the production process. The location of railroad tracks is crucial to the siting of,Paragraph
the building. Staggering the buildings allows for the proper entry of rail tracks,Paragraph
through the gates of the factory buildings. At the same time spacious storage,Paragraph
"yards should be provided, and this touches upon a city planning principle of great",Paragraph
"aesthetic significance. It is precisely this staggering of buildings, necessary in",Paragraph
"Practical terms, that will give the plant an effective silhouette; and the necessary",Paragraph
"layout of the yards fulfills a demand by a past master of city planning, Camillo",Paragraph
"Sitte, who described a square enclosed by buildings as one of the most necessary",Paragraph
aspects of architectural effects.,Paragraph
Whenever the opportunity arises to compare plants designed from such a,Paragraph
purely practical point of view with others based on random factors or built in,Paragraph
"stages, one is astonished to see how such different impressions can be created",Paragraph
with the same expenditure of construction and materials.,Paragraph
But the same is also true of a factory’s interior layout. The spatial arrangement,Paragraph
"grows out of the organization of the production process. Clear layout, ease of",Paragraph
"interchange and forward movement of products, and unhampered mobility of tools,",Paragraph
"machines, or trucks require open, uncluttered, well-lit halls. Workplaces should be",Paragraph
as well lit and spacious as possible. It is therefore recommended that staircases,Paragraph
and elevators be moved to the exterior; this will at the same time make the archi-,Paragraph
"tectural effect more impressive, producing a long sequence of work spaces inside",Paragraph
and on the outside rows of windows picturesquely enlivened by protruding stair-,Paragraph
wells and elevator shafts towering above the roof. Since light is a prerequisite for,Paragraph
"good work, factory buildings should have large window openings; they should",Paragraph
"dominate, control the surface of the building, and lend support in their effect as",Paragraph
windows. For this reason they should not seem like large holes in the wall but,Paragraph
"appear flush with the outer wall, giving the exterior a friendly appearance .3¢",Caption

There is no question that only the straight line and right angle can be,Paragraph
