Introduction,Title
"uke THE Inst VOlume of Makers of Modern Architecture (2007), this",Paragraph
sequel is not intended to be a thoroughgoing history of the building,Paragraph
"art since the beginnings of the Modern Movement, but rather a",Paragraph
series of interpretive studies of some leading architectural,Title
personalities from around the turn of the last century to the present,Title
day. Three figures addressed in the first volume are revisited in,Paragraph
"these pages: Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier, whose personal",Paragraph
"histories I here discuss in greater detail than in my earlier, more",Paragraph
general overviews. Those two masters share an unchallenged,Paragraph
"position atop the critical hierarchy, and their status seems even",Paragraph
more justified with the passage of time and the support of seemingly,Paragraph
"inexhaustible new scholarship. Conversely, among present-day",Paragraph
architects Renzo Piano continues to be a prolific yet puzzling,Paragraph
designer whose uneven but sporadically superlative output,Paragraph
illuminates the crucial role that sympathetic patronage plays in the,Paragraph
"outcome of a commission, a factor that affects all architects though",Paragraph
seldom as clearly as in his case.,Paragraph
The pieces on which the following chapters are based were all,Paragraph
"initially suggested by some _ topical occasion, including",Paragraph
"anniversaries, awards, newly completed buildings, exhibitions,",Caption
"publications, deaths, or some combination thereof. These events in",Paragraph
turn prompted a variety of responses from me: reconsideration of,Paragraph
widely renowned architects whom I thought merited more accurate,Paragraph
"historical judgment (Stanford White, the Bauhaus group),",Paragraph
reassessment of once-celebrated figures subsequently much less well,Paragraph
"regarded (Edward Durell Stone, James Stirling), reestimation of",Paragraph
canonical reputations rarely called into question (R. Buckminster,Paragraph
"Fuller, Eero Saarinen), recognition of unjustly neglected masters",Paragraph
"(Margarete Schiitte-Lihotzky, Carlo Scarpa), and evaluation of",Paragraph
present-day practitioners with enough completed work to establish,Paragraph
"their relative standing (Rem Koolhaas, Bernard Tschumi).",Paragraph
If there is one recurrent theme that unites all these essays it is the,Paragraph
central role that character and personality play in the creation of,Paragraph
"architecture, not altogether surprising given that this is the most",Paragraph
public of art forms and thus inevitably indicative of the social values,Paragraph
"of its sponsors. The ways in which designers conceive, rationalize,",Paragraph
"develop, explain, execute, and promote their works are as varied as",Paragraph
"the commissions they receive, but their goal is always the same: to",Paragraph
persuade others to have faith in their sometimes improbable visions,Paragraph
and their ability to bring them to fruition. Even for the greatest,Paragraph
"master builders, the pursuit of their art is a never-ending series of",Paragraph
"confrontations and challenges, accommodations and compromises,",Paragraph
"imposed by the needs (or desires) of clients, financial limitations,",Paragraph
"legal requirements, and countless other factors that constrain",Paragraph
architects to a greater extent than their counterparts in other artistic,Paragraph
"mediums. Added to those impediments, the larger, inexorable forces",Paragraph
of politics and economics always have an enormous effect on the,Paragraph
"profession, whether or not its exponents are politically engaged",Paragraph
(although designers who work in the public sphere should always,Paragraph
"expect that their efforts will have direct social implications and, on",Paragraph
"occasion, unpleasant repercussions).",Paragraph
The greatest architectural disjunction of the twentieth century,Paragraph
"was caused by the rise of Hitler, a failed painter and architectural",Paragraph
aspirant whose hatred of Modernism in all mediums brought an,Paragraph
abrupt end to Germany’s primacy as an incubator for artistic,Paragraph
innovation. Hitler’s maniacal anti-Semitism of course most,Paragraph
immediately affected the numerous Jewish designers and clients,Paragraph
who were in the forefront of the new architecture. But the,Paragraph
repressive culture of Nazism affected non-Jews as well. Among the,Paragraph
foremost exponents of the new architecture and urbanism whose,Paragraph
"careers were destroyed, derailed, displaced, or at the very least long",Paragraph
"delayed by the Dozen-Year Reich were two gentiles: Ernst May,",Paragraph
impresario of Frankfurt’s phenomenal social-housing campaign of,Paragraph
"the 1920s and early 1930s, and one of his chief collaborators, the",Paragraph
Viennese architect Margarete Schiitte-Lihotzky.,Caption
"Even before Hitler took power, the global economic depression",Paragraph
"prompted May, Schiitte-Lihotzky, and many other Modernists to",Paragraph
"work for the Soviet government, one of the world’s few large-scale",Paragraph
architecture patrons during Stalin’s initial Five-Year Plan of 1928-,Paragraph
1932. This association alone disqualified the leftist May and the,Paragraph
"Communist Schtitte-Lihotzky from work under the Nazis, yet they",Paragraph
fared little better with the Soviets. Members of the “May Brigade”,Paragraph
who stayed on in the USSR after their boss left in 1933 in some,Paragraph
"cases faced imprisonment, and their Russian colleagues were",Paragraph
"executed. May, who was publicly denounced by the Nazi",Paragraph
"propaganda minister, first found refuge in British-controlled Kenya,",Paragraph
but during the Mau Mau uprising of the early 1950s returned to,Paragraph
Germany where he finally resumed his role as a city planner during,Paragraph
"his homeland’s massive postwar reconstruction. On the other hand,",Paragraph
"Schiitte-Lihotzky, who joined the anti-Nazi resistance following the",Paragraph
"Anschluss, found it difficult to find work in Austria after the war",Paragraph
because of her continued allegiance to communism in nominally,Paragraph
neutral Austria.,Paragraph
Recent research has also shed a harsher light on the attitudes and,Paragraph
activities during World War II of the Swiss-French architect Le,Paragraph
"Corbusier, who turns out to have been more avid and successful in",Paragraph
trying to gain work from France’s Nazi-puppet Vichy government,Paragraph
"than had been previously known. On the other hand, Le Corbusier’s",Paragraph
younger Brazilian contemporary and admirer Oscar Niemeyer saw,Paragraph
his professional prospects in the United States effectively wrecked,Paragraph
"by his membership in the Communist Party, which he joined in",Paragraph
"1945, just in time for the advent of McCarthyism and the denial of",Paragraph
American entry visas to artists with leftist affiliations or even,Paragraph
sympathies.,Paragraph
Economic shifts and downturns can displace architects just as,Paragraph
"surely as putsches, coups, revolutions, and rebellions. In fulfillment",Paragraph
"of Daniel Burnham’s irrefutable exhortation “first, get the job”—1ule",Paragraph
number one in an artistic medium that demands a patron before the,Paragraph
creative act can begin in earnest—architects have always had to go,Paragraph
where the work is. Gian Lorenzo Bernini’s arduous 1665 transalpine,Caption
carriage journey from Rome to Paris was prompted by the prospect,Paragraph
"of expanding the Palais du Louvre for Louis XIV, which, despite the",Paragraph
"ample papal patronage this artistic polymath enjoyed back home,",Paragraph
seemed to be an offer he could not refuse. Arguably the first,Paragraph
"international architectural celebrity, Bernini was greeted along the",Paragraph
way by crowds that sporadically lined his route. But his,Paragraph
flamboyantly Baroque project was ultimately rejected—Claude,Paragraph
Perrault’s more reserved Classical design would be executed instead,Paragraph
—and this futile experience proved that even the greatest architects,Paragraph
are not immune from the humiliations of the supplicant artist.,Paragraph
"Closer to our own time, during the recession and “stagflation” of",Paragraph
"the early 1970s, out-of-work American architects flocked to Iran,",Paragraph
where the shah sponsored vast public works schemes that came to,Paragraph
an abrupt halt with his overthrow at the end of that decade.,Paragraph
"Similarly, the global economic meltdown of 2008, which initially",Paragraph
"left China relatively unscathed, sent countless American architects",Paragraph
in search of the lucrative commissions that have abounded in,Paragraph
Beijing and the ninety other Chinese cities (many of them whose,Paragraph
names are unknown to foreigners) with populations over a million.,Paragraph
The first volume of Makers of Modern Architecture was faulted by,Paragraph
some commentators for the relatively few women it contains—Ray,Paragraph
Eames and Denise Scott Brown are the only female subjects among,Paragraph
the book’s seventeen chapters. This second selection will likely elicit,Paragraph
"a similar response, there being but four women discussed here in",Paragraph
"detail: Schiitte-Lihotzky, Billie Tsien, Kazuyo Sejima, and Elizabeth",Title
Diller.,Paragraph
The only possible justification for this imbalance is that in any,Paragraph
"general study of the building art, women are still bound to be in a",Paragraph
"minority, given that female enrollment in architecture schools did",Paragraph
"not begin to approach parity with men until at least the 1970s, and",Paragraph
only now are women practitioners receiving major commissions in,Paragraph
any significant numbers. One review of the Spanish-language,Paragraph
edition of Makers of Modern Architecture was titled “Los machos alfa,Paragraph
de la arquitectura del siglo XX” (The Alpha Machos of Twentieth-,Paragraph
"Century Architecture), a fairly accurate characterization of the male-",Paragraph
dominated profession in that period.,Paragraph
"The marginalized role of women even at the Bauhaus, which was",Paragraph
"otherwise among the most forward-thinking, not to say radical, of",Paragraph
"twentieth-century educational institutions, gives some indication of",Paragraph
"the ingrained prejudices that had to be overcome, and still do. The",Paragraph
three aforementioned female architects currently at work all have a,Paragraph
"male partner or partners (in two instances their husbands), a pattern",Paragraph
"established in earlier generations by Charles and Ray Eames, Alison",Paragraph
"and Peter Smithson, and Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi.",Paragraph
That tendency has been continued more recently by such,Paragraph
distinguished American spousal teams as Craig Hodgetts and Hsin,Paragraph
"Ming Fung, Diana Agrest and Mario Gandelsonas, Laurie Hawkinson",Caption
"and Henry Smith-Miller, and Marion Weiss and Michael Manfredi.",Paragraph
"In other pairings, Richard Fernau and Laura Hartman, professional",Paragraph
"partners since 1980, were once romantically involved but have long",Paragraph
"been married to others, whereas Thomas Hanrahan and Victoria",Paragraph
Myers continue to practice together after their divorce. Deborah,Paragraph
"Berke, Winka Dubbeldam, Jeanne Gang, Zaha Hadid, Maya Lin, and",Paragraph
Toshiko Mori are among the most notable high-style practitioners,Paragraph
who head offices without a principal male partner.,Paragraph
The burgeoning presence of women in the highest echelons of,Paragraph
architecture has hardly been the biggest change in the profession in,Paragraph
"recent decades, however. Certainly computer technology has had",Paragraph
"the greatest impact on the conception, planning, and execution of",Paragraph
buildings since the adaptation of new industrial methods of,Paragraph
construction during the first half of the nineteenth century. Digital,Caption
techniques for drafting and rendering designs now allow for,Paragraph
prospective depictions of projects as lifelike as photographs of,Paragraph
completed buildings. Yet this seems a mere sleight of hand,Paragraph
compared to the astounding new engineering and fabrication,Paragraph
capabilities opened by unprecedented advances in architecturally,Paragraph
applicable software. As had often occurred during earlier periods of,Paragraph
"technological breakthrough, there were fears that computers would",Paragraph
"somehow fundamentally alter, not to say pervert, the very nature of",Paragraph
"the creative act, rather than becoming just another tool in the",Paragraph
"arsenal of human artistry. Without question, the new architectural",Paragraph
possibilities enabled by computerization have had an immense,Paragraph
"effect on the look of contemporary design, but as with all",Paragraph
"comparably epochal advances before it—printing, photography, and",Paragraph
"telecommunications, to name but a few—what emerges is only",Paragraph
equal to the intelligence and imagination of those whose master,Paragraph
them.,Paragraph
Another signal phenomenon of our times has been the cult of the,Paragraph
"celebrity architect. To be sure, more than a century ago the",Paragraph
scandalous private lives of Stanford White and Frank Lloyd Wright,Title
—two showboating public personages who thrived on popular,Paragraph
attention—provided ample fodder for the sensationalist press. For,Paragraph
his sins White was gunned down at the age of fifty-two; Wright died,Paragraph
"(of natural causes) a few months shy of ninety-two, and used those",Paragraph
four extra decades of life to transform his image from that of,Paragraph
"cheating husband, deadbeat dad, and outspoken advocate of free",Paragraph
love by morphing into a benign dispenser of heartland American,Paragraph
"verities, a veritable Carl Sandburg of architecture. Wright’s",Paragraph
instinctive mastery of new forms of mass publicity—from newspaper,Paragraph
"interviews in the 1910s, to newsreel bits in the 1930s, to television",Paragraph
talk- and game-show appearances in the 1950s—obliterated popular,Paragraph
recall of his lurid past and helped burnish his image as a beloved,Paragraph
national cultural treasure quite apart from his stupendous body of,Paragraph
work.,Paragraph
There is no question that public recognition has always helped,Paragraph
"architects to win further clients, and increasingly so since the",Paragraph
celebrity industry has metastasized in its variety and reach.,Paragraph
"However, not until the 1980s did the international celebrity",Paragraph
architect fully emerge. This phenomenon paralleled the,Paragraph
"contemporaneous rise of the “name” fashion designer, promoted by",Paragraph
"luxury-goods conglomerates to spur sales of scent, accessories, and",Paragraph
other ancillary items bearing the names of couturiers whose bespoke,Paragraph
garments were far beyond the means of average people. Even,Paragraph
"though Wright, with his budget-priced Usonian houses of 1936",Paragraph
"onward (and his earlier, wholly umsuccessful attempts at",Paragraph
"prefabrication), tried to bring his revolutionary concepts to a wider",Paragraph
"public than his costly one-off commissions, by the late twentieth",Paragraph
century an architect-built house could be afforded by only a small,Paragraph
economic elite. Thus the retailing of all sorts of architect-designed,Paragraph
household goods allowed those priced out of the custom residential,Paragraph
market to participate in the aura of high-style architecture with an,Paragraph
Alessi teakettle by Michael Graves or a Swid Powell coffee mug by,Caption
Robert Venturi.,Paragraph
Architect-endorsed “branding” soon extended from useful or,Paragraph
"decorative objects to buildings themselves, especially luxury",Paragraph
"developments in large urban centers where apartment buildings,",Paragraph
"hotels, and boutiques have lately been marketed as much for the",Paragraph
designer’s imprimatur as for any intrinsic aesthetic quality. Yet very,Paragraph
few of the many high-style architects who built condominiums in,Paragraph
New York City before the global market crash in 2008 rethought the,Paragraph
"basics of the high-density multiunit dwelling. Instead, they",Paragraph
concentrated on clever surface effects that would set their efforts,Paragraph
apart from the competition’s. This sort of superficial decoration was,Paragraph
little different from that pursued by Philip Johnson during his,Paragraph
"corporate skyscraper phase of the 1980s, when he freely admitted",Paragraph
that in working with property developers who presented him with a,Paragraph
predetermined high-rise building envelope calibrated to maximize,Paragraph
"profits, there was little he could do beyond gussying up the curtain",Paragraph
walls in one eye-catching mode or another.,Paragraph
Celebrity architects also became more familiar to the general,Paragraph
public through such rare events as the televised presentation in,Paragraph
2002 of the semifinalists’ designs in the competition for the,Caption
reconstruction of the World Trade Center site. On a more regular,Caption
"basis, The Charlie Rose Show, which was first broadcast by PBS in",Paragraph
"1991, has offered an upper-middlebrow forum in which scores of",Paragraph
high-profile master builders have attempted to elucidate their work,Paragraph
to an informed general audience. Whether these designers,Paragraph
succeeded in demystifying their creative process for laymen remains,Paragraph
debatable. Given the strong emphasis that avant-garde practitioners,Paragraph
"have placed on theoretical concerns during the past several decades,",Paragraph
the more pretentious among them often add to the obfuscation.,Paragraph
Apart from a few indefatigable press-friendly performers like Wright,Paragraph
"and Fuller, the predominant twentieth-century notion of the",Paragraph
"architect was that of an aloof, hyperrational engineer rather than",Paragraph
"that of an approachable, intuitive artist.",Paragraph
Before the professionalization of architecture in the nineteenth,Title
"century, it was standard procedure for an aspiring mason or",Paragraph
carpenter to begin his apprenticeship at fourteen and to become a,Paragraph
master builder by his early twenties. But with today’s protracted,Paragraph
"educational adolescence and a much longer life expectancy,",Paragraph
"architects now finish schooling in their mid- to late twenties, work",Paragraph
"for an established firm during their thirties, and then, if sufficiently",Paragraph
"talented, embark on independent practice at around forty.",Paragraph
Designing a house for one’s parents is an almost cliché rite of,Paragraph
passage—Le Corbusier and Robert Venturi are prime twentieth-,Paragraph
century examples of helpful familial patronage—followed by more,Paragraph
residential work and nondomestic renovations or additions. Only,Paragraph
after two decades of sustained experience do big jobs generally start,Paragraph
"to arrive, although by the age of fifty typecasting also sets in. If one",Paragraph
"is fortunate enough to bring off several well-received projects, a",Paragraph
"Pritzker Prize might come during one’s sixties, depending on that",Paragraph
coveted award’s shifting and often inscrutable notions of artistic,Paragraph
excellence and geopolitical distribution. Winning the Pritzker,Paragraph
"assures a flood of work in one’s seventies and eighties, commissions",Paragraph
necessarily carried out by assistants as the demands of modern-day,Paragraph
cultural stardom and the inevitable waning of physical capacities,Title
prevent many architects from attaining the transcendent final phase,Paragraph
more easily achieved by artists in other mediums. Architecture is,Paragraph
"not a profession for the fainthearted, the weak-willed, or the short-",Paragraph
lived.,Paragraph
"The self-identification of architects as artists, which began to",Paragraph
reassert itself in the architectural avant-garde around the mid-,Paragraph
"1970s, was intensified by the increase in the numbers of what would",Paragraph
become the most conspicuous public building category of the late,Paragraph
"twentieth century, the art museum, which was superseded around",Paragraph
the turn of the millennium by a comparable increase in the,Paragraph
construction of performing arts halls. To win commissions in either,Paragraph
"format, architects found it to their advantage to posit themselves as",Paragraph
"artists, and in many cases have validated that comparison, as",Paragraph
"demonstrated most notably by Frank Gehry, of whose Guggenheim",Paragraph
Museum Bilbao it has been said (as had earlier been claimed of,Paragraph
Wright’s original Guggenheim) that the building itself is the,Paragraph
"institution’s greatest work of art, and whose Walt Disney Concert",Paragraph
Hall in Los Angeles might be said to be a composition equal to some,Paragraph
of the greatest of those played within its billowing walls.,Paragraph
Writing in the very first issue of The New York Review of Books in,Paragraph
"1963, Robert Lowell wisely observed, “The arts do not progress but",Paragraph
move along by surges and sags.” This is particularly true of,Paragraph
architecture. Although today it is more than ever a_ highly,Paragraph
"collaborative process, it is still driven forward by the vision of",Paragraph
"relatively few practitioners—some well-known to the public, others",Paragraph
familiar only to specialists—whose work is closely watched by their,Paragraph
peers and thus has a disproportionate effect on the direction of the,Paragraph
"discipline. All the same, my emphasis on personality and character",Paragraph
ought not to be misinterpreted as an endorsement of a Great Man,Paragraph
"(or Great Woman) Theory of architecture. Rather, it reflects my",Paragraph
"belief that the human element, both individual and collective, in the",Paragraph
creation and the habitation of the built environment is central to,Paragraph
any understanding of the universal impulse we all share: to make,Paragraph
ourselves a sheltering home on earth.,Paragraph
"CHARLES McKIM, WILLIAM MEAD, AND",Title
STANFORD WHITE,Title
ir may seem Odd to begin a book about modern architecture with a firm,Paragraph
"now generally considered to be historical revivalists, but a strong",Paragraph
"case can be made that McKim, Mead & White was a proto-modern",Paragraph
partnership not only in its corporate organization but also in its,Paragraph
audacious address of new building forms engendered by the,Paragraph
machine age. Changing attitudes toward historically inspired,Paragraph
"architecture, and Classicism in particular, have led to reassessments",Paragraph
of buildings that were long dismissed by proponents of the Modern,Paragraph
Movement as retrogressive but that now are widely regarded as,Paragraph
advanced despite their outwardly traditional appearance. There is,Paragraph
no better example of this reversal of posthumous fortune than New,Paragraph
"York City’s Pennsylvania Station of 1905-1910 (see Illustration 1b),",Paragraph
still keenly mourned as the lost masterpiece of Charles Follen,Paragraph
"McKim, one of the triumvirate—along with William Rutherford",Paragraph
Mead and Stanford White—who gave their surnames to the most,Paragraph
prolific and celebrated high-style American architectural practice,Paragraph
during the half-century between the Civil War and World War I.,Paragraph
"It had long been commonplace to emphasize McKim, Mead &",Paragraph
"White’s dependence on Old World prototypes. For example, White",Paragraph
based his Renaissance Revival New York Herald Building of 1890-,Paragraph
"1895, which fronted Herald Square, on Fra Giovanni Giocondo’s",Caption
"Palazzo del Consiglio of 1476-1492 in Verona, and he modeled the",Paragraph
Mozarabic tower of his Madison Square Garden of 1887-1891 (once,Caption
"the third-tallest structure in the city, after the Brooklyn Bridge and",Paragraph
the Statue of Liberty) on the Giralda of 1184-1198 in Seville.,Caption
"Similarly, McKim’s Beaux Arts—inspired Boston Public Library of",Paragraph
1888-1892 owes an obvious debt to Henri Labrouste’s Bibliotheque,Paragraph
"Sainte-Geneviéve of 1843-1851 in Paris, whereas his Pennsylvania",Paragraph
Station followed a conjectural reconstruction of Imperial Rome’s,Paragraph
Baths of Caracalla of 212-216 AD.,Caption
"Though McKim, Mead & White’s historical eclecticism almost",Paragraph
"never attains the quality of its sources, and on occasion appears",Paragraph
little more than a skillfully executed precursor of the touristic,Paragraph
"landmarks we now see replicated at Las Vegas theme hotels, the best",Paragraph
"of the firm’s work, however derivative in outward expression, on",Paragraph
occasion comes close to that of the foremost American master,Paragraph
"builder of the generation before it: H. H. Richardson, in whose",Paragraph
"employ McKim and White first met. Yet despite McKim, Mead &",Paragraph
White’s current critical esteem—considerably higher than it was half,Paragraph
a century ago—in order to find the true muscle and sinew of,Paragraph
advanced American architecture during the heyday of this arch-,Paragraph
establishment partnership we must look instead to the mystically,Paragraph
"inclined but commercially aware Louis Sullivan, spiritual father of",Paragraph
"the tall office building, and to his spiritual son, Frank Lloyd Wright,",Paragraph
the apostle of organic design derived from the native soil. Their,Paragraph
heroic quest for an authentically American architecture set them in,Paragraph
diametric opposition to what they saw as the deadening hand of,Paragraph
"Classicism, so powerfully wielded by McKim, Mead & White",Paragraph
(however much Sullivan and Wright may have absorbed and,Paragraph
subsumed historical models themselves).,Paragraph
The American public was rudely reawakened to the significance,Paragraph
"of McKim, Mead & White by the demolition of Pennsylvania Station,",Caption
which began in October 1963 but took nearly three years to,Paragraph
accomplish because of the huge building’s extraordinarily solid and,Paragraph
deep construction. By the time the vast site was cleared and ready to,Paragraph
receive the crowning indignity of Charles Luckman’s ticky-tacky,Paragraph
"Madison Square Garden, completed in 1968, the _historic-",Paragraph
preservation movement had gathered to prevent comparable acts of,Paragraph
"cultural vandalism. New York’s only other equivalent landmark,",Paragraph
Grand Central Terminal of 1904-1913 (a collaboration between the,Paragraph
"firms of Reed & Stem and Warren & Wetmore), was spared a similar",Paragraph
fate when opponents derailed a disastrous redevelopment scheme by,Paragraph
Marcel Breuer for its site during the 1970s thanks to the shameful,Paragraph
precedent of Penn Station (though the creation of the New York City,Paragraph
Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1965 was too late to stop,Paragraph
"the vast, ugly Pan Am Building from going up next to the terminal).",Paragraph
McKim’s design marked a significant departure from earlier,Paragraph
railway depots because it was built to accommodate the newly,Paragraph
"electrified trains of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which freed him",Paragraph
from the standard arrangement of a train shed attached to a shelter,Paragraph
"for ticket sales and passenger waiting areas, all at street level or",Paragraph
only somewhat recessed (as was the case at the steam-driven New,Paragraph
York Central Railroad’s Grand Central Terminal). Electrified trains,Paragraph
"emit no noxious fumes, so they could run through tunnels rather",Paragraph
than on viaducts or in open trenches and thus remain deep,Paragraph
"underground once they reached their destinations, which enabled",Paragraph
McKim to submerge components that previously needed to be above,Paragraph
ground.,Paragraph
The new possibilities provided by electrification afforded McKim,Paragraph
the freedom to make his ground plan for Pennsylvania Station a,Title
marvel of modern efficiency. In choosing the Baths of Caracalla as,Paragraph
"his model for its exterior, the architect found an ideal scheme that",Paragraph
allowed him to encompass the entire eight-acre site—which covered,Paragraph
two full city blocks from West 33rd to 31st Streets and from Seventh,Caption
"to Eighth Avenues—in one immense but cohesive whole, united by a",Paragraph
colossal order of granite columns that formed a monumental,Paragraph
colonnade on its principal facade along Seventh Avenue and,Caption
concealed a porte-cochere driveway that ran along its north flank on,Paragraph
"33rd Street. This ingenious arrival sequence, which protected",Paragraph
"travelers from the elements in all seasons, was arranged so that",Paragraph
luggage could be conveniently unloaded first and then moved to,Paragraph
"baggage cars via mechanical conveyors, before passengers were",Paragraph
driven on to a final stop situated as close as possible to the,Paragraph
"departure gates, located below street level.",Paragraph
Although Penn Station’s stupendously grand waiting room was,Paragraph
decked out with all the elaborate masonry detailing of the Classical,Paragraph
"copybook, the concourse—where travelers descended to the train",Title
platforms on the level beneath it—dispensed with stone cladding,Paragraph
and left the building’s steel supports exposed. With its barrel-vaulted,Paragraph
"glass-paned ceiling and machine aesthetic, the concourse resembled",Paragraph
Joseph Paxton and Charles Fox’s Crystal Palace of 1850-1851 in,Caption
London; with its strong vertical development and interplay of light,Paragraph
and shadow it also brought to mind Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s,Paragraph
"Carceri d’invenzione of 1745-1751, etchings of imaginary prisons in",Caption
which the Venetian architect and printmaker concocted vertiginous,Paragraph
multilayered networks of mysteriously interconnected spaces. (Rare,Paragraph
film footage of Penn Station’s concourse and porte cochere can be,Caption
found in the early talkie Applause (1929) directed by Rouben,Paragraph
Mamoulian.),Paragraph
McKim’s unexpectedly harmonious synthesis of two divergent and,Paragraph
"supposedly irreconcilable architectural approaches, the Classical and",Paragraph
the industrial—a melding earlier perfected by Labrouste—would,Paragraph
have been a most instructive object lesson during the architectural,Paragraph
style wars that were to rage during the two decades following the,Paragraph
scandalous sack of McKim’s marvel. No one saw the dire,Paragraph
implications of that insane decision more clearly than an,Paragraph
"anonymous editorial writer in The New York Times, who sounded, at",Paragraph
"least, like Ada Louise Huxtable, that infallible Cassandra of",Paragraph
urbanism:,Title
"Any city gets what it admires, will pay for, and, ultimately,",Paragraph
"deserves. Even when we had Penn Station, we couldn’t afford",Paragraph
to keep it clean. We want and deserve tin-can architecture in a,Paragraph
tinhorn culture. And we will probably be judged not by the,Paragraph
monuments we build but by those we have destroyed.,Paragraph
"McKim, Mead, and White began working together in New York",Paragraph
"City in 1879 when White, now the best remembered of the partners,",Paragraph
joined forces with his two older colleagues. Although Mead has,Paragraph
"sometimes been unfairly characterized as a glorified office manager,",Paragraph
or at best a mediator between his two antithetical if extravagantly,Paragraph
"gifted associates, there is no question that the magnetic (and",Paragraph
occasionally mutually repellent) poles of the consortium were,Paragraph
McKim and White. This can be neatly summarized by juxtaposing a,Paragraph
"pair of contemporaneous, functionally identical, but tellingly",Paragraph
different New York City schemes that exemplify the two architects’,Paragraph
respective qualities: McKim’s Low Memorial Library of 1895-1898,Paragraph
at his new campus for Columbia University in Manhattan’s,Caption
"Morningside Heights, and White’s Gould Memorial Library of 1897-",Caption
1902 at his University Heights branch of New York University in the,Caption
Bronx (which became Bronx Community College when NYU gave up,Paragraph
the property in 1973). Each building serves as the focal point for its,Paragraph
"academic ensemble, is compact in ground plan, and has a shallow",Paragraph
centralized dome and a columned entry portico of Roman,Caption
"derivation, but there the similarities end.",Paragraph
"The Columbia library is massive, stolid, sober, devoid of",Paragraph
"ornamental frippery, and though a bit dull conveys an aura of",Paragraph
gravitas thoroughly suited to high-minded intellectual pursuits. On,Paragraph
"the other hand, White’s uptown NYU library is characteristically",Paragraph
"lighter in volume and enlivened by sprightly detailing, which",Paragraph
suggests that a little learning can be a delightful thing. Like,Paragraph
"Richardson, McKim studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and",Paragraph
"possessed an innately more decorous temperament than White, who",Paragraph
had almost no formal training but was such a natural-born designer,Paragraph
and quick study that his lack of education would have been,Paragraph
"betrayed to only the most pedantic of Classical scholars. Instead, it",Paragraph
was the far more important differences in personal character,Paragraph
between McKim and White that held the seeds of destruction for this,Paragraph
architectural dream team.,Paragraph
"McKim, Mead, and White made their reputations, at first",Paragraph
"individually and then in concert, during the 1870s and 1880s with a",Paragraph
remarkable series of large wood-frame vacation houses (see,Caption
Illustration 1a) in fashionable resort communities along the Atlantic,Paragraph
"seaboard, including Elberon, New Jersey; Newport, Rhode Island;",Paragraph
"Lenox, Massachusetts; Tuxedo Park, New York; and the East End of",Paragraph
"Long Island, where from 1880 to 1883 White designed the Montauk",Paragraph
Association—a group of seven capacious “cottages” nicknamed the,Paragraph
"Seven Sisters, along with a communal recreation building—on a",Paragraph
"bluff near the tip of the South Fork, a property laid out by Frederick",Paragraph
"Law Olmsted, landscape architect of New York’s Central Park of",Caption
1857-1873.,Paragraph
The novel domestic format devised by the collaborators stemmed,Paragraph
less from American precedents than from vernacular traditions in,Paragraph
Normandy and the residential work of their older British,Title
"contemporary Richard Norman Shaw, who in turn harked back to",Paragraph
"English rural forms with rambling, irregularly angled, multigabled",Paragraph
"compositions that seemed to be the accretions of many years, if not",Paragraph
several centuries. But whereas Shaw clad his houses in half-timber,Paragraph
"or slate tiles, McKim, Mead & White used natural-colored wood",Paragraph
"shingles, a vernacular American material, which it deployed in",Paragraph
varied interlocking textures that the architectural historian Henry-,Paragraph
Russell Hitchcock vividly likened to birds’ plumage.,Paragraph

This sense of genteel social retirement and grand self-sufficiency,Paragraph
was most apparent in the spacious living halls the firm designed for,Paragraph
a number of their Shingle Style schemes. As with the,Paragraph
multifunctional ground-floor reception and sitting areas that became,Paragraph
"popular in mid-nineteenth-century Britain, McKim, Mead & White’s",Paragraph
adaptations were focused around a vast hearth (often with an,Paragraph
"adjacent seating alcove, or inglenook) that infused visitors’ first",Paragraph
impression with a welcoming warmth both figurative and literal.,Paragraph
"Though usually paneled in dark wood, the typical McKim, Mead &",Paragraph
White living hall was well illuminated through broad expanses of,Paragraph
"multipaned windows, often on two sides of the room, which in",Paragraph
many cases gave onto the firm’s signature enveloping verandas.,Paragraph
"But there was also a distinctly East Asian feeling, which, as",Paragraph
"Hitchcock noted, went well beyond the superficial application of",Paragraph
Japanesque decorative motifs that became a widespread craze,Paragraph
during the zenith of the Aesthetic Movement in the 1880s:,Paragraph
"The main rectangular space, of which the shape is emphasized",Paragraph
by the ceiling beams and by the abstract geometrical pattern of,Paragraph
"the floor, seems to flow out in various directions into other",Paragraph
rooms and into several bays and nooks; but the actual room-,Paragraph
space is sharply defined by a continuous frieze-like member,Paragraph
that becomes an open wooden grille above the various,Paragraph
openings. There can be little question that the major influence,Paragraph
"here is from the Japanese interior, but the Japanese interior",Paragraph
understood as architecture.,Paragraph
Credit for introducing this continuous flow of space to America is,Paragraph
"most often given to Wright, whose interest in classical Japanese",Paragraph
"architecture is well known. But McKim, Mead & White was",Paragraph
executing these sweeping proto-modern interiors two decades before,Paragraph
Wright went even further with that openness in his celebrated,Paragraph

"Pulitzers—as well as fellow artists, including Louis Comfort Tiffany",Paragraph
"and Charles Dana Gibson, in addition to nearby country retreats for",Paragraph
"the plutocratic Astor, Mackay, and Oelrichs families.",Paragraph
Although Stanford White remains among the very few architects,Paragraph
"whose name is widely recognized among laymen in this country, his",Paragraph
urban designs were demonstrably lightweight in comparison to,Paragraph
McKim’s. White is perhaps most accurately seen as the John Nash of,Paragraph
"American urbanism, a facile and pleasure-giving metteur en scéne of",Paragraph
enchanting set pieces that catch the eye but rarely provide much,Paragraph
"intellectual substance, as was also the case with the equally well-",Paragraph
connected English architect who put his mark on Regency London as,Paragraph
"indelibly as White did on New York at the height of the Gilded Age,",Paragraph
but who also often seems more an ingenious urban stage designer,Paragraph
than a shaper of modern civic life.,Paragraph
"All the same, there is no doubt that apparently without exception",Paragraph
"White’s clients adored what he gave them, as indicated by one",Paragraph

McKim’s characteristic perfectionism (which contrasted with,Paragraph
White’s sometimes slapdash solutions) would never be indulged,Paragraph
"more fully than by J. Pierpont Morgan, who commissioned him to",Paragraph
build the New York private library and gallery of 1903-1906 that in,Paragraph
"2010 emerged, more magnificent than ever, from an exemplary",Paragraph

"told the architect, and he got one, though not before spending a",Paragraph

"visit to the Acropolis in Athens, McKim became fascinated by the",Paragraph
ancient anathyrosis technique of assembling precision-ground blocks,Paragraph
of masonry without mortar (a refinement the Incas later,Paragraph
independently mastered and employed in rather less regular fashion,Paragraph
for their famous walls at Cuzco). Climatic differences would not,Paragraph
permit an exact duplication of the Greek method of mortarless,Paragraph
"assemblage, but McKim came very close by adding a thin layer of",Paragraph
lead between the Morgan Library’s marble blocks to compensate for,Paragraph
expansion and contraction caused by New York’s more extreme,Paragraph
"temperatures. This nicety, which Morgan instantly assented to, set",Paragraph
"him back an extra $50,000 (about $1.2 million in current value).",Paragraph
McKim is the closest America has ever come to having a national,Paragraph
"architect, and his imprint on the city of Washington is still palpable",Paragraph
on both the urban and the domestic scale. He was a member of the,Paragraph
Senate-appointed panel responsible for the so-called McMillan Plan,Title
"of 1901 (named for the Michigan legislator who sponsored it),",Paragraph
which sought to restore order to the capital’s original 1791 design,Paragraph
by the French-born civil engineer and architect Pierre-Charles,Paragraph
"L’Enfant. That grandiose Baroque layout, with radial principal",Paragraph
"boulevards superimposed on an overall grid of lesser streets, had",Paragraph
been only sketchily realized when the federal government moved to,Paragraph
Washington from Philadelphia in 1800.,Paragraph
"Over the next century, L’Enfant’s scheme was repeatedly",Paragraph
"compromised, no more so than with the imposition of an undulating",Paragraph
Romantic landscape devised in 1851 by Andrew Jackson Downing,Title
to surround Renwick’s Neo-Gothic Smithsonian of 1846-1855. This,Paragraph
visual non sequitur encroached onto the broad greensward L’Enfant,Caption
hoped would extend westward from the Capitol building to the,Paragraph
Potomac. The far-reaching remedial proposals set forth under,Paragraph
"McKim’s supervision, which were largely but not fully implemented,",Paragraph
"reasserted the French architect’s intentions, especially in the",Paragraph
"creation of the National Mall, the strong outlines and verdant",Paragraph
integrity of which remain intact at the precinct now considered,Paragraph
America’s sacrosanct front yard.,Paragraph
McKim’s strong hand in reshaping the nation’s capital can be seen,Paragraph
"most frequently in television broadcasts from the White House,",Paragraph
where the main floor of the Executive Mansion—especially the East,Paragraph
"Room, scene of many presidential press conferences and ceremonies;",Paragraph
"the Cross Hall, through which the president passes to face the",Paragraph
"cameras; and the State Dining Room, where foreign heads of state",Paragraph
are entertained—were all redesigned by him as part of a,Paragraph
thoroughgoing renovation ordered by Theodore Roosevelt in 1902.,Paragraph
A century after James Hoban’s President’s House of 1792-1800 was,Paragraph
"first occupied, the Neoclassical character of the original structure",Paragraph
had been sadly undermined. The exterior was overburdened by a,Paragraph
chaotic jumble of greenhouses appended to the west side of the,Paragraph
mansion (where the McKim-designed executive office wing now,Paragraph
"stands), and Victorian interior accretions were aptly likened to the",Paragraph
"gaudy, overstuffed decor of a Mississippi riverboat.",Paragraph
"McKim stripped away these excesses, including Louis Comfort",Paragraph
"Tiffany’s Aesthetic Movement stained-glass windscreen of 1882,",Paragraph
which shielded the Cross Hall from the drafty lobby. But rather than,Paragraph
going back to Hoban’s delicate Neoclassical interior detailing (which,Paragraph
McKim had carefully covered over but was ripped out in the gut,Paragraph
"reconstruction of 1948-1952 decreed by Harry Truman), the",Paragraph
architect substituted a beefier Anglo-Classical aesthetic that at the,Paragraph
time passed for the then-popular Colonial Revival style. Here is yet,Paragraph
another example of the inevitable tendency of Classical revivals to,Paragraph

imperial ambitions of America in the days of the Great White Fleet.,Paragraph
Only four years after the completion of this incomparably,Paragraph
"prestigious and much-admired project, McKim, Mead & White’s",Paragraph
glory years came to an abrupt and bloody end. White had always,Paragraph

bric-a-brac as compulsively as his younger contemporary William,Paragraph

was forced into a sideline as a sub rosa dealer to defray the crushing,Paragraph
debts he accrued.,Paragraph
"A social animal to the bone, White never let his family—",Paragraph
"conveniently rusticated at Box Hill, the idyllic Shingle Style house",Paragraph
on Long Island he built and constantly remodeled for them between,Paragraph
"1884 and 1906—interfere with his frenetic social life in the city,",Paragraph
which he rationalized as a means of getting jobs from the nabobs of,Paragraph

"adept architectural networker than Stanny White, who moved with",Paragraph
intuitive ease among the various subsets of New York’s economic,Paragraph
and social elite as he made friends and garnered commissions,Paragraph
everywhere he went.,Paragraph
"White also had a thing for underage girls, a predilection that he",Paragraph
hardly concealed in the louche theatrical haunts that were no less a,Paragraph

during the first years of the new century.,Paragraph
The lurid tale of White’s fatal attraction for Nesbit has been told,Paragraph
"many times, and given the unedifying nature of their relationship,",Paragraph
trashier accounts get closer to the seamy reality than bowdlerized,Paragraph
versions. This folie 4 deux was the subject of Richard Fleischer’s,Paragraph
"1955 film The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing, which starred Ray Milland",Paragraph

FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT,Title
THE Most REMARKABLE thing about the extensive literature on Frank Lloyd,Paragraph
"Wright—new additions to which flow forth season after season,",Paragraph
even as the stream of other architecture books dwindles—is not its,Paragraph
"magnitude (491 titles as of 2013, according to the Library of",Paragraph
"Congress catalog, more than the 433 executed buildings in Wright’s",Paragraph
catalogue raisonné). More striking is the extreme disproportion in,Paragraph
the coverage of different aspects of his seven-decade career. In,Paragraph
"addition to many lavish Wright picture albums, there is no end of",Paragraph
publications on individual houses by America’s greatest architect.,Paragraph
The finest of those studies have been by the architectural historian,Paragraph
"and critic Donald Hoffmann, whose magisterial Wright series for",Paragraph

penetrating monographic analyses of the Robie house of 1906-1910,Title

"Pennsylvania, are unrivaled and likely to remain so. Such classic",Paragraph
works have been vastly outnumbered by the self-aggrandizing,Paragraph
memoirs written by many patrons who commissioned Wright houses,Paragraph
"late in his career, whether or not the buildings they paid for were of",Paragraph
any special quality.,Paragraph

"the corruptions of Gotham. Nonetheless, as an architect who had",Paragraph
"few peers as a self-promoter, Wright was inexorably drawn to New",Paragraph
"York and its influential opinion-makers in publishing, broadcasting,",Paragraph
"and the arts. With each well-publicized visit, the architect perfected",Paragraph
"his carefully crafted image of a curmudgeonly embattled genius, as",Paragraph
"he dependably supplied reporters and cameramen with pithy quotes,",Paragraph
"clever photo ops, and droll newsreel turns, like another incorrigible",Paragraph
"press hound of the period, George Bernard Shaw.",Caption

communication as they emerged. Kinescopes and tapes preserve,Paragraph
several of his frequent appearances on such early TV programs as,Paragraph
Conversations with Elder Wise Men (in dialogue with the young Hugh,Caption

"and What’s My Line? (where a blindfolded Dorothy Kilgallen, the",Paragraph

Wright’s New York base of operations was the luxurious Plaza,Paragraph
"Hotel, where he first stayed in 1909, two years after its opening, on",Paragraph

"who lived high on the hog even when flat broke, Wright redecorated",Paragraph

Avenue at the building’s northeast corner—with a mélange of Asian-,Paragraph
inspired and modern furnishings (including chairs carved with a,Paragraph
"swan’s-head motif, left behind by the previous tenant, the couturier",Paragraph
"Christian Dior), and obscured the rooms’ Beaux Arts detailing with",Paragraph
panels of gold-flecked Japanese rice paper. Although the Plaza’s,Paragraph
beer-baron architectural historicism exemplified the deracinated,Paragraph
"styles he rebelled against as a young firebrand, Wright the Olympian",Paragraph
sage took a more benign view of the hotel’s forgettable architect,Paragraph
than he did of formidable competitors like Le Corbusier and Ludwig,Paragraph

"love affair with the automobile, which shaped—in fact, dominated",Paragraph
—his approach to regional development. No other master builder,Paragraph
has maintained a more enduring hold on the American imagination,Paragraph
"than Wright, not even Thomas Jefferson (who is considered first and",Paragraph
foremost an architect by Neoclassical fanatics). Although Jefferson’s,Paragraph
reverence for the Vitruvian tradition was the antithesis of Wright’s,Paragraph
"contempt for historical revivalism, they shared an antiurban vision",Paragraph
of the United States as a gridwork of small farms and single-family,Paragraph
"houses, punctuated by modestly sized towns. Both men viewed big",Paragraph
cities with instinctive suspicion. The major difference was that,Paragraph
Wright’s idea for modern exurbia—his unrealized Broadacre City,Paragraph
"scheme of 1932-1934, a low-rise, low-density Nowhere Land he",Paragraph
hoped would encourage “lives lived in greater independence and,Paragraph
seclusion”—depended on the private automobile as virtually the,Paragraph
sole means of transportation. Broadacre’s formula for communal,Paragraph
dispersal and social isolation presaged the rampant sprawl that has,Paragraph

much at odds with the environmentalism imputed to Wright’s earthy,Paragraph

quintessential American manifestations—the destructive effects of,Paragraph

"“freedom”—remains unexplored, but it could yield a critique of far-",Paragraph
reaching significance and contemporary relevance.,Paragraph
The biggest gap on the Wright bookshelf remains a biography that,Paragraph
begins to approach John Richardson’s multivolume masterpiece A,Paragraph
Life of Picasso. Retellings of Wright’s life story continue to appear,Paragraph
and just as predictably vanish. None thus far has been wholly,Paragraph
"satisfactory, although the most useful collection of facts is to be",Paragraph
found in the uneven Frank Lloyd Wright: His Life and His Architecture,Paragraph
(1979) by Robert Twombly. One can understand why any historian,Paragraph
would shrink from the all-consuming effort needed to realize a,Paragraph
"comprehensive life-and-works of this prolific figure, who died when",Paragraph
"he was ninety-one. However, such an achievement would guarantee",Paragraph
its author a place in the Boswellian pantheon along with,Paragraph
"Richardson, Leon Edel, Richard Ellmann, and other masters of the",Paragraph

lends itself all too readily to the salacious scandalmongering that,Paragraph

After the two-decade eclipse precipitated by the Mamah,Paragraph

"the Taliesin Fellowship, the school-cum-professional practice he set",Paragraph
"up in 1932 at his estate in Spring Green, Wisconsin—less out of love",Paragraph
for pedagogy than as a survival strategy when the Great Depression,Paragraph
exacerbated his desperation and made even erstwhile devotees see,Paragraph
him as an irrelevant anachronism. The fellowship rescued Wright,Paragraph
"financially, spiritually, and creatively (until advanced old age began",Paragraph

Modern Architecture was also the battered but unbowed architect’s,Paragraph

"West, Wright’s other home and design studio, begun in 1937, in",Paragraph
"Scottsdale, Arizona—a trio outstanding within Wright’s oeuvre not",Paragraph
only for quality but for variety.,Paragraph
Although Wright’s Prairie Houses responded with notable,Paragraph
"sensitivity to specific sites and social settings, they also shared a",Paragraph
certain sameness. The architect of Fallingwater insisted that “the,Paragraph
ideas involved here are in no ways changed from those of [my],Paragraph
early work.... The effects you see in this house are not superficial,Paragraph
"effects.” However, there is no denying that some of its details evince",Paragraph

severely unadorned balconies of this country house for the,Caption
Pittsburgh department store owner Edgar Kaufmann Sr. would have,Paragraph
been right at home in a white-stucco Le Corbusier villa. (Wright had,Paragraph
"originally wanted to surface those parapets with gold leaf, an idea",Paragraph
"rejected by Kaufmann, who was sensitive to public relations and",Paragraph
deemed the gilding provocatively ostentatious during the Great,Paragraph

Truer to Wright’s claims of consistency with his pioneering work,Paragraph
"of the century’s first decade was his Johnson Wax headquarters,",Paragraph
"which, despite being an exercise in the trendy Streamline Moderne",Paragraph
"style then sweeping the country, was rooted in his Larkin building",Paragraph
of three decades earlier. The Johnson offices’ Great Workroom,Paragraph
"reiterated the basic format of the Larkin’s central workspace, the",Paragraph
"Light Court, which was similarly inward-turning, high-ceilinged,",Paragraph
and illuminated by skylights. Taliesin West evoked a more recent,Paragraph
"Wright precedent, his temporary Ocatillo Desert Camp of 1928 in",Paragraph
"Chandler, Arizona, where the architect and his devoted staff",Paragraph
rusticated during an ill-fated series of commissions that ended,Paragraph
abruptly with the Wall Street crash. Although Taliesin West was,Paragraph

anchored by massive piers made from local boulders cast in,Paragraph

these three schemes represent a more concentrated display of,Paragraph
Wright’s prodigious talents than during any equivalent period of his,Paragraph
career.,Paragraph
The early days of Taliesin West—where the fellowship escaped,Paragraph
the harsh Wisconsin winters—were indelibly captured in,Paragraph
"photographs by Wright’s longtime official image-maker, Pedro E.",Caption
"Guerrero, a poor Mexican-American who was allowed to enroll in",Paragraph
the fellowship without a fee in return for his services. Although,Paragraph
Wright harbored certain biases not unusual for a man born just two,Paragraph
"years after the Civil War ended, he betrayed no prejudice when he",Paragraph
unhesitatingly welcomed Guerrero into the Taliesin community at a,Paragraph
time when discrimination against Latinos was rife in the American,Paragraph
Southwest. The architect treated his protégé with immense paternal,Paragraph
"tenderness and reflexive munificence when, after Pearl Harbor, the",Paragraph
"young man enlisted in the army, to the dismay of the pacifist",Paragraph
"Wright, a stalwart of the isolationist America First movement.",Paragraph
"In contrast to such noble episodes, the Taliesin Fellowship,",Paragraph
"isolated and hierarchical, was to a great extent a royal court, an",Paragraph
"atmosphere promoted less by Wright than by his sinister,",Paragraph
"manipulative, and voyeuristic third wife, Olgivanna—a Montenegrin",Paragraph
divorcée and acolyte of G.I. Gurdjieff. (Mrs. Wright’s flagrant,Paragraph
advances toward Gurdjieff during his 1934 stay at Taliesin made the,Paragraph
"depth of her attraction embarrassingly clear.) The fellowship’s lithe,",Paragraph
"nubile, and enticingly underdressed apprentices responded to the",Paragraph
"climate, whether homosexual, bisexual, heterosexual, or pansexual.",Paragraph
But it is no news that college-age youths like to have a great deal of,Paragraph
"sex, and that old folks do, too (the nonagenarian Wright improbably",Paragraph
boasted that he “fucked his wife every night”); or that design,Paragraph
students are perhaps more likely to be gay than many other,Paragraph
students; or that a lothario like Wright could be homophobic. For,Paragraph
"decades, the unimpeachable gatekeeper of the Taliesin archive was",Paragraph
"Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer, of immeasurable help to historians and critics",Paragraph
"during the long twilight of Olgivanna, who outlived her husband by",Paragraph
"more than a quarter-century, and whose greed and mania for",Paragraph
control might have brought Wright studies to a complete halt were,Paragraph
it not for Pfeiffer. This paragon of accuracy and probity astonished,Paragraph
"fellow scholars when, in one tell-all account of life at the fellowship,",Paragraph
"he recalled informing Wright that he was gay, to which the architect",Paragraph
"replied, “Bruce, why don’t you cut your dinky dick off?”",Paragraph
Perhaps the saddest victim of that extended household was,Paragraph
"Olgivanna and Wright’s only child together, Iovanna Lazovich Lloyd",Paragraph
"Wright, who renamed herself Rosa and lived in mental institutions",Paragraph
for much of her life. The architect’s seventh offspring got off to an,Paragraph
"inauspicious start: before her parents could legally marry, the",Paragraph
newborn and her mother were hounded from the hospital by,Paragraph
"Wright’s erratic and vindictive second wife, Miriam Noel. Iovanna,",Paragraph
"the architectural counterpart of the pathetic Lucia Joyce, suffered",Paragraph
from familial dysfunctions familiar to children of the great in every,Paragraph
"field. But as was painfully apparent, Iovanna/Rosa was also",Paragraph
"psychotic, although her flashes of intelligence repeatedly raised false",Paragraph
"hopes about her prognosis, as was likewise true of the daughter of",Paragraph
the author of Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. This heartbreaking case,Paragraph
"history provides an insistent, melancholy counterpoint to the",Paragraph
persistent tales of sexual antics and power intrigues that swirled,Paragraph
"around the indifferent Wright, whose imperturbable nature was a",Paragraph
mixture of Micawberish optimism and cosmic self-absorption.,Paragraph
Wright’s blithe disregard for others and for the havoc that such,Paragraph
obliviousness could wreak on his high professional aspirations was,Paragraph
"never clearer than in his abandonment of his first wife, Catherine",Paragraph
"Tobin Wright, and their six children upon his elopement with",Paragraph
"Mamah Borthwick Cheney, the wife of a neighbor for whom he built",Paragraph
"his Cheney house of 1903-1904 in Oak Park, Illinois. This escapade",Paragraph
"ended with Mamah’s murder in 1914, the grisly denouement to a",Paragraph
"sex-and-homicide saga that surpassed its nearest equivalent, when",Paragraph
Stanford White was shot to death eight years earlier by the,Paragraph
deranged husband of the roué architect’s erstwhile underage,Paragraph
"plaything, Evelyn Nesbit Thaw. For five years, Wright’s real-life soap",Paragraph
opera played out in headlines that brought him to the attention of a,Paragraph
national audience as yet unfamiliar with his work.,Paragraph
"However, by 1906 the architect had become enough of a local",Paragraph
celebrity to merit a picture postcard of his own Oak Park house and,Paragraph
studio of 1889-1898 (see Illustration 2a). The caption under that,Paragraph
"image, “The House Built Around a Tree,” referred to his having",Paragraph
reconfigured the ground plan for his octagonal home-office addition,Caption
of 1897-1898 to preserve a mature gingko tree (which survived,Paragraph
until it was felled by lightning in 1992). Wright carried out a much,Paragraph
less edifying alteration of the structure a decade after that tree-,Paragraph
"sparing gesture, when he thoughtfully remodeled it to serve as an",Paragraph
"income-producing boardinghouse run by his forsaken spouse, after",Paragraph
"he and his free-thinking, financially independent lady friend took off",Paragraph
together.,Paragraph
The moral outrage that affair ignited can be deduced from the,Paragraph
overheated press coverage. The Chicago Tribune deemed the brazen,Paragraph
liaison “an affinity tangle ... unparalleled even in the checkered,Paragraph
"history of soul-mating,” a widely shared perception that halted the",Paragraph
architect’s thriving career in short order. Public indignation was,Paragraph
further inflamed by the knowledge that Wright’s practice had been,Paragraph
based on residential commissions like the Cheneys’—the,Paragraph
revolutionary series of Prairie Houses (more than fifty in all),Paragraph
"through which he advanced his program for a new, distinctively",Paragraph
American form of domestic habitation. In Wright’s recasting of the,Paragraph
"modern home, the routines of everyday life were exalted as sacred",Paragraph
"activities, dramatized by the altar-like dining tables that became as",Paragraph
much a hallmark of his interiors as his leaded-glass windows. More,Paragraph
than one potential Wright client surely felt that the architect’s,Paragraph
heedless and licentious behavior desecrated the temple of the family,Paragraph
and made a mockery of the idealistic values that he purported his,Paragraph
designs would reinforce. Mamah Borthwick was a follower of Ellen,Paragraph
"Key, the Swedish feminist and advocate of free love, and as such",Paragraph
saw her own belated rejection of married life and child-rearing as an,Paragraph
"act of high philosophical principle, not an insolent flouting of",Paragraph
bourgeois hypocrisy.,Paragraph
"After Wright and Borthwick returned from Europe, they sought",Paragraph
"refuge in the Wisconsin farming valley where he grew up, a place",Paragraph
where they could be away from the prying eyes of Oak Park,Paragraph
neighbors who knew both aggrieved spouses whom the,Paragraph
transgressors had left behind. Protected within his extended family’s,Paragraph
"arcadian stronghold, Wright concealed the scope of his plans for a",Paragraph
new dream house there. He disingenuously claimed that Taliesin,Paragraph
"(see Illustration 2b), which was named after a mythic Welsh bard,",Paragraph
would be no more than a “bungalow:” a false-modest misnomer as,Paragraph
laughable as a Newport Gilded Age “cottage.” His most inspired,Paragraph
design decision was Taliesin’s siting: not atop a hill but nestled into,Paragraph
"the crest of a hillside, in keeping with his belief that a truly organic",Paragraph
architecture must be subservient to nature. The expansive Taliesin,Paragraph
"complex—a serene Japanesque interplay of long, low-slung wings",Paragraph
shaded by broadly overhanging roofs and interspersed with terraced,Paragraph
courtyards—accorded with no one’s notion of a tawdry love nest.,Paragraph
"Then, with Wright absent, at lunchtime one Saturday in August",Paragraph

Wright employees lay dead. It is impossible to outdo Wright’s own,Paragraph
"words on the tragedy, in the open letter he wrote to acknowledge",Paragraph

"DESPITE THE INHERENTLY SOCial nature of architecture and city planning,",Paragraph
personal histories of master builders were uncommon before the last,Paragraph

Wright’s sweeping self-portrait as a heroic individualist served as,Paragraph

"architect and urbanist born Charles-Edouard Jeanneret in 1887,",Paragraph
twenty years after Wright.,Paragraph
Le Corbusier was one of Wright’s few competitors who matched,Paragraph
his flair for self-promotion (Buckminster Fuller was another).,Paragraph
"However, Le Corbusier’s posthumous influence has outstripped that",Paragraph
of the greatest American architect. The European’s schemes were,Paragraph
often less specific to their sites than Wright’s and thus more,Paragraph
adaptable elsewhere (and everywhere). Le Corbusier’s work in South,Paragraph
America and India won him a third-world following that Wright,Paragraph
never attracted. And his “Five Points of a New Architecture” of 1926,Paragraph
became a modern “must” list that could be copied by almost,Paragraph
"anyone, anywhere. Those veritable commandments included thin",Paragraph
piloti columns on which buildings could be supported; ribbon,Paragraph
windows; open floor plans; facades freed from load-bearing,Caption
structure; and roof gardens. Such formularization was also central to,Paragraph
"the steel-skeleton, glass-skin high-rise format later perfected by",Paragraph
"another contemporary, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, but his schemata",Paragraph
did not offer the rich recombinations possible with the “Five,Paragraph
Points.”,Paragraph
"During Le Corbusier’s lifetime, his reputation did not derive solely",Paragraph
"from his vast corpus of designs, which still astonishes in its",Paragraph
inventiveness and boundless implications. His renown was,Paragraph
enormously enhanced by the more than fifty books and pamphlets,Paragraph
through which he promulgated his radical vision of a new building,Paragraph
art for the modern age—everything from city planning to interior,Title
"design. For example, to replace the tightly knit, medium-rise urban",Paragraph
"neighborhoods he deemed insalubrious and oppressive, Le Corbusier",Paragraph
proposed residential skyscrapers widely spaced amid parks and,Paragraph
"highways. Like his closest present-day equivalent, Rem Koolhaas, he",Paragraph
had a size fetish and made headlines during his 1935 trip to,Paragraph
America when he complained that New York’s skyscrapers were not,Paragraph
"big enough. He was also fascinated with modern ocean liners, which",Paragraph
"helped shape his conception of large-scale residential schemes,",Paragraph
specifically the six Unité d’Habitation apartment developments he,Paragraph
built in France and West Berlin during his final two decades. To,Paragraph
modernize domestic interiors cluttered with ornate furnishings and,Paragraph
"cocooned in fabric, he advocated rooms as sparse and easy to clean",Paragraph
as a tuberculosis ward. And rather than reiterating the dull gray,Paragraph
"masonry of northern European cityscapes, he favored the gleaming",Paragraph
"white stucco of Mediterranean villages, regardless of that material’s",Paragraph
climatic suitability.,Paragraph
Le Corbusier was electrified by the feedback he got when he,Paragraph
"expounded his controversial proposals in public, whether to general",Paragraph
"audiences, university students, or fellow practitioners. His need for",Paragraph
attention—the source of which was finally established by Nicholas,Paragraph
"Fox Weber in Le Corbusier: A Life (2008), the first full-length",Paragraph
biography of the architect—was fed by the heavy schedule of,Paragraph
speaking engagements he kept up for decades. He also attended,Paragraph
many of the symposia convened by supporters of modern,Paragraph
architecture to hash out their theories and establish a unified,Paragraph
"agenda. Those meetings could be contentious, for what we now call",Paragraph
the Modern Movement was in fact an unruly scrum of competing,Paragraph
factions with doctrinaire positions that often divided an allegedly,Paragraph
common cause.,Paragraph
"Most architects give lectures primarily to advertise themselves,",Paragraph
and Le Corbusier was no more shy than his colleagues in basing his,Paragraph
talks on his own work. What set his public appearances apart was,Paragraph
the way they prompted him to reexamine fundamental concepts—,Paragraph
from the organization of metropolitan transport to the layout of the,Paragraph
working-man’s house—as much for himself as for his listeners.,Paragraph
"Whatever his announced topic, he emphasized a constant theme: his",Paragraph
specific version of Modernism held unique promise for elevating,Paragraph
mankind to unprecedented levels of bodily well-being and psychic,Paragraph
stimulation.,Paragraph
"Despite Le Corbusier’s interest in theory, his discourses were",Paragraph
"anything but cerebral abstractions, and conveyed a vigorous",Paragraph
physicality and joyous immediacy thanks to the method through,Paragraph
which he illustrated his thoughts. His visual aids were low-tech yet,Paragraph
"high-impact. On the wall behind him, the architect would unroll and",Paragraph
pin up a swath of yellow tracing paper as wide as a movie screen.,Paragraph
"While he spoke, he used varicolored chalks or crayons and sketched",Paragraph
"a profusion of pictograms, scrawled a welter of catchphrases, and",Paragraph
"ended up with a dense calligraphic mural, like a Cy Twombly",Paragraph
drawing avant la lettre. Many Le Corbusier lecture backdrops,Paragraph
"survive, intact or in tatters, thanks to souvenir hunters who",Paragraph
swooped in and claimed them the second he exited the stage.,Paragraph
"As is true of most other avant-garde architects, Le Corbusier",Paragraph
established his reputation through private residences commissioned,Paragraph
by enlightened clients brave enough to support the unconventional,Paragraph
ideas of a young and largely untested designer. Of singular,Paragraph
"importance are the houses of the architect’s so-called Heroic Period,",Paragraph
created between 1920 and 1930 in collaboration with Pierre,Paragraph
"Jeanneret, his cousin and early partner. These nineteen schemes",Paragraph
(fifteen of them executed) for sites in or near Paris were starkly,Paragraph
"unornamented, defiantly uningratiating structures that when new",Paragraph
reminded many of factories. Le Corbusier took this analogy as a,Paragraph
compliment and duly dubbed his new domestic conception the,Paragraph
"machine a habiter—“machine for living in.” Today, these houses",Paragraph
"accord with popular notions of Bauhaus architecture, even though",Paragraph
Le Corbusier had no official or even direct connection to that,Paragraph
German design school.,Paragraph
The evolution of the Heroic Period houses shows how the,Paragraph
designers extracted a remarkable array of compositional variations,Paragraph
"from a narrow repertoire of forms (right-angled volumes, flat roofs,",Paragraph
windows flush with wall planes) and a limited palette of materials—,Paragraph
"white-painted stucco, glass, and metal. Le Corbusier and Jeanneret",Caption
were able to do so much with so little mainly because of the,Paragraph
"former’s genius for reconceiving space in novel ways, a gift he came",Paragraph
into full possession of during this determinative decade. The climax,Paragraph
of the cousins’ astonishing residential sequence was the Villa Savoye,Paragraph
"of 1928-1931 in Poissy, in my estimation, and that of many others,",Paragraph
the ultimate twentieth-century house. Its vivifying counterpoint of,Paragraph
geometric rigor (through the ancient proportional system known as,Paragraph
the Golden Section) and spatial propulsion (through dynamic ramps,Paragraph
in place of stairs) makes the structure exhilarating to move through,Paragraph
every step of the way from front door to roof terrace. By the time,Paragraph
"this job was finished, the architects likely realized that they had",Paragraph
pretty much exhausted their revolutionary formula and could only,Paragraph
repeat themselves if they stuck with it.,Paragraph
"Soon after the completion of the Villa Savoye, Le Corbusier began",Paragraph
to move away from industrial perfectionism and toward its polar,Paragraph
"opposite in a nascent Neoprimitive style, which emerged with his",Paragraph
introduction of rough stone walls in several country houses of the,Paragraph
"1930s, further evidenced itself in the raw concrete and vigorous",Paragraph
modeling of his Pavillon Suisse of 1930-1933 at the Cité,Caption
"Internationale Universitaire in Paris, and culminated with his",Paragraph
gloriously antirational Ronchamp chapel two decades afterward.,Paragraph
Though he abandoned the mechanistic approach of his Heroic,Paragraph
"Period, the Corbusian vocabulary would become so pervasive that",Paragraph
its author’s main contribution might be seen as his codification of,Paragraph
the closest to a true lingua franca that ever emerged from the babel,Paragraph
we call modern architecture.,Paragraph
Although it was one thing for Le Corbusier to collaborate with,Paragraph
"Jeanneret, it was quite another for him to collaborate with the",Paragraph
"Nazis. Years before France fell in 1940, Hitler’s animus toward",Paragraph
modern architecture had spurred a_ steady emigration of,Paragraph

"chief, visited Paris to oversee his design for the Third Reich’s",Paragraph
"pavilion at the 1937 International Exposition, a prophetic precursor",Paragraph
of a more pervasive German presence in France three years later.,Paragraph
"After the war, the Nazi master builder acknowledged being familiar",Paragraph
"with Le Corbusier’s work, which perhaps informed his",Paragraph
megalomaniacal plans to rebuild Berlin on a scale similar to that,Paragraph
which Le Corbusier had envisioned for Paris. But Speer’s Stripped,Paragraph
Classicism and Le Corbusier’s Minimalist Modernism were far too,Paragraph
"disparate in essence to allow for any middle ground. Le Corbusier,",Paragraph
oblivious (for once) to his international identity as a vociferous,Paragraph
"champion of the very architecture Hitler despised, somehow",Paragraph
imagined he could find a position with Marshal Pétain’s,Paragraph
collaborationist government. The architect moved to the provisional,Paragraph
"capital of Vichy, where he assiduously lobbied for work. He was",Paragraph
fortunate to have failed for the most part (although the French,Paragraph
architectural historian Jean-Louis Cohen has uncovered disturbing,Paragraph
evidence that Le Corbusier designed more for the Vichy regime than,Paragraph
"had been previously understood), which made it that much easier to",Paragraph

Polarization of critical opinion in Britain on this widely imitated,Paragraph

including the historian Colin Rowe’s hugely influential treatise “The,Paragraph

also determined not to be known well. He never added an,Paragraph

"However, one thing everyone knew about him was his relentless",Paragraph
"Protestant work ethic, befitting the son of a Calvinist watchmaker.",Paragraph
But as Nicholas Fox Weber persuasively argues in his revelatory and,Paragraph
"absorbing Le Corbusier: A Life, the architect was driven by",Paragraph
motivations more primal than compulsive Swiss industriousness.,Paragraph
Weber gets to the heart of the matter by employing Le Corbusier’s,Paragraph
own words to document his ceaseless struggle to win the love and,Paragraph
"affirmation of his mother, Marie Charlotte Amélie Jeanneret, née",Paragraph
Perret (no relation to the Belgian-born architects Auguste and,Paragraph
"Gustave Perret, with whom Le Corbusier apprenticed).",Paragraph
"Mme Jeanneret, a music teacher, openly preferred her older son,",Paragraph

his parents.,Paragraph
This previously unknown factor in the architect’s psychic makeup,Paragraph
—his intense mother fixation—is a discovery of immense,Paragraph
"importance, and Weber is right to give it a prominent place in his",Paragraph
well-paced and judiciously balanced narrative. He is also correct to,Paragraph
avoid simplistic psychological diagnoses and let the primary,Paragraph
evidence speak for itself. The results are so convincing that even,Paragraph
without knowing the full contents of the architect’s archive it seems,Paragraph
safe to say that Weber did an extraordinary job of surveying the,Paragraph
long-sequestered papers and charting a plausible map of the inner,Paragraph
man. He was the first writer granted unrestricted access to Le,Paragraph

"remains unwaveringly sympathetic, often in the face of quite",Paragraph
unpleasant evidence.,Paragraph
Yet he also indicates why the Fondation Le Corbusier delayed a,Paragraph
full biographical accounting for such a scandalously long time. The,Paragraph
architect constructed a public persona of hyperrational control and,Paragraph
"glacial indifference, which some have seen reflected in the",Paragraph
inhumane streak suggested by his drastic urban renewal schemes,Paragraph

much of Paris’s Right Bank) and unreciprocated Nazi sympathies.,Paragraph
"But the infantile tone of his letters to his mother—by turns fawning,",Paragraph

and every bit as selfish and manipulative as the ghastly matriarch,Paragraph
herself—exposes his appalling lack of empathy for anyone but,Paragraph
himself and the mother whom he could neither separate from nor,Paragraph
win over.,Paragraph
Weber goes so far as to assert that Le Corbusier’s most acclaimed,Paragraph
postwar work—the pilgrimage church of Notre-Dame-du-Haut of,Paragraph

though it struck some as premature to hold full-scale Bauhaus shows,Paragraph

certainly time for a long-overdue reassessment of this persistently,Paragraph
stereotyped and often maligned powerhouse of modern culture. For,Paragraph
"example, one lingering popular fixation is the very notion of",Paragraph
"“Bauhaus architecture,” which has become a reflexive misnomer for",Paragraph
pared-down Modernist building design. Many of the leading figures,Paragraph

the slightly earlier Berlin extravaganza.,Paragraph

"the Bauhaus in its departmental organization, and likewise",Paragraph
incorporated mediums overlooked by other museums before its,Paragraph
"founding in 1929, especially photography and film (and, for a while,",Paragraph
"dance). From the outset, MoMA followed the Bauhaus’s strict",Paragraph
prohibition against design that even hinted at the decorative (most,Paragraph
"notably Art Deco), a prejudice that skewed the pioneering museum’s",Paragraph
view of Modernism for decades. Thus it was fortunate for MoMA,Paragraph
that its “Bauhaus 1919-1933: Workshops for Modernity” was,Paragraph
"organized by Barry Bergdoll, its open-minded and historically astute",Paragraph

Expressionist output of the Bauhaus in the years immediately,Paragraph
following its founding. This introductory space offered an eye-,Paragraph
opening experience for those familiar only with the cliché of the,Paragraph
Bauhaus as a soulless assembly line of mechanistic design. The,Paragraph

a direct outgrowth of the universal craving for regeneration that,Paragraph
"arose after the Great War, an apocalypse of unmitigated horror. The",Paragraph

warfare.,Paragraph
"The primal image of the Bauhaus, which appeared on the front of",Paragraph
Gropius’s four-page prospectus of 1919—commonly called the,Paragraph
Bauhaus Manifesto—was Lyonel Feininger’s angular black-and-white,Paragraph
"woodcut of a crystalline church, its three spires topped not with",Paragraph
crosses but with five-pointed stars radiating beams of light in all,Paragraph
"directions. This imaginary structure, as much lighthouse as",Paragraph
"sanctuary, was intended to evoke not specifically religious",Paragraph
sentiments but rather the uplifting and unifying spirit of the great,Paragraph
"cathedral-building enterprises of the Middle Ages, which lasted",Paragraph
"decades, sometimes centuries, and brought a town’s entire citizenry,",Paragraph
"of all ranks and occupations, together in one high communal cause.",Paragraph
Hopes for an analogous modern equivalent were a crucial part of,Paragraph
the early Bauhaus ethos.,Paragraph
Emblematic of the Weimar school’s Expressionist phase is the,Paragraph
"African (or Romantic) chair of 1921, a collaboration between",Paragraph
"Marcel Breuer, who was both an architect and a furniture designer,",Paragraph
"and the weaver Gunta Stélzl. (Though much published, the object",Paragraph
"itself, long thought to be lost, suddenly resurfaced when its owner",Paragraph
showed up unannounced with the miraculously preserved relic in,Paragraph
"the trunk of his car at Berlin’s Bauhaus Archive, which acquired it in",Paragraph
2004 with funds from the Ernst von Siemens Art Foundation.),Paragraph
Breuer and Stdlzl’s vigorously Neoprimitive scheme—a framework,Paragraph
of carved wood painted in striped earth tones and upholstered with,Paragraph
boldly patterned brocade—trises to a pointed arch behind the head,Caption
"of the sitter. It might be a Benin royal throne, even though such",Paragraph
high-backed forms are uncharacteristic of sub-Saharan ritual,Paragraph
furniture. This imposingly hieratic piece appears all the more,Paragraph
surprising when one considers that Breuer is best known for that,Paragraph
"ubiquitous standard of twentieth-century seating, his Cesca chair of",Paragraph
"1928, with its continuous S-curve of bent metal tubing and",Paragraph
contrasting seat and back of natural-colored caning. There could be,Paragraph
no more telling embodiment of the fundamental _ stylistic,Title
transformation of the Bauhaus from Expressionism to Functionalism,Title
than Breuer and Stélzl’s wildly irrational African chair set alongside,Paragraph
his coolly industrial Cesca model.,Paragraph
"Stdlzl, the sole woman to be named master of a Bauhaus",Paragraph
workshop but today far less well remembered than her younger,Paragraph
"weaving colleague Anni Albers, was the rare exception to the",Paragraph
constraints imposed on the school’s supposedly liberated female,Paragraph
faculty and students. The Bauhaus at first was intended to be,Paragraph
gender-blind. But the chauvinistic and essentially conservative,Paragraph
Gropius became alarmed by what he saw as the excessive number of,Paragraph
women in a student body that never numbered more than 150,Title
"matriculants at any given moment, which prompted him to steer",Paragraph
women away from the supposedly “masculine” architecture,Title
curriculum and toward the traditionally “feminine” crafts,Title
"workshops. All the same, personal relationships of all degrees of",Paragraph
intimacy blossomed in the hothouse atmosphere of a school that,Paragraph
self-consciously stood apart from its provincial and traditional social,Paragraph
surroundings in both Weimar and Dessau. The Jewish Anni Albers,Paragraph
(née Annelise Fleischmann) and her decade-older Roman Catholic,Paragraph
"husband, Josef, a student-turned-instructor associated with the",Paragraph
"Bauhaus longer than any of his contemporaries, met and married",Paragraph
"while at the school, the most famous of many such Bauhaus liaisons,",Paragraph
both official and informal.,Paragraph
What made the Bauhaus such a truly revolutionary undertaking,Paragraph
was not so much its departure from prevailing social and aesthetic,Paragraph
norms—most notably its rejection of historical styles—but rather its,Paragraph
systematic recasting of the way in which the fine and applied arts,Paragraph
"were taught. During the nineteenth century, the rapid emergence",Paragraph
and proliferation of new manufacturing methods and building,Title
technologies led to the establishment of polytechnic schools that,Paragraph
concentrated on the practicalities of engineering and construction,Paragraph
rather than the niceties of stylistic correctness or adherence to,Paragraph
established precedent. In the decades just before the Bauhaus was,Paragraph
"founded, there were a few piecemeal attempts to reform some of the",Paragraph
German and Austrian crafts schools established during the age of,Paragraph
industrialization. Typical of these breakaway groups was the Wiener,Paragraph
"Werkstatte (Viennese Workshop), founded in 1903, which",Paragraph
emphasized the fabrication of decorative objects to be sold through,Paragraph
its own retail outlets.,Paragraph
The Bauhaus’s immediate precursor was the Grand-Ducal School,Paragraph
"of Arts and Crafts, established in Weimar by the state of Thuringia",Paragraph
in 1905 under the direction of the Belgian architect Henry van de,Paragraph
Velde. During World War I van de Velde was compelled to resign as,Paragraph
"an enemy alien but recommended as his successor Walter Gropius,",Paragraph
who insisted on sweeping changes when he took over in 1919 and,Paragraph
effectively created a new institution. The hallmark innovation of the,Paragraph
"Bauhaus was the Vorkurs (preliminary course), a_ required",Paragraph
introductory class that provided intensive back-to-basics immersion,Paragraph
"in the fundamentals of color theory and composition, with an",Paragraph
emphasis on the arrangement of tonalities to achieve specific optical,Paragraph
"effects, and on recombinations of pure geometric forms as the",Paragraph
elemental building blocks of design. The Vorkurs was conceived and,Paragraph
"initially taught by Johannes Itten, the extravagantly eccentric,",Paragraph
mystically inclined Swiss Expressionist painter whom Gropius hired,Paragraph
"as “form master” for the school’s metalwork, sculpture, wall-",Paragraph
"painting, weaving, and woodworking workshops.",Paragraph
"An oddball even for a radical art school, Itten sported medieval-",Paragraph
"style robes and sandals, shaved his head, and consumed copious",Paragraph
"quantities of garlic. That dietary habit was a precept of Mazdaznan,",Paragraph
"the esoteric philosophy Itten followed, a hodgepodge of Zoroastrian,",Paragraph
"Theosophical, and Christian beliefs, part New Age religion, part",Title
"yogic health regimen. Itten, by any measure a luftmensch, was the",Paragraph
"id to the superego of Gropius, whose skills as an administrator and",Paragraph
persona of high-bourgeois propriety were the polar opposites of his,Paragraph
otherworldly subordinate’s meditative nature and bohemian,Title
affectations. Together this ill-assorted couple expressed both sides of,Paragraph
"the Bauhaus’s bifurcated nature, at once utopian and pragmatic,",Paragraph
"intuitive and scientific, highly ordered and subversively anarchic.",Paragraph
Encapsulating that duality is Itten’s 1921 lithograph Color Sphere,Paragraph
in 7 Light Values and 12 Tones. The Bauhdusler (as the school’s,Paragraph
faculty and students were called) adored charts and diagrams of all,Paragraph
"sorts, and Itten’s construct suggests both a Buddhist mandala and",Paragraph
the periodic table of elements. The upper three quarters of Color,Paragraph
"Sphere are dominated by a twelve-point, multicolor star inscribed",Paragraph
"within seven concentric circles, flattened like an orthographic",Paragraph
projection of the globe. The bottommost portion of this two-part,Paragraph
composition is devoted to a grid of rectangles arranged in the color,Paragraph
"order of the light spectrum, from violet at one end to red at the",Paragraph
other. Several other Bauhaus artists produced works based on grid,Paragraph
themes that clearly originated with concepts embodied in this visual,Paragraph
"aid, including Josef Albers’s colored-glass, metal-framed Gitterbilder",Paragraph
(lattice pictures) and Paul Klee’s mosaic-like paintings. That,Paragraph
congruence seems especially noteworthy since both men went on to,Paragraph
teach the Vorkurs after Itten left the school in 1923 in protest over,Paragraph
Gropius’s new determination to focus on the production of,Paragraph
commercial prototypes rather than purely theoretical design.,Paragraph
Gropius did possess a definite knack for spotting talents superior,Paragraph
"to his own, and he was also a veritable weathervane of shifting",Paragraph
trends. He abandoned the machine aesthetic of his and Adolf,Paragraph
Meyer’s critically acclaimed demonstration factory and office,Title
building at the 1914 Deutscher Werkbund exhibition in Cologne to,Paragraph
take up Expressionism when that became the new direction in the,Paragraph
shell-shocked aftermath of the Great War. The Bauhaus was but,Paragraph
three years old when Gropius sensed that Expressionism was in turn,Paragraph
"becoming démodé, and he was ready to change direction once",Paragraph
"again. In 1922, Kandinsky arrived from Moscow at the Bauhaus,",Paragraph
"where a year later he was joined by Moholy-Nagy, and together they",Paragraph
exerted a tremendous impact on the school.,Paragraph
"No Bauhdusler has been more underestimated than Moholy-Nagy,",Paragraph
"who, although hardly forgotten in art circles, has never received the",Paragraph
wide recognition enjoyed by many of his lesser contemporaries.,Paragraph
Today he is best remembered for his experimental photographs of,Paragraph
"the 1920s. Since the inception of photography, artists had been",Paragraph
attempting to use this archetypically modern medium to achieve,Paragraph
"effects that would validate it as the equal of painting, a quest",Paragraph
epitomized by Edward Steichen’s heavily handworked and painterly,Paragraph
"Imagist landscape photos of the early 1900s. Conversely, Moholy-",Paragraph
Nagy rejected prevalent pictorial conventions in photography and,Paragraph
began to use the as yet underexploited mechanical potential of the,Paragraph
medium to “paint” abstractions directly on film instead of trying to,Paragraph
capture nature through a lens at a distance. In doing so he extended,Paragraph
the nineteenth-century practice of photographing objects on flat,Paragraph
"surfaces, as William Henry Fox Talbot did with pieces of lace and",Paragraph
"Anna Atkins with botanical specimens, a camera-less method in",Paragraph
which objects were placed on light-sensitive paper and exposed in,Paragraph
silhouette.,Paragraph
"Moholy-Nagy’s most innovative efforts, which he called",Paragraph
"photograms (a term he did not invent but gave currency to), were",Paragraph
often printed in the white-on-black tones of a negative and thus,Paragraph
"evinced the ghostly aura and scientific exactitude of the X-ray,",Paragraph
which had been perfected by the German physicist Wilhelm Réntgen,Paragraph
in 1895 with his famous skeletal study of his wife’s hand. Along,Paragraph
"with a great many silhouetted everyday objects, both instantly",Paragraph
"recognizable and puzzlingly abstract, human hands figure in several",Paragraph
of Moholy-Nagy’s photograms. But rather than summoning up,Paragraph
medical associations they strike an atavistic note not unlike,Paragraph
handprints in prehistoric cave paintings. Expressive manipulation of,Paragraph
photographic imagery—including the composite pictures called,Paragraph
photomontages—entered a brave new world thanks to Moholy-,Paragraph
"Nagy, who was also a provocateur in other mediums. His dazzling",Paragraph
"kinetic sculpture Light Prop for an Electric Stage (1930), a perforated-",Paragraph
"metal rotating device of ambiguous, almost Duchampian symbolism,",Paragraph
was photographed by its maker in countless sequential variations.,Paragraph
The kaleidoscopic array of illuminations and shadows that Light Prop,Paragraph
splashes onto every surface of the space in which it is displayed,Paragraph
demonstrates how Moholy-Nagy extended the potential of sculpture,Paragraph
in ways no less audacious than those he deployed in his deeply,Paragraph
penetrating photograms.,Paragraph
The Bauhaus was preternaturally modern in its grasp of the power,Paragraph
"of publicity, both visual and textual. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the",Paragraph
"last of the school’s three directors, took a competitive jab at the first",Paragraph
when he asserted that “the best thing Gropius has done was to,Paragraph
invent the name Bauhaus.” Mies was right about the extraordinary,Paragraph
"resonance of that inspired coinage, which conjoined the",Paragraph
monosyllabic root of the German verb bauen (“to build”) with the,Paragraph
"noun Haus, homophone of cognates in both English and Dutch,",Paragraph
which gave the neologism a snappy assonance as well as intimations,Paragraph
of universality. The term also harked back to Bauhiitte (“building,Paragraph
"hut”), the mason’s lodge from which the raising of medieval",Paragraph
"cathedrals was overseen. However, the very word “Bauhaus”",Paragraph
"became a red flag to the National Socialists, and within months of",Paragraph
Hitler becoming chancellor in 1933 acquiescent local authorities,Title
shut the school as a suspected hotbed of Kulturbolschewismus,Paragraph
"(cultural Bolshevism). Mies, an expert of compliant realpolitik, went",Paragraph
"as a supplicant to Alfred Rosenberg, the noxious Nazi ideologue, and",Paragraph
begged that the Bauhaus be reopened. Rosenberg exasperatedly,Paragraph
"remonstrated, “Why didn’t you change the name, for heaven’s",Paragraph
sake?”,Paragraph
The second-best thing Gropius did was to design the Bauhaus,Paragraph
building of 1925-1926 in Dessau (see Illustration 4b). Although not,Paragraph
"quite a great work of architecture, it nonetheless was a first-rate",Paragraph
advertising tool. Following the lead of Le Corbusier’s Purist designs,Paragraph
"of the early 1920s, Gropius reverted to his former industrial",Paragraph
"aesthetic and gave the Bauhaus headquarters a sleek, stripped-for-",Paragraph
action look that melded the efficiency of a factory with the,Paragraph
"cleanliness of a laboratory, neither quality associated with",Paragraph
traditional art schools. Gropius’s scheme flaunted two bravura,Paragraph
effects—the diaphanous glass-curtain wall of the workshop block,Caption
"and the two-story, ribbon-windowed bridge that spanned a roadway",Paragraph
to link two wings—but the design was nowhere nearly as striking as,Paragraph
Le Corbusier’s alchemies of volume and space. This pair of dramatic,Paragraph
"gestures aside, Gropius’s Dessau building seemed to anticipate the",Paragraph
no-nonsense sobriety that would infuse the Bauhaus under his,Paragraph
"successor, the Swiss architect Hannes Meyer, whom Gropius",Paragraph
"engaged to head the school’s architecture program in 1927, and who",Paragraph
assumed the top job a year later.,Paragraph
A committed Communist with close ties to architects in the Soviet,Paragraph
Union—where the exuberant experimentation of the early Russian,Paragraph
"Constructivists was waning, soon to be superseded by the",Paragraph
Classicizing conformity of ascendant Stalinist neoconservatives—,Paragraph
Meyer faced growing opposition from the increasingly right-wing,Paragraph
"government of Dessau, which funded the Bauhaus. He was forced to",Paragraph
"resign in 1930, but not before he inculcated some decidedly Soviet",Paragraph
"notions into the Bauhaus ethos, most notably the Existenzminimum,",Paragraph
"or minimum means for existence, which had a decisive influence on",Paragraph
social-housing design in Germany and elsewhere. It is thus,Paragraph
important to remember that it was only under Meyer’s two-year,Paragraph
directorship that this extreme utilitarian functionalism (a concept he,Paragraph
took from 1920s Soviet housing and planning) prevailed at the,Paragraph
"Bauhaus, a brief, joyless interlude that has loomed larger in",Paragraph
historical hindsight than it ought to.,Paragraph
"A more life-affirming presence at the Bauhaus was Kandinsky, a",Paragraph
"master who exerted a powerful influence on his fellow Bauhdusler,",Paragraph
and who in turn absorbed the equally potent influence of other,Paragraph
"giants among them, most notably Klee. A 2009 Kandinsky survey at",Paragraph
New York’s Guggenheim Museum offered the additional thrill of,Paragraph
experiencing Frank Lloyd Wright’s last masterpiece abrim with,Paragraph
precisely the kind of art for which this institution—originally named,Paragraph
the Museum of Non-Objective Painting—was created. As one stood,Paragraph
at the low parapet that edges the museum’s helical ramp and looked,Paragraph
"across Wright’s monumental rotunda, the pulsating colors and",Paragraph
hyperactive forms of Kandinsky’s canvases seemed to ricochet all,Paragraph
around a void that had never seemed more alive. The Guggenheim,Paragraph
"possesses one of the three greatest Kandinsky collections, rivaled",Paragraph
only by those of the Lenbachhaus in Munich and the Pompidou,Paragraph
"Center in Paris. With its approximately 250 Kandinskys, the",Paragraph
Guggenheim could have readily mounted a full-scale retrospective,Paragraph
"without borrowing a single item. One loan in the 2009 show, from",Paragraph
"the Beyeler Foundation in Switzerland, was unusually poignant:",Paragraph
"Kandinsky’s lyrical oil-on-canvas abstraction Fugue (1914), back in",Paragraph
New York nineteen years after the Guggenheim sold it for $20.9,Paragraph
"million, to help pay for its acquisition of the Panza di Biumo",Paragraph
"collection of Minimalist and Conceptual art, a trade-off that rightly",Paragraph
provoked howls of protest.,Paragraph
Kandinsky is often deemed the father of abstraction—art that is,Paragraph
nonrepresentational and evokes a mood or state of mind rather than,Paragraph
actual objects. This transformation was announced by his Untitled,Paragraph
"(First Abstract Watercolor) of 1910, now in the Pompidou Center.",Caption
This pivotal work—a buoyant overall pattern of multicolored,Paragraph
splotches and calligraphic squiggles—was made three years after,Paragraph
Picasso’s seminal Demoiselles d’Avignon. The basic difference,Paragraph
between these respective breakthroughs was that Picasso’s oil,Paragraph
painting remained essentially representational no matter how,Paragraph
"stylized or distorted his means of depiction, whereas Kandinsky",Paragraph
never returned to the overt folkloric subjects and landscapes that he,Paragraph
"had once favored—his alpine views, cavorting peasants, and riders",Paragraph
on horseback deliquesced into the electrifying ether of his mature,Paragraph
pictures (although the art historian Rose-Carol Washton Long has,Paragraph
pointed out Kandinsky’s “veiling” of thematic subject matter that,Paragraph
may seem abstract on the surface).,Paragraph
"Around the time that Kandinsky began teaching in Weimar, his",Paragraph
paintings became more geometrically precise and formally,Paragraph
calculated in ways that often seem at odds with the breathtaking,Paragraph
"fluency of his early abstractions, a tightened organizational",Paragraph
tendency that only increased during his Bauhaus years. Several,Paragraph
Kandinskys from that period indicate the magnetic pull of Klee on,Paragraph
"his Russian colleague, especially several works on paper in which",Paragraph
the latter incorporated mosaic-like checkerboard patterns often,Paragraph
employed in Klee’s work. Kandinsky’s 1929 oil-on-Masonite Levels,Paragraph
(EtagenJ—now in the Guggenheim  collection—is likewise,Paragraph
reminiscent of Klee in its juxtaposition of a white rectilinear,Paragraph
armature that suggests the splayed arms of a high-tension power,Paragraph
"pole, interspersed with playful geometric pictograms against a solid",Paragraph
Prussian-blue background.,Paragraph
One of the most insightful considerations of Kandinsky was,Paragraph
"presented by the art historian John Golding in a 1997 lecture,",Paragraph
"“Kandinsky and the Sound of Colour,” later collected in his",Paragraph
magisterial Paths to the Absolute (2000). As Golding writes:,Paragraph
Kandinsky had originally sensed the potential of a purely,Paragraph
abstract art through his belief in the “musicalization” of,Paragraph
"painting, although he had insisted from the start that he had no",Paragraph
desire to paint musical pictures. He had soon come to feel that,Paragraph
the achievements of painting could surpass those of music.... In,Paragraph
doing so he was bringing to fruition a long line of enquiry,Paragraph
going back more than a century.,Paragraph
This conviction echoed the obsession of early Modernists in all fields,Paragraph
who sought to break down the barriers between mediums through,Paragraph
synesthesia—“hearing” color or “seeing” sound—in order to create a,Paragraph
"Gesamtkunstwerk, or total work of art. That endeavor was at the very",Paragraph
"heart of the Bauhaus project, which attempted to integrate the",Paragraph
entire spectrum of arts into one life-enhancing whole.,Paragraph
It is generally held that Modernism celebrates fragmentation and,Paragraph
opposes the continuity implicit in the Classical tradition. But despite,Paragraph
the frequent antics of the Bauhaus’s youthful adherents—the,Paragraph
"costume parties, the cabaret evenings, the Charleston contests, the",Paragraph
"jazz sessions, the kite festivals—these high-spirited college kids were",Paragraph
anything but lords (and ladies) of misrule. During the politically,Paragraph
"precarious but creatively fertile years of the Weimar Republic, the",Paragraph
"Bauhdusler gathered under one roof to learn, practice, and teach arts",Paragraph
as ancient as weaving and as novel as photography with utter,Paragraph
seriousness and optimistic conviction. By viewing all mediums with,Paragraph
"fresh eyes, they made the old new again, and the new timeless as",Paragraph
"never before, proven by the myriad works that can still astound us",Paragraph
almost a century after the Bauhaus set the arts in perpetual motion.,Paragraph
ERNST MAY AND,Title
MARGARETE SCHUTTE-LIHOTZKY,Title
tHErE is No Sadder tale in the annals of architecture than the virtual,Paragraph
disappearance in recent decades of the defining architectural form,Paragraph
of the early Modern Movement—publicly sponsored housing. The,Paragraph
provision of decent dwellings for all people was a cardinal tenet of,Paragraph
the reform movements that arose throughout the industrialized,Paragraph
"world during the late nineteenth century, when new building",Paragraph
materials and construction techniques seemed to put that ideal,Paragraph
within the grasp of reality. Particularly after the cataclysm of World,Paragraph
War I and the resultant rise of social democratic governments in,Title
"Europe, large-scale housing programs were undertaken as a means",Paragraph
"of establishing political stability, promoting equality, and nurturing",Paragraph
a productive workforce.,Paragraph
"That dream has effectively vanished both abroad, where several",Paragraph
European nations have lately faced insolvency and have drastically,Paragraph
"cut government spending on social services, and in the United",Paragraph
"States, where public housing has long been demonized as a breeding",Paragraph
"ground for a vicious cycle of dependence, indolence, poverty, and",Paragraph
crime. The inspiring careers and enduringly livable designs of two,Paragraph
towering but still insufficiently recognized figures in modern,Paragraph
architecture—the German architect and city planner Ernst May and,Title
"one of his chief collaborators, the Austrian architect and interior",Paragraph
designer Margarete Schiitte-Lihotzky—represent the zenith of,Paragraph
socially responsible housing in the twentieth century. For five,Paragraph
"decades, from the 1920s until his death in 1970, May’s architecture",Paragraph
"had a strong influence in Germany, the Soviet Union, East Africa,",Paragraph
"and then Germany again, the three locales of a career shaped—some",Paragraph
would say distorted—by three of the twentieth century’s major,Paragraph
"political forces: communism, fascism, and colonialism.",Paragraph
May was born in Frankfurt am Main in 1886 (the same year as,Paragraph
Ludwig Mies van der Rohe). The son of a prosperous Protestant,Paragraph
"factory owner and a Jewish mother, he received his architectural",Paragraph
training at the Technische Hochschule in Munich. During a summer,Paragraph
break he worked for the British architect and town planner,Paragraph
"Raymond Unwin, who was then constructing Letchworth Garden",Paragraph
"City in Hertfordshire, the first development of its kind, founded in",Paragraph
"1903 by Ebenezer Howard, father of the Garden City Movement,",Caption
"which aimed to supplant congested, overgrown metropolises with",Paragraph
"far smaller, self-sufficient communities that brought their",Paragraph
inhabitants closer to their workplaces and nature through,Paragraph
environmentally aware site planning that emphasized open green,Paragraph
spaces. At Letchworth May was steeped in that housing-reform,Paragraph
"group’s ethos of urban decentralization, ecological conservation,",Paragraph
"communal land ownership, and humane scale. Though Germany had",Paragraph
its own vigorous offshoot of the Garden City Movement—,Paragraph
"exemplified by such New Towns as Theodor Fischer, Hermann",Paragraph
"Muthesius, Richard Riemerschmid, and Heinrich Tessenow’s",Paragraph
Hellerau near Dresden and Bruno Taut’s Falkenberg near Berlin—,Paragraph
May’s formative English experience is evident in the intelligent,Paragraph
layouts and sensitive landscaping of his mature work.,Paragraph
"He was conscripted into the German army during World War I,",Paragraph
"designed military cemeteries in Romania and France, and during the",Paragraph
last year of the conflict joined the Deutscher Werkbund (German,Paragraph
"Work Federation), the progressive design group founded in 1907 to",Paragraph
promote closer cooperation between designers and industry. In,Paragraph
"1919, under the Weimar Republic, May was named the technical",Paragraph
"director of the Schlesische Heimstatte (Silesian Homesteads), a",Paragraph
government home-building agency in the eastern German state of,Paragraph
"Silesia, where he oversaw construction of housing in a more",Paragraph
conservative architectural style than would soon be his practice. In,Paragraph
"1924 he joined Walter Gropius, Martin Wagner, and Taut in forming",Paragraph
a Kopfgemeinschaft (think tank) to address innovative housing,Paragraph
"solutions. A year later he was called to Frankfurt, where his",Paragraph
accomplishments were historic.,Paragraph
"Between 1925 and 1930, May, as the director of the city’s housing",Paragraph
"department, constructed twenty-three Frankfurt-region Siedlungen",Paragraph
"(settlements) that provided some 15,000 dwelling units, a",Paragraph
logistically astounding accomplishment. His closest rival in the,Paragraph
"quantity and quality of that output was Taut, who during the",Paragraph
"Weimar years built about 10,000 units in and around Berlin.",Paragraph
Although these housing estates were financed by a variety of,Paragraph
"sponsors that included local municipalities, labor unions, and",Paragraph
"private building societies, they were substantially underwritten by",Paragraph
the national government following the enactment in 1924 of the,Paragraph
Hauszinnssteuer (house mortgage-interest tax) applied to private,Paragraph
residential structures built before World War I as a means of,Paragraph
equitably subsidizing desperately needed new housing. This,Paragraph
considerable income stimulated a huge increase in public residential,Paragraph
projects until the international market crash hit economically shaky,Paragraph
Germany with particular force at the end of that decade. In her,Paragraph
"classic survey Modern Housing (1932), the American urbanist",Paragraph
Catherine Bauer estimated that one in ten German families benefited,Paragraph
"from this nationwide initiative, among the proudest attainments of",Paragraph
"the often beleaguered and much maligned Weimar Republic, which",Paragraph
has frequently been caricatured as a cesspool of moral laxity and,Paragraph
"hedonistic decadence. According to Bauer, who was at the center of",Paragraph
similarly motivated but much less thoroughgoing initiatives in the,Paragraph
"United States at that time, this was “the most fruitful epoch of",Paragraph
modern housing which the world has yet to know.”,Paragraph
In contrast to such widely published contemporaneous showpieces,Paragraph
as Gropius’s Bauhaus of 1925-1926 in Dessau and Mies van der,Paragraph
Rohe’s German Pavilion of 1928-1929 at the Barcelona,Title
"International Exposition, May’s diffuse Frankfurt ensembles could",Paragraph
not be summarized in single photographic images and were best,Paragraph
comprehended through aerial views. That elevated perspective is,Paragraph
especially useful in appreciating the most admired of his housing,Paragraph
"projects, Romerstadt, in the suburb of Heddernheim, which like",Paragraph
others in this homesteading program was sited to plug gaps in the,Paragraph
"periphery of Frankfurt’s urban sprawl. R6merstadt combines long,",Paragraph
whiplash-like rows of three-to-five-story apartment blocks with,Paragraph
"semidetached and terraced private houses, all interspersed with",Paragraph
"playgrounds, sports fields, a primary school, and shops. That",Paragraph
graceful organic layout feels notably different from the geometric,Paragraph
handling of the central feature at May’s Bruchfeldstrasse Siedlung of,Paragraph
"1926-1927—1the so-called Zickzackhausen, with imposing flanks of",Paragraph
flats set at serrated ninety-degree angles—or the rigid ranks of,Paragraph
"parallel rectangular residential structures, called Zeilenbau (linear",Paragraph
"blocks), that predominate in some of his other Frankfurt",Paragraph
"developments, including Praunheim of 1926-1929 and Westhausen",Paragraph
of 1929-1931.,Paragraph
The ground plan of Rémerstadt follows and emphasizes the,Paragraph
undulating contours of the shallow Nidda River basin in which it is,Paragraph
"sited. To echo that flowing quality, both ends of the two main",Paragraph
"residential blocks terminate in rounded bays (see Illustration 5a), a",Paragraph
streamlined treatment that recalls the favorite motif of May’s,Paragraph
"contemporary Erich Mendelsohn, whose curvilinear tendencies",Paragraph
stand in marked contrast to the strict rectangularity of much early,Paragraph
Modernist architecture. A series of four rampart-like raised terraces,Paragraph
"overlooking the river valley are similarly sinuous, and mediate",Paragraph
between the housing units above and a fan-shaped field of narrow,Paragraph
"allotment gardens below, in which residents could grow their own",Paragraph
"vegetables and flowers, a participatory interaction with nature",Paragraph
prized in Garden City communities. Further softening the somewhat,Paragraph
"severe appearance of May’s unornamented architecture, the stucco",Paragraph
"facades at ROomerstadt were painted in harmonious earth tones, from",Paragraph
a delicate rose-beige to a deep terra-cotta. The cumulative effect was,Paragraph
quite different from the all-white exteriors that many now,Paragraph
"erroneously think were mandatory for Modernist workers’ housing,",Paragraph
a coloristic freedom that was taken to even greater heights of,Paragraph
"expression by May’s Kopfgemeinschaft colleague Taut, whose work in",Paragraph
Magdeburg and Berlin exhibited the most inventive use of,Paragraph
architectural pigmentation during the interwar period.,Paragraph
"But no matter how they were configured, May’s housing projects",Paragraph
invariably were oriented to optimize southern exposure. Following,Paragraph
"traditional Garden City planning principles, they were laid out to",Paragraph
free large internal portions of the site for shared open space. And,Paragraph
the problem that bedeviled the few Garden Cities ventured in the US,Paragraph
—what to do with the cars?—was moot in a setting where,Paragraph
automobile ownership was rare and tram lines provided cheap and,Paragraph
convenient transportation from these new outlying communities to,Paragraph
"jobs in the city center. Residents who had grown up in the cramped,",Paragraph
"dark, unhygienic quarters of Frankfurt’s medieval core found the",Paragraph
"idyllically landscaped new Siedlungen—spacious, sun-washed,",Paragraph
"sanitary, and salubrious—to be nothing less than a revelation. More",Paragraph
"than eight decades later they remain well-kept, attractive places to",Paragraph
live.,Paragraph
"To drum up broad support for his grand enterprise, May became",Paragraph
"an adept publicist. He put out a strikingly designed magazine, Das",Paragraph
"Neue Frankfurt, to chronicle his Siedlungen in particular and spread",Paragraph
"the gospel of Modernism in general. He lectured extensively,",Paragraph
"encouraged the publication of enticing picture-postcard series, set",Paragraph
up popular home-outfitting exhibitions to demonstrate and promote,Paragraph
"new building materials and labor-saving appliances, and used the",Paragraph
emergent medium of radio broadcasting to reach an even wider,Paragraph
"audience. More important, the charismatic May’s extraordinary",Paragraph
"administrative skills, political acumen, and dauntless willpower",Paragraph
enabled him to achieve much in little time at Frankfurt. He was,Paragraph
furthermore physically imposing: he stood nearly six foot three and,Paragraph
was feared by bureaucrats and his assistants alike for his,Paragraph
intimidating gaze.,Paragraph
“May the Magician” (as one awestruck employee dubbed him),Paragraph
stayed well informed about rising talents in the international,Paragraph
planning community. One of his smartest moves was to hire,Paragraph
"Margarete Lihotzky, a young Austrian who was the first woman to",Paragraph
receive an architecture degree from Vienna’s School of Applied Arts,Paragraph
and had been working for the pioneering Minimalist architect Adolf,Paragraph
"Loos for the city of Vienna, which under its social democratic",Paragraph
government from 1918 to 1934 carried out a public housing,Paragraph
program comparable to Frankfurt’s in its ambitiousness and,Paragraph
"excellence. Later known as Grete Schiitte-Lihotzky, after she married",Paragraph
"another of May’s architects, Wilhelm Schiitte (who designed schools",Paragraph
"for his boss’s Siedlungen), she was born in 1897 in Vienna. Her",Paragraph
"father was a liberal-minded civil servant with pacifist sympathies,",Paragraph
and her mother a homemaker who joined the Red Cross during the,Paragraph
"Great War, which broke out when Grete was seventeen.",Paragraph
"Schiitte-Lihotzky’s most famous design, for the pathbreaking",Paragraph
ready-made all-in-one unit known as the Frankfurt Kitchen (1926-,Paragraph
"1927; see Illustration 5b), was informed not only by recent advances",Paragraph
"in standardization, prefabrication, and mass production—",Paragraph
interconnected concepts through which reformers believed that,Paragraph
good design could be made affordable for everyone—but also by,Paragraph
"time-motion studies, sociological tracts on domestic economy, and",Paragraph
above all a conviction that more efficient food preparation would,Paragraph
free women from a central aspect of oppressive household chores,Title
"that fell disproportionately to them, at a time when even in the most",Paragraph
progressive German households cooking was still deemed to be eine,Paragraph
"weibliche Pflicht (a wifely duty). Dimensionally, the Frankfurt",Paragraph
Kitchen—which measured approximately thirteen feet long by seven,Paragraph
feet wide by nine feet high (proportions that varied slightly from,Paragraph
one Siedlung to the next)—is a marvel of what German theorists,Paragraph
(who took their cues from Soviet contemporaries) called the,Paragraph
Existenzminimum (minimum means for existence).,Paragraph
"This was clear when a rare intact example of one such unit,",Paragraph
removed from an unrenovated apartment in May’s Héhenblick,Caption
housing estate in Ginnheim (where he himself lived in a cubic,Paragraph
"single-family villa of his own design), was acquired by New York’s",Paragraph
Museum of Modern Art in 2009 and displayed there two years later.,Paragraph
"For New Yorkers resigned to even smaller, often windowless galley",Paragraph
"kitchens, Schiitte-Lihotzky’s light-filled, shipshape design seemed",Paragraph
anything but minimal. MoMA’s example of the Frankfurt Kitchen is,Paragraph
the smallest of three variations devised by Schiitte-Lihotzky for,Paragraph
"different residential developments. However, some more affluent",Paragraph
urban dwellers might be caught short less by its size than by the,Paragraph
kitchen’s battleship-gray cupboards and drab linoleum-covered work,Caption
"surfaces, unfathomably austere for present-day America, where a",Paragraph
disproportionate amount of our gross national product goes toward,Paragraph
granite counter-tops and cherrywood kitchen cabinets. (In 2005 the,Paragraph
Victoria & Albert Museum salvaged another intact exemplar from,Caption
"the same Hodhenblick estate, but the London unit is painted a more",Paragraph
pleasing blue-green color than New York’s soberly utilitarian,Paragraph
version.),Paragraph
Schiitte-Lihotzky’s close reading of home-management texts by,Paragraph
"such pioneering feminists as the American Christine Frederick, along",Paragraph
with her own careful observations about the order in which women,Paragraph
"prepare, cook, serve, and clean up after meals, prompted her very",Paragraph
specific positioning of elements in the Frankfurt Kitchen to make,Paragraph
each task as labor-conserving as possible. Following the time-motion,Paragraph
"studies of Frederick Winslow Taylor, she positioned the gas range,",Paragraph
"industrial-style metal sink, and fitted glass-fronted cabinets in",Paragraph
"optimal relation to each other, arranging them to coincide with the",Paragraph
general order of tasks through which meals are made and cleaned,Paragraph
up after. Among her labor-saving devices was a built-in grid of,Paragraph
"eighteen drawer-like aluminum containers for sugar, flour, rice,",Paragraph
"coffee, and other dry foodstuffs. Each neatly labeled, removable",Paragraph
scoop-like aluminum compartment came complete with a handle,Paragraph
and spout that allowed it to be lifted out and the contents poured.,Paragraph
When the designer was told that inquisitive toddlers were prone to,Paragraph
wreak havoc when they tried to use these easy-to-remove,Paragraph
"components as playthings, she prudently elevated the enticing",Paragraph
handles beyond their reach in further refinements of her scheme.,Paragraph
Other simple but ingenious labor-saving devices in the Frankfurt,Paragraph
Kitchen included a slatted wooden dish-drying rack that was set into,Paragraph
"a shelf over the sink, which let water drip directly down into the",Paragraph
"drain. And a hinged upright ironing board, like a Murphy bed,",Paragraph
pivoted horizontally next to the window to take advantage of,Paragraph
daylight. The ensemble was so intelligently organized that it could,Paragraph
only have come from the mind of a woman who had personally,Paragraph
"experienced firsthand the illogic, drudgery, and waste of traditional",Paragraph
kitchens.,Paragraph
"To maximize the efficiency of every square centimeter of space,",Paragraph
Schiitte-Lihotzky emulated fitted-kitchen models from early modern,Paragraph
"transportation—steamboats, railroad cars, and lunch wagons—",Title
which employed prefabricated components to achieve ultimate,Paragraph
efficiency. By operating within industrial guidelines of,Paragraph
"interchangeable parts, Schiitte-Lihotzky could mass-produce her",Paragraph
Frankfurt Kitchen at low cost for all the new Siedlungen. As Susan R.,Paragraph
Henderson noted in her 1996 essay “A Revolution in the Woman’s,Paragraph
Sphere: Grete Lihotzky and the Frankfurt Kitchen”:,Title
Lihotzky’s points of reference were far removed from the,Paragraph
"woman’s sphere: ship galleys, the railroad dining car kitchen,",Caption
"and the lunch wagon.... With Lihotzky, the kitchen came to full",Paragraph
maturity as a piece of highly specialized equipment—a work,Paragraph
station where all implements were a simple extension of the,Paragraph
operator’s hand.,Paragraph
Yet for all the designer’s emphasis on modern innovation—,Paragraph
notably her application of assembly-line techniques perfected by,Paragraph
"Henry Ford—this kitchen-in-a-box was a low-tech affair, not only",Paragraph
because of strict budgetary restrictions (the local government,Paragraph
limited the cost of each kitchen to one-and-a-half times an average,Paragraph
"worker’s monthly salary, an amount amortized through rental fees)",Paragraph
but because labor-saving electrical appliances were not yet generally,Paragraph
"available. For example, Schiitte-Lihotzky specified no refrigerator,",Paragraph
which was considered a superfluous extravagance at a time when,Paragraph
people shopped for fresh food daily and in a place where it rarely,Paragraph
got very hot in summer.,Paragraph
May and Schiitte-Lihotzky did not agree on every feature of the,Paragraph
"Frankfurt Kitchen. She wanted an eat-in kitchen, but size and",Paragraph
"budget constraints made this impossible, whereas he was somewhat",Paragraph
overly concerned about the hygienic separation of cooking and,Paragraph
"dining. Schiitte-Lihotzky, who considered the subject from an",Paragraph
"empathetic female perspective, tried to bring the woman of the",Paragraph
house into closer contact with other family members as she went,Paragraph
about her chores (which would later be encouraged by kitchen pass-,Paragraph
"throughs in postwar American subdivisions), whereas May held to a",Paragraph
"more conventional, bourgeois male point of view about women’s",Paragraph
subservient place in the home. The Frankfurt Kitchen could be,Paragraph
constructed so successfully because May had the purchasing power,Paragraph
to make its manufacture economical within the limited budgets set,Paragraph
by the city government. Prefabrication never became the panacea,Paragraph
many thought it could be because industrially produced components,Paragraph
seldom were ordered in numbers large enough to be dramatically,Paragraph
cost-effective. But the unprecedented scope of the Frankfurt housing,Paragraph
experiment gave May the ability to specify customized elements—,Paragraph
"especially precast concrete wall panels, for the production of which",Paragraph
he established a factory—in sufficient quantity to actualize new,Paragraph
concepts that remained mere theories to others.,Paragraph
Schiitte-Lihotzky’s revolutionary role as a woman in this allegedly,Paragraph
“masculine” profession was alluded to in a delightful Spottgedicht,Paragraph
(satirical poem) from the 1920s that was likely written by her future,Paragraph
"husband Wilhelm Schiitte, but which captured the spell that she cast",Paragraph
on her other male coworkers as well:,Paragraph

May’s three-year stint in the Workers’ Paradise followed the all-,Paragraph

delightful five-story residential and commercial complex with a,Paragraph
streamlined exterior of semicircular concrete bays shaded by,Caption
continuous visor-like sunscreens that projected from each floor. His,Paragraph
"small but thriving practice was interrupted during World War II,",Paragraph
when he was jailed for two years by Kenya’s British colonial,Paragraph
government as an enemy alien.,Paragraph
"After his release, May and the architect George Blowers invented",Paragraph
"the Hook-on-Slab system of 1945, an ingenious construction",Paragraph
technique whereby flanged panels of precast reinforced concrete,Paragraph
could be slotted into one another to create slightly curving load-,Paragraph
bearing exterior walls. May used this as the basis for a housing,Paragraph
"prototype modeled on traditional East African grass houses, which",Paragraph
in his more solid rendering resembled Quonset huts with their,Paragraph
pronounced parabolic profile. As the historian Philipp Sturm has,Paragraph
"dryly noted, “The Africans were impressed by the technology of this",Paragraph

"Africans, and Asians if it had been implemented. Perhaps the",Paragraph
architect simply reflected attitudes of the colonial government that,Paragraph
"commissioned him, but his implicit acceptance of such pernicious",Paragraph
social engineering tarnished his long-standing reputation as a,Paragraph
progressive and has led some leftist critics to scorn him as a white,Paragraph
supremacist.,Paragraph
"After two decades in Africa, May had become deeply disillusioned",Paragraph
about the untapped potential he once imagined its peoples possessed,Paragraph
and was alarmed by the Mau Mau uprising. With large-scale postwar,Paragraph
"urban reconstruction underway in Germany, he returned to his",Paragraph
homeland in 1953 at the outset of the Wirtschaftswunder (economic,Paragraph
miracle). During this final phase of his career he served as chief,Paragraph
"planner for several cities, including Hamburg, Mainz, and",Paragraph
Wiesbaden. Nothing May subsequently did ever approached the,Paragraph
coup he carried off during his brief but astonishingly productive,Paragraph
"Frankfurt heyday. By comparison, Franklin Roosevelt’s fitful",Paragraph
greenbelt New Town schemes never approached their earlier,Paragraph
Weimar Republic counterparts either in comprehensive scale or,Paragraph
"design distinction, and America’s subsequent government-sponsored",Paragraph
housing programs retained a degrading class stigma that deepened,Paragraph
with each passing decade.,Paragraph
"After Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society, the belief in decent public",Paragraph
housing as a political right or social obligation was supplanted in,Paragraph
the US by the notion that suitable shelter should be an act of charity,Paragraph
rather than governmental policy. Thus in the absence of taxpayer-,Paragraph
sponsored initiatives there have been volunteer construction,Paragraph
"programs such as Habitat for Humanity, Homes for Heroes, Make It",Paragraph
"Right, and Rural Studio—honorable in intent but pitifully limited in",Paragraph
"scope, and focused on erecting single-family dwellings rather than",Paragraph
creating cohesive multiunit housing communities. In view of,Paragraph
"America’s postmillennial political and social direction, it seems quite",Paragraph
unlikely that we will soon see anything approaching the miracle of,Paragraph
late-1920s Frankfurt in America. But for as long as dreams of,Paragraph
"equality advanced through architecture persist, the surpassingly",Paragraph
humane work of Ernst May and Margarete Schiitte-Lihotzky will,Paragraph

OSCAR NIEMEYER,Title
"WHEN oscar nieMEYER Cied on December 5, 2012, ten days before his",Paragraph
"105th birthday, he was universally regarded as the very last of the",Paragraph
"twentieth century’s major architectural masters, an astonishing",Paragraph
"survivor whose most famous accomplishment, Brasilia, was the",Paragraph
climactic episode of utopian High Modern urbanism. That logistical,Paragraph
miracle and social adventure took just three and a half years from,Paragraph
"conception to completion, yet fell far short of its transformative",Paragraph
intentions. This was the most audacious planning scheme in a,Paragraph
century that saw the creation of several other start-from-scratch,Paragraph
capital cities that signified the waning of colonialism and the ascent,Paragraph
"of nationalism, including Walter Burley Griffin’s Canberra in",Paragraph
"Australia (1912-1920), Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker’s",Paragraph
"administrative nexus of the British Raj at New Delhi (1913-1931),",Paragraph
and Le Corbusier’s regional seat for the Indian Punjab at Chandigarh,Paragraph
(1951-1964).,Paragraph
"Brasilia, laid out by Niemeyer’s mentor Lticio Costa in 1957 and",Paragraph
"built principally by Niemeyer from 1958 to 1960, would have been",Paragraph
enough to secure the architect’s place in history. Yet posthumous,Paragraph
recapitulations of his epochal career remind us that during the two,Paragraph
decades that preceded this colossal undertaking—especially the,Paragraph
"early 1940s, when South America remained free from involvement",Paragraph
in World War II and thus was able to build with abandon—,Paragraph
Niemeyer stood at the very peak of architectural innovation and,Paragraph
invention. In those dark times he almost single-handedly upheld life-,Paragraph
affirming values counter to the industrialized mayhem being visited,Paragraph
on so much of mankind. Niemeyer’s work has rightly been likened,Paragraph
to Brazilian music: the swaying lines and swelling contours of his,Paragraph
"biomorphic 1940s designs evoke the samba, the sensuous and",Paragraph
insinuating dance that encapsulates that country’s vibrant,Paragraph
multiracial mix and easygoing sexuality. The cooler syncopations of,Paragraph
bossa nova were echoed in the measured visual rhythms of the,Paragraph
architect’s more self-consciously elegant Brasilia phase of the late,Paragraph
1950s and early 1960s. His work was then contemporaneous with,Paragraph
the emergence of the “new beat” that caused a global sensation just,Paragraph
as fantastic images of his dream-come-true city were splashed across,Paragraph
the international press.,Paragraph
Oscar Ribeiro de Almeida Niemeyer Soares Filho was born in Rio,Paragraph
de Janeiro in 1907 into a prominent upper-middle-class family of,Paragraph
German descent; his father was a typographer and one grandfather,Paragraph
was a supreme court justice. In 1929 he entered the National School,Paragraph
"of Fine Arts in Rio and studied architecture under Costa, who, along",Paragraph
"with his partner, the Russian émigré Gregori Warchavchik, was a",Paragraph
founding father of Brazilian Modernism. Upon receiving his,Paragraph
"architecture degree in 1934, Niemeyer joined the Costa firm. Two",Paragraph
years later Costa won the commission for a new Ministry of,Paragraph
"Education and Health headquarters in Rio and invited Le Corbusier,",Paragraph
"who had lectured to great acclaim in the city in 1929, to serve as",Paragraph
design adviser. Forward-thinking Brazilian architects eagerly,Paragraph
"embraced Le Corbusier’s precepts, particularly his use of reinforced",Paragraph
"concrete, which is cheaper, more adaptable to tropical settings, and",Paragraph
offers greater sculptural plasticity than conventional steel-frame,Paragraph
construction.,Paragraph
"During his first visit to Brazil, Le Corbusier urged his young",Paragraph
"coprofessionals to take freely from his work, but when Niemeyer",Paragraph
showed that he was a bit too adept at improving on those,Paragraph
"prototypes, the Swiss-French master, ever wary of potential rivals,",Paragraph
lashed out. One big problem in adapting Le Corbusier’s slab-like,Paragraph
tower schemes to warmer regions was providing climate control at a,Paragraph
time when mechanical air-conditioning was still in its infancy. In his,Paragraph
"unbuilt Plan Obus of 1933 for Algiers, Le Corbusier specified louver-",Paragraph
"like brises-soleils—sun-breakers—for the scheme’s exposed facades,",Paragraph
but he had still not executed any by the time Niemeyer beat him to,Paragraph
the punch at the Rio ministry. The young architect also raised the,Paragraph
slab’s ground-level piloti columns to a more monumental height of,Paragraph
"thirty feet, which resulted in a widely admired work that by",Paragraph
common consent out-Corbusiered Le Corbusier.,Paragraph
From the outset Niemeyer favored a design element found only,Paragraph
occasionally in his idol’s pre-1930 oeuvre: the curve. As he wrote:,Paragraph
"I am not attracted to [right] angles or to the straight line, hard",Paragraph
"and inflexible, created by man. I am attracted to free-flowing,",Paragraph
sensual curves. The curves that I find in the mountains of my,Paragraph
"country, in the sinuousness of its rivers, in the waves of the",Paragraph
"ocean, and on the body of the beloved woman. Curves make up",Paragraph
"the entire Universe, the curved Universe of Einstein.",Paragraph
Niemeyer found his ideal horticultural counterpart in the two-,Paragraph
"years-younger landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx, who created",Paragraph
strong biomorphic ground patterns in large monochromatic beds of,Paragraph
"plants (analogous to the free-form compositions of Jean Arp,",Paragraph
"Alexander Calder, Joan Miré, and other Surrealist artists of the",Paragraph
"1930s). A gifted botanist, Burle Marx domesticated many native",Paragraph
"plant species, more than thirty of which now bear his name. He",Paragraph
fully integrated the natural and the man-made with indoor-outdoor,Paragraph
water features and other illusionistic devices. Thanks to Burle,Caption
"Marx’s work, Niemeyer’s buildings achieved an aura of Edenic",Paragraph
wonder unmatched in Modernism.,Paragraph
Costa and Niemeyer collaborated on the Brazilian Pavilion at the,Paragraph
"1939 New York World’s Fair, the indisputable architectural hit of",Paragraph
the exposition (which also featured Alvar Aalto’s now legendary,Paragraph
Finnish Pavilion). This exotic Modernist efflorescence dazzled,Paragraph
"visitors with its languorously attenuated ramps, delightfully",Paragraph
"ambiguous transitions between exterior and interior, and a pond",Paragraph
designed by Burle Marx to display the gigantic Amazonian water lily,Caption
Victoria regia (which had inspired the structure of Joseph Paxton’s,Paragraph
ridged glazing at London’s Crystal Palace of 1850-1851).,Caption
Niemeyer’s remarkable early designs were likewise highlights of the,Paragraph
Museum of Modern Art’s avidly received 1943 survey “Brazil,Title
"Builds,” an upbeat escapist interlude during America’s",Paragraph
architecturally deprived war years that tied into the Roosevelt,Paragraph
"administration’s Good Neighbor Policy, aimed at improving",Paragraph
relations with Latin American nations through political,Title
"nonintervention, economic cooperation, and cultural exchange.",Paragraph
The commission that fully displayed Niemeyer’s individual genius,Paragraph
for the first time was his stunning complex of small buildings at,Paragraph
"Pampulha, a prosperous new suburb of Belo Horizonte, capital of",Paragraph
Brazil’s mineral-rich Minas Gerais state. Here in 1940 Juscelino,Paragraph
"Kubitschek de Oliveira, a physician-turned-leftist-politician known",Paragraph
"as the city’s “hurricane mayor” because of his whirlwind initiatives,",Paragraph
began his two decades as Niemeyer’s greatest champion.,Paragraph
Kubitschek’s urge to build big—which he continued as governor of,Paragraph
Minas Gerais (1950-1955) and finally as president of Brazil (1956-,Paragraph
1961)—makes French President Francois Mitterrand’s grands projets,Paragraph
of 1981-1998 seem somewhat underreaching. In hiring Niemeyer to,Paragraph
design a series of recreational public buildings around a new man-,Paragraph
"made lake at Pampulha, Kubitschek caught the architect at the very",Paragraph
peak of his powers. Positioned at spacious intervals around the,Paragraph
"amoeba-like shoreline are the Casino, House of Dance, Yacht Club,",Paragraph
"Golf Club, and Church of Saint Francis of Assisi. In particular, the",Paragraph
Casino of 1940-1943 (converted into an art gallery when Brazil,Paragraph
outlawed gambling in 1946) is a spatial marvel. Set on a gently,Paragraph
"sloping waterside bank, this two-story structure comprises a square",Paragraph
ground-floor entry defined by an equilateral grid of thin pilotis,Caption
"(much like those in Corbusier’s Villa Savoye of 1928-1931 in Poissy,",Paragraph
France) with window walls that dematerialize the concrete-framed,Paragraph
exterior. Atop this simple plinth is a second rectangular level,Caption
"containing the gaming room and, within an ovoid appendage that",Paragraph
"expands out toward the lake, a restaurant tiered with multiple",Paragraph
concentric levels to maximize seeing and being seen.,Paragraph
To increase the efficiency of the Casino’s several leisure functions,Paragraph
"—dining, dancing, and gambling—Niemeyer devised an ingenious",Paragraph
"tripartite circulation system with separate stairways, ramps, and",Paragraph
"catwalks so that patrons, entertainers, and service staff could pursue",Paragraph
their activities without colliding. We are now aware that the,Paragraph
interiors of early Modernist buildings were considerably less austere,Paragraph
"and colorless than has been imagined, but the Pampulha Casino was",Paragraph
more hedonistic than most European pleasure domes of the interwar,Paragraph
"period. Here, amid brightly hued, alluringly fragrant gardens laid",Paragraph
"out by Burle Marx, Niemeyer combined walls paneled in onyx,",Paragraph
"exotic native woods, and rose-tinted mirrors; floors of parquet and",Paragraph
polished travertine; slender stainless-steel-clad columns; hangings,Caption
"and upholstery of organza, satin, taffeta, and tulle; and a circular,",Paragraph
translucent etched-glass dance floor lit from below—all of which,Paragraph
together conjured what Cole Porter memorably called “a night of,Paragraph
tropical splendor.”,Paragraph
As if to give habitués of this nocturnal adult playground remission,Paragraph
"from its many occasions of sin, Niemeyer’s Church of Saint Francis",Paragraph
of Assisi of 1940-1942 (see Illustration 6a) stood nearby to offer,Paragraph
"absolution—or would have, had not conservative Catholic prelates,",Paragraph
"offended by the chapel’s freewheeling form and frank sensuality,",Paragraph
"refused to consecrate it until 1959, by which time the globally",Paragraph
celebrated architect had become a national culture hero. His church,Paragraph
features a lateral line-up of four parabolic arches formed from thin,Paragraph
concrete shells (faced with a blue-and-white azulejo tile mural of,Paragraph
scenes from the life of the saint by Candido Portinari); the gracefully,Paragraph
"rhythmic arches suggest the rolling contours of a mountain range, or",Paragraph
"perhaps a recumbent female nude. The similarly vaulted nave,",Paragraph
which telescopes into the arch of the high altar like the stem of the,Paragraph

"In 1946, a year after the United Nations was founded, the",Paragraph
philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. donated $8 million for the,Paragraph
purchase of a sixteen-acre parcel bordering the East River in,Paragraph
midtown Manhattan as the new organization’s permanent home.,Paragraph
The honor of designing the headquarters was deemed too great for,Paragraph
"any one member nation to bear, so an international Board of Design,",Paragraph
"which included Le Corbusier and Niemeyer, was established under",Paragraph
"the direction of Wallace K. Harrison, the Rockefeller family’s",Paragraph
longtime architectural factotum. This complicated saga is revealed,Paragraph
in illuminating behind-the-scenes detail in A Workshop for Peace:,Paragraph
Designing the United Nations Headquarters (1994) by George A.,Paragraph
"Dudley, a young architectural assistant of Harrison’s charged with",Paragraph
"documenting the proceedings, which now seem like a veritable",Paragraph
master class in the pitfalls of design by committee.,Paragraph
Though the forty-year-old Niemeyer was the most junior among,Paragraph
"the design team, his schematic outline—essentially the UN complex",Paragraph
"as we now know it, dominated by the slender high-rise slab of the",Paragraph
Secretariat Building set parallel to the river—caused a sensation,Paragraph
among his collaborators. As Dudley recorded:,Paragraph
It literally took our breath away to see the simple plane of the,Paragraph
"site kept wide open from First Avenue to the [East] River, only",Paragraph
"three structures on it, standing free, a fourth lying low behind",Paragraph
them along the river’s edge....,Paragraph
The comparison between Le Corbusier’s heavy block and,Paragraph
"Niemeyer’s startling, elegantly articulated composition seemed",Paragraph
"to me to be in everyone’s mind. As different as night and day,",Paragraph
"the heaviness of the block seemed to close the whole site, while",Paragraph
"in Niemeyer’s refreshing scheme the site was open, a grand",Paragraph
space with a clean base for the modest masses standing in it.,Paragraph
Le Corbusier disagreed: in his notebook he labeled a thumbnail,Paragraph
"sketch of his own proposal “beau” and Niemeyer’s “médiécre” [sic],",Paragraph
"though in fact it was quite the reverse. As the oldest, most eminent",Paragraph
"member of the panel, Le Corbusier pulled rank and at one meeting,",Paragraph
"according to Dudley, “blew his top and shouted, ‘He’s just a young",Paragraph
man; that scheme isn’t from a mature architect.” ” Though Le,Paragraph
"Corbusier could not get his own proposal accepted, he cowed the",Paragraph
"twenty-years-younger Niemeyer into altering his configuration,",Paragraph
eliminating the open areas between buildings the Brazilian called,Paragraph
"for, and thereby grievously diminished the ensemble’s spatial",Paragraph
qualities. The execution of the project was handed over to Harrison,Paragraph
"and his partner, Max Abramovitz, whose lackluster detailing further",Paragraph
diluted Niemeyer’s exhilarating initial vision. Though the,Paragraph
participants had agreed that the UN Headquarters would be credited,Paragraph
"as a group effort, Le Corbusier tried to claim sole authorship, and",Paragraph
evidently altered and backdated his sketches to support that,Paragraph
"fraudulent impression. Yet even in its compromised final state, this",Paragraph
eloquent and hopeful midcentury landmark remains most,Paragraph
identifiably the conceptual work of Niemeyer.,Paragraph
Though the idea of relocating Brazil’s government from the old,Paragraph
Portuguese colonial capital of Rio on the Atlantic coast to a virgin,Paragraph
"site deep within the hinterlands arose several centuries ago,",Paragraph
Brasilia’s origin myth—a miraculous tale disseminated by,Paragraph
Kubitschek to spur popular support for his quixotic $40 billion,Paragraph
endeavor—is of more recent vintage. According to this mystical,Paragraph
"account, in 1883 an Italian missionary priest, Giovanni Bosco (later",Paragraph
"canonized as Saint John Bosco and now the patron saint of Brasilia,",Paragraph
"popularly known as Don Bosco), had a dream in which he traveled",Paragraph
by train through the Andes to Rio accompanied by an angelic,Paragraph
companion. As Bosco recalled his vision:,Paragraph
"Between the fifteenth and twentieth degrees of latitude, there",Paragraph
was a long and wide stretch of land which arose at a point,Paragraph
where a lake was forming. Then a voice said repeatedly:,Paragraph
"... there will appear in this place the Promised Land, flowing",Paragraph
with milk and honey.,Paragraph
"Niemeyer, a Communist and lifelong atheist, framed the argument",Paragraph
for the move to the prophesied latitude of 15° 45’ in more political,Paragraph
terms:,Title
Rio is a lavish show-window which hides from public view the,Paragraph
"poor, backward, and forgotten.... The seat of government must",Paragraph
"be established in the heart of Brazil’s vast territory, so that it",Paragraph
"surveys the whole national panorama, so that it will be within",Paragraph
reach of all the classes and all the regions.,Paragraph
"Yet Brasilia turned out to be anything but egalitarian, and Niemeyer",Paragraph
eventually confessed that this putative everyman’s utopia “was a,Paragraph
city constructed as a showcase of capitalism—everything for a few,Paragraph
on a world stage.”,Paragraph
The rapid and relatively economical construction of the new,Paragraph
capital was aided by a disastrous drought in northeastern Brazil that,Paragraph
in early 1958 propelled ten thousand out-of-work laborers to the,Paragraph
building site. The refugees created instant favelas—Rio-style,Paragraph
shantytowns that Brasilia was meant to eradicate—that grew into,Paragraph
the ring of impoverished satellite communities that still encircle the,Paragraph
"capital, an island of bureaucratic privilege within a sea of squalor.",Paragraph
(Only in 1985 did Costa finally add a group of low-cost residential,Paragraph
units on the edge of Brasilia.) Kubitschek insisted that an,Paragraph
"international jury preside over a competition for the master plan,",Paragraph
"which infuriated Le Corbusier, who deeply coveted the job and",Paragraph
denounced such unseemly auditioning as “democratic cowardice.”,Paragraph
He persuaded French President Charles de Gaulle to intervene on his,Paragraph
"behalf with the Brazilian president, but to no avail.",Paragraph
"As many commentators have noted, Costa’s airplane-shaped plano",Paragraph
piloto (pilot plan)—with a 3.75-mile-long monumental axis that,Paragraph
comprises the “fuselage” and a perpendicular 8-mile-long residential,Paragraph
axis that forms the curving “wings”—is a distorted version of Le,Paragraph
"Corbusier’s Ville Radieuse (Radiant City) of 1924, his radical vision",Paragraph
of an ideal metropolis dominated by skyscrapers widely spaced amid,Paragraph
sweeping greenswards and serviced by broad automobile,Paragraph
"thoroughfares. According to Costa’s wife, he came up with the idea",Paragraph
for his plan not during an air flight but on a sea voyage between,Paragraph
"New York and Rio, “in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with the",Paragraph
"same 360° stretch of horizon as the Central Plain.” Incredibly, after",Paragraph
"an initial site visit in 1957, Costa did not return to Brasilia until",Paragraph
"1974, for a conference on the city’s urban problems. The capital’s",Paragraph
planner avowed that he could never leave Rio to live in his most,Paragraph
"famous creation: “I’m too comodista, addicted to the comforts here.”",Paragraph
Flanking Costa’s monumental axis are Niemeyer’s two rows of,Paragraph
identical ten-story horizontal-slab governmental ministry buildings,Caption
"—ten on one side, seven on the other—ranged in eerily monotonous",Paragraph
ranks like the German architect Ludwig Hilberseimer’s unexecuted,Paragraph
"Hochhausstadt (High-Rise City) project of 1924. In these buildings,",Paragraph
"there is no hint of the “free-flowing, sensual curves” Niemeyer had",Paragraph
"earlier celebrated. Furthermore, the structures were environmentally",Paragraph
"disastrous. Lacking brises-soleils and air-conditioning, they became",Paragraph
so unbearably hot that at least one government minister kept offices,Paragraph
on opposite exposures and moved between them at noon.,Paragraph
At the very “nose” of this virtual aircraft stands the triangular,Paragraph
"Plaza of the Three Powers (see Illustration 6b), an architectural",Paragraph
"embodiment of the executive, judicial, and legislative triad. The two",Paragraph

surmount a long rectangular base: the cupola of the Senate and the,Paragraph
Chamber of Deputies’ bowl-like reversal of that form. Centered,Paragraph
"behind them rise the twin towers of the Congressional Secretariat,",Paragraph
two parallel twenty-eight-story slabs linked midway by a flying,Caption
bridge that completes the outline of a mammoth capital H. The,Paragraph
adjacent presidential office block and Supreme Court building are,Paragraph
"similar glass-walled boxes, each with two elevations enlivened by",Paragraph
"flaring, finlike marble colonnades.",Paragraph
"The loveliest of Brasilia’s structures is the presidential residence,",Paragraph
the poetically named Palacio da Alvorada (Palace of the Dawn) of,Paragraph
"1956-1958, a transparent, rectilinear Miesian pavilion with",Caption

"decorated in the high International Style manner, like a number of",Paragraph

precise proportion.,Paragraph
Brasilia’s most distinctive architectural presence is Niemeyer’s,Paragraph

dramatic circular arrangement of eighteen boomerang-shaped,Caption
concrete columns that are joined by clear- and stained-glass panels,Paragraph
"and flare upward like a chalice, a crown of thorns, or, more",Paragraph
"irreverently, a crown roast of lamb—though perhaps the best",Paragraph

times with the Eucharist and salvation. Set to one side of the,Caption
"monumental axis, the church is entered through a subterranean",Paragraph
"tunnel that intensifies a sensation of soaring, light-flooded uplift as",Paragraph
one emerges into the domelike sanctuary.,Paragraph
"In 1945, Niemeyer joined the newly founded Brazilian Communist",Paragraph
Party after giving shelter to opponents of Gettlio Vargas’s,Paragraph
"dictatorship in his house, which he soon turned over to the Party.",Paragraph
His formal Communist affiliation (contemporaneous with that of,Paragraph
"Pablo Picasso and Pablo Neruda, who were among several notable",Paragraph
artists and intellectuals to become Party members at the end of,Paragraph
World War II) did not debar him from coming to the US to work on,Paragraph
the UN scheme—tepresentatives of the organization’s Communist,Paragraph
member states enjoyed diplomatic immunity—but it did cost him,Paragraph
"other work in the States. Invited to teach at Yale in 1946, he was",Paragraph
"denied an entry visa, and when he was offered the deanship of",Paragraph
Harvard’s Graduate School of Design in 1953 he had to decline on,Paragraph
"similar grounds, as happened yet again in 1967 when he was asked",Paragraph
to design a business center near Miami. His only built American,Paragraph

Several years after the 1964 coup by the right-wing general,Paragraph
Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco installed a military,Paragraph
"dictatorship, Niemeyer went into exile for seventeen years. Offered",Paragraph
"a French passport by de Gaulle in 1967, he resettled in Paris, where",Paragraph

"schemes for international clients, including headquarters for the",Paragraph
"publisher Mondadori in Segrate, Italy (1968-1975), and the",Paragraph
University of Constantine of Algeria (1969-1972). His abiding,Paragraph
political allegiance was demonstrated by his French Communist,Paragraph
Party headquarters of 1967-1980 in Paris—an undulating mid-rise,Paragraph
slab that adjoins a shallow concrete dome atop a below-street-level,Paragraph
conference hall rather like the UN General Assembly Chamber.,Paragraph
Niemeyer’s extraordinary longevity allowed him to witness the,Paragraph
cyclical ups and downs of artistic reputation come full circle within,Paragraph
his own lifetime. The ecstatic reception that greeted Brasilia’s,Paragraph
"inauguration on April 21, 1960, soon gave way to well-deserved",Paragraph
dissections of its serious failings as socially imaginative planning.,Paragraph
No critique has been more incisive than James Holston’s The,Paragraph
"Modernist City: An Anthropological Critique of Brasilia (1989), which",Paragraph
skewers the scheme’s humanitarian aspirations toward creating a,Paragraph
classless society while in fact it has abetted further division between,Paragraph
"rich and poor. For a Communist, Niemeyer had an oddly passive,",Paragraph
"cynical, or at the very least fatalistic attitude about architecture’s",Paragraph
ability to effect social improvement. In 2005 he noted that although,Paragraph
Le Corbusier “thought ... that architecture can change life ... I don’t,Paragraph
agree at all with that view. I believe exactly the opposite is true. It is,Paragraph
life that influences architecture.” He had used that laissez-faire,Paragraph
attitude to justify his primarily aesthetic approach in very similar,Paragraph
terms five years earlier:,Title
I do not know why I have always designed large public,Paragraph
buildings. But because these buildings do not always serve the,Paragraph
"functions of social justice, I try to make them beautiful and",Paragraph
"spectacular so that the poor can stop to look at them, and be",Paragraph
touched and enthused. As an architect that is all I can do.,Paragraph
Yet Niemeyer might well have looked to the impressive,Paragraph
accomplishments in public housing by leftist German architects of,Paragraph
the Social Democratic Weimar Republic like Bruno Taut and Ernst,Paragraph
May during the 1920s for ample evidence to the contrary. One of,Paragraph
the most trenchant critiques of this glaring oversight—Niemeyer’s,Paragraph
"most obvious blind spot—came from a fellow Communist, the",Paragraph
Italian émigré Brazilian architect Lina Bo Bardi. In her 1958 essay,Paragraph
"“Architecture or Architecture,” published in the Didrio de Noticias, Bo",Paragraph
Bardi already observed a disturbing departure from the humane,Paragraph
quality of his earlier work at Pampulha:,Paragraph
But what is architecture if not the most efficient means of,Paragraph
"combating, through its example, that same social injustice, the",Paragraph
very status quo that pained Niemeyer but that he nonetheless,Paragraph
felt obliged to contribute to and perpetuate (given his,Paragraph
popularity and influence over the young). Is the modern,Paragraph
"architect—as a builder of cities, neighborhoods, and public",Paragraph
housing—not an active combatant in the field of social justice?,Paragraph
"What is it that instills moral doubts, an awareness of injustice,",Paragraph
"in a strong, confident mind, if not a keen sense of collective",Paragraph
"responsibility and, with this, a willingness to fight for a",Paragraph
"positive, moral goal?",Paragraph
"As Postmodernist design began its brief ascendance in the 1970s,",Paragraph
Brasilia’s Space Age aesthetic was derided by neotraditionalists and,Paragraph
its Corbusian grandiosity denounced by proponents of the,Paragraph
neoconservative New Urbanism Movement. But as attitudes shifted,Paragraph
"yet again, the 1988 Pritzker Prize was given jointly to Niemeyer and",Paragraph
Gordon Bunshaft—the first dual conferral of that award—in what,Paragraph
was widely interpreted as a rebuke to Postmodernism after its,Paragraph
adherents James Stirling and Hans Hollein had been thus honored.,Paragraph
Accolades continued to mount as Niemeyer grew older and older; in,Paragraph
2003 he was asked to design that summer’s temporary pavilion at,Paragraph
"London’s Serpentine Gallery in Hyde Park, a sure index of",Paragraph
contemporary architectural hipness. (And also an index of the taste,Paragraph
"of Peter Palumbo, chairman of both the Pulitzer Prize since 2004",Paragraph
and the Serpentine Gallery since 1995. Of the thirteen Serpentine,Caption
"Pavilion architects until 2012, all but two of them—Daniel",Paragraph
Libeskind and Snghetta—had won the coveted award.),Paragraph
"Niemeyer’s last works are far from his best, but that has not",Paragraph
affected their popularity. His white disk-shaped Niterdi,Paragraph

was an educational alternative no different at the time from an,Paragraph

"values that he retained throughout his career, as was also true of his",Paragraph
"great contemporary Kahn, an even more talented draftsman as well",Paragraph
as a far more original and convincing reinterpreter of Classicism in a,Paragraph
modern mode. Though Stone picked up the new aesthetic of,Paragraph

"central circulation route (the marche), and the tripartite handling of",Paragraph

which remain evident in his mature work.,Paragraph
After working as an assistant on Schultze & Weaver’s Waldorf-,Paragraph
Astoria Hotel of 1929-1931 in New York City (where he designed,Paragraph

"Goodwin, a routinier Beaux Arts architect whose main qualification,",Paragraph
"as the museum’s first architecture curator, Philip Johnson, later",Paragraph
"candidly recalled, was “money, money, money.” Stone was given",Paragraph
the tricky task of steering the design away from Goodwin’s,Paragraph
conservative proclivities and toward the Modernist aesthetic the,Paragraph
young institution was promoting. It is to Stone’s credit that the,Paragraph
mismatched partners’ Museum of Modern Art of 1936-1939,Title
emerged as a thoroughly respectable if not quite thrilling specimen,Paragraph
"of the International Style, with neutrally detailed, domestically",Paragraph
scaled galleries that became the influential new standard for,Paragraph
"exhibiting twentieth-century painting, sculpture, and design.",Paragraph
"During World War II, Stone served as a major in the US Army,",Paragraph
"and while stationed in Washington, D.C., he designed airfields and",Paragraph
military bases. When peace came the architect applied his newly,Paragraph
acquired organizational abilities to large-scale projects that included,Paragraph
"resort hotels in Panama and Lebanon, as well as colleges across the",Paragraph
United States as higher education boomed (in large part thanks to,Paragraph
"the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, commonly known as",Paragraph
"the G.I. Bill). His workload grew to an enviable degree, and he",Paragraph
"found a paradoxical admirer in Wright, whose revolutionary",Paragraph
reputation stemmed from breaking out of precisely the kind of static,Paragraph
boxlike configurations that Stone resorted to time and again during,Paragraph
"his postwar period, as opposed to the often dynamic layouts of his",Paragraph
prewar houses.,Paragraph
Wright blamed his brush with oblivion in the 1920s on the strict,Paragraph
"reductivism espoused by Le Corbusier, Gropius, Mies, Oud, and",Paragraph
other European modernists who abjured all applied ornament and,Paragraph
"pattern. After his triumphant comeback in the 1930s, Wright",Paragraph
embraced increasingly florid decorative schemes to set his work,Paragraph
apart from that of his nemeses who championed the pared-down,Paragraph
International Style. This is where America’s greatest architect and,Paragraph
the profession’s latest sensation found common ground. In Stone’s,Paragraph
Stanford and Harvey Mudd ensembles he paid Wright the,Paragraph
compliment of using geometrically patterned precast concrete,Paragraph
components clearly derived from the old master’s pre-Columbian-,Paragraph
inspired “textile block” concrete construction system of 1922-1923.,Paragraph
Wright in turn said that he admired Stone’s widely praised US,Paragraph
"Embassy of 1954-1958 in New Delhi, and went so far as to claim it",Paragraph
"was more beautiful than the Taj Mahal, proof that he had never laid",Paragraph
eyes on either.,Paragraph
"Wright’s ferocious third wife, Olgivanna, always attuned to the",Paragraph
"main chance, encouraged a friendship between the two architects as",Paragraph
Stone’s star began its meteoric rise. The Montenegrin-born,Paragraph
"Olgivanna, an acolyte of the spiritualist G.I. Gurdjieff, thrived on",Paragraph
intrigue and loved to meddle in the sex lives of the Taliesin,Paragraph
"Fellowship, Wright’s architecture school-cum-professional office—",Paragraph
cum-imperial court. After his death in 1959 there was an,Paragraph
"understandably sharp drop-off in commissions, and the widow",Paragraph
Wright hatched a byzantine plot to draw the Stones deeper into the,Paragraph
Taliesin circle in order to profit from his connections. As Hicks,Paragraph
"Stone writes of his mother and her new best friend, “They confided",Paragraph
"in each other about the details of their marriages, the sexual",Paragraph
"behavior of their husbands, and the role a wife can play in her",Paragraph
husband’s architectural practice.” Convinced that if Ed Stone were,Paragraph
made jealous enough he’d spend more time at Taliesin West in,Paragraph
"Arizona, the sinister Mrs. Wright successfully masterminded an",Paragraph
affair between Maria and a neurosurgeon she had tutored in,Paragraph
Gurdjieff’s beliefs. But that dalliance wrecked the Stones’ already,Paragraph
"stormy marriage, and the wicked old schemer, who belatedly feared",Paragraph
"a scandal, banished the hapless adulterers from her desert court.",Paragraph
Much as Francis Bacon bitchily referred to his macho fellow,Paragraph
"painter Jackson Pollock—best known for his airy, looping skeins of",Paragraph
"pigment—as “the lacemaker,” that sobriquet also could have been",Paragraph
applied to Stone once he began repetitively wrapping decorative,Paragraph
white filigreed screens around his buildings in the early 1950s.,Paragraph
"Johnson, a much better critic than designer, delivered the sharpest",Paragraph
one-sentence verdict on Stone when he observed that “architecture,Paragraph
is more than putting drapes in front of a house to hide it.” One of,Paragraph
the more egregious applications of that idea was the lacy white,Paragraph
facade Stone tacked onto his own Victorian town house on,Caption
"Manhattan’s Upper East Side, which sticks out from its row of stolid",Paragraph
brownstones like an enormous antimacassar. Easily and cheaply,Paragraph
"mimicked in precast concrete and other composite materials,",Paragraph
knockoffs of his pierced screens quickly became ubiquitous,Paragraph
"architectural clichés throughout the Sunbelt, where countless",Paragraph
breezeways and carports bear silent witness to the false dawn of a,Paragraph
new Stone Age.,Paragraph
Even fellow architects who saw certain good qualities beneath the,Paragraph
froufrou surface of Stone’s postwar work were exasperated by his,Paragraph
"constant reiteration of patterned screens. Eero Saarinen, his",Caption
principal rival for high-profile corporate commissions and another,Paragraph
darling of the mainstream press in the 1950s (both appeared on the,Paragraph
"cover of Time magazine, a big deal back then), averred that “the",Paragraph
best thing that could happen to Ed Stone would be for someone to,Paragraph
take his grilles away from him.” By the 1960s that opinion became,Paragraph
so widespread among Stone’s critics and potential clients that his,Paragraph
"office managers curtailed and eventually banned his hallmark motif,",Paragraph
"more as a marketing strategy than as an artistic principle. Alas,",Paragraph
"what lay behind the screens was not particularly interesting, and",Paragraph
without those seductive peekaboo veils it became all too obvious,Paragraph
that the exposed volumes of his unadorned work lacked either the,Paragraph
"raw power of Brutalism or the understated rigor of Minimalism, the",Paragraph
two dominant architectural trends of the 1960s and 1970s. Stone’s,Paragraph
"simpler late-career structures, almost always clad in white masonry",Paragraph
"deployed in vertical stripes, exude the denuded and forlorn air of",Paragraph
freshly shorn sheep.,Paragraph
"Vincent Scully, the oracular architectural historian who made the",Paragraph
"critical reputations of both Kahn and Venturi, was exceptional",Paragraph
during the postwar period for being wholly receptive to new,Paragraph
"expressions of the Classical tradition, as exemplified by his support",Paragraph
for both Kahn’s majestic Roman-inspired forms and the playful,Paragraph
Mannerist and vernacular conceits of Venturi and Scott Brown. But,Paragraph
Scully could not stomach what he saw as the debased sub-Classical,Paragraph
"values of Stone and his closest contemporary counterpart, the",Paragraph
Japanese-American architect Minoru Yamasaki (whose most famous,Paragraph
"work, the twin-towered World Trade Center of 1966-1977 in New",Caption
"York City, conformed closely to Stone’s white-clad, vertical-striped,",Paragraph
flat-topped high-rise format). As Scully wrote in 1969 of that shared,Paragraph
aesthetic:,Title
"It is superficial classicism; and it is, literally, superficial design,",Paragraph
"where the volume, into which the functions are more or less",Paragraph
"fitted, is fundamentally Miesian, symmetrical, and not overly",Paragraph
"studied, but the surface is as crumpled and laced up as the",Paragraph
trade can afford.,Paragraph
"Stone’s rigid tendencies were most apparent, and deleterious, in",Paragraph
"his comprehensive planning schemes, never more so than in his",Paragraph
Uptown Campus of 1954-1958 for the State University of New York,Caption
at Albany. Its obsessively symmetrical layout—centered by a vast,Paragraph
colonnaded oblong of interconnected mirror-image pavilions and,Caption
roofless courtyards—is bounded beyond its outer corners by four,Paragraph
identical freestanding high-rises surrounded at the base by deep,Paragraph
arcades. The quadrangle has been a defining element of collegiate,Paragraph
"design since the Middle Ages, when such inward-facing spaces grew",Paragraph
incrementally and organically out of defensive monastic prototypes,Paragraph
and reflected the functional relationships of the buildings that,Paragraph
surrounded them. In contrast to the logical evolution and essential,Paragraph
"intimacy of medieval university ensembles, the superscale, unitary",Caption
"nature of Stone’s Albany campus is decidedly arbitrary, not to say",Paragraph
"Procrustean. For example, the handling of the four principal atriums",Paragraph
is so similar that it is hard (at least for the occasional visitor) to tell,Paragraph
exactly where within the complex one is. Likewise the,Paragraph
indistinguishable appearance of the identical outlying towers makes,Paragraph
it difficult to read those vertical elements as accurate reference,Paragraph
points.,Paragraph
Another deficiency of this scheme—and of Stone’s oeuvre in,Paragraph
"general—is a basic disregard for climatic conditions, as seen at",Paragraph
Albany in his fetishistic fondness for open plazas and porous,Paragraph
"peripheries, particularly unsuitable for that city’s frigid winters. But",Paragraph
"in that respect Stone was no different from his old boss Harrison,",Paragraph
whose brutally exposed and windswept Empire State Plaza of 1959-,Paragraph
"1976, also in Albany, would likewise be more appropriate in Brasilia",Paragraph
than the northern Hudson River valley. Although Stone’s perforated,Paragraph
outer walls may have made good environmental sense in tropical,Paragraph
"settings—particularly the New Delhi embassy, where his openwork",Paragraph
panels updated the traditional jali that shaded and ventilated,Paragraph
classical Mughal architecture—he applied that idea so,Paragraph
indiscriminately everywhere in the world that rather than seeming,Paragraph
an outgrowth of well-considered design it became a mere styling,Paragraph
gimmick. Yet even in warm locales where this formula might have,Paragraph
"made more ecological sense, Stone’s contradictory combination of",Paragraph
"International Style generality, Classical rigidity, and Romantic",Title
theatricality resulted in some rather strange proposals.,Paragraph
One such scheme was his vast campus for the University of,Paragraph
Islamabad (now Quaid-i-Azam University) of 1966-1985 in,Paragraph
"Pakistan, one of fifteen late-career commissions in that country,",Paragraph
which also included the Presidential Palace of 1966—circa 1980 in,Paragraph
Islamabad and the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and,Title
Technology of 1965-1974 in Nilore. The university ensemble,Caption
"multiplies the SUNY Albany format to an almost manic degree, with",Paragraph
"a proliferation of identically scaled, atrium-centered buildings in a",Paragraph
checkerboard pattern that makes the New York State campus look,Paragraph
positively Minimalist.,Paragraph
Changing attitudes toward Stone’s work were evident by the turn,Paragraph
"of the millennium, when one of the most misjudged preservation",Paragraph
battles in recent decades attracted a disproportionate amount of,Paragraph
attention given the historical insignificance of the building involved:,Paragraph
his Gallery of Modern Art of 1964-1965 in New York City.,Paragraph
Commissioned by the eccentric A&P supermarket heir Huntington,Caption
"Hartford, this privately endowed institution was conceived as a",Paragraph
contrarian riposte to the Museum of Modern Art and what Hartford,Title
—whose taste in painting ran to the then deeply unfashionable Pre-,Paragraph
Raphaelites and the later work of Salvador Dali—saw as the overly,Paragraph
restrictive view of Modernism advanced by MoMA. It was therefore,Paragraph
no coincidence that he turned to one of that institution’s original,Paragraph
"architects for his rival gallery, although the results were strikingly",Paragraph
different from Stone’s textbook exercise in International Style,Paragraph
orthodoxy for MoMA three decades earlier.,Paragraph
"The highly visible, easily accessible, but tightly restricted site that",Paragraph
Hartford chose for his quixotic project occupied a small traffic island,Paragraph
at the southern end of Manhattan’s chronically ill-defined Columbus,Paragraph
Circle. Stone maximized the small rectangular ground plan by,Paragraph
"extending the structure to a height of ten stories, and created an",Paragraph
illusion of greater depth at street level by pushing the building,Paragraph
envelope out to its permissible maximum on all four sides and then,Paragraph
encircling the base with an arcade of oddly stylized columns that,Paragraph
"Ada Louise Huxtable, writing in The New York Times, indelibly",Paragraph
"likened to giant lollipops. Above them, the building’s white marble",Paragraph
"facing was trimmed with eyelet-like holes around the edges, rather",Paragraph
"than the architect’s more typical all-over perforation pattern. Stone,",Paragraph
"never very imaginative with spatial solutions, was unable to create",Paragraph

"financial bust for the profligate playboy patron, and after he closed",Paragraph

A leading voice in favor of the old Hartford’s preservation was the,Paragraph

"2004, the late Herbert Muschamp, who in 2006 wrote a rambling",Paragraph

commissioned attention-getting corporate towers.),Paragraph
The prestige value of a skyscraper by a name-brand architect was,Paragraph

ambitious TV mogul who hired Saarinen to design the CBS Building,Paragraph
"of 1960-1965 in New York. But the finished product, completed",Paragraph
"four years after the architect’s death, failed to fulfill Paley’s dream",Paragraph
"of outdoing the uncouth whiskey tycoon Samuel Bronfman, who",Paragraph
sponsored Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson’s,Paragraph
"acclaimed Seagram Building of 1954-1958, three blocks east of the",Caption
CBS site. The control-freak Paley micromanaged countless design,Paragraph
"details, including the stippled matte finish of the dark gray granite",Paragraph
cladding that earned his network’s headquarters the sobriquet,Paragraph
"“Black Rock.” Alas, he did not reckon what a miscalculation it was",Paragraph
for Saarinen to sink the monolithic tower’s entry court two feet,Paragraph
below street level on Manhattan’s Avenue of the Americas. This,Paragraph
deflating arrival sequence down a peripheral bank of steps is the,Paragraph
antithesis of the uplifting approach to the sublime Seagram Building,Paragraph
via Mies’s majestic plaza elevated atop a plinth.,Caption
"All artists go through distinct developmental periods, but the look",Paragraph
"of Saarinen’s buildings could vary wildly, and without apparent",Paragraph
"logic, from project to project. At times he would let fly with a",Paragraph
swooping extravagance not witnessed since the swan song of Art,Paragraph
"Nouveau half a century earlier, and exemplified by his voluptuously",Paragraph

demonstrated by the crisp modularity of his IBM Research Center of,Paragraph
"1957-1961 in Yorktown Heights, New York.",Caption
Saarinen’s Deere and Company Administrative Center of 1957-,Title
"1963 in Moline, Illinois, was the finest of his corporate headquarters",Paragraph
because it so satisfyingly mediated his bipolar aesthetic and proved,Paragraph
how the seemingly exhausted Miesian mode could still yield far,Paragraph
"more volumetric interest than the routine, flat-walled International",Paragraph
"Style box. For this lush-budget job on a well-manicured rural site,",Paragraph
Saarinen wrapped the eight-story glass-skinned office building in a,Paragraph
scaffold-like exoskeleton of the newly introduced Cor-Ten steel,Paragraph
(later to become the sculptor Richard Serra’s preferred material).,Paragraph
This beautifully proportioned grid of rust-colored columns and,Paragraph
"railings acts as a sunscreen, but more important, it dematerializes",Paragraph
the structure’s bulk and imparts to it an ethereal floating quality,Paragraph
much like that of Kobori Enshu’s Katsura Imperial Villa of 1620-,Paragraph
"1645 in Kyoto, the summit of classical Japanese architecture, which",Paragraph
captivated Saarinen when he visited the city in 1958. Although his,Paragraph
"Deere project was already well underway, he was so taken by the",Paragraph
"exquisitely assembled, deceptively understated villa and its lyrical",Paragraph
"garden—trevered by early Modernists, including Bruno Taut and",Paragraph
"Walter Gropius, who through this example reawakened the",Paragraph
Eurocentric post-Meiji period Japanese to their own glorious,Title
architectural heritage—that upon his return he drastically reworked,Paragraph
"the plans, and reported to his client that the improved version",Paragraph
showed “real promise of achieving ... the same quality as Katsura.”,Paragraph
Was Saarinen the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of twentieth-century,Paragraph
"architecture, morphing with alarming suddenness from one",Paragraph
diametrically opposed persona to another? Was he the Janus of,Paragraph
"midcentury Modernism, a pivotal figure who looked back toward",Paragraph

toward the Expressionistic animation of Frank Gehry and Santiago,Paragraph
"Calatrava? Or was he little more than a straight Philip Johnson, a",Paragraph
dab hand at tossing off instantly arresting but ultimately vacuous,Paragraph
trophy architecture for the captains of corporate America?,Title
One might have thought that any lingering unease over his,Paragraph
bifurcated vision would have been allayed after the demise of,Paragraph
Modernist orthodoxy and the rise of today’s more permissive,Title
attitudes in architecture. But opinion on Saarinen has remained,Paragraph
"sharply divided, as was confirmed by the two very different points",Paragraph
of view set forth at a Saarinen symposium held at the Yale School of,Paragraph
"Architecture in 2005. Most of the panelists—all alumni of his office,",Paragraph
including Kevin Roche (who took over the firm after his boss died),Paragraph
and Cesar Pelli—spoke in the laudatory tones expected on such,Paragraph
"occasions. The keenest insights, unsurprisingly, came from Robert",Paragraph
"Venturi, a leading protagonist in the downfall of Modernist",Paragraph
hegemony and an on-and-off Saarinen employee from 1950 to 1953.,Paragraph
"Venturi’s pioneering advocacy of an inclusive, high/low, either- or",Paragraph
approach to architecture might seem to dispose him favorably,Paragraph
toward Saarinen’s wayward design ethos. But as Venturi,Paragraph
"persuasively maintained at Yale, the trouble with Saarinen isn’t that",Paragraph
his work is too diverse but rather that it isn’t complex and,Paragraph
contradictory enough:,Title
There can be many ways of expression that can connect with,Paragraph
different cultures: there is not one universal culture anymore.,Paragraph
But I don’t think this is what Eero’s eclectic expressionism was,Paragraph
about.... You could not call it multiculturalism because it,Paragraph
was/is a little like every building being in a different,Paragraph
costume ... at a costume ball where someone goes as one thing,Paragraph
and another person goes as another thing.... The,Paragraph
expressionistic variety was not derived from what we would,Paragraph
"call multiculturalism now, but from a kind of arbitrary,",Paragraph
"stylistic, fashionable approach.",Paragraph
Venturi declared his favorite scheme of Saarinen’s to be the,Paragraph
Gateway Arch at the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial of,Caption
"1947-1965 in St. Louis, the 630-foot-tall stainless-steel catenary that",Paragraph
"he praised for its “modern structure, monumental scale, and",Paragraph
"appropriate symbolism!” However, with his extensive historical",Paragraph
"knowledge, he cannot have been unaware of its extraordinary",Paragraph
resemblance to the unbuilt arch Adalberto Libera designed in 1939,Paragraph
for Mussolini’s aborted Esposizione Universale Roma of 1942. (That,Paragraph
"unpleasant fact made headlines in 1948, when Saarinen presented",Paragraph
his proposal. The hubbub subsided after he indignantly denied,Paragraph
"having copied the Fascist prototype, and the National Park Service",Paragraph
proceeded with his scheme nonetheless.) I suspect that Venturi,Paragraph
actually chose the St. Louis monument because of its subliminal Pop,Paragraph
implications: the arch brings to mind a superscale Oldenburgian,Title
wicket awaiting a croquet ball as big and as white as the Perisphere,Paragraph
at the 1939 New York World’s Fair.,Paragraph
"For all his populist impulses, Venturi was never an indiscriminate",Paragraph
eclecticist but a thoroughgoing theorist with strongly held,Paragraph
"philosophical positions. Conversely, if Saarinen had articulated a",Paragraph
"systematic rationale for his extreme stylistic shifts, he might not",Paragraph
have been stigmatized as a mercurial opportunist who abetted a,Paragraph
culture of planned obsolescence through the architectural equivalent,Paragraph
of novel consumer goods. Yet looking back at the 1950s boom years,Paragraph
"of the American automobile industry, its annual introduction of new",Paragraph
car models with increasingly swollen protuberances and exaggerated,Paragraph
"fins had more than a little in common with the sexy, futuristic",Paragraph
schemes being spun out at the same time by Saarinen’s firm in the,Paragraph
Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills. Perhaps because of his facile,Paragraph
"design skills, aptitude for public relations, and heady professional",Title
"ascent, he felt no need to justify artistic license through theoretical",Paragraph
argument.,Paragraph
By the time Saarinen’s career shifted into high gear after World,Paragraph
"War II, the fundamental precepts of the Modern Movement had been",Paragraph
so widely accepted that manifestos seemed redundant and remained,Paragraph
"so until 1966, when Venturi’s self-proclaimed “gentle manifesto,”",Paragraph
"Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture, undid what remained of",Paragraph
his erstwhile employer’s dwindling legacy. Scholars were long,Paragraph
thwarted in their attempts to put Saarinen into proper perspective,Paragraph
because exclusive access to the architect’s drawings and papers had,Paragraph
"been monopolized by a writer whose perpetually awaited,",Paragraph
authorized life-and-works never materialized. This Godot-like stasis,Paragraph
"ended in 2002, when Roche donated the Saarinen office archives to",Paragraph
"Yale, which broke the embargo, but the damage had been done. The",Paragraph
protracted hiatus in Saarinen studies allowed specious claims to go,Paragraph
"unchallenged, primarily the persistent Eero-myth that he was the",Paragraph
missing link in modern architecture’s apostolic succession.,Paragraph
Saarinen stood apart from his peers in no small part because of,Paragraph
the charismatically photogenic quality of his built work. The,Paragraph
dynamic color images made by one of his foremost visual,Paragraph
"chroniclers, Balthazar Korab, practically leap off the page. The",Paragraph
Michigan-based Korab and his two major competitors—Ezra Stoller,Paragraph
of New York and Julius Shulman of Los Angeles—were to the,Paragraph
photography of midcentury Modern architecture what their,Paragraph
contemporaries Ansel Adams and Yousuf Karsh were to the western,Paragraph
"landscape and celebrity portraiture, respectively: unapologetic",Paragraph
showmen who played to popular notions of the heroic in order to,Paragraph
ennoble their subjects. Both Stoller and Shulman were adept (if,Paragraph
"formulaic) technicians with foolproof commercial instincts, though",Paragraph
seemingly incapable of the sly insights that give the images of their,Paragraph
lesser-known but prolific contemporary Pedro E. Guerrero (who,Paragraph
began his career as Frank Lloyd Wright’s official photographer) a,Paragraph
critical edge that their work generally lacks.,Paragraph
Stoller’s 1962 black-and-white photo essay on the TWA Terminal,Paragraph
remains unsurpassed in conveying the essence of an unconventional,Paragraph
architectural masterpiece. But neither he nor Shulman (whose,Paragraph
virtuosic ability to bring out a thousand shades of gray was akin to,Paragraph
that of 1930s cinematographers) commanded Korab’s gift for high-,Paragraph
"keyed color. Like all but a few of his High Modernist colleagues,",Paragraph
Saarinen had little interest in the expressive potential of,Paragraph
architectural color. But the sensuously modeled contours of his,Paragraph
strongest buildings never looked more alive than when Korab shot,Paragraph
them against the ravishing tints of dawn or twilight. He captured,Paragraph
"the buoyant optimism of his favorite subject to perfection, the visual",Paragraph
equivalent of Frank Sinatra’s infectiously upbeat 1958 LP Come Fly,Paragraph
"with Me, the ideal soundtrack for Saarinen’s aerodynamic structures,",Paragraph
which seem ready to lift into orbit.,Paragraph
No modern architect derived greater benefit from family,Paragraph
"connections than Eero Saarinen, who was born in Finland in 1910,",Paragraph
"on the thirty-seventh birthday of his father, Eliel, their homeland’s",Paragraph
preeminent architect during the first third of the twentieth century,Paragraph
"(until Alvar Aalto, half a generation between the two Saarinens and",Paragraph
much more significant than either). The elder Saarinen (along with,Paragraph
"his two partners, Herman Gesellius and Armas Lindgren) had started",Paragraph
the new century with a bang thanks to their critically acclaimed,Paragraph
"Finnish Pavilion at the Universal Exposition of 1900 in Paris, which",Paragraph
displayed an invigorating folkloristic strength that stood out from,Paragraph
the overcomplicated baroquerie around it. Eero was raised at,Paragraph
"Hvittrask, the communal country house and studio of 1902 near",Caption
Helsinki created by his father and his two colleagues in the style,Paragraph
that took its name from the Arts and Crafts—oriented National,Paragraph
"Romantic Movement, which asserted Finnish independence after",Paragraph
"centuries of domination by Sweden and Russia, a dream that finally",Paragraph
"became a reality in 1917, two months after the October Revolution.",Paragraph
Although the richly embellished MHvittrask ensemble was,Paragraph
influenced to some extent by the other new free styles that erupted,Paragraph
"around the turn of the twentieth century, the utopian young Finns",Paragraph
who created it were more politically motivated than their Art,Paragraph
Nouveau counterparts. As was true with exponents of the,Paragraph
widespread fin-de-siécle phenomenon of the Gesamtkunstwerk (“total,Paragraph
"work of art”), Finland’s National Romanticists placed great emphasis",Paragraph
"on the complete coordination of all aspects of design, from the",Paragraph
grandest environmental concepts to the tiniest decorative grace,Paragraph
"notes, the same unified approach then being pursued in America by",Paragraph
Wright under his rubric of “organic architecture.”,Paragraph
Eliel Saarinen attracted further international attention with his,Paragraph
second-place entry in the Chicago Tribune Building competition of,Caption
"1922. Many thought it superior to the prizewinning scheme, by",Paragraph
"John Mead Howell and Raymond Hood, which was fussed up with",Paragraph
"incongruous Neo-Gothic ornament. Saarinen’s powerfully massed,",Paragraph
"clean-lined proposal, free of anachronistic historical details, made",Paragraph
an immediate impact on American skyscraper design (as seen in the,Paragraph
rapid adaptation of his principal ideas by Ralph Walker for his look-,Paragraph
alike New York Telephone Building of 1923-1926 in lower,Caption
Manhattan). Rarely has losing a competition been such a boon to an,Paragraph
architect’s career. Favorable publicity about Saarinen caught the eye,Paragraph
"of the Detroit newspaper magnate George Booth, who wanted to",Paragraph
establish an American design school based on Arts and Crafts,Paragraph
principles. He asked the recent émigré not only to design the,Paragraph
"Cranbrook Academy of Art, built on Booth’s estate in suburban",Caption
"Detroit, but also to head the school and shape its curriculum,",Paragraph
whereupon the elder Saarinen resettled with his family on the,Paragraph
nascent campus.,Paragraph
"Eero’s formidable mother, Loja (herself the child of an eminent",Paragraph
"architect, Eliel’s partner and Hvittrask collaborator Gesellius), was",Paragraph
an accomplished textile designer and sculptor who ensured that her,Paragraph
boy’s precocious talents were not merely encouraged but given,Paragraph
ample opportunity for application. He began working in his father’s,Paragraph
"architectural office at fifteen, creating decorative elements and",Paragraph
furnishings for Cranbrook. (Such early employment was a,Paragraph
"throwback to craft apprenticeships, which traditionally began after",Paragraph
religious confirmation at age fourteen.) Although the younger,Paragraph
Saarinen’s mature work adhered to the High Modernist proscription,Paragraph
against the applied ornament and vivid pattern so integral to his,Paragraph
"father’s Arts and Crafts credo, he never abandoned his great concern",Paragraph
for the sympathetic furnishing and landscaping of his buildings with,Paragraph
the “organic” unity espoused by the designers of the Arts and Crafts,Paragraph
Movement.,Paragraph
"Saarinen fils had a gift for furniture design, which was rewarded",Paragraph
"when he and a close Cranbrook contemporary, Charles Eames, won",Paragraph
two first prizes for chairs they collaborated on for the Museum of,Paragraph
Modern Art’s Organic Design in Home Furnishings competition of,Paragraph
"1940. Eames and his wife, Ray, went on to become the supreme",Paragraph
furniture designers of the twentieth century. Eero Saarinen was not,Paragraph
"nearly as important in that sphere, but he did create two icons of",Paragraph
modern seating: the spindly-legged but warmly enveloping Womb,Title
chair of 1946-1948 (a wool-upholstered reinterpretation of the,Paragraph
traditional high-backed club chair) and the sleekly reductive Tulip,Paragraph
or Pedestal chair of 1954-1957 (a continuous linear flow of white-,Paragraph
"painted aluminum with a fiberglass seat supported by a single,",Paragraph
centered column flaring upward from a circular base). These classics,Paragraph
"are still produced by Knoll, the high-style furniture manufacturer",Paragraph
"whose longtime presiding spirit, Florence Schust Knoll, studied at",Paragraph
Cranbrook during the 1930s and was welcomed into the Saarinen,Paragraph
"family circle (although she did not marry Eero, as his mother",Paragraph
wished).,Paragraph
By the time large-scale civilian construction resumed after World,Paragraph
"War II, young Saarinen—a partner in Eliel’s practice since 1937—",Paragraph
was better positioned than any other architect of his generation to,Paragraph
land the big new jobs that poured forth following years of pent-up,Paragraph
demand. The backing of his father’s long-established office lent,Paragraph
weight to the thirty-seven-year-old’s winning entry in the St. Louis,Paragraph
"memorial competition. Two years before Eliel’s death in 1950, Eero",Paragraph
"assumed full creative control of the firm, which saw the last of his",Paragraph
father’s somewhat stuffy Stripped Classicism—the farthest the,Paragraph
essentially conservative Eliel was prepared to go on the road to High,Paragraph
"Modernism. The younger Saarinen, always a quick study, grasped",Paragraph
how avidly the postwar American business establishment was taking,Paragraph
"to the cost-efficient, easily adaptable International Style. In his no-",Paragraph
"nonsense, meticulously Miesian design for the General Motors",Paragraph
"Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, begun in 1948, we can see",Paragraph
the exact moment when the mantle passed from father to son.,Paragraph
"On his own, Eero quickly became more famous than Eliel ever",Paragraph
had been. Saarinen’s output as a whole divides quite easily between,Paragraph
the building categories he excelled at (corporate offices and,Paragraph
airports) and others he never seemed to master (embassies and,Paragraph
"dormitories). In 1954, the State Department began a commendable",Paragraph
(if ultimately disappointing) program to improve the quality of its,Paragraph
"foreign service architecture, reflecting America’s new position as an",Paragraph
international superpower. Although several of the country’s (and the,Paragraph
"century’s) most lauded architects were enlisted—Gropius, Marcel",Paragraph
"Breuer, Paul Rudolph, and I. M. Pei among them—none delivered",Paragraph
"his best work, perhaps inhibited by notions of official decorum or",Paragraph
daunted by how to represent the nation abroad in architectural,Paragraph
form.,Paragraph
Saarinen’s skyrocketing professional status was confirmed by his,Paragraph
receiving three of these coveted commissions: an addition to the,Paragraph
"American Embassy in his homeland’s capital, Helsinki (1952-1953,",Paragraph
"but never executed), and the US Chancellery buildings in Oslo",Paragraph
(1955-1959) and London (1955-1960). The London legation offices,Paragraph
were accorded a prestigious site on Grosvenor Square in Mayfair.,Paragraph
The architect’s early sketches document his struggle with a,Paragraph
landmark urban setting worlds away from the spacious corporate,Paragraph
arcadias and idyllic campuses he was used to. He finally gave up his,Paragraph
updated Classicist attempts and defaulted to a variant of his,Paragraph
"Modernist Oslo solution: a long, relatively low, flat-roofed structure,",Paragraph
"its facade paneled with stone-framed, upright rectangular windows.",Caption
"Ten years after V-E Day, debate still raged over whether bombed-out",Paragraph
London ought to be reconstructed in a historical or contemporary,Paragraph
"manner. Saarinen somehow thought his buff-colored, New Brutalist",Paragraph
scheme was sympathetic to its redbrick Georgian surroundings. Few,Paragraph
"British critics, traditionalist or Modernist, agreed, and they stirred",Paragraph
up the biggest controversy of Saarinen’s career. The embattled,Paragraph
architect was not helped when he asked the Polish-American,Paragraph
sculptor Theodore Roszak to fashion an enormous eagle to adorn the,Paragraph
"Grosvenor Square facade. This garish gilded-aluminum mascot, with",Caption
"the wingspan of a small plane and a predatory mien, handed the",Paragraph
project’s opponents a made-to-order caricature of Ugly American,Paragraph
hubris at a time of mounting British resentment over the role,Paragraph
"reversal between the two imperial powers—ours waxing, theirs",Paragraph
waning.,Paragraph
The unprecedented growth of American higher education after,Paragraph
World War II demanded new student housing to keep up with,Paragraph
"ballooning enrollment. A year before victory, Saarinen was asked to",Paragraph
"prepare a master plan for Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio,",Paragraph
one of many institutions bracing for the influx of demobilized,Paragraph
soldiers eager to complete their education thanks to the G.I. Bill. In,Paragraph
"the typical pattern of architectural patronage, one commission begat",Paragraph
"a similar one, then another and another, but more often than not",Paragraph
Saarinen’s academic schemes were as lackluster as his State,Paragraph
Department designs. Oddly for an architect who grew up on a,Paragraph
"campus designed by his own father, he had little apparent feeling",Paragraph
"for the social aspects of student life, and his dorm layouts often",Paragraph
failed to encourage personal interaction.,Paragraph
"For example, his Hill College House of 1958-1960, a women’s",Paragraph
"dormitory at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, is",Paragraph
entered via a walkway conceived as a virtual drawbridge to,Paragraph
symbolically protect the inhabitants from male visitors. In that,Paragraph
"respect Saarinen was no different from Louis Kahn, whose Erdman",Paragraph
Hall Dormitories of 1960-1965 at Bryn Mawr College in,Paragraph
"Pennsylvania likewise resembled a medieval fortress, a defensive",Paragraph
posture that in hindsight seems even more anachronistic in light of,Paragraph
the upheavals set in motion by the feminist movement within only a,Paragraph
"few years of these buildings’ completion. Just as tellingly, the Hill",Paragraph
College House living quarters that face the inward-turning,Paragraph
structure’s central atrium are screened by louvers that suggest a,Paragraph
"zenana, the female precinct of Islamic domestic architecture. One",Paragraph
noteworthy exception to Saarinen’s social myopia was the visitors’,Paragraph
lounge at Vassar’s Emma Hartman Noyes House of 1954-1958. This,Paragraph
"secluded seating area, which the architect recessed below floor",Paragraph
"level, encouraged intimacies unanticipated by the bemused client",Paragraph
"but seized upon by grateful residents and their suitors, who dubbed",Paragraph
"Saarinen’s popular innovation “the passion pit.” However, none of",Paragraph
his many dormitory designs approached the brilliance of his,Paragraph
countryman Alvar Aalto’s Baker House of 1946-1949 at MIT. Aalto’s,Paragraph
"audacious, serpentine ground plan emerged from his desire to",Paragraph
"minimize the dehumanizing effect of long residence-hall corridors,",Paragraph
"rather than to maximize an eye-catching exterior, all too often",Paragraph
Saarinen’s seeming motivation.,Paragraph
Saarinen’s desire to make modern architecture more emotionally,Paragraph
"expressive, at a time when the late International Style seemed to be",Paragraph
"running on empty, won his office a particular following for its",Paragraph
"churches, a growth industry during the suburbanization of 1950s",Paragraph
America. But his attempts to convey spirituality through a new,Paragraph
"vocabulary of forms were only sporadically successful. Unlike Aalto,",Paragraph
who used indirect natural light to define sacred space with a power,Paragraph
"matched in modern architecture only by Le Corbusier and Kahn,",Paragraph
Saarinen relied for the most part on new iterations of familiar,Paragraph
"religious motifs. For example, the needlelike, 192-foot-high spire of",Paragraph
"his North Christian Church of 1959-1964 in Columbus, Indiana",Paragraph
"(commissioned by his most frequent patron, the industrialist J. Irwin",Paragraph
"Miller, who turned his small hometown into a Modernist",Paragraph
"architectural wonderland), updated the imagery of medieval spires",Paragraph
and proved that the fléche is not weak if the spirit is willing. His,Paragraph
most moving work of _ religious architecture was his,Paragraph
"nondenominational Kresge Chapel of 1950-1955 at MIT, the form",Paragraph
"and materials of which owe a great deal to Aalto’s Baker House, a",Paragraph
few hundred feet away. The rough-finished brick that Saarinen,Paragraph
chose for both the circular exterior and undulating interior walls of,Paragraph
this small but monumental cylinder is so similar to the cladding of,Paragraph
the undulating Baker House that direct inspiration seems certain.,Paragraph
The chapel’s windowless sanctuary is illuminated by an oculus,Paragraph
"directly above the Minimalist white marble altar, behind which is",Caption
"suspended a see-through, floor-to-ceiling metal screen of gilded",Caption
oblongs by the sculptor Harry Bertoia. Only cynics will interpret,Paragraph
Bertoia’s glittering reredos as a rain of golden banknotes fluttering,Paragraph
down from a beneficent and munificent deity.,Paragraph
Saarinen came closest to expressing the zeitgeist of the incipient,Paragraph
Space Age in his three superb aviation terminals: TWA; Dulles,Paragraph
"International Airport of 1958-1963 in Chantilly, Virginia; and",Paragraph
Ellinikon International Airport of 1960-1969 in Athens. It is hard,Paragraph
enough for an architect to rethink conventional attitudes toward,Paragraph
familiar functional problems. It is an even greater challenge for an,Paragraph
architect to invent a structure that can accommodate a function for,Paragraph
which there is little or no precedent. The latter was often required,Paragraph
"during the nineteenth century, when the proliferation of new",Paragraph
technologies prompted innovative architectural solutions that could,Paragraph
mesh modern functions with the existing urban fabric. The train,Paragraph
station is the prime example of this phenomenon: a building,Paragraph
unknown before the Industrial Revolution but essential to all cities,Paragraph
after the advent of railways.,Paragraph
Commercial air travel was no longer a novelty by the time,Paragraph
"Saarinen was hired by Trans World Airlines in 1956, but the air",Paragraph
transport industry was about to embark on a vast expansion made,Paragraph
"possible by the new generation of large-scale jet aircraft, which",Paragraph
would transform a privilege for the elite into a commonplace for the,Paragraph
masses. The idea of transcontinental and foreign air travel needed to,Paragraph
be marketed to an inexperienced public skeptical or even afraid of,Paragraph
"flying, at a time when high-fatality passenger plane crashes often",Paragraph
made headlines. All three of Saarinen’s airport schemes were,Paragraph
intended to make getting onto a plane an exciting but above all a,Paragraph
reassuring experience. While the TWA Terminal’s soaring lines,Paragraph
"suggest the common perception of it as a bird in flight, the architect",Paragraph
disclaimed any intentional resemblance and other analogies make,Paragraph
"equal sense. The womb-like, cavernous interiors flow from one into",Paragraph
another with an organic inevitability reminiscent of various,Paragraph
biological morphologies or geological formations. (The terminal was,Paragraph
"given a long-overdue renovation by its new owner, JetBlue, which",Paragraph
in 2008 returned the run-down landmark to something like its,Paragraph
original state.),Paragraph
Saarinen’s denial that he was making representational references,Paragraph
at TWA (not surprising given High Modernism’s emphasis on,Paragraph
abstraction) was the opposite of Santiago Calatrava’s latter-day,Paragraph
avowal of avian symbolism in his flock of air and rail terminals.,Paragraph
Although Saarinen has been accused of some of the same tendencies,Paragraph
now held against Calatrava—particularly a fondness for ostentatious,Paragraph
engineering displays when simpler solutions would suffice—,Paragraph
"Saarinen, even at his shallowest, had far more depth than Calatrava.",Paragraph
"Nonetheless, despite the best efforts of Saarinen’s valiant partisans,",Paragraph
their rehabilitation campaign forces the unfortunate conclusion that,Paragraph
his body of work simply cannot bear the sustained scrutiny merited,Paragraph
by the oeuvre of a true underappreciated genius of Modernism like,Paragraph
Aalto (whose lifespan overlapped Saarinen’s and exceeded it by a,Paragraph
decade at each end). The disproportionate interest in Saarinen in,Paragraph
recent years shows how historical perspective can be skewed by,Paragraph
"contemporary fixations, and how immediate concerns can make us",Paragraph
believe that we best see the past not through a clarifying lens but,Paragraph
reflected in a mirror. As Venturi mused at Yale:,Paragraph
Is it not ironical that the neo-modernism characteristic of,Paragraph
"today’s architecture, which is spectacularly expressionistic via",Paragraph
"its forms rather than richly iconographic via its symbolism, can",Paragraph
be said to represent a kind of Saarinen revival—or survival?,Paragraph

onE OF THE MOst persistent yet elusive dreams of the Modern Movement,Paragraph
in architecture has been prefabrication: industrially made structures,Paragraph
that can be assembled at a building site. Although prefabrication has,Paragraph
"a long history—the ancient Romans shipped precut stone columns,",Paragraph
"pediments, and other architectural elements to their colonies in",Paragraph
"North Africa, where the numbered parts were reassembled into",Paragraph
temples—the idea took on a new impetus with the technological,Paragraph
advances of the Industrial Revolution. Nineteenth- and early-,Paragraph
twentieth-century exponents of prefabrication were certain it would,Paragraph
supplant age-old traditions of individualized design and handcrafted,Paragraph
construction. The building art would be revolutionized by freeing,Paragraph
"designers and construction workers from repetitive tasks, and",Paragraph
democratized by making high-style architecture more affordable to,Paragraph
everyone.,Paragraph
"However, in the century and a half after the first comprehensive",Paragraph

"Palace of 1850-1851, which combined modular planning,",Paragraph
"interchangeable parts, and fast construction—entirely ready-made",Paragraph
"buildings were scarce at best, although some _ prefabricated",Paragraph
components are now used in virtually all construction. The major,Paragraph
impediment has been a matter of economics. The financial benefits,Paragraph
of prefabrication have never been as large as its advocates,Paragraph
"predicted, for although some labor costs can be reduced by machine",Paragraph
"manufacturing, on-site assembly of any building still depends to a",Paragraph
significant extent on the handwork of skilled craftsmen. The human,Paragraph
element that can never be entirely eliminated from the construction,Paragraph

"Rather than celebrating this modern innovation, Keaton—the",Paragraph
peerless master of intricately choreographed and perfectly timed,Paragraph
sight gags—imagined practically every catastrophe that could occur,Paragraph
after the pieces for a ready-to-assemble dream house were delivered.,Paragraph
It says a great deal about the overestimated potential and unfulfilled,Paragraph
promise of prefabrication that so many of these schemes were never,Paragraph

"But lack of success in bringing such schemes to reality, and even",Paragraph
"more so to widespread currency, does not necessarily condemn a",Paragraph
"designer to obscurity, and in fact quite the opposite was the good",Paragraph
"fortune of R. Buckminster Fuller, whose best-remembered",Paragraph
"conception, the geodesic dome, was far outnumbered by his many",Paragraph

progressed far beyond the drawing board or a few prototypes. Yet,Paragraph
that did not deter this relentlessly ambitious and quintessentially,Paragraph
American character from carving out a distinctive role for himself as,Paragraph
a kind of national guru of futuristic technology for more than half a,Paragraph
century. Evanescent visions of the future such as Fuller nurtured,Paragraph
throughout his quixotic career are symptomatic of troubled times,Paragraph
"like the postmillennium period, and they also were common during",Paragraph
"the politically and socially volatile 1960s, when many felt that",Paragraph
modern architecture had subsided into rote academic convention.,Paragraph

Friedman considered his designs the building blocks for an,Paragraph

"countless public lectures at colleges, conferences, and festivals",Paragraph

"lectures, which went on for as long as sixteen hours. As the ever-",Paragraph

kids eating out of his hand like he did.” Films of Fuller in action,Paragraph
make it difficult to fathom why so many were so excited by his,Paragraph
"personal appearances, except perhaps as feats of extreme endurance.",Paragraph
He was unusually short and so shortsighted that thick eyeglass,Paragraph
lenses magnified his gaze to disconcerting immensity—a,Paragraph
combination of traits that brought to mind the cartoon character Mr.,Paragraph
Magoo. Fuller’s clipped New England monotone was no match for,Paragraph
"Robert Frost’s adorable twang, but he was nonetheless clearly",Paragraph
charismatic and exerted a hypnotic effect that belied his,Paragraph
"unprepossessing appearance, as he spun out homilies on how easy it",Paragraph
would be to right all the world’s wrongs if only we followed his,Paragraph
simple instructions.,Paragraph
It was hard to disagree with much of what he said—the,Paragraph
unconscionable inequities in the global distribution of wealth ought,Paragraph
to be redressed; no one anywhere should be allowed to live in,Paragraph
"hunger, disease, or poverty; science and technology must be",Paragraph
"harnessed for peaceful purposes rather than war. However, Fuller",Paragraph
seldom got around to specifying the exact means by which these,Paragraph
much-needed but undoubtedly utopian reforms could be instituted.,Paragraph
"His rambling discourses, far less comprehensible on the printed page",Paragraph
"than they seemed when he delivered them in person, provide ample",Paragraph
proof of a fertile but scattered mind and help to explain his,Paragraph
"obsession with inventing new systems and with wordplay, which he",Paragraph
perhaps hoped would organize his hazy and disconnected ideas.,Paragraph
"(Fuller’s World Game of 1969, meant to teach the public about",Paragraph
"international resource allocation, has won him an avid constituency",Paragraph
among linguistic theorists.),Paragraph
His spellbinding delivery of fuzzy prose brings to mind his,Paragraph
"greatest architectural contemporary, Louis Kahn, similarly verbose",Paragraph
"and vague. However, Kahn was no charlatan, which cannot be said",Paragraph
"with absolute certainty of Fuller, a talented structural engineer but a",Paragraph
most unreliable social engineer who abandoned more than one of,Paragraph
"his almost-finished projects, it would seem, because the results",Paragraph
might have disproved his overreaching claims or shown his theories,Paragraph
"to have been faulty, if not downright fallacious. His most fantastic",Paragraph
invention was not the geodesic dome—in retrospect the fool’s gold,Paragraph
of mid-twentieth-century architecture—but rather the fictionalized,Paragraph
life story he fed to credulous biographers. Fuller’s self-serving and,Paragraph
auto-mythologizing version of things remained unchallenged until,Paragraph
Stanford University acquired the engineer’s archive in 1999 (sixteen,Paragraph
years after his death) and finally opened his copious papers to the,Paragraph
full scrutiny of scholars.,Paragraph
"As with Richard Nixon and his White House tapes, Fuller was the",Paragraph
agent of his own historical undoing by meticulously recording in,Paragraph
private the very activities he lied about with such impunity in,Paragraph
public. He called his omnium-gatherum of 847 life-and-works,Paragraph
"scrapbooks the Dymaxion Chronofile, but a better name might have",Paragraph
been Witness for the Prosecution because of all the damning evidence,Paragraph
"they contain. To be sure, Frank Lloyd Wright was less than wholly",Paragraph
"truthful in An Autobiography, but unlike Fuller he was unashamed to",Paragraph
"admit professional or personal setbacks, and there was often an",Paragraph
essential veracity even in the great architect’s lies. Among the first,Paragraph
scholars to make use of this revealing trove was the late Loretta,Paragraph
"Lorance, whose Becoming Bucky Fuller (2009) cites dozens of",Paragraph
instances in which he distorted or falsified significant facts about his,Paragraph
"career, claiming, for example, that he was unfairly forced out as",Paragraph
president of a prefab building materials and construction company,Title
"because of a corporate restructuring, when in fact he was let go",Paragraph
because of his own incompetence and mismanagement.,Paragraph
Richard Buckminster Fuller was born in 1895 to a distinguished,Paragraph
Massachusetts family that arrived from England six years before the,Paragraph
"founding of Harvard, which he attended for two years until he was",Paragraph
"expelled. As he recalled, “I cut classes and went out quite",Paragraph
"deliberately to get into trouble, and so naturally I got kicked out.” In",Paragraph
"1917 he married the long-suffering Anne Hewlett, of the Long Island",Paragraph
"Hewletts, but he did not give up carousing until a string of personal",Paragraph
and professional disasters led him to the brink of suicide ten years,Paragraph
"later. In his autobiography, Fuller related that just as he was about",Paragraph
"to throw himself into Lake Michigan and end it all, he was suddenly",Paragraph
encased within a “sparkling sphere of light” that levitated and,Paragraph
"hovered in midair, while a disembodied voice admonished him,",Paragraph
"“You do not have the right to eliminate yourself, you do not belong",Paragraph
to you. You belong to the universe.” That transparent celestial orb,Paragraph
and those words of cosmic consolation evoke the peculiar blend of,Paragraph
Emersonian egocentrism and pantheistic mysticism that typified the,Paragraph
"American Transcendentalists, one of whose more prominent",Paragraph
"members was Fuller’s redoubtable great-aunt, the pioneering editor,",Paragraph
"journalist, and feminist Margaret Fuller. No wonder he became such",Paragraph
"a hit with the hippies, whose mantra of “We Are All One” was",Paragraph
practically in the old man’s genes.,Paragraph
"Fuller’s reputation rests principally on his invention, in 1947, of",Paragraph
"the geodesic dome, a demispherical shelter that requires no inner",Paragraph
"columns because its continuous surface network of rods, arranged in",Paragraph
"repetitive diagonal patterns of triangles, carries the structural load.",Paragraph
"He claimed to have made his biggest discovery in kindergarten,",Paragraph
when his extreme myopia forced him to rely on touch during an,Paragraph
"arts-and-crafts project with toothpicks and dried peas, which he",Paragraph
assembled into the configuration that half a century later would,Paragraph
make him famous. It was a foundation myth Wright would have,Paragraph
been proud of. More than once Fuller was saved by his knack for,Paragraph
lucky timing; the urgent need for new construction of all kinds after,Paragraph
World War II encouraged him to promote the geodesic dome as a,Paragraph
panacea for everything from the housing shortage to industry’s shift,Title
"from military to civilian production. Deemed more economical,",Paragraph
"portable, adaptable, and reusable than conventional shelters, the",Paragraph
geodesic dome also looked futuristic in a benevolent way that,Paragraph
"appealed to the optimistic mood of a victorious America, and it",Paragraph
became the first unqualified success of his career.,Paragraph
It took some time for the drawbacks of Fuller’s beguiling,Paragraph
invention to become apparent. Those deficiencies included the large,Paragraph
amount of unusable interior space around the circumference of a,Paragraph
structure that curved down to the ground; the persistent leaks,Paragraph
"caused by the geodesic dome’s multifaceted surface, with its",Paragraph
plethora of joints and seams; and the difficulty of controlling,Paragraph
temperature and ventilation inside what is essentially a greenhouse.,Paragraph
"(Indeed, geodesic domes have been most successfully used as",Paragraph
"conservatories, including the Climatron of 1960 at the Missouri",Paragraph
"Botanical Garden in St. Louis, by the firm of Murphy and Mackey.)",Paragraph
Fuller at last achieved the official recognition he yearned for,Paragraph
"when he was asked to design the American exhibition for Expo ’67,",Paragraph
the Montreal world’s fair. Measuring 250 feet in diameter and as tall,Paragraph
"as a twenty-story building, his United States Pavilion of 1965-1967",Paragraph
—which he called the Skybreak Bubble—was the largest and most,Paragraph
fully spherical of his executed geodesic domes (see Illustration 9). It,Paragraph
was also the closest he came in his built work to memorializing the,Paragraph
otherworldly see-through orb that he said had enveloped him at the,Paragraph
"transformative moment of his life, forty years earlier. In 1995, nine",Paragraph
years after fire destroyed the structure’s transparent acrylic,Caption
"covering, the restored former pavilion reopened as the Biosphere, an",Paragraph
environmental exhibition on permanent display in a set of buildings,Caption
"constructed inside the original steel skeleton. (The outer skin, which",Paragraph
"had made the interior so costly to cool and heat, was not replaced.)",Paragraph
"Notwithstanding that obtuseness about climate control, Fuller",Paragraph
gained a wholly unmerited reputation for ecological awareness.,Paragraph
None of his schemes refutes that notion more effectively than his,Paragraph
and Sadao’s Dome over Manhattan. This much-reproduced,Paragraph
photomontage depicts a gigantic transparent cupola encircling and,Paragraph
"covering midtown Manhattan from river to river. Characteristically,",Paragraph
Fuller never sufficiently explained how this Brobdingnagian blister,Paragraph
"would be entered and exited, cleaned and maintained, how it would",Paragraph
"be built, or why it was needed. It is also a prime example of Fuller’s",Paragraph
influence on others who went on to accomplish more interesting,Paragraph
things with his ideas than he did. Dome over Manhattan,Paragraph
"foreshadowed megascale conceptual images, including Claes",Paragraph
Oldenburg’s drawing series Proposals for Monuments and Buildings of,Paragraph
1965-1969; Hans Hollein’s photomontage Aircraft Carrier City in,Paragraph
Landscape of 1964; and Gian Piero Frassinelli’s The Monument,Paragraph
"Continuous of 1969, an altered photograph by a member of the",Paragraph
visionary Superstudio collective.,Paragraph
Fuller’s direct effect on the 1960s avant-garde was not solely,Paragraph
"pictorial, however, and his concepts were also applied with notable",Paragraph
"imagination by experimental architects, including Peter Cook and",Paragraph
"Ron Herron of England’s Archigram group, and the Metabolists in",Paragraph
"Japan, including Kisho Kurokawa and Fumihiko Maki. The",Paragraph
diametrical opposite of those high-tech professionals was the,Paragraph
"American hippie commune the Droppers, whose self-built Drop City",Paragraph
"of 1966 in Trinidad, Colorado, found favor with Fuller. Rosemarie",Paragraph
"Haag Bletter has pointed out the contradictions of this odd hybrid,",Paragraph
"loosely inspired by Fuller’s geodesic domes, but ... covered",Paragraph
"with old car parts, the detritus of the official car culture. Drop",Paragraph
City won the Buckminster Fuller Dymaxion Award. The,Paragraph
experiment of twenty people living as a commune was,Paragraph
described by Peter Rabbit in Drop City (1971) as a group of,Paragraph
“total revolutionaries; we are free men living equally with free,Paragraph
creatures in a free universe. The story of Drop City will never,Paragraph
end. It’s the story of man on the road to be free.” What freedom,Paragraph
"meant was not explained, but the group spent a great deal of",Paragraph
time driving around in cars going to ... junkyards to buy,Paragraph
automobile parts for their domes.,Paragraph
It seems inevitable that the self-actualizing Fuller was drawn to,Paragraph
"automotive design, as realized in his most famous vehicular scheme,",Paragraph
"the Dymaxion “2” 4D Transport of 1934, the prototype for a",Paragraph
"zeppelin-shaped, three-wheeled car with which he planned to",Paragraph
revolutionize the automobile industry. The eleven-passenger,Paragraph
"Dymaxion car was twenty feet long, but Fuller cleverly engineered it",Paragraph
"to make a full turn within the radius of its own length, a neat trick",Paragraph
that caused mob scenes whenever the streamlined wonder was,Paragraph
"taken out for a spin. Alas, a headline-making crash of an earlier",Paragraph
model at the 1933 Century of Progress International Exposition in,Paragraph
Chicago killed the Dymaxion’s driver. Investors withdrew their,Paragraph
financing and the enterprise collapsed. (The word “Dymaxion”—a,Paragraph
"fusion of “dynamic,” “maximum,” and “ion”’—was coined by the",Paragraph
marketing-conscious inventor’s PR man. Fuller also used the term,Paragraph
"for various versions of his metal-clad Dymaxion House, including a",Paragraph
hexagonal model that was raised above the ground and suspended,Paragraph
from a central mast—patented as the 4D House in 1928—and the,Paragraph
"circular, yurt-like Dymaxion Deployment Unit of 1941.)",Paragraph
Beyond the many unresolved questions of Fuller’s highly,Paragraph
"publicized but only fitfully credible career, there remains the larger",Paragraph
"question of why prefabricated construction, and prefabricated",Paragraph
"housing in particular, has been received with much more",Paragraph
enthusiasm in Japan and Scandinavia than in this country. It is,Paragraph
always said that the American public simply does not like modern,Paragraph
design (a canard lately kept alive by adherents of the neotraditional,Paragraph
"New Urbanism Movement). However, that was not at all the case",Paragraph
"immediately after World War II, when contemporary versions of the",Paragraph
California ranch house were widely accepted nationwide. Well,Paragraph
"before that, populist forms of prefabrication like the Sears Catalogue",Paragraph
Homes of 1908-1940—a likely source for Keaton’s architectural,Paragraph
slapstick One Week—found a wide and appreciative middle-class,Paragraph
"audience. These reasonably priced, ready-to-erect dwellings were",Paragraph
offered by the Chicago-based mail-order retailer in an encyclopedic,Paragraph
"array of 447 models, from Craftsman bungalows and Cape Cod",Caption
saltboxes to Tudor cottages and Spanish haciendas—stylistic,Paragraph
"promiscuity enough to give Alfred Barr, the Museum of Modern",Paragraph
"Art’s puritanical founding director, the vapors.",Paragraph
Among those distinguished innovators who attempted prefab,Paragraph
"designs is a roll call of architectural deities—Frank Lloyd Wright, Le",Paragraph
"Corbusier, Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, Charles and Ray Eames,",Paragraph
"Jean Prouvé, and Fuller—all of whom tried, with usually less",Paragraph
"success than Sears, to harness new production techniques that could",Paragraph
make their designs more accessible to the many—a central goal of,Paragraph
the Modern Movement. Whether one reckons Fuller ludicrously,Paragraph
"overrated or insufficiently revered, his curious career and",Paragraph
achievements seem in hindsight unequal to the extraordinary,Paragraph
adulation showered upon him late in his life. Yet there is no denying,Paragraph
Fuller’s place in twentieth-century culture or his profound effect on,Paragraph

CARLO SCARPA,Title
"carLo scarpa was the greatest Venetian architect since Andrea Palladio,",Paragraph
and he remains the foremost architect of the twentieth century still,Paragraph
"unknown to the general public. When he died, in 1978 at the age of",Paragraph
"seventy-two, he left a remarkable though quite small body of work",Paragraph
that included very few buildings that were freestanding or of any,Paragraph
appreciable size. They were principally museum conversions and,Paragraph
"renovations, country villas, and tombs—homes for art, the living,",Paragraph
and the dead. Attempts to widen his renown seem doomed to,Paragraph
"failure, if the exemplary retrospective mounted in 1999 by the",Paragraph
Canadian Center for Architecture (CCA) in Montreal was any,Paragraph
indication. Yet his relevance to the most important values of,Paragraph
architecture seems stronger with each passing year. Rarely has,Paragraph
"modern architecture been as powerful, as poetic, or as cryptic as his.",Paragraph
Scarpa was much influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright’s theory of,Paragraph
"organic architecture, which proposed that all elements of a scheme",Paragraph
be conceived as inseparable parts of a unified whole. But the Italian,Paragraph
also had equally close affinities with his five-year-older,Paragraph
contemporary Louis Kahn. Both men were late bloomers whose,Paragraph
professional development was delayed by the Great Depression and,Paragraph
World War II; both were transfixed by history and were transformed,Paragraph
"by it in middle age, during the postwar years when modern",Paragraph
architecture was at its most amnesiac. By 1950 these two,Paragraph
introspective and artistically ambitious men had become repelled by,Paragraph
the spiritual emptiness and generic sameness of International Style,Title
"architecture in its later, corporate phase. To redress what they saw",Paragraph
"as the loss of physical and emotional substance in modern building,",Paragraph
"they looked back at the architecture of the past, not in an attempt to",Paragraph
imitate or revive it but instead to extract its vital essence and,Paragraph
reinterpret it for their own time in new and pertinent ways.,Paragraph
"“I have always had an immense desire to belong to tradition,”",Paragraph
"Scarpa once said, “but without having capitals and columns.” He",Paragraph
"would not use history as a grab bag of styling tricks, and would",Paragraph
have been appalled by the ignorant and heavy-handed invocation of,Paragraph
the past by the Postmodern phase in architecture that was just,Paragraph
getting underway at the time of his death. Scarpa demonstrated how,Paragraph
a contemporary architect could eloquently summon up the grandeur,Paragraph
of the ancients by using primal geometry expressed in the,Paragraph
reductivist vocabulary of the Moderns in his Veritti Tomb of 1951 at,Paragraph
"the Cemetery of San Vito in Udine (designed with Angelo Masieri), a",Paragraph
"veritable cube composed of thin slabs of stone, with a huge round",Paragraph
aperture cut into the center of the facade. A Wrightian bronze entry,Caption
"gate screens the lower third of the circle, with a hemispherical",Paragraph
Prairie School-style planter set asymmetrically to one side. Scarpa,Caption
emphasizes the inner void of the cube—the burial chamber itself—,Paragraph
by piercing the side and back walls with smaller geometric,Paragraph
openings. The roof of the mausoleum is a disk as large as the frontal,Paragraph
"opening, suspended above the graves and held free from the",Paragraph
ceiling’s vacant corners; this negativepositive form is underscored,Paragraph
by the perception that the overhead circle was removed from the,Paragraph
facade.,Caption
Despite the heroic regenerative project that Scarpa and Kahn,Paragraph
"shared, and its vast implications for reconfiguring the commercially",Paragraph
"dominated public realm of mid-twentieth-century architecture, both",Paragraph
"men are now often regarded as architects’ architects, self-absorbed",Paragraph
specialists whose fellow designers are most likely to empathize with,Paragraph
"their sometimes uningratiating forms, unrelenting geometries, and",Paragraph
what can seem like an obsessive focus on overly finicky details. It is,Paragraph
"certainly true that Scarpa, to a much greater extent than Kahn,",Paragraph
lavished intense attention on what the general public would,Paragraph
consider the little things of architecture—such subsidiary elements,Paragraph
"as door handles and hinges, wall surfaces, paving textures, stair",Paragraph
"rails, and the like. Yet he was no solipsist, and understood that it is",Paragraph
precisely on that level of tactile material intimacy and direct,Paragraph
physical engagement that most people experience a building.,Paragraph
For his 1961-1963 reworking of the ground floor and courtyard,Caption
"of the Palazzo Querini Stampalia in Venice, a sixteenth-century",Caption
"landmark that now houses an art collection and research library,",Paragraph
Scarpa took enormous pains in designing a small but intricately,Paragraph
"detailed and perfectly proportioned footbridge of wood, metal, and",Paragraph
stone that leads across a narrow canal to the building’s main,Caption
"entrance. The pleasingly gentle arc of the bridge’s steel double span,",Paragraph
"the resilient feel of the perfectly scaled wooden treads, and",Paragraph
especially the wood-and-brass handrail that is startlingly sensuous,Paragraph
to the touch offer an intriguing preview of his work inside the,Paragraph
palazzo. Scarpa’s many sheets of densely reworked preparatory,Paragraph
sketches for the little Venice bridge—“I can see an image only if I,Paragraph
"draw it,” he said—illustrate the patience and care that he invested",Paragraph
in an element of a project that most other architects of the time,Paragraph
would have breezed through by adopting a_ straightforward,Paragraph
"technological solution, or would have passed on to an underling.",Paragraph
Appropriate local materials were also central to Scarpa’s thinking,Paragraph
"wherever he worked, but above all in his native city. For an",Paragraph
entrance plaque inscribed with the name of the Querini Stampalia,Caption
"Foundation he specified Istrian stone, the Adriatic limestone long",Paragraph
used throughout the Venetian archipelago because its surface builds,Paragraph
up a protective patina against the corrosive salt air of the lagoon.,Paragraph
No commission was too mundane for him to treat with anything,Paragraph
but the utmost seriousness. In a world in which museums now,Paragraph
"sometimes seem more like shopping malls than temples of art, it is",Paragraph
sobering to look back on a time not so long ago when Scarpa made,Paragraph
a shop seem like a museum (and not of the MoMA white-cube sort).,Paragraph
His Olivetti showroom of 1957-1958 on St. Mark’s Square in Venice,Caption
was a natural extension of the pioneering business-machine firm’s,Paragraph
identification with and patronage of high-style design. Occupying,Paragraph
two bays of a retail arcade that in turn opens onto “the drawing,Caption
room of Europe” (as Napoleon is said to have dubbed the,Paragraph
"incomparable piazza), this small but imposing bottega possesses a",Paragraph
distinctly Venetian mixture of dignity and theatricality. As the,Paragraph
"American architect George Ranalli, whose own work has been",Paragraph
"deeply informed by Scarpa’s ethos, wrote in the catalog for the 1999",Paragraph
CCA exhibition:,Title
Without either sacrificing his creativity or holding back on his,Paragraph
"architectural agenda, Scarpa developed a way of connecting an",Paragraph
avant-garde design to the sensibility of the work that for,Paragraph
centuries had been produced in this quarter. One of his,Paragraph
strategies was to use the same artisanal techniques of,Paragraph
construction that had formed the historic city in order to,Paragraph
evolve new forms.,Paragraph
The Olivetti showroom’s shimmering floor of pale gold and deep,Paragraph
red Murano glass tesserae irregularly set in cement seems to draw,Paragraph
visitors inward like a flood tide (a not-unintentional metaphor for,Paragraph
the acqua alta that immerses the city with increasing frequency) and,Paragraph
"suffuses the long, narrow rooms with a warm reflected glow.",Paragraph
"Smooth, natural-colored stucco walls are outlined with simple strips",Paragraph
"of dark-stained wood, near rough concrete walls inset with narrow",Paragraph
bands of brass. The company’s products could be discreetly but,Paragraph
effectively displayed on low tables and pedestals designed by the,Paragraph
"architect, making the merchandise seem like congenial analogues to",Paragraph
"the setting rather than objects of consumer worship, an unusual",Paragraph
"distinction these days. In one corner, a low, rectangular marble",Paragraph
fountain is incised with geometric motifs that simultaneously recall,Paragraph
classical Japanese design as well as an Islamic water garden in,Paragraph
"miniature. In another corner of the ground floor, a majestic stairway",Caption
of invisibly supported marble slabs rises weightlessly to offices on,Paragraph
the mezzanine level. This ranks as one of the most extraordinary,Paragraph
interiors of any epoch in Venice.,Paragraph
"The weight of the past bore heavily on Scarpa, who was born in",Paragraph
"Venice in 1906 and grew up there and in Vicenza, the nearby",Paragraph
"capital of the Veneto region, both cities with their wealth of",Paragraph
"landmarks by Palladio. Paradoxically, Scarpa’s birthplace may be",Paragraph
"rich in architectural splendor, but in modern times it has been",Paragraph
virtually devoid of opportunities for construction beyond the,Paragraph
"preservation of the old. Well aware of that fact, he studied",Paragraph
"architecture at the city’s Academy of Fine Arts, earning a diploma in",Paragraph
architectural drawing and the right to style himself professore. But,Paragraph
because he refused to take the qualifying examination for architects,Paragraph
"required by the Italian government after World War II, Scarpa could",Paragraph
"never call himself an architect, and therefore was legally compelled",Paragraph
to work with a properly credentialed collaborator on all his projects.,Paragraph
"Incredibly, in 1956, just when his building career was beginning to",Paragraph
"soar, the invidious Venice Association of Architects sued him for",Paragraph
practicing without a license—though to the lasting honor of his,Paragraph
hometown he was acquitted of the trumped-up charges.,Paragraph
"Scarpa’s first major project, the internal restructuring of the",Paragraph
Gothic Ca’ Foscari on the Grand Canal for the University of Venice,Caption
"in 1935-1937, demonstrated his sure hand at inserting strong but",Paragraph
sympathetic modern elements into a historical framework.,Paragraph
"Returning to traditional Venetian materials, including terrazzo and",Paragraph
"scagliola (a plaster-like composite that mimics marble), he",Paragraph
employed skilled artisans to install them using age-old techniques,Paragraph
but in unmistakably modern configurations. In this way he endowed,Paragraph
the interiors with a formal purity that enhanced their low-key,Paragraph
"richness, much like Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who combined rare",Paragraph
wood or stone to great effect in large but unadorned expanses. Such,Paragraph
"projects were rare during the worldwide Great Depression, and like",Paragraph
most other Italian architects (then and now) Scarpa was forced to,Paragraph
"find alternatives to building, yet these necessary excursions into",Paragraph
other branches of design and his parallel teaching career only,Paragraph
deepened his mastery of the mother art.,Paragraph
The architect’s design work from 1926 to 1947 was most,Paragraph
"distinguished by his efforts in Murano art glass, the leading",Paragraph
industrial production of the Venetian lagoon. He worked out many,Paragraph
of his major ideas in that “minor” medium well before he was able,Paragraph
"to address them in building. Among the vases, bowls, and other",Paragraph
vessels that indicate their designer’s innate feel for the inherent,Paragraph
qualities of the material at hand (another gift that he shared with,Paragraph
his hero Wright) are several pieces that display his virtuosic ability,Paragraph
"to take historical forms—whether Roman, Chinese, Islamic, or",Paragraph
"Renaissance—simplify them greatly, inflect them wholly and",Paragraph
"credibly in a contemporary direction, and thereby make them fully",Paragraph
"his own. Taken in its entirety, Scarpa’s command of a wide range of",Paragraph
"glass-fabrication techniques, refined sense of color, and belief in",Paragraph
research as the fount of creativity confirm him as the supreme,Paragraph
Italian glass designer of the twentieth century.,Paragraph
Complicating the reuse of history for Scarpa throughout his career,Paragraph
—which began in the early years of Mussolini and ended in the,Paragraph
worst year of the Red Brigades—was the way in which the Classical,Paragraph
tradition was sullied in Italy under the Fascists. Mussolini,Paragraph
encouraged a watered-down but pumped-up simulacrum of the,Paragraph
Classical vocabulary to evoke Roman Imperial antecedents in the,Paragraph
"cynical service of his brutal regime, thereby discrediting historical",Paragraph
"form in his country long after his downfall. As a result, Scarpa and",Paragraph
his postwar contemporaries sought a figure who embodied “the,Paragraph
"architecture of democracy” and they found Wright, who detested all",Paragraph
overt revivalism and was basking in the critical acclaim that greeted,Paragraph
his late-life creative resurgence. In 1951 Wright went to Venice,Paragraph
"(where he met Scarpa) for an exhibition of his work, and a year",Paragraph
later was asked to design a small palazzo on the Grand Canal for an,Paragraph
"architectural library dedicated to the memory of Angelo Masieri,",Paragraph
Scarpa’s collaborator on the Veritti Tomb and one of his closest,Paragraph
"friends, who had recently died in a car crash soon after visiting the",Paragraph
master at Taliesin. This project fell through because of the growing,Paragraph
sentiment that contemporary architecture—even a scheme as,Paragraph
suitable as this crypto-Gothic palazzo—would compromise the,Paragraph
touristic charm of the historic city.,Paragraph
Wright’s use of integral ornament—worked directly into building,Paragraph
materials such as molded concrete block or handcrafted into details,Paragraph
that reiterated themes stated elsewhere in the structure—ran,Paragraph
counter to the International Style’s ban on applied decoration. He,Paragraph
thereby inspired Scarpa to use embellishments that are of a building,Paragraph
"rather than on it, just as he maintained that a house should be of a",Paragraph
hill rather than on it. Such characteristic Scarpan motifs as,Paragraph
horizontal rows of lines stepped inward or outward to imply a,Paragraph
"Classical molding can be traced directly to Wright, who seemed to",Paragraph
offer a viable third way between politically tainted Classicism and,Paragraph
"globally generic Modernism. Yet the American’s architecture, with",Paragraph
"its profoundly rooted sense of place, could not be transplanted as",Paragraph
"readily as the aptly named International Style, which could be",Paragraph
erected on virtually any site anywhere. Scarpa found in his native,Paragraph
"region’s indigenous crafts, traditional materials, and characteristic",Paragraph
"colors—Carpaccio pink, Titian red, Bellini ocher, and Byzantine gold",Paragraph
—a territorial grounding that no foreign influence could alter.,Paragraph
"If one spends time among Italian architects, the word interventi",Paragraph
(interventions) is bound to come up in the first few minutes of,Paragraph
"almost any conversation, and it is essential to understanding Scarpa.",Paragraph
Confrontations with and alterations of existing buildings have long,Paragraph
"formed the basis of architectural practice in Italy, whose ancient",Paragraph
history and omnipresent artistic heritage have always encouraged,Paragraph
the recycling of old buildings. The American-style obliteration of the,Paragraph
still-usable past seems in the Italian setting not merely economically,Paragraph
profligate but also culturally suicidal. That intelligent repurposing,Paragraph
was sequentially applied over several centuries to the Palazzo,Paragraph
"Abatellis in Palermo, which was badly damaged during World War",Paragraph
II. Scarpa was nearing fifty when in 1953 he received his first major,Paragraph
museum commission: to remodel the palazzo to house the medieval,Title
and modern art collections of the Sicilian state. He was brought into,Paragraph
the project once the physically compromised structure was,Paragraph
"stabilized by other architects and, working against a tight deadline",Paragraph
"and on a small budget, was charged with the creation of gallery",Paragraph
spaces and new installation components.,Paragraph
"He rejected the notion that a building’s past lives should, or even",Paragraph
"could, be effaced or concealed, and thus openly treated the historic",Paragraph
survivor as a palimpsest. The accidental contributions of time and,Paragraph
"fate were welcomed by Scarpa, who did not seek superficial",Paragraph
perfection. Reopening a disused quarry to find the exact match for,Paragraph
old stonework—a practice not unheard of among _ historic,Paragraph
"preservationists—would never have occurred to him. In his work,",Paragraph
awkward joints between earlier portions of a building and his,Paragraph
interventi were exalted rather than eradicated.,Paragraph
"Writing in the 1999 CCA catalog, the architect Jorge Silvetti sums",Paragraph
up the master’s noninvasive and yet revelatory strategy:,Paragraph
The slab of travertine that he adds next to a medieval stone,Caption
wall acts as an emblem of his architecture. Such a sliver of,Paragraph
space joins them ... yet at the same time it literally separates,Paragraph
"them, puts air in between, and ... makes unequivocal what is",Paragraph
new and what is old; that slice of space is also the space of his,Paragraph
signature.,Paragraph
Scarpa would study closely the color and texture of the buildings,Paragraph
"he was entrusted to improve, but was improvisational enough to",Paragraph
know that handsome results could be achieved in a variety of ways,Paragraph
and often worked directly with craftsmen on-site to do so. Some of,Paragraph
the walls at the Palazzo Abatellis were plastered in a natural off-,Paragraph
"white tone or tinted a velvety light olive-green, while others were",Paragraph
"left in their original exposed masonry, but all were deemed worthy",Paragraph
as backdrops for painting and sculpture. The architect’s,Paragraph
"unpretentious but exquisitely wrought display devices, which",Paragraph
"received their first major exposure here, helped change the way in",Paragraph
which art objects are presented to the public. Plinths of rough,Paragraph
"concrete, sculpture bases combining raw welded steel with smoothly",Paragraph
"polished ebony, and clamp-like metal brackets jutting out from",Paragraph
walls and even suspending objects in midair knocked traditional art,Paragraph
off its cliché pedestal and gave a modern immediacy to works,Paragraph
"centuries old, a technique now followed in museums around the",Paragraph
"world, though rarely with Scarpa’s inventive attention to detail.",Paragraph
Sensitive to how certain artworks were originally meant to be,Paragraph
"viewed, he tried to approximate such settings wherever practicable.",Paragraph
"At the Palazzo Abatellis, for example, he positioned an anonymous",Paragraph
fifteenth-century fresco of The Triumph of Death in the apse of the,Caption
"Gothic chapel of the former monastery, the better to convey the",Paragraph
painting’s emotional impact at the end of a long enfilade as part of a,Paragraph
sequence of religious images dealing with the life cycle.,Paragraph
"Scarpa’s most impressive installation, daring in its simplicity, is",Paragraph
his addition to the Canova Plaster Cast Gallery of 1955-1957 in,Paragraph
"Possagno, in the Veneto, which preserves the working prototypes of",Paragraph
the preeminent Neoclassical sculptor. In a period when white walls,Paragraph
"had become a museological article of faith, Scarpa was not afraid to",Paragraph
"use color, often deeply saturated pigment, when he thought it best",Paragraph
for specific galleries. Yet rather than contrasting Canova’s pale,Paragraph
"monochromatic sculptures against darker backgrounds, he made a",Paragraph
riskier decision and kept the walls of his galleries light to maximize,Paragraph
"reflectivity, and used tall, narrow cuts at right angles into the upper",Paragraph
corners of the cubic galleries to flood the casts with natural,Paragraph
illumination. Though Canova was termed “the erotic Frigidaire” by,Paragraph
"the critic Thomas B. Hess, his figures have never seemed more",Paragraph
"fleshly, animated, or sensuous than they do in Scarpa’s warming",Paragraph
bath of daylight.,Paragraph
His third great (and most complex) gallery scheme was for the,Paragraph
"Castelvecchio Museum of 1956-1973 in Verona, a fourteenth-",Paragraph
century fortress that became a barracks under the Napoleonic,Paragraph
"occupation and a museum in the 1920s, when the bastion was",Paragraph
gussied up with pseudo-Gothic detailing and fake Renaissance,Paragraph
decor. As Ranalli has written of this scheme:,Paragraph
"Rather than viewing restoration as the opposite of renovation,",Paragraph
"Scarpa embarked on an intriguing strategy of demolition,",Paragraph
"change, and modification. He layered history, allowing each",Paragraph
historical moment to come alive and take its place next to the,Paragraph
others. Eventually functioning as a curator in deciding how to,Paragraph
"treat each fragment of the existing structure, he removed some",Paragraph
"elements, restored others, and interspersed new ones. He was",Paragraph
able to achieve this while setting up a dialogue between old,Paragraph
"and new, provoking the older elements into conversation with",Paragraph
"wholly invented new forms, surfaces, textures, and motifs.",Paragraph
"The jewel of Castelvecchio is Scarpa’s sacello, or treasure chest, a",Paragraph
small reliquary-like structure built to house a few remarkable,Paragraph
Longobardic antiquities. The exterior of this severely cubic masonry,Caption
"container is faced with a syncopated, mosaic-like checkerboard",Paragraph
"pattern of small rose- and cream-colored stone squares, alternatingly",Paragraph
"rough-hewn and matt-finished, which impart an almost Byzantine",Paragraph
"sparkle and sumptuousness. Inside, dark olive-green plaster walls",Paragraph
and a concealed skylight add to its air of mystery and concentrate,Paragraph
attention on the precious objects within. Epitomizing Scarpa’s,Paragraph
genius for revitalization is his placement of the Castelvecchio,Paragraph
"Museum’s most famous artifact, a white marble equestrian statue of",Paragraph
the fourteenth-century condottiere Cangrande della Scala. Scarpa,Caption
perched it atop a second-story bridge in a loggia that he created to,Paragraph
separate the Napoleonic addition from the medieval fortress. He,Paragraph
angled the effigy of horse and rider to emphasize its autonomy from,Paragraph
"the architecture and to increase its visibility from several directions,",Paragraph
and put it where visitors must pass several times during their route,Paragraph
through the galleries and thus encounter it each time from a,Paragraph
different and newly telling perspective.,Paragraph
Scarpa’s masterpiece is the Brion Family Tomb and Chapel of,Paragraph
1969-1978 in San Vito d’Altivole in the Veneto (see Illustration 10).,Caption
If modern religious architecture fell on hard times because of a,Paragraph
concomitant crisis of belief and the growing secularization of,Title
"Western culture, then twentieth-century funerary art fell into the",Paragraph
abyss. There are but a handful of other great modern structures that,Paragraph
"deal effectively with death, most notably Gunnar Asplund’s",Paragraph
Crematorium of 1935-1940 at Stockholm South Cemetery and Aldo,Caption
Rossi’s San Cataldo Cemetery of 1971-1984 in Modena. Giuseppe,Caption
"Brion was the founder, with his wife, Onorina Tomasin, of",Paragraph
"Brionvega, the Milan-based electronics manufacturer renowned",Paragraph
"during the 1950s and 1960s for its elegantly designed radios,",Paragraph
"televisions, and sound equipment. A year after her husband’s death",Paragraph
"in 1968 at the age of fifty-nine, the widow Brion thought in the",Paragraph
same terms of aesthetic excellence and commissioned Scarpa to,Paragraph
create an equally superb final resting place in her husband’s native,Paragraph
village.,Paragraph
The architect saw the project as a chance to give full expression to,Paragraph
ideas that he had been nurturing for some time. “All great,Paragraph
"architecture is rational,” he declared, “but great art is created only",Paragraph
when spiritual and imaginative elements appear in it—the,Paragraph
"irrational, which constitutes its inspired, creative function.” Above",Paragraph
"all, he wished to address in built form what he called “the great",Paragraph
open questions in which modern rational thinking has no place.”,Paragraph
"Scarpa conceived the large, inverted-L-shaped Brion plot in an outer",Paragraph
corner of the town burial ground in terms of a spiritual journey,Paragraph
through a metaphorical landscape—“del cammin di nostra vita” (the,Paragraph
"pathway of our life), in Dante’s deathless phrase.",Paragraph
"An inward-tilting, concrete peripheral rampart sets the site apart",Paragraph
from its varied surroundings—farm fields on one side (where crops,Paragraph
grow to the full height of the wall and completely obscure it from,Paragraph
"view in that direction), houses on another, with the cemetery’s",Paragraph
conventional grave monuments ranked in grid patterns within the,Paragraph
"arms of the L. With its several reflecting pools, water channels, and",Paragraph
"clusters of columnar cypresses, the Brion precinct appears to float",Paragraph
"like an island, recalling the cemetery of San Michele in the Venetian",Paragraph
"lagoon, which Scarpa knew from earliest childhood and where he",Paragraph
"built several tombs in the 1940s, or the much-reproduced painting",Paragraph
"Die Toteninsel (The Isle of the Dead), produced in several versions",Paragraph
during the 1880s by the Swiss Symbolist Arnold Bécklin.,Paragraph
The visitor’s progress through the grounds of the Brion Tomb is as,Paragraph
carefully controlled as that through a classical Japanese stroll,Paragraph
"garden, with sightlines restricted and perspectives directed to foster",Paragraph
an impression of limitless space in a relatively small area. The,Paragraph
disposition of three major elements in three corners of the site,Caption
further maximizes one’s experience of the whole. The cubic chapel,Paragraph
(rotated ninety degrees within the grid of the cemetery) and the,Paragraph
"rectangular water pavilion each occupy a different far end of the L,",Paragraph
with the circular burial vault of the Brions equidistant at the right,Caption
angle between them. Scarpa’s illusion of infinite extension begins,Paragraph
"with the propylaeum, a tightly enclosed concrete entry corridor that",Paragraph
"recalls Wright’s restricted transitional spaces, which make the areas",Paragraph
beyond them seem larger in contrast.,Paragraph
"At the entry to that covered walkway, one wall is punctuated by",Paragraph
"an aperture of two large overlapping circles, outlined in blue and",Paragraph
"gold mosaic, an ancient motif known in Latin as the vesica piscis",Paragraph
"(fish bladder), also used as a proportioning device in Gothic",Paragraph
architecture and as a ritualistic symbol by Freemasons. (Scarpa,Paragraph
repeated that motif in small marble inlays behind the chapel altar.),Paragraph
This modern reiteration of an archaic symbol of marital fidelity and,Paragraph
"eternity—two intertwined rings, but also a diagram in silhouette of",Paragraph
a solar eclipse—frames a poignant first glimpse through the opening,Paragraph
"of the actual gravesite, with its pair of marble sarcophagi set just",Paragraph
"below grade beneath a low, bridge-like canopy, angled to be visible",Paragraph
"from the far ends of the L. Hugely affecting, this vista through the",Paragraph
double-ringed opening brings to mind the words from Oscar Wilde’s,Paragraph
Salome: “And the mystery of love is greater than the mystery of,Paragraph
death.”,Paragraph
"The propylaeum leads both to the water pavilion, a contemplative",Paragraph
"space with an atmosphere of absolutely Eastern tranquillity, and in",Paragraph
"the opposite direction, around a corner toward the chapel. That",Paragraph
"Catholic sanctuary, though strikingly devoid of Christian symbolism,",Paragraph
"is a deeply moving place, one of those rare works of modern",Paragraph
religious architecture (Le Corbusier’s Ronchamp chapel being,Paragraph
another prime example) that communicates not intellectually but,Paragraph
"viscerally. The precast concrete exterior is almost Classical, with its",Paragraph
symmetrically placed entry door and rhythmically repeated motifs—,Paragraph
"tall, narrow windows framed by pilaster-like panels beneath a step-",Paragraph
banded cornice.,Caption
"The chapel’s interior, a dark, angular volume of concrete walls",Paragraph
"beneath a ziggurat-stepped ceiling, is unremitting in its solemnity. A",Paragraph
grave-size slab of marble set flush into the mosaic floor at the foot,Caption
of the lectern-like altar—a minimalist abstraction of the catafalque,Paragraph
"—leaves no doubt about this space’s funerary function, a place that",Paragraph
"awaits the inevitable hour. The narrow, ceiling-high windows, the",Paragraph
"skylight at the apex of the coffered ceiling, and a series of four",Caption
"small, square, hinged alabaster panels on either side of the altar all",Caption
admit slanting rays of light that mitigate the gloom and allude to,Paragraph
"the cosmos. The scale is at once intimate and monumental, focusing",Paragraph
on the individual and inescapable nature of death while elevating,Paragraph
the personal into the realm of the transcendent.,Paragraph
"This, in the end, is what the sublimely enigmatic architecture of",Paragraph
Scarpa at its best accomplishes. His work has sometimes been,Paragraph
"dismissed as too personal and hermetic to be widely emulated, but",Paragraph
such a criticism misses the entire point of what he achieved. Scarpa,Paragraph
wanted architecture to be more alive to its own time but also more,Paragraph
alive to all that had gone before it; to be one with its surroundings,Paragraph
but also to make a place more vivid than it had been before. “The,Paragraph
"problems involved are the same as ever,” he said of modern",Paragraph
architecture. “Only the answer changes.” The Brion Tomb had just,Paragraph
"been finished when its architect traveled to his beloved Japan,",Paragraph
whose design ethos so profoundly influenced his own. While in the,Paragraph
"northern city of Sendai, he fell down a flight of concrete steps, was",Paragraph
"critically injured, and died ten days later. His body was returned to",Paragraph
"the Veneto, where it was wrapped in a linen winding sheet and",Paragraph
"immured in a peripheral wall of his newly completed necropolis,",Paragraph
"standing up in the manner of a medieval knight, befitting a heroic",Paragraph
condottiere of the building art.,Paragraph

JAMES STIRLING,Title
FEW Younc aricionapos Of the building art now realize how large James,Paragraph
Stirling loomed on the international architecture scene during the,Paragraph
"two decades before he died, in 1992, at the age of sixty-eight. Apart",Paragraph
"from the eager embrace of his avant-garde colleagues, who saw in",Paragraph
"him the harbinger of thrilling new design directions, Stirling in his",Paragraph
white-hot heyday was as celebrated by youthful fans as Rem,Paragraph
Koolhaas is today—a veritable rock star of the profession who,Paragraph
"lectured to capacity audiences, was lionized by critics, became a",Paragraph
"fixture on short lists for prestigious cultural commissions, and",Paragraph
attracted applicants from all over the world to study with him at,Paragraph
"Yale, where he was an influential and much-loved visiting professor",Paragraph
for nearly a quarter of a century. (One characteristically,Paragraph
idiosyncratic representational method that he popularized among,Paragraph
several generations of Yale architecture students was his novel,Paragraph
"“worm’s-eye-view” perspective drawing, which depicts a building as",Paragraph
if seen from below ground.),Paragraph
Now Stirling is best remembered for his dramatic mid-career,Paragraph
stylistic shift from mechanistic forms and _ industrial-looking,Paragraph
materials associated with the early Heroic Period of the Modern,Paragraph
Movement—the post-World War I concatenation exemplified by the,Paragraph
"revolutionary schemes of Le Corbusier, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,",Paragraph
"the Russian Constructivists, and Holland’s De Stijl group—and his",Paragraph

"from around 1975 to 1990, borrowed motifs from earlier periods in",Paragraph
implicit sympathy with the alleged communicative power of the,Paragraph
building art’s age-old signs and symbols. Stirling’s Postmodern,Paragraph
designs derived in part from the English Baroque (particularly,Paragraph
"Nicholas Hawksmoor and John Vanbrugh, both with strong",Paragraph
Mannerist tendencies) and German Neoclassicism (including,Paragraph
Friedrich Weinbrenner and Karl Friedrich Schinkel). But he mixed,Paragraph
ideas explored by those architects with early Modernist engineering,Title
"concepts and vernacular industrial construction techniques, which",Paragraph
gave his work a hybrid character that made him difficult to,Paragraph
categorize among his peers. His nearest contemporary analogue was,Paragraph
"the Milanese architect Aldo Rossi, who likewise mined the Classical",Paragraph
tradition to impressive effect on occasion.,Paragraph
"Stirling—whom I got to know somewhat when my wife, the",Paragraph
"architectural historian Rosemarie Haag Bletter, and I worked on an",Paragraph
eponymous 1986 documentary film about him commissioned by the,Paragraph
BBC in conjuntion with German and Swedish television and directed,Paragraph

that his body of work divides quite evenly into two distinct phases,Paragraph
"marked by his volte-face of the mid-1970s, when he started to",Paragraph
"combine Modern and Classical styles. Instead, he insisted that all his",Paragraph
designs shared an inner consistency despite superficial disparities.,Paragraph
But even a cursory examination of his life story reveals equally,Paragraph

As a boy Stirling found an emotional outlet in his love of bird-,Paragraph

classic The Birds of the Liverpool Area (1941). Conscripted into the,Paragraph

system in ways both big and small.,Paragraph

"Stirling was “a handful, and I realised that,... I thought that with my",Paragraph
background I could cope.” Girouard’s commendable determination,Paragraph
to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth—including a,Paragraph
detailed account of the late-life affair that came close to ending his,Paragraph
subject’s marriage—led Stirling’s widow to withdraw her support for,Paragraph
what had started out as the architect’s authorized biography.,Paragraph
Stirling’s early works in England—especially his university,Paragraph
"commissions of the 1950s and 1960s at Oxford, Cambridge, and",Paragraph
"Leicester universities, his so-called Red Trilogy (so named for the",Paragraph
"coloration of their redbrick cladding, the building material that",Paragraph
became synonymous with the expansion and democratization of,Paragraph
British higher education in the postwar years)—would alone justify,Paragraph
a long-overdue reassessment. The first of the two uncontested peaks,Paragraph
of Stirling’s career was his and James Gowan’s Engineering Building,Paragraph
"of 1959-1963 at the University of Leicester (see Illustration 11a),",Paragraph
which reiterated readily identifiable early Modernist details in a,Paragraph
way that had been unthinkable in a profession that had only lately,Paragraph
"abjured the direct copying of Greek, Roman, Romanesque, Gothic,",Paragraph
"Renaissance, and other historical prototypes. But now it is easy to",Paragraph
see Stirling’s borrowings from early Modernist antecedents in the,Paragraph
1960s as a forerunner of his Classical appropriations during the,Paragraph
"1980s, a kind of Postmodernism avant l’heure.",Paragraph
"For Leicester, Stirling and Gowan (who ended their association",Paragraph
soon after that job was finished) designed two wedge-shaped lecture,Paragraph
theaters that thrust outward from the base of the slender office,Paragraph
tower like giant diving platforms. These were modeled after,Paragraph

while Leicester’s wraparound strip windows bring to mind Wright’s,Paragraph
"S. C. Johnson Research Tower of 1944-1951 in Racine, Wisconsin.",Caption
The Red Trilogy also owes a huge debt to Alvar Aalto’s University of,Paragraph
"Jyvaskyla in Finland, begun in 1951, although Stirling’s sense of site",Paragraph
planning at that point in his development was nowhere near as,Paragraph
sophisticated as that of the older and more experienced Finnish,Paragraph
architect.,Paragraph
Some critics have maintained that the Leicester Engineering,Paragraph
Building (subsequent work by Gowan supports his partner’s primary,Paragraph
authorship here) in effect puts quotation marks around some of the,Paragraph
best-known motifs of early twentieth-century architecture and thus,Paragraph
treats the Modern Movement as a swipe file rather than a set of,Paragraph
philosophical principles. But as Stirling would later do in very,Paragraph
different ways in his and Michael Wilford’s Neue Staatsgalerie of,Paragraph
"1977-1983 in Stuttgart (see Illustration 11b), he united these",Paragraph
potentially discordant elements with consummate assurance and,Paragraph
"complete coherence and, early or late, could never be defined or",Paragraph
dismissed as a mere pasticheur.,Paragraph
Once Stirling’s practice finally started to prosper in the late 1960s,Paragraph
"with corporate commissions from Olivetti and Siemens, he",Paragraph
assembled an important collection—which he installed in his Arts,Paragraph
and Crafts-style house in London’s Belsize Park—of vigorously,Paragraph
"scaled, museum-quality Regency furniture by such then-undervalued",Paragraph
figures as George Bullock and Thomas Hope. These pieces he mixed,Paragraph

"The ways that win, the arts that please play a crucial role in",Paragraph
"successful architectural practice, as proven par excellence by Philip",Paragraph
"Johnson and I. M. Pei, two born charmers and diplomats whose",Paragraph
relative lack of native talent was far outweighed by their ability to,Paragraph
"court, land, and keep clients. Nikolaus Pevsner, the godlike doyen of",Paragraph
"British architectural historians, let his judgment stray from the",Paragraph
professional to the personal when he bitterly remarked that “Stirling,Paragraph
"is a rude man, and the buildings he designs are rude as well.” Such",Paragraph
"personal animus aside, one cannot but conclude that Stirling’s",Paragraph
abundant architectural gifts were subverted by his deep-seated,Paragraph
personality flaws. Problems were evident early on. The property,Paragraph

Neuilly—found the young Stirling (as the developer’s son later told,Paragraph
Girouard) to be,Paragraph
a terrible prima donna.... He has a very feminine side to him.,Paragraph
"He’s rather like a dressmaker producing a dress, and there are",Paragraph
terrible scenes if I want the windows to be two inches lower or,Paragraph

would like them.,Paragraph
"Stirling’s biographer struggled manfully to show a kinder, gentler",Paragraph
"side of his rumbustious subject, but there is no denying that the",Paragraph
architect was self-defeatingly off-putting to would-be supporters and,Paragraph
"potential clients alike. For example, his most strenuous advocate",Paragraph
"was the critic Charles Jencks, who saw in the Stuttgart Neue",Paragraph
Staatsgalerie perfect justification for his belief in Postmodernism as,Paragraph
"the wave of the architectural future. However, Jencks had one cavil",Paragraph
about the new museum: he disliked an off-the-rack industrial storm,Paragraph
"drain that Stirling placed at the center of the rotunda pavement, and",Paragraph
suggested instead a representational sculpture to glorify the,Paragraph
building’s symbolic omphalos. Stirling repaid his thankless exponent,Paragraph
by referring to him in public lectures thereafter as “Charlie Junk.”,Paragraph
Certainly the frustrations of keeping an avant-garde architectural,Paragraph
"practice solvent in postwar Britain were enormous, and no doubt",Paragraph
"took their psychic toll on Stirling, whose office on more than one",Paragraph
"occasion was without any work whatever. During the 1970s, a",Paragraph
recessionary decade when the worldwide dearth of construction,Title
prompted architects to produce hypothetical schemes or publish,Paragraph
"dossiers of their earlier designs, he magnified his status with the",Paragraph
"instant cult classic James Stirling: Buildings & Projects, 1950-1974, a",Caption
precursor of Koolhaas’s best-selling and considerably thicker,Paragraph
"S,M,L,XL (1995). Stirling’s strikingly laid-out automonograph was a",Paragraph
"self-promotional picture book, and its close resemblance to Le",Paragraph
Corbusier’s Quvre compléte was hardly coincidental.,Paragraph
The architectural historian Anthony Vidler has plausibly,Paragraph
interpreted Stirling’s mid-career recourse to Classical motifs as a,Paragraph
natural by-product of his architectural training at the University of,Paragraph
Liverpool during that postwar interregnum in English design,Paragraph
education when the Beaux Arts Classical tradition still lingered on,Paragraph
but Modernism had not yet fully taken root. Even if one accepts,Paragraph
Stirling at his word that he made his big stylistic shift not for,Paragraph
"opportunistic reasons, when Postmodernism became the latest",Paragraph
"architectural fashion, but to find greater expressive range than the",Paragraph
"restrictive Modernist vocabulary allowed, there has been little",Paragraph
evidence since his death to change one’s view of a markedly,Paragraph
bifurcated oeuvre. Stirling’s posthumous reputation has languished,Paragraph
largely because of diminished critical regard for Postmodernism. He,Paragraph
"was arguably its most successful practitioner, as demonstrated by",Paragraph
"his and Wilford’s indisputable masterpiece, the Neue Staatsgalerie,",Paragraph
"the first (and, some would say, only) evidence that the Classical",Paragraph
vocabulary could still yield the expressive force Stirling ascribed to,Paragraph
it.,Paragraph
The Stirling and Wilford office was at a near standstill when the,Paragraph
"firm received this major commission, part of the extraordinary spree",Paragraph
of German museum construction in the years just before,Paragraph
reunification. Nominally an addition to a mid-nineteenth-century,Paragraph
"Neoclassical art gallery, this ingenious synthesis of monumental",Paragraph
architecture and humane city planning not only ameliorated some of,Paragraph
the more egregious blunders of Stuttgart’s postwar urban renewal,Paragraph
"but created, in the museum’s majestic roofless rotunda, one of the",Paragraph
finest civic spaces in modern Europe. Although its conventional,Paragraph
"picture galleries are adequate and nothing more, the entire",Paragraph
"ensemble has aged handsomely, unlike the dated appearance and",Paragraph
shabby condition of so many public works from that period.,Paragraph
"The Neue Staatsgalerie is loaded with visual jests, mainly insider",Paragraph
"jokes best appreciated by architectural cognoscenti, including a",Paragraph
Weinbrenneresque columned portal that seems to sink into the,Paragraph
"rotunda’s pavement through a “trapdoor,” and sandstone walls that",Paragraph
lack connective mortar and flaunt (to specialists who notice such,Paragraph
things) their nonstructural nature by revealing how the steel,Paragraph
framework behind actually does the heavy lifting. Yet this extensive,Paragraph
"composition, which covers several city blocks, is at once boldly",Paragraph
assertive and deferentially adaptive. It meshes so smoothly with its,Paragraph
"surroundings that one can only agree with Jencks, who called it",Paragraph
“more an articulation of urban tissue than a conventional building.”,Paragraph
"Stirling’s most effective use of color was at the Neue Staatsgalerie,",Paragraph
with a palette initially controversial but in due course widely,Paragraph
emulated. To take the curse of bourgeois stodginess off the sober,Paragraph
"sandstone cladding, he specified that his exaggeratedly fat metal",Paragraph
"handrails be painted shocking pink and electric blue, with the metal",Paragraph
framing of the undulating glass window-walls of the reception hall,Caption
"painted an even more jolting poison green, the same shade as the",Paragraph
Pirelli raised-disk rubber-tile flooring the visitor encounters on,Caption
entering the building. Although Stirling fancied himself an adept,Paragraph
"colorist, sometimes he clearly did not know when to stop. Many of",Paragraph
the widely admired monochromatic drawings that emerged from the,Paragraph
Stirling and Wilford office during the 1970s were in fact rendered,Paragraph
by Léon Krier (the Luxembourg-born architect who went on to,Paragraph
design the neotraditional Dorset new town of Poundbury for Prince,Caption
Charles). The bilious greens and dingy blues that Stirling,Paragraph
subsequently superimposed on Krier’s delicate black-and-white,Paragraph
originals—several of which include Hitchcock-cameo depictions of,Paragraph
Stirling and his favorite pieces of Regency furniture—led Girouard,Paragraph
to report that,Paragraph
Krier was quite rightly infuriated to find that Jim had coloured,Paragraph
many of his drawings for the Black Book and elsewhere.,Paragraph
Among others the wonderful worm’s-eye axonometric of the,Paragraph
"Florey Building [at Oxford], and the famous drawing of Jim",Paragraph
"and his Hope furniture were, in effect, ruined in this way.",Paragraph
There may have been an element of jealousy or mischief in,Paragraph
what Jim did.,Paragraph
The causes of Stirling’s creative decline during his final decade,Paragraph
"are impossible to ascertain, but he was to some extent a casualty of",Paragraph
the jet-age architectural treadmill that he mordantly termed “the,Paragraph
circus’—a punishing nonstop international round of pitches for,Paragraph
"competitive commissions, speaking engagements to generate",Paragraph
"publicity, participation in conferences to validate his peer-group",Paragraph
"credentials, and visiting professorships to guarantee a steady cash",Paragraph
flow. As with many experimental architects whose uncertain,Paragraph
workload requires outside sources of income to help keep an office,Paragraph
"and staff afloat, Stirling’s peripatetic existence was further",Paragraph
necessitated because he was suspect in Britain for questionable,Paragraph
technical abilities that subverted his job prospects there. That bum,Paragraph
rap stemmed from functional problems that plagued his poorly,Paragraph
maintained Cambridge University History Faculty Building of 1964—,Caption
"1967, the reading room of which is covered by a gigantic tentlike",Paragraph
glass roof that leaked incessantly. (An unexpected supporter of the,Paragraph
"design was Isaiah Berlin, who liked it because it was not a pastiche",Paragraph
"of antique forms.) Not until the following decade, when Stirling was",Paragraph
taken up by a series of sympathetic German patrons (and aided by,Paragraph
"German engineers, contractors, and craftsmen far superior to their",Paragraph
"often lackadaisical British counterparts), did he shed the stigma of",Paragraph
lax execution.,Paragraph
His personal presentation worked against him as well. The,Paragraph
"Pavarotti of architecture, Stirling weighed more than three hundred",Paragraph
"pounds—how much is unknown, for his physician’s scale went no",Paragraph
higher—and if not an outright alcoholic he was certainly a very,Paragraph
heavy drinker. (I recall taking this Falstaffian figure to dinner at the,Paragraph
"trendy North London restaurant Carrier’s in the early 1980s, when",Paragraph
he guzzled bottle after bottle of some costly Rothschild wine as if it,Paragraph
were water on a hot summer’s day. He brought along his uninvited,Paragraph
"teenage son, Ben, whom he importuned, to the young man’s evident",Paragraph
"embarrassment, “Drink up, boy, you won’t get claret like this every",Paragraph
"day!”) In 1984, the impending decision about who would win the",Paragraph
"coveted commission for the Getty Center in Los Angeles, which",Paragraph
came down to two finalists—Stirling and Richard Meier—prompted,Paragraph
"a member of the selection committee, the great British architectural",Paragraph
"historian and Stirling admirer Reyner Banham, to tell me",Paragraph
pessimistically that the decision would hang on whomever Getty,Paragraph
officials preferred to dine with over the next several years. Quite,Paragraph
"possibly the prospect of endless boozy, gluttonous evenings with",Paragraph
"Stirling pushed them into the arms of Meier, though as the loser",Paragraph
"sourly but accurately predicted, “They’ll get another washing",Paragraph
"machine.” However, by the time this thirteen-year project was",Paragraph
"completed, the unlucky Stirling had been dead for half a decade. He",Paragraph
succumbed to complications from abdominal surgery twelve days,Paragraph
after the queen knighted him.,Paragraph
Nothing Stirling and Wilford did after Stuttgart ever rose to that,Paragraph
level of excellence. As often happens in an underappreciated,Paragraph
"architect’s homeland once he is acclaimed for work built abroad,",Paragraph
Stirling was rediscovered by the British after his German coup,Paragraph
"d’estime, and his office again began to receive important",Paragraph
commissions in England after nearly a decade of stony indifference.,Paragraph
"Among those jobs was Number One Poultry of 1985-1998, a mid-",Paragraph
rise mixed-use commercial building for a prestigious triangular site,Paragraph
"in the City of London facing Mansion House, the lord mayor’s",Caption
official residence. This Postmodern project was backed by the,Paragraph
"property developer Peter Palumbo, whose two-decade struggle to",Paragraph
erect Mies’s International Style bronze-and-glass Mansion House,Paragraph
Tower of 1967—a nineteen-story mini-Seagram Building—ran,Paragraph
aground thanks to the outspoken opposition of Prince Charles. No,Paragraph
doubt Palumbo calculated that in the afterglow of his Stuttgart,Paragraph
"museum, Stirling was the man of the hour who could propel the",Paragraph
long-stalled effort to completion. Palumbo thought his intuition was,Paragraph
"confirmed when Charles told him, “You can rest assured that this is",Paragraph
"one scheme I shan’t be saying anything about.” However, the fickle",Paragraph
prince later denounced it on television as a “1930s wireless set.” In,Paragraph
"fact, Number One Poultry—clad in alternatingly toned horizontal",Paragraph
"sandstone stripes, much like Stuttgart—more closely resembles a",Paragraph
"decapitated Sphinx, its subliminally Egyptoid aura reinforced by a",Paragraph
bloated scale that overwhelms its decorous surroundings far more,Paragraph
than Mies’s elegant Minimalist tower would have done.,Paragraph
"In 1986, Stirling and Wilford were also passed over in favor of the",Paragraph
Americans Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown for the Sainsbury,Caption
"Wing, an extension to London’s National Gallery. The following year",Paragraph
"the British partners completed their Clore Gallery, a substantial",Paragraph
wing at the city’s Tate Gallery for the work of J.M.W. Turner. The,Caption
"Clore was conceived by Stirling as a metaphorical garden pavilion,",Paragraph
which he clad in a superscale gridwork pattern that gives the,Paragraph
"inverted L-shaped pairing of two shoe-box-like volumes a repetitive,",Paragraph
"rectilinear, mock-Elizabethan air. But any Tudor revivalism was",Paragraph
countered by the incorporation of a massive limestone entry,Paragraph
surround with Mycenaean overtones. It says a great deal that the,Paragraph
"Clore looks best late at night, dimly lit. The upper-story interiors,",Paragraph
"however, were meant to be viewed in the full natural light of day,",Paragraph
and some of the colors Stirling selected for those display spaces,Paragraph
"were hideous, especially a cloying raspberry-mousse hue that has",Paragraph
fortunately been replaced with neutral tones more hospitable to the,Paragraph
Turners hung there.,Paragraph
"Emboldened by his way with color at Stuttgart, Stirling went to",Paragraph
even greater extremes in his and Wilford’s pink-and-blue-banded,Paragraph
Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin ftir Sozialforschung of 1979-1987 in,Paragraph
"the German capital, their expansion of a social-sciences think tank",Paragraph
"adjacent to the city’s Kulturforum, a jumble of dissonant high-style",Paragraph
Modern architecture that includes Mies’s Neue Nationalgalerie of,Paragraph
1959-1965 and Hans Scharoun’s Philharmonie of 1959-1963. This,Paragraph
was perhaps the most idiosyncratic work Stirling ever brought to,Paragraph
"fruition, A gleeful contrarian, he always professed to detest",Paragraph
picturesque design—buildings in which a preconceived arrangement,Paragraph
of exterior forms takes precedence over internal organization and,Paragraph
mimics painterly or theatrical effects to create an eye-catching,Paragraph
image. But the Wissenschaftszentrum’s multifarious agglomeration,Paragraph
of Tuscan-inspired components is by any definition picturesque.,Paragraph
"Stirling asserted that this grouping of four office structures, cranked",Paragraph
"around at various angles, stemmed from his rejection of a typical",Paragraph
Modernist super-block solution. The complex includes a barracks-,Paragraph
like street-front block three stories high; an octagonal flat-topped,Paragraph
tower of eight stories; and a semicircular wing (dubbed the,Paragraph
"amphitheater) and a cruciform volume with one apsidal end, termed",Paragraph
"the basilica, of five stories each.",Paragraph
The Wissenschaftszentrum’s overall affect of carnivalesque excess,Paragraph
and manic gaiety—the result of its loud exterior treatment in,Paragraph
alternating layers of baby blue and Pepto-Bismol pink—prompted,Paragraph
one Berlin wag to spray-paint a curving wall of the complex with,Paragraph
"the word Geburtstagstorte (birthday cake). Stirling, with",Paragraph
"characteristic perversity, wanted to leave that epithet in place, but",Paragraph
his staid academic client demurred. The architect’s apparent need to,Paragraph
upstage the adjacent competition of Mies and Scharoun was not,Paragraph
"unlike a typically infantile propensity remarked upon by Girouard,",Paragraph
who relates that if his subject felt he was not the cynosure of,Paragraph
attention at social gatherings he would sometimes resort to making,Paragraph
funny faces and antic gestures to gain attention.,Paragraph
"An artist of sporadic genius, a thoroughly inspiring educator, and",Paragraph
"a critic of uncommon insight, Stirling remains a figure of continuing",Paragraph
interest at the very least because his highly uneven output so,Paragraph
strongly illuminates a significant transitional moment in,Paragraph
"architecture, Even though he produced only two buildings that can",Paragraph
be deemed true classics—in Leicester and Stuttgart—those are,Paragraph
"enough to assure his place in the modern canon, if not in the top",Paragraph
"tier of all-time master builders. Faute de mieux, perhaps, but Stirling",Paragraph
was the preeminent British architect of the third quarter of the,Paragraph
twentieth century (and even a bit beyond). One can only honor his,Paragraph
deeply abiding passion for architecture and his desire to impart that,Paragraph
enthusiasm through his own buildings. In one of the most telling,Paragraph
"passages of “The Black Notebook,” Stirling records his reaction to",Paragraph
"Anthony Mann’s biopic The Glenn Miller Story (1954), which he",Paragraph
terms “a poor film enlivened by 5 minutes of Louis Armstrong”:,Paragraph
[Armstrong’s] whole personality and more directly his music,Paragraph
expresses “the joy of living.” Obviously he is no longer,Paragraph
"innovating, he is not producing with the same deliberate",Paragraph
intention or innovation of the early days—yet his now non-,Paragraph
progressive music is still greater than any other living jazzman.,Paragraph
He can’t help it—so easy—like Corb who has said “I shit,Paragraph
architecture.” Again the combination of man and instrument,Paragraph
and music producing something which has the grace of,Paragraph
inevitability.,Paragraph
That fundamentally joyous and inevitable quality suffuses his,Paragraph
architecture at its best—one might even say that Postmodernism,Paragraph
was a poor style enlivened by five minutes of Jim Stirling. The,Paragraph
narrative of modern architecture would be far less lively without,Paragraph
"this formidable, unruly, and paradoxical figure, whom the journalist",Paragraph
"Colin Amery once described, a bit maliciously but nonetheless quite",Paragraph
"aptly, as “a great rogue elephant.”",Paragraph

RENZO PIANO,Title
"RENZO PIANO, wHo turned seventy-five in 2012, may be best known as the",Paragraph
"preeminent museum designer of his time, but he has also amply",Paragraph
demonstrated organizational and technical skills that have won him,Paragraph
"prestigious, horizon-altering jobs of the sort once deemed the",Paragraph
summit of architectural attainment—the skyscraper. Piano’s,Paragraph
increasingly taller office towers trace his progress from the twenty-,Paragraph

"Aurora Place of 1996-2000 in Sydney, and then to the fifty-two-",Paragraph
story New York Times headquarters of 2000-2007 in Manhattan. His,Paragraph
most spectacular and in several respects best skyscraper is not only,Paragraph
his tallest but was also the loftiest habitable structure in Western,Paragraph
"Europe at the time of its completion: the 1,016-foot-high Shard of",Paragraph
"2000-2013 in London (see Illustration 12a), a ninety-five-story",Paragraph
"mixed-use development that combines offices, apartments, a hotel,",Paragraph
"restaurants, and an observatory. The flight path to Heathrow Airport",Caption

"in Southwark on the river’s South Bank, near Tower Bridge—by",Caption
"Piano’s crystalline form of angular, sloping glass-sheathed planes,",Paragraph
which taper upward like a colossal stalagmite and stand out all the,Paragraph
more because of the Shard’s medium-rise surroundings and glazed,Paragraph
"exterior, both of which contrast dramatically with the skyscraper’s",Paragraph
"masonry-clad neighbors, which average about fifteen stories.",Paragraph
A generation after the widespread public debate set in motion,Paragraph
during the 1980s by the architecturally retardataire Prince Charles,Paragraph
as to whether or not London should permit further high-rise,Paragraph
"development near the city center, a 2000 Urban White Paper issued",Paragraph
"by the Labour government of Prime Minister Tony Blair, “Our",Paragraph
"Towns and Cities—the Future,” laid out incentives to promote the",Paragraph
construction of skyscrapers in the British capital to spur economic,Paragraph
development. Even though the 2001 terrorist attack on New York’s,Paragraph
World Trade Center raised urgent questions about the safety of,Paragraph
"extremely tall buildings, that catastrophe barely delayed a new",Paragraph
"wave of ambitious high-rise construction around the globe,",Paragraph
"including several claimants to record-breaking height in their city,",Paragraph
"country, continent, or the world at large.",Paragraph
The skyscraper first emerged in the late nineteenth century as a,Paragraph
means of maximizing land use in the downtown financial centers of,Paragraph
"Chicago and New York, but that format turned out to be a",Paragraph
potentially lucrative venture even where property values were not,Paragraph
"excessively high, because repeatable stories are a relatively cheap",Paragraph
method of repetitive design and standardized construction. The,Paragraph
profit motive has been at the root of the resurgence of the very tall,Paragraph
building despite increasing doubts about the form’s sustainability,Paragraph
"and security. Yet for all those reservations, in purely architectural",Paragraph
terms Piano’s dazzling London tower is difficult not to admire.,Paragraph
Although at first glance the Shard’s general shape might bring to,Paragraph
mind William Pereira’s Transamerica Pyramid of 1969-1972 in San,Caption
"Francisco, that 850-foot-high office building looks much more static",Paragraph
than the London skyscraper because its four canted sides meet,Paragraph
neatly at right angles and rise continuously to a single pinnacle. In,Paragraph
"contrast, Piano’s more animated and ambiguous composition (a",Paragraph
fragmentary eight-sided arrangement in which the outer wall planes,Caption
diverge obliquely from right angles and overlap at the edges rather,Paragraph
than meeting directly) culminates in individual points that converge,Paragraph
but do not quite come together at the very top. Thanks to the,Paragraph
"architect’s specification of an unusually clear iron-free glass, the",Paragraph
Shard exhibits an extraordinary transparency both when viewed,Paragraph
from the exterior and particularly when experienced from within.,Paragraph
That impression is especially pronounced as one stands close to the,Paragraph
"floor-to-ceiling window walls on one of the office levels, which",Paragraph
"occupy floors 2 to 28 (with restaurants on 31 to 33, the Shangri-La",Paragraph
"Hotel on 34 to 52, private residences on 53 to 65, the observatory",Caption
"on 68 to 72, and the spire from 73 to 95, with the stories in between",Paragraph
those divisions taken up by mechanical equipment floors). Thanks to,Paragraph
"the slightly irregular, angled periphery of each story, the tower’s",Paragraph
"gentle upward tapering, and the unobtrusive external framing, the",Paragraph
predominant sensation the Shard imparts is one of a gossamer,Paragraph
"weightlessness, wholly unexpected in a structure of such magnitude.",Paragraph
The most unfortunate aspect of the Shard is a rectangular,Paragraph
nineteen-story wing appended perfunctorily to the structure in,Caption
"fulfillment of the developer’s demand for 900,000 square feet of",Paragraph
rentable space. A newly imposed zoning regulation capped the,Paragraph
"maximum height of the tower at 1,355 feet, a 25 percent reduction",Paragraph
from the architect’s original configuration that necessitated an,Paragraph
"addition to make up the difference. Nicknamed the Backpack, this",Paragraph
"blocky and banal annex, which could just as well be found in a",Paragraph
"suburban American office park, disfigures the sculptural integrity of",Paragraph
the beautifully proportioned tower and reminds us that although,Paragraph
"Piano was hired because of his highly marketable name, the Shard",Paragraph
was driven not by artistic aspiration (as was Ludwig Mies van der,Paragraph
"Rohe and Philip Johnson’s Seagram Building in New York,",Caption
commissioned by the Bronfman family) but as a money-making,Paragraph
speculation.,Paragraph
Yet for all the skyscraper commissions that will come to Piano,Paragraph
"because of the Shard, during the three decades that preceded it he",Paragraph
consolidated his place as the most sought-after specialist in the,Paragraph
defining architectural category of his time—the museum. As of 2012,Paragraph
"he had completed nineteen museum buildings in Europe, the United",Paragraph
"States, and Asia, and was planning another six in the thriving offices",Paragraph
"he maintains in Paris and his native Genoa. Taken as a whole, these",Paragraph
twenty-five commissions make up a self-contained body of work,Paragraph
within his larger oeuvre and comprise virtually all of the museum’s,Paragraph
myriad present-day incarnations. Among them Piano has designed,Paragraph

"Longa, Vita Brevis: Contemporary Art at LACMA, 1913-2007”",Title
retraces the museum’s sad history as a champion and repository of,Paragraph

account would make the Broad enterprise seem like a Hollywood,Paragraph
"happy ending, though in fact it unintentionally came off as an ironic",Paragraph
commentary not unlike Robert Altman’s mordant movie-industry,Paragraph
satire The Player (1992). Zelevansky’s litany of self-interested,Paragraph
meddling by earlier donors unconcerned about the destructive,Paragraph
effects of their behavior was all the more topical and troubling,Paragraph
because it drew obvious parallels between erstwhile LACMA trustees,Paragraph
and the museum’s latter-day big kahuna. As Adrian Ellis wrote in,Paragraph
"The Art Newspaper in 2008, the museum’s acquiescence to Broad",Paragraph
poses,Title
a very real danger that the appropriate conservatism of the,Paragraph
museum sector will be challenged aggressively by a new,Paragraph
generation of proprietorial museum board members who feel,Paragraph
"that, as in their own professional lives, “rules are for other",Paragraph
"people” and that, whatever the formal legal status, these",Paragraph
institutions are an extension of their own private property and,Paragraph
can be run as such.,Paragraph
"A month before BCAM was inaugurated, the donor gave an",Paragraph
"interview to the New York Times reporter Edward Wyatt, in which",Paragraph
he revealed that rather than giving his art to LACMA as many had,Paragraph
"anticipated, his holdings will remain the property of his foundation,",Paragraph
which will make decisions normally reserved by a museum for,Paragraph
works in its possession. Observers viewed this stunning news as an,Paragraph
ominous portent for American arts philanthropy. Govan tried to put,Paragraph
"the best possible spin on Broad’s ill-timed announcement, but there",Paragraph
was no disguising the worst public relations disaster to befall an art,Paragraph
institution since the reopening in 2006 of the Getty Villa in Malibu,Paragraph
was eclipsed by the international antiquities scandal that implicated,Paragraph
that museum. Although Govan gamely told Wyatt that “I don’t think,Paragraph
most people care when they walk in the door whether the museum,Paragraph
"owns the works or not,” the consensus in the art world echoed the",Paragraph
Time magazine critic Richard Lacayo’s blunt blog posting: “LACMA,Paragraph
got screwed.”,Paragraph
"The prior architectural history of this institution offers a classic,",Paragraph
"perhaps unsurpassable, example of how an inferior design can",Paragraph
bedevil sponsors years after a project was finished. In light of later,Paragraph
"depredations, Pereira’s LACMA of 1963-1965 doesn’t look so",Paragraph

the superbly intelligent architect Charles Moore surprised his fellow,Paragraph

"expansion of 1982-1986, by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates,",Paragraph
burdened the site with a ponderous PoMo-Deco addition reminiscent,Paragraph
of a 1930s Hollywood soundstage. The museum’s quest for,Paragraph
architectural cohesion was further doomed by Bruce Goff and Bart,Paragraph
"Prince’s bizarre Pavilion of Japanese Art of 1978-1988, a",Paragraph
"zoomorphic folly that evoked a fossilized mammoth, the",Paragraph
resemblance underscored by sub-Disney dinosaur replicas placed,Paragraph

announced that it would demolish Pereira’s pavilions and the Hardy,Paragraph
Holzman Pfeiffer addition and replace them with a $650 million,Paragraph
"building by Peter Zumthor, the Swiss Minimalist and Pritzker Prize",Caption
winner.),Paragraph
LACMA’s one great chance for architectural redemption came and,Paragraph
went with the master plan of 2002-2003 by Rem Koolhaas and the,Paragraph
Office for Metropolitan Architecture. With one breathtaking gesture,Paragraph
—Koolhaas wanted to lop off the upper levels of the entire complex,Paragraph
"and encase the remains under a rectangular, translucent plastic",Paragraph
dome—he would have given it a new architectural identity of,Paragraph
stupendous power. But the museum’s officials balked because the,Paragraph
radical plan required closing the institution to the public for three,Paragraph
"years, whereupon Broad approached Piano, who in 2003 agreed to",Paragraph
"design the collector’s dream monument to himself, but only if",Paragraph
"LACMA would also implement the architect’s master plan. On paper,",Paragraph
"at least, Piano’s rethinking of the museum seemed so logical as to be",Paragraph
"irrefutable, and sensible enough for the most conservative trustee.",Paragraph
"Instead of Koolhaas’s scorched-earth approach, his successor called",Paragraph
for the demolition only of the ugly multilevel parking garage next to,Paragraph
"the Pereira complex. In place of that eyesore, he positioned BCAM",Paragraph
"as the fulcrum of the expanded campus, which is now entered via a",Paragraph
new plaza on Wilshire between BCAM and the original LACMA,Caption
ensemble.,Paragraph
The first phase of Piano’s three-part master plan exacerbated some,Paragraph
"of the site’s defects. It comprised BCAM, the BP Grand Entrance (an",Paragraph
"8,100-square-foot piazza shaded by a graceful, unenclosed, and flat-",Caption
"roofed minimalist canopy, named for British Petroleum, which",Paragraph
"donated $25 million to the museum), and the covered walkways",Paragraph
that now link the Piano and the Pereira buildings. Phase two added,Paragraph
"Piano’s Resnick Pavilion of 2006-2010 for changing exhibitions,",Paragraph
with phase three a planned overhaul of the oldest structures.,Paragraph
BCAM’s boxy form and forbidding Wilshire elevation reiterated the,Paragraph
monolithic muteness of the Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer addition. To,Paragraph
"enliven the twin-square facade of his building’s street elevation,",Paragraph
"Piano suggested that they be hung with superscale, scrim-like",Paragraph
banners commissioned from local artists. Without such,Paragraph
"embellishment, however, BCAM would be virtually indistinguishable",Paragraph
from a public utility substation. The symmetrical gallery wings are,Caption
"clad in beige travertine, and to emphasize the H-shaped ground plan",Paragraph
"Piano gave the slightly recessed midsection, which contains",Paragraph
"elevators and stairways, a transparent glass skin. The absence of an",Paragraph
entrance on Wilshire clearly acknowledges that almost all visitors to,Paragraph
LACMA come by car and enter through the parking garage rather,Paragraph
than from the street.,Paragraph
The BP Grand Entrance pavilion employs the same red-painted,Paragraph
steel Piano used for BCAM’s side-wall fire escape and the beams that,Paragraph
"protrude horizontally above it, as well as the escalator-cum-stair",Paragraph
tower and the concourse that connects BCAM with the original,Paragraph
complex. The interior wall colors Piano specified for his New York,Caption
Times Building (including several infelicitous shades of red) exposed,Paragraph
his deficiencies as a colorist. The screaming fire-engine red he,Paragraph
picked for BCAM’s exterior metalwork looks awful against the pale,Paragraph
"masonry. Mixing bold, even loud colors with neutral stonework is",Paragraph
"not an impossible task, as was proven by James Stirling and Michael",Paragraph
"Wilford’s majestic Neue Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, where the",Paragraph
architects used acid-green mullions and hot-pink railings to jazz up,Paragraph
the museum’s stolid limestone-and-sandstone veneer. Here Piano’s,Paragraph
unconvincing chromatic contrast comes across as no more than a,Paragraph
mixed metaphor.,Paragraph
"BCAM is meant to be entered on its third and uppermost story, via",Paragraph
the open escalator or the stairway housed within the scaffold-like,Paragraph
"red-painted steel structure Piano has dubbed “the spider,” but which",Paragraph
more closely resembles an outsize jungle gym. Not since the gigantic,Paragraph
Plexiglas tube he and Rogers snaked up one flank of their Pompidou,Paragraph
"Center has Piano designed such a flamboyant people mover. Indeed,",Paragraph
this overelaborate appendage seems a nostalgic bid to recapture the,Paragraph
brashness of his breakthrough commission. Whatever the architect,Paragraph
"had in mind here, the mildly embarrassing entry sequence is soon",Paragraph
forgotten as one approaches the main event: the galleries for which,Paragraph
"Piano is so celebrated. At the building’s 2008 press preview, Govan",Paragraph
"extolled the “crystal clear” light of Piano’s loftlike, columnless",Paragraph
exhibition spaces. But after one entered the building and passed,Paragraph
"through the top-floor lobby (dominated by a vast, glass-fronted",Paragraph
"elevator shaft containing a three-story-high, black-white-and-red",Paragraph
"montage commissioned from Barbara Kruger), the first gallery on",Paragraph
the north side (devoted to Jasper Johns) came as a shock. Despite,Paragraph
perfect weather—as bright a day as can be expected of Southern,Paragraph
California in winter—the light was gray and gloomy. A nearby room,Paragraph
devoted to enormous unstretched canvases by Leon Golub fared,Caption
"somewhat better, but it too seemed inadequately illuminated. The",Paragraph
only truly impressive gallery was a spacious room hung with tier,Paragraph
"after tier of large color photographs by Cindy Sherman, where the",Paragraph
lower artificial light level was likely dictated by conservation,Paragraph
requirements for works on paper.,Paragraph
Another telling portion of the museum’s surprising inaugural,Paragraph
"publication—the transcript of a discussion among Broad, Govan,",Paragraph
and Piano—hints at a possible source of the trouble:,Paragraph
EB: ... I was very concerned with the cost of the roof. Renzo,Paragraph
and I had quite a few discussions about how to get it down to,Paragraph
$200 a square foot.,Paragraph
RP: The good thing about the roof is that we needed the roof. I,Paragraph
"lost on the basement, and I won on the roof.",Paragraph
"EB: The roof’s great, except it cost more than the rest of the",Paragraph
building.,Paragraph
"RP: Eli, do you remember one day, we were around the table",Title
"and you said, “How much do we save if we take the roof",Paragraph
"away?” Well, you save a lot, especially on the architectural",Paragraph
fees!,Title
"By way of comparison, BCAM cost about 66 percent less per",Paragraph
square foot than the Nasher. (LACMA never itemized the final cost-,Paragraph
"per-square-foot of the BCAM roof.) By any reckoning, Broad cannot",Paragraph
"be called a cheapskate. Nevertheless, his dickering over the",Paragraph
architectural element Piano is most famous for—his ingenious,Paragraph
overhead light filters—might have led to the architect’s use of rows,Paragraph
of relatively rudimentary mesh ceiling panels below the rooftop’s,Caption
"factory-style sawtooth skylights, which evidently do not perform at",Paragraph
"the high level achieved by the intricate, custom-designed ceiling",Paragraph
"systems he created, without regard to expense, for the Menil and the",Paragraph
Nasher.,Paragraph
Southern California is often said to be America’s proving ground,Paragraph
for trends that later go nationwide. Although the private museum,Paragraph
was pioneered on the East Coast (and also at the Huntington Library,Paragraph
"near Los Angeles) in the early twentieth century, its postwar",Paragraph
"resurgence was largely a Los Angeles phenomenon, with the J. Paul",Paragraph
"Getty Museum in Malibu and Brentwood, the Norton Simon",Caption
"Museum in Pasadena, and the Armand Hammer Museum in",Paragraph
Westwood. It is impossible not to wonder what the cultural life of,Paragraph
Los Angeles would now be like if those three men had given the,Paragraph
billions they lavished on art and architecture to LACMA instead.,Paragraph
"However, those buccaneers were not the only hometown models",Paragraph
Broad could have emulated.,Paragraph
"For decades, one of LACMA’s biggest and most reliable supporters",Paragraph
"was the fabulously rich, publicity-shy Anna Bing Arnold, who died",Paragraph
at the age of one hundred in 2003. Her first husband was the New,Paragraph
"York real estate magnate Leo S. Bing, who with his brother",Paragraph
Alexander M. Bing funded such seminal housing reform schemes as,Paragraph
Clarence Stein and Henry Wright’s Sunnyside Gardens of 1924-1928,Title
"in Queens, New York, and the new town of Radburn, New Jersey, of",Paragraph
1928-1932. The $24 million she bequeathed to the museum for its,Caption
education program was just a fraction of her lifetime gifts to,Paragraph
"LACMA, where she was esteemed for her unconditional readiness to",Paragraph
pay for acquisitions curators deemed imperative—the Blanchette,Paragraph
"Rockefeller of the West, and the antithesis of Broad’s all-strings-",Paragraph
"attached modus operandi. In 1978, Arnold addressed a Los Angeles",Paragraph
"conference on the arts in education, and in phrases that harked back",Paragraph
to the nineteenth-century notion of the museum as vehicle for,Paragraph
"spiritual uplift and social cohesion, she emphasized what a unifying",Paragraph
force art can be:,Paragraph
Art is a universal language which binds people to one another,Paragraph
and to humane and ideal aims.... Art can still be the leaven to,Paragraph
"help us fulfill our emotional needs, to accept the restrictions in",Paragraph
"our daily lives, and to become all that we are.",Paragraph
To have the crucial role of museum professionals usurped by self-,Paragraph
serving tycoons in the name of economic imperative threatens not,Paragraph
only the integrity of individual institutions but the very principle of,Paragraph
art held in public trust. Not all California crazes have caught on,Paragraph
"elsewhere in America, which raises hopes that the cautionary",Paragraph
"example of LACMA, seduced and abandoned, might deter other",Paragraph
museums from entering into such dangerous liaisons. It is a,Paragraph
commonplace that museum architecture must be subservient to the,Paragraph
"needs of the works displayed within it, but what a museum chooses",Paragraph
to exhibit is sometimes less important than the building itself. Such,Paragraph
is the case with Piano’s Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art of,Paragraph
"2009-2012 in Oslo (see Illustration 12b), a privately owned",Paragraph
contemporary art gallery built to house works—predominantly,Paragraph
"paintings and sculptures but also including photography, video, and",Paragraph
installation pieces—assembled by the Norwegian shipping firm,Paragraph
Astrup Fearnley starting in the 1960s and formalized by the creation,Paragraph
"of the eponymous museum in 1993, for which Piano created its first",Paragraph
purpose-built home almost two decades later.,Paragraph
"Piano’s great foursome of the Menil, Twombly, Beyeler, and",Paragraph
Nasher museums not only are alike in being his finest essays in,Paragraph
exhibition design but are equally distinguished by their exceptional,Paragraph
"holdings. The contents of the Astrup Fearnley collection, on the",Caption
"other hand, were not generally well known beyond art-world",Paragraph
"insiders until the opening of the Piano building, though word had",Paragraph
spread within the New York trade about the Norwegian institution’s,Paragraph
vigorous acquisition of high-priced pieces from leading,Paragraph
contemporary dealers. The extent of the Fearnley foundation’s,Paragraph
purchases in the run-up to its museum’s completion astounded,Paragraph
"viewers when they were finally put on view in 2012, for the results",Paragraph
amounted to a veritable checklist of the trendiest (and most,Paragraph
"expensive) artists of the period, including Maurizio Cattelan,",Paragraph
"Damien Hirst, Jeff Koons, Takashi Murakami, and Richard Prince, in",Caption
what certainly must have represented an outlay of many tens if not,Paragraph
several hundreds of millions of dollars. Although other figures of,Paragraph
"considerably greater merit are also represented—Robert Gober,",Paragraph
"Bruce Nauman, and Cindy Sherman among them—along with a",Paragraph
"number of young Norwegians little-known outside their homeland,",Paragraph
the overall impression of the collection was one of immense but,Paragraph
sadly misallocated resources. If there was ever a modern,Paragraph
"museological equivalent of the term “fashion victim,” this was it.",Paragraph
"Whatever one makes of the Astrup Fearnley Museum’s contents,",Paragraph
the building itself is a great success in urbanistic terms. In hopes of,Paragraph
this becoming the cultural anchor of the city’s newly gentrified,Paragraph
"district of Tjuvholmen (the name means “thieves’ home,” alluding to",Paragraph
"a former penal colony), property developers offered the institution a",Paragraph
spectacular waterfront site on the Oslo Fjord to the southwest of the,Paragraph
"city center. Piano, who grew up in the Ligurian port of Genoa and",Paragraph
"has always been attuned to the sea, responded to the site with a",Paragraph
nautically inspired structure quite unlike any of his many other,Paragraph
"museums. Here the dominant architectural feature is a vast,",Paragraph
billowing glass-and-steel roof canopy that swoops over the three,Paragraph
distinct components of the complex beneath it like a gigantic ship’s,Paragraph
sail and unites the trio of buildings: the harborfront gallery for,Paragraph
"changing exhibitions, and across a narrow channel a parallel",Paragraph
"structure for the permanent collection and administrative offices,",Paragraph
next to which is a six-story office building leased to a major Oslo,Paragraph
law firm.,Paragraph
In piquant contrast to Piano’s high-tech roof element—which,Paragraph
touches down on one point like a barely tethered tent in the grassy,Paragraph
sculpture park that fronts the fjord—the three buildings are clad in,Paragraph
unfinished vertical wood siding that suggests maritime piers. It has,Caption
been claimed that any building looks twice as good if it is sited next,Paragraph
"to a major body of water, and that could also be said of Snghetta’s",Paragraph
"Oslo Opera House, which likewise abuts the city’s coastline but in a",Paragraph
much more industrial segment of its inner port. Echoing Le,Paragraph
"Corbusier, Piano said at the Astrup Fearnley Museum’s dedication,",Paragraph
"“Light is the most important material for architecture,” and went on",Paragraph
"to add, “The next is water—water is magic because it is never the",Paragraph
same.”,Paragraph
Looking back on the quite mixed results of Piano’s unprecedented,Paragraph
"volume of museum design, there seems little doubt that the success",Paragraph
of his individual projects owes less to the felicities of site than to the,Paragraph
exigencies of patronage. His quartet of galleries in Texas and,Paragraph
Switzerland are perhaps most remarkable for the way in which they,Paragraph
transcend largely unpromising environmental conditions to create,Paragraph
sympathetic spaces for viewing art. But they no doubt owe their,Paragraph
transcendent quality to their enlightened benefactors—the,Paragraph
"connoisseurs Dominique de Menil, Ernst Beyeler, and Raymond",Paragraph
"Nasher. They stand in telling contrast to Eli Broad, who received",Paragraph
"one of Piano’s least satisfactory efforts, even though it is widely",Paragraph
assumed that a single strong client is more likely to obtain a good,Paragraph
result than a consensus-seeking committee. As Renzo Piano’s finest,Paragraph
"museums indicate, at his best he can be an architectural alchemist,",Paragraph
but at the other end of his creative spectrum it is clear that he is not,Paragraph
a magician.,Paragraph

REM KOOLHAAS,Title
"with His propicious gift for invention, shrewd understanding of",Paragraph
"communication techniques, and contagiously optimistic conviction",Paragraph
that modern architecture and urban design still possess enormous,Paragraph
"untapped potential for the transformation of modern life, no master",Paragraph
builder since Le Corbusier has offered a more impressive vision for a,Paragraph
"brighter future than the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, who has",Paragraph
somehow managed to preserve his long-standing reputation as the,Paragraph
bad boy of his profession even while executing the most impressive,Paragraph
"body of built work by a member of his generation. To be sure, there",Paragraph
are other present-day architects who do certain things better than,Paragraph
he does. Robert Venturi is a finer draftsman and a more elegant,Paragraph
writer; Denise Scott Brown has a more empathetic feel for the social,Paragraph
interactions that inform good planning; and Frank Gehry displays a,Paragraph
sharper eye for sculptural assemblage and a keener instinct for,Paragraph
popular taste. But when it comes to sheer conceptual audacity and,Paragraph
"original thinking about the latent possibilities of the building art,",Paragraph
Koolhaas today stands unrivaled.,Paragraph
"Through his Rotterdam-based practice, the Office for Metropolitan",Paragraph
"Architecture and its research-and-development division, AMO,",Paragraph
Koolhaas has conceived some of the most daring schemes of the past,Paragraph
"four decades, ranging in scale from mammoth undertakings like",Paragraph
Euralille of 1987-1994 (the reconfiguration of the northern French,Title
"city of Lille with a new high-speed railway hub, commercial center,",Paragraph
and convention hall) and De Rotterdam of 1997-2013 (three,Paragraph
interconnected mixed-use towers that together comprise the biggest,Paragraph
building in Holland) to exquisite smaller structures including the,Paragraph
"Casa da Masica of 2001-2005 in Porto, Portugal (an ark-like concert",Paragraph
"hall), and the Netherlands Embassy of 1997-2003 in Berlin (the",Paragraph
finest work to rise in the German capital since reunification). But,Paragraph
"there is a dark side to Koolhaas as well, signified by the laissez-faire",Paragraph
stance he takes toward social issues and the morally neutral attitude,Paragraph
"he brings to his architecture and urbanism, especially his cynical",Paragraph
acceptance of the world as it is in all of its post-capitalist corruption,Paragraph
"and squalor, a stance diametrically opposed to the high-minded",Paragraph
reformist ideals of the Modern Movement.,Paragraph
I witnessed a startling outburst that exemplified Koolhaas’s deep,Paragraph
disdain for the social welfare planning at which his homeland excels,Paragraph
during a visit to his Rotterdam office in 1994. We walked past a,Paragraph
recently built old-age home in an inoffensively mild Postmodern,Paragraph
"style that brought to mind the redbrick Begijnhof in Amsterdam, a",Paragraph
late-medieval courtyard of almshouses notable for its humane scale,Paragraph
"and quiet dignity. Eyeing the new facility, Koolhaas suddenly",Paragraph
"exclaimed, “That’s exactly what I hate about Holland, that horrible",Paragraph
sentimentality!” The widespread perception of Koolhaas as a,Paragraph
Manichean opportunist whose undeniable brilliance is diminished,Paragraph
by an essential coldheartedness was summed up in a cruel but,Paragraph
telling passage in Chip Kidd and Dave Taylor’s architectural-themed,Title
"graphic novel Batman: Death by Design (2012), in which this",Paragraph
polarizing figure is transparently disguised as a Dutch architect,Paragraph
"named Kem Roomhaus. As Batman observes, “Roomhaus may be an",Paragraph
"insufferable, affected, narcissistic creep, but he’s also a genius.” Yet",Paragraph
"the same could be said of Le Corbusier, and like that similarly chilly",Paragraph
"and determined careerist, Koolhaas knows that the power of",Paragraph
"presentation, verbal as well as visual, is a crucial (and perhaps the",Paragraph
decisive) element in the realization of the building art.,Paragraph
"Following the great Swiss-French master’s profitable example,",Paragraph
"Koolhaas has produced several hugely popular books, including",Paragraph
Delirious New York: A Retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan (1978) and,Paragraph
"S,M,L,XL (1995). Koolhaas’s Project Japan: Metabolism Talks ...",Paragraph
"(2011), written with Hans Ulrich Obrist, pays tribute to the",Paragraph

forefront of that country’s near-miraculous rebuilding after the,Paragraph

"Western modernism, Kenzo Tange. This heavily illustrated and",Paragraph
engagingly discursive oral history was undertaken in 2005 (the year,Paragraph
of Tange’s death at the age of ninety-one) to record the testimony of,Paragraph
the surviving Metabolists.,Paragraph
"In common with all of Koolhaas’s publications, one can readily",Paragraph
detect that Project Japan actually concerns the author and his own,Paragraph
interests as much as its ostensible subject. The Metabolists’ obsessive,Paragraph
fixation on futuristic megastructures—stupendous agglomerations of,Paragraph
superscaled buildings with integrated urban transport and other,Paragraph
"infrastructure meant to extend over many square miles, sometimes",Paragraph
"atop shallow bodies of water like Tokyo Bay, none of which were",Paragraph
"fully executed—has long been shared by the Dutch architect, who",Paragraph
like his older Japanese counterparts in the Metabolist group has,Paragraph
sought ingenious ways to overcome the severe geographic,Paragraph
"constraints of his tiny, sea-bound, populous homeland.",Paragraph
Another means of mass communication is perhaps even more,Paragraph
"important to Koolhaas than the printed word: film, which he studied",Paragraph
as a young man. Few makers of architectural films exploit the full,Paragraph
potential of the medium to create a convincing sense of what it is,Paragraph
"like to move through a sequence of interiors, which was made much",Paragraph
easier with the introduction of the Steadicam in 1976. A rare,Paragraph
exception was Ila Béka and Louise Lemoine’s documentary Koolhaas,Paragraph
"Houselife (2008), with which the architect was not directly involved",Paragraph
and which presents a warts-and-all portrait of his House in Bordeaux,Paragraph
"of 1994-1998, a country residence outside the village of Floriac and",Paragraph
overlooking the river Gironde. This rectangular three-level flat-,Paragraph
roofed structure—already under the protection of France’s Caisse,Paragraph
Nationale des Monuments Historiques—was commissioned by Jean-,Paragraph
"Francois Lemoine, a newspaper editor who was paralyzed in an",Paragraph
automobile accident and died only three years after his home was,Paragraph

high-profile assignments in the most conspicuous architectural,Paragraph
category of the past several decades says much about the frequently,Paragraph
confrontational nature of his vision. In the limited competition for,Paragraph

versions of a pompous Postmodern enlargement that would have,Paragraph
engulfed the original building in a welter of fussy classicizing,Paragraph

superstructure to be inserted behind the landmarked brownstones,Caption
"adjacent to the museum, which would have risen up and hovered",Paragraph
over the Breuer building like a monstrous cobra. The Whitney,Paragraph
abandoned that nonstarter after two years of even more vocal,Paragraph

up and died down over the years. But by the time the sculptures,Paragraph

purpose-built Duveen Gallery of 1936-1938 (after they received an,Paragraph
"ill-advised acid scrub), the Elgin Marbles had attained the",Paragraph
transcendent status shared by those very few artworks universally,Paragraph
agreed to be the common spiritual inheritance of all mankind—and,Paragraph
thus just as legitimately held in London as in Athens or anywhere,Paragraph
"else, so long as they remain accessible to the public and are",Paragraph
safeguarded for future generations.,Paragraph
This Olympian view of global custodianship was vehemently,Paragraph
"rejected by Mercouri, who in 1981 became her country’s minister of",Paragraph
"culture (a post she held, save a four-year interregnum, until her",Paragraph
"death in 1994). Self-described as the Parthenon’s La Pasionaria, she",Paragraph
reignited a smoldering controversy and turned the sculptures’,Paragraph
restitution into an international crusade that her countrymen have,Paragraph
continued. Those efforts reached an emotional crescendo with the,Paragraph
"unveiling of Tschumi’s $200 million showplace, which seemed less",Paragraph
an architectural event or a museological accomplishment than the,Paragraph
costliest and craftiest weapon in a Kulturkampf of Homeric intensity,Paragraph
and duration. That perception was underscored by the foreign press,Paragraph
brigade flown in at considerable expense by the Greek government,Paragraph
"for the sumptuously produced, strenuously orchestrated opening, a",Paragraph
rare promotional extravaganza at a time of retrenchment for,Paragraph
cultural institutions worldwide and a harbinger of the financial,Paragraph
crisis that would plunge the country into deep turmoil just a few,Paragraph
years later.,Paragraph
Any prior pretense to the lack of a political agenda was dropped,Paragraph
at the dedication of the New Acropolis Museum when the Greek,Caption
"minister of culture, Antonis Samaras, spoke of the building’s true",Paragraph
function in the bluntest of terms:,Paragraph
We cannot dedicate this magnificent new museum with full,Paragraph
hearts. We cannot illuminate fully the artistic achievement,Paragraph
"created in fifth-century Athens, because almost half of the",Paragraph
sculptures from the Parthenon were taken from here 207 years,Paragraph
"ago to reside in enforced exile 4,000 kilometers away.",Paragraph
The abduction of these sculptures is not only an injustice to,Paragraph
"us Greeks but to everyone in the world, the English included,",Paragraph
"because they were made to be seen in sequence and in total,",Paragraph
something that cannot happen as long as half of them are held,Paragraph
hostage in the British Museum.,Caption

gritted teeth:,Title

completed his first jigsaw puzzle. Several foreign-owned (and,Paragraph
insignificant) bits of the Parthenon sculptures were donated to the,Paragraph

brandished was on loan from the Vatican Museum for only a year.,Paragraph
"Days before the opening, he indignantly rebuffed the British",Paragraph
Museum’s offer to lend the Elgin Marbles to Athens for three months,Paragraph
in return for Greek recognition of British ownership. According to,Paragraph
"Samaras’s communiqué, “Accepting it would legalise the snatching",Paragraph
of the Marbles and the monument’s carving-up.” But he nonetheless,Paragraph
seized upon the Holy See’s paltry benefice as though it were a papal,Paragraph
endorsement and milked it to maximum effect as the Platonic ideal,Paragraph
of a photo-op prop.,Paragraph
Mercouri’s strategy has emboldened other countries to press for,Paragraph
possession of artworks they likewise judge essential to their national,Paragraph
"identity, and in many cases those efforts have succeeded. However,",Paragraph
the proliferation of such suits clearly endangers the free and open,Paragraph
diffusion of culture in the higher service of international,Title
understanding. Masterpieces of art possess immense potential to,Paragraph
advance a worldview that could help assuage the societal terrors,Paragraph
"posed by globalization, the most thoroughgoing socioeconomic",Paragraph
"upheaval since the Industrial Revolution, which has set off a",Paragraph
"pandemic of retrogressive nationalism, regional separatism, and",Paragraph
"religious extremism. In the cultural sphere, this unfortunate",Paragraph
development was anticipated by Mercouri’s discovery of the hot-,Paragraph
button issue that would secure her second career. Daughter of a,Paragraph
"high-ranking Athens politician, she shared the leftist sympathies of",Paragraph
"her American-born husband, the director Jules Dassin, who was",Paragraph
blacklisted during the McCarthy period and moved to Europe. Most,Paragraph
memorable of their eight films together was Dassin’s Never on,Paragraph
"Sunday (1960), in which she portrayed a definitive golden-hearted",Paragraph
whore.,Paragraph
But Mercouri’s finest hour came as a fearless opponent of the,Paragraph
right-wing dictatorship that seized power in Greece in 1967. When,Paragraph
"the military despots revoked her citizenship, she spat out: “I was",Paragraph
born a Greek and I will die a Greek. Mr. Pattakos [a leader of the,Paragraph
junta] was born a fascist and will die a fascist.” After democracy,Paragraph
"was restored in 1974, she was elected to parliament and made the",Paragraph
Elgin Marbles into a cause that not only played irresistibly to the,Paragraph
Greek national psyche but reunited her country after decades of,Paragraph

sexpot to Euripidean avenger and vividly personified what until,Paragraph

associated with the now-defunct Institute for Architecture and,Paragraph
"Urban Studies, the avant-garde think tank and academy that exerted",Paragraph
an enormous influence on advanced architectural thought between,Paragraph
1967 and 1984. His big career breakthrough came when he won the,Paragraph
design competition for one of Francois Mitterrand’s lesser-known,Paragraph
grands projets: the Parc de la Villette of 1983-1986 in Paris (see,Caption
"Illustration 14a), a redevelopment of 135 acres in the city’s",Paragraph

"to reconceive the urban park, he dispersed twenty-six red-painted",Paragraph
metal-clad follies (most of them two or three stories high) in a grid,Paragraph
pattern that blanketed the site. These fantasias recombined snippets,Paragraph
of familiar early Modernist motifs—especially the dynamic forms of,Paragraph
"Russian Constructivism—and although charming, they soon seemed",Paragraph
of little consequence.,Paragraph
Tschumi’s stalled building career prompted him to become the,Paragraph

Berlin. The hiring of foreign architects for all those highly coveted,Paragraph

"globalization of the profession, reconfirmed when Tschumi was",Paragraph
called to the Acropolis. These selections may well have indicated the,Paragraph
sponsors’ desire to attract worldwide attention or to avoid the,Paragraph

his Greek clients found both an adept practitioner and a perfect,Paragraph
camouflage for their underlying nationalistic motivations.,Paragraph
"As a work of architecture, the New Acropolis Museum brings to",Paragraph
mind Mark Twain’s deadpan observation that “Wagner’s music is,Paragraph
"better than it sounds,” for in certain respects Tschumi’s design is",Paragraph
"better than it looks, especially after one recovers from the terrible",Paragraph
first visual impression it makes. This triple-decker sandwich of,Paragraph
"latticework concrete at the bottom, angled panels of corrugated",Caption
"metal in the middle, and dark-gray glass at the top appears more",Paragraph
like a provincial convention center than a national treasure house.,Paragraph
Athenians have complained that the hulking structure—as high as a,Paragraph
seven-story building—is out of scale with its low-rise residential,Paragraph
surroundings. But the museum’s site is ideally positioned in relation,Paragraph
"to the Acropolis, which rises three hundred yards to the northwest,",Paragraph
and a public institution of such extraordinary importance could,Paragraph
hardly have been confined to a domestic scale.,Paragraph
The museum’s ground floor and piano nobile are trapezoidal in,Paragraph
"plan and parallel the surrounding streets. However, the rectangular",Paragraph
top story is shifted on a diagonal to align with the Parthenon. This,Paragraph
contrary inflection recalls Tschumi’s premillennial Deconstructivist,Paragraph
"phase (he was one of seven architects, along with Peter Eisenman,",Paragraph
"Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas, Daniel Libeskind, and the",Title
"Viennese firm Coop Himmelb()au, included in Philip Johnson and",Paragraph

"Tschumi’s work, his Alfred Lerner Hall of 1996-1999 at Columbia",Paragraph
"University, a dizzying and pointless mash-up of frenetic angular",Paragraph
tricks.,Paragraph
Perhaps he intended the infinitely calmer Athens museum’s,Paragraph
tripartite elevations to evoke the base/shaft/capital format,Paragraph
prescribed by the Five Orders of Classical architecture. Particularly,Paragraph
"unfortunate is the structure’s ground level, with deeply recessed",Paragraph
concrete panels that were quickly colonized by pigeons as a,Paragraph

promenade where tourists begin the ascent to the Acropolis. This,Paragraph

"Miami Beach or Las Vegas hotel rather than any loftier association,",Paragraph
is raised on four fat concrete cylinders typical of the building’s,Paragraph
ungainly and overabundant concrete supports (forty-three in all).,Paragraph
"According to the architect, the massive columns dictated by building",Paragraph
codes for the earthquake-prone Attica region also allowed him to,Paragraph
make fewer incursions into Roman-era ruins that were unearthed as,Paragraph
the foundation was dug. Remnants of a fourth-to-seventh-century-,Paragraph

landscape designer Deborah Nevins) is scheduled to open in 2015.,Paragraph
Much sought after for his dependable Modernist variations on the,Paragraph
"Classical colonnaded pavilion, Piano would have seemed the self-",Paragraph
"evident choice for the Acropolis project, but he eschews design",Paragraph
competitions and accepts only direct commissions. (Best known,Paragraph
"among the dozen contenders for this job, which Tschumi won in",Paragraph
"2001, were Arata Isozaki and Daniel Libeskind.) Not only would",Paragraph
Piano’s hallmark style have been most appropriate at its veritable,Paragraph

likely have assured a much more elegant structural outcome.,Paragraph
Visitors to the New Acropolis Museum pass under the entry,Caption

"reception lobby, and then are directed toward the Gallery of the",Paragraph
"Slopes, named for its ramped floor (segments of which are glass to",Paragraph

mimic airport terminals (exemplified by Yoshio Taniguchi’s Museum,Paragraph
of Modern Art expansion of 1997-2003 in New York and Piano’s,Paragraph
Modern Wing of 1999-2009 at the Art Institute of Chicago) but,Paragraph
more specifically suggests an airplane hangar. The gallery’s lateral,Paragraph
walls are paneled with dot-patterned concrete rectangles that,Paragraph
"resemble superscale dominoes, while beneath them are vitrines",Paragraph
chockablock with ancient objects discovered on the site (similar to,Paragraph
"displays in the Athens airport). At the far end of the space, a wall-to-",Paragraph
wall flight of steps rises to the second-floor exhibition areas for,Caption
"works from the surrounding Attica region, Athens, and the",Paragraph
"Acropolis, though not the Parthenon itself.",Paragraph
One is greeted on that next level by a fragmentary reconstruction,Paragraph
of the pediment from an earlier Acropolis temple of Athena,Caption
destroyed by fire. To the right of this assemblage one passes into the,Paragraph
"wedge-shaped Archaic Gallery, and all at once another",Paragraph
unimaginably sublime world materializes. The exterior glass walls of,Paragraph
this sculpture hall are coated with tiny white ceramic dots (called,Paragraph
frits) that screen distracting city views and suffuse a supernal glow,Paragraph
heightened by filtered daylight that streams down from deeply inset,Paragraph
skylights—an effect equal to the widely esteemed lighting of Piano,Paragraph
at his best—made possible when Tschumi rotated the story above,Paragraph
this middle level of the museum. The sculptures are thus shown to,Paragraph
much better advantage than comparable works at Athens’s drab,Paragraph
"National Archaeological Museum, where several top-rank",Paragraph
masterpieces are undermined by poor one-source illumination.,Paragraph
"Under the lambent daylight of the Archaic Gallery, marbles",Caption
disclose translucence that eludes even the finest high-resolution,Paragraph
photography and reveal rare traces of original pigment—a shock to,Paragraph
those unaware that the ancient Greeks painted their statuary in bold,Paragraph
(and to modern tastes garish) polychrome. The pedestals here were,Paragraph
individually calibrated to the center of gravity of each object as a,Paragraph
"seismic precaution. Only breakable artifacts are kept behind glass,",Paragraph
and one’s ability to view pieces from all angles lends further,Paragraph
credence to the free-form display concept. This lively convocation of,Paragraph
"gods, goddesses, demigods, kouroi, korai, horses, mythical beasts,",Paragraph
"and grave stelae is electrifying, all the more so because the",Paragraph
ensemble includes such Ancient Art 101 mainstays as the Kritios,Paragraph
Kouros and the torso of the Rampin Rider (fitted with a casting of the,Paragraph
"horseman’s head, now in the Louvre).",Caption
Some critics have deplored the Archaic Gallery’s lack of clearly,Paragraph
differentiated display and traffic zones. But to me this seems a well-,Paragraph
"nigh-perfect installation, perhaps a result of the museum’s staff",Paragraph
having devised the arrangement not solely through the usual scale,Paragraph
models and cutout replicas of artworks but rather by experimenting,Paragraph
with the actual sculptures in the space itself. That almost unheard-of,Paragraph
method was afforded by the twenty-month lead time between the,Paragraph
initial transfer of the collection from the old Acropolis Museum of,Caption
"1874 (a small, undistinguished structure next to the Parthenon) and",Paragraph
"this building’s debut. The Archaic Gallery demonstrates, better than",Paragraph
"any other museum space in recent memory, that when great works",Paragraph
"are superlatively presented, architectural deficiencies can seem",Paragraph
practically irrelevant.,Paragraph
"With the exception of the Archaic Gallery, all the rest of the New",Paragraph
"Acropolis Museum, until one arrives at the top-floor Parthenon",Paragraph
"Gallery, is a disappointment. That is especially true of the museum’s",Paragraph
worst organizational blunder. Increasing levels of air pollution in,Paragraph
Athens have prompted removal of the Acropolis’s remaining,Paragraph
sculptures to prevent further erosion from acid rain. (They are being,Paragraph
replaced with facsimiles made from the same Pentelic marble as the,Paragraph
originals.) Among those pieces are five caryatids (columns in the,Paragraph
form of draped standing women) that formerly supported the so-,Paragraph
"called Porch of the Maidens on the Erechtheum, a small temple just",Paragraph
"to the north of the Parthenon. (One maiden was abducted by Elgin,",Paragraph
who in addition to decorative sculptures took away architectural,Paragraph
elements as study models for Britain’s burgeoning building-products,Paragraph
"industry.) In the New Acropolis Museum, this quintet of the four",Paragraph
Greek-owned caryatids and one replica have been reinstalled in,Paragraph
"their original configuration, but what ought to have been a",Paragraph
showstopper is a fiasco. These celebrated chiton-clad figures were,Paragraph
placed on a mezzanine balcony under which visitors pass into the,Caption
"Gallery of the Slopes on the first floor, and the sculptures are easy to",Paragraph
"miss if one does not turn around and look up. Furthermore, even",Paragraph
"though much of that soaring hall receives natural light, the caryatids",Paragraph
are diminished by inept artificial illumination.,Paragraph
At last visitors come to the museum’s make-or-break moment at,Paragraph
"the very top of the building, the Parthenon Gallery, which might be",Paragraph
called Exhibit A in Greece’s case before the court of world opinion.,Paragraph
Here we are immediately confronted by a thrilling panorama framed,Paragraph
by the floor-to-ceiling wraparound window wall: we see the,Paragraph
invincibly glorious sanctuary of Athena Parthenos from a vantage,Paragraph
point superbly calibrated in orientation (the temple seems,Paragraph
"illuminated in even northern light, like a model in an artist’s",Paragraph
"studio), proximity (from this three-hundred-yard remove, the full",Paragraph
"length of the monument can be encompassed in a single glance),",Paragraph
and perspective (the gentle thirty-one-degree sightline from the,Paragraph
gallery up to the Acropolis does not unduly foreshorten the,Paragraph
Parthenon).,Paragraph
"Less felicitously, this majestic vista is distractingly broken up by",Paragraph
"two overlapping, discordant metal grids: one holds the oblong panes",Paragraph
"of the top story’s curtain wall, the other supports an inner screen of",Paragraph
glass panels with steel cables and square gaskets. The two-and-a-,Paragraph
half-foot interstice between the two layers maximizes the circulation,Paragraph
of cooled air mandatory for a glass-skinned building in the,Paragraph
"desertlike Attic climate. But this plethora of superimposed,",Paragraph
misaligned rectangles recalls David Hockney’s mosaic-like,Paragraph
composites of pieced-together photographs. One yearns for glazing,Caption
details as seamless as the hyper-Minimalist transparency achieved,Paragraph
by the Japanese firm SANAA for their nearly invisible Glass Pavilion,Caption
of 2001-2006 at the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio.,Caption
Architects often purport to have reached design decisions that,Paragraph
"were so logical as to be inevitable and irrefutable, whereas almost",Paragraph
all such choices are in fact arbitrary to some extent. Tschumi,Paragraph
maintains that the Parthenon Gallery had to echo its subject as,Paragraph
closely as possible. It was easiest for him to approximate the outline,Paragraph
of the Parthenon’s ground plan within the confines of the museum’s,Paragraph
"loftlike, 128-by-276-foot top story. That story’s outer dimensions",Paragraph
allowed a broad ambulatory for viewing the sculptures on all four,Paragraph
sides of the floor-to-ceiling rectangular structure that the architect,Paragraph
"positioned at the center of the space. However, he could not also",Paragraph
replicate the prototype’s 40-foot height in a building that already,Paragraph
"towers over its surroundings as it is. Thus, in the 23.5-foot-high",Paragraph
"Parthenon Gallery, the metopes are seen from a vantage point lower",Paragraph
than they originally were on the temple. The architect’s dutiful,Paragraph
adherence to Modernism’s ban on outright imitation is reflected in a,Paragraph
"display that is schematic enough to avoid “Disneyfication,” an",Paragraph
unforgivable sin in the Eurocentric intellectual circles Tschumi,Paragraph
"frequents. Therefore, although the Parthenon Gallery has the exact",Paragraph
number of columns placed around the central display rectangle in,Paragraph
"the same arrangement visible in the near distance, these supports",Paragraph
are chilly stainless-steel tubes rather than warm fluted-marble,Paragraph
drums.,Paragraph
"In one crucial respect, this commendable installation creates an",Paragraph
impression quite the opposite of the client’s desired result. Mixed,Paragraph
among the pristine plaster metopes and Great Panathenaic,Paragraph
procession frieze—molded during the nineteenth century from the,Paragraph
British Museum’s holdings—are the degraded and discolored pieces,Paragraph
lately saved from the Parthenon. Granted that even the Elgin,Paragraph
Marbles themselves are no longer as white as these immaculate,Paragraph
"reproductions, anyone who has seen the London originals will agree",Paragraph
"that they are in far better shape than the Athens remnants, some of",Paragraph
which appear to have been marinated in tobacco juice.,Paragraph
"Other pieces here seem like half-dissolved sugar cubes, and it",Paragraph
takes a good visual imagination and knowledge of Classical,Paragraph
"iconography to figure out what some panels represent. (Helpfully,",Paragraph
small reproductions of the precise drawings made by the French,Caption
artist Jacques Carrey thirteen years before the 1687 bombardment,Title
have been placed next to the sculptures they document.) Present-,Paragraph
day Greeks dismiss any suggestion that Elgin may have actually,Paragraph
performed a great service by ensuring the protection of many,Paragraph
masterworks that otherwise would likely be in the same state of,Paragraph
"deterioration. But this side-by-side, before-and-after evidence speaks",Paragraph
for itself.,Paragraph
"Given the highly charged political imperative of this project, one",Paragraph
had half expected a polemical presentation on the order of the artist,Paragraph
"Hans Haacke’s scathing installation pieces, in which he takes deadly",Paragraph
aim at the sinister symbiosis between cultural institutions and,Paragraph
corporate interests. But instead of rhetorical stunts—pedestals,Paragraph
"standing empty under spotlights, vacant walls emblazoned with",Paragraph
"accusatory texts—Tschumi’s neutrally detailed, gray-painted matrix",Paragraph
makes Greece’s portion of the Parthenon legacy seem unexpectedly,Paragraph
"abundant, and the facsimile inserts are not so jarring as anticipated.",Paragraph
"No matter what the eventual outcome of the Elgin Marbles saga, this",Paragraph
long-suffering treasure will never be complete because of the many,Paragraph
"irretrievable losses it has suffered, even if all the surviving pieces",Paragraph
were reassembled in one place.,Paragraph
Bernard Tschumi’s Parthenon Gallery conveys a remarkably full,Paragraph
impression of the original ensemble. Given the riches on display one,Paragraph
"story below this, and the even more stupendous holdings in Athens’s",Paragraph
"National Archaeological Museum, the modern Greeks’ relentless",Title
determination to own every last one of the Parthenon marbles seems,Paragraph
more than a bit selfish. These are not trading cards with a wrapper,Paragraph
urging “Collect them all!” Greece is to be congratulated for finally,Paragraph
improving upon the dumpy old Acropolis Museum. But,Paragraph
monopolizing a common inheritance of all mankind is anything but,Paragraph

attempted to portray the institution’s relocation to Philadelphia’s,Paragraph

"restored, the Barnes was effectively bankrupt by the turn of the",Paragraph
millennium. In 2002 the foundation’s beleaguered board members,Paragraph
petitioned a court to let them break Albert Barnes’s trust indenture,Paragraph
and move his art to the center of Philadelphia in order to make it,Paragraph
more convenient to the general public—admission had been by,Paragraph
appointment only and was severely limited—and thereby alleviate,Paragraph
"the institution’s fiscal crisis, a remedy enabled by the financial",Paragraph
backing of foundations and individuals who supported the departure,Paragraph
from Lower Merion and made their funding contingent on it. Barnes,Paragraph
had insisted that none of his eight hundred paintings or thousands,Paragraph
"of other objects could ever be sold, loaned, or removed from the",Paragraph
"elaborate installations he contrived for them. Thus, the court agreed",Paragraph
to the relocation after Barnes officials guaranteed that the collector’s,Paragraph
displays would be strictly maintained in the institution’s new home.,Paragraph
"Barnes, whose father labored in a Philadelphia slaughterhouse,",Paragraph
put himself through the University of Pennsylvania and earned a,Paragraph
"medical degree, but he saw greater financial potential in",Paragraph
manufacturing medicines. He teamed up with a more technically,Paragraph
adept colleague who devised the formula for an antiseptic eyewash,Paragraph
that prevented congenital gonorrheal infections in newborns. A,Paragraph
"skillful marketer, Barnes bought out his partner for a relative",Paragraph
pittance and went on to make a fortune from the soon-ubiquitous,Paragraph
"optical solution, which he named Argyrol. The elder Barnes was a",Paragraph
"friend of Peter Widener, a fellow abattoir worker who later became",Paragraph
a trolley magnate and an important art patron. Widener’s example,Paragraph
"likely inspired the younger Barnes to assemble his own, far more",Paragraph
significant collection once the big money began to roll in.,Paragraph
"In 1912 Barnes asked an old Philadelphia high school classmate,",Paragraph
"the artist William Glackens, to buy paintings for him in Europe, and",Paragraph
"his friend’s selection of choice works by Cézanne, Renoir, van Gogh,",Paragraph
and Picasso set the tone for the collection. Starting with Glackens’s,Paragraph
"choices, Barnes, relying on his own formidable artistic judgment,",Paragraph
"went on to build a collection of 46 Picassos, 59 Matisses, 69",Paragraph
"Cézannes, and 181 Renoirs, as well as Old Master pictures by Hans",Paragraph
"Baldung Grien, Tintoretto, Veronese, El Greco, Frans Hals, Salomon",Caption
"van Ruisdael, Claude Lorrain, and Goya, along with Modernist",Paragraph
"works by Courbet, Daumier, Degas, Manet, Monet, Gauguin,",Caption
"Toulouse-Lautrec, the Douanier Rousseau, Redon, Braque,",Caption
"Modigliani, Utrillo, de Chirico, Soutine, Klee, Miré, and the",Paragraph
"Americans Maurice Prendergast, Charles Demuth, Glackens,",Caption
"Marsden Hartley, and Horace Pippin. (Barnes’s Renoirs—the one",Paragraph
instance when his superlative eye failed him—are his collection’s,Paragraph
weakest link. His taste tended toward the artist’s excruciating late,Paragraph
"female nudes, grotesque creatures with puny craniums and colossal",Paragraph
bottoms—wobbly orange-tinted images of flesh so bloated that they,Paragraph
seem eerily prophetic of our country’s current pandemic of morbid,Paragraph
obesity.),Paragraph
"To house them, in 1922 Barnes engaged the French-born Beaux",Paragraph
Arts architect Paul Philippe Cret (now best remembered as Louis,Paragraph
Kahn’s teacher at the University of Pennsylvania) to build an,Paragraph
"imposing limestone-clad mansion in Lower Merion, a township",Caption
bordering Philadelphia to the northwest. There he intermingled his,Paragraph
pictures in galleries further crowded with Pennsylvania German,Caption
"painted furniture, Native and Early American pottery, Navajo",Caption
"jewelry, Greek antiquities, classical Chinese sculpture, and any other",Title
rare and beautiful objects that caught his all-encompassing eye.,Paragraph
Certainly the oddest component of these eclectic ensembles was the,Paragraph
array of metal hardware and utensils he hung all around his,Paragraph
paintings like nimbuses emanating from saints—curlicues of antique,Paragraph
wrought iron that often echo sinuous linear elements in canvases or,Paragraph
decorative objects near them. Detached from their functional,Paragraph
"setting, these finely crafted door knockers, escutcheons, hinges,",Paragraph
"keys, ladles, latches, padlocks, and other implements serve as",Paragraph
calligraphic glosses on the pictures they surround.,Paragraph
An even more effective display element is the ocher-colored,Paragraph
"burlap Barnes specified for the gallery walls, a color so harmonious",Paragraph
with most of his pictures that one wonders why it is not widely,Paragraph
copied elsewhere. Another controversial aspect of the installation,Paragraph
"was his practice of “skying” pictures in tiers two or three rows high,",Paragraph
a vertical arrangement traditionally employed by the Académie des,Paragraph
Beaux-Arts in Paris and the Royal Academy in London for their,Paragraph
annual exhibitions. Yet the Barnes galleries are so well proportioned,Paragraph
and the pictures so intelligently disposed that there is almost never,Paragraph
any difficulty in seeing even things positioned high on the walls.,Paragraph
"Certain pictures, the Cézannes in particular, are strong enough to be",Paragraph
read without difficulty across a large room even when hung eight,Paragraph
"feet up, as his Large Bathers is. The only serious exception is Seurat’s",Paragraph
"Poseuses, a tableau of artist’s models that possesses the transcendent",Paragraph
equilibrium of a Botticelli. In an instance of complete aesthetic,Paragraph
"overkill, Barnes placed that shimmering Pointillist apparition, which",Paragraph
"begs to be seen at close range as well as from a further remove, over",Paragraph
Cézanne’s somewhat smaller but monumental The Card Players.,Paragraph
"On occasion, Barnes’s juxtapositions, all of which are maintained",Paragraph
"in the new museum, can be breathtaking. For example, in Room 22,",Paragraph
"on the second floor, the face-off between two ferocious Picasso oil",Paragraph
"studies of African-masklike heads (1907), contemporary with his",Paragraph
"revolutionary Demoiselles d’Avignon, sets up a reciprocal magnetism",Paragraph
further intensified by three late-medieval figures of the crucified,Paragraph
Christ hung between these small but terrifying pictures. Barnes may,Paragraph
"have been a crank, but he was also touched with some kind of",Paragraph
genius. That appears especially clear now that visitors can see these,Paragraph
fabled works better than at any time since Barnes bought them. The,Paragraph
Lower Merion galleries were immersed in a depressingly subfusc,Paragraph
gloom because the curtains were always drawn to keep out harmful,Paragraph
ultraviolet rays.,Paragraph
Thus the most welcome aspect of the new Barnes is the veritable,Paragraph
visual resurrection occasioned by the lighting designer Paul,Paragraph
Marantz’s exquisite calibration and mixture of natural and artificial,Paragraph
illumination—only two of the twenty-three display rooms do not,Paragraph
have some daylight—which made even those well acquainted with,Paragraph
the collection wonder if the works were cleaned as part of the,Paragraph
"reinstallation, though they were not. Perhaps the luckiest",Paragraph
beneficiary of this transformation is Matisse’s tripartite mural The,Paragraph
"Dance (1932-1933), which Barnes commissioned for the lunettes",Paragraph
just below the ceiling of the triple-height Main Room. This jazzy,Paragraph
"composition has always fairly vibrated with kinetic energy, but now",Paragraph
"its plummy colors strut their stuff, too.",Paragraph
Although several informative new books were issued in,Paragraph
"conjunction with the opening of the Philadelphia gallery in 2012,",Paragraph
the finest publication on the collection remains Great French,Paragraph
"Paintings from the Barnes Foundation: Impressionist, Post-Impressionist,",Title
and Early Modern (1993). It was the first book to reproduce these,Paragraph
"works in color, which Barnes had prohibited because he believed",Paragraph
that his pictures’ true tonalities would inevitably be misrepresented.,Paragraph
This classic volume is especially commendable for the art historian,Paragraph
"Joseph J. Rishel’s entries on Cézanne, which include some of the",Paragraph
"finest writing on that artist by any scholar, including the brilliant",Paragraph
"Meyer Schapiro, whom Barnes spitefully barred from Lower Merion",Paragraph
while he let Cub Scout packs and the odd working Joe roam his,Paragraph
overwhelming galleries.,Paragraph
The design for the new Barnes emerged through an invitational,Paragraph
"competition organized in 2007 by Martha Thorne, executive director",Paragraph
"of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, who was assisted by several well-",Paragraph
"informed advisers, including the veteran architectural editor",Paragraph
"Suzanne Stephens. Portfolios were solicited from some thirty firms,",Paragraph
"and the selection committee, which included Barnes trustees and",Paragraph
"representatives of institutions backing the move, evaluated a well-",Paragraph
"chosen short list of six finalists: Tadao Ando, Thom Mayne of",Paragraph
"Morphosis, and Rafael Moneo (all Pritzker Prize winners), as well as",Paragraph
"Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Kengo Kuma, and Williams and Tsien. The",Paragraph
"latter’s powerful little drawing, titled “Gallery in a Garden, Garden",Paragraph
"in a Gallery,” depicts an oblong ensemble of the same approximate",Paragraph
outlines as Cret’s Barnes. Williams and Tsien’s proposal was likewise,Paragraph
centered amid a landscape reminiscent of the original building’s,Paragraph
"graceful arboretum, with the addition of a small garden within a",Paragraph
three-story-high glass-enclosed cloister inserted into the heart of the,Caption
gallery wing in place of a light well in the Cret original. (That,Paragraph
building is being retained by the foundation for horticultural,Caption
programs.),Paragraph
The exterior of the new Barnes is as well considered as the site,Paragraph
"planning, and both are perfectly enhanced by the elegant and",Paragraph
"appropriately Gallic landscape design by Laurie Olin, which features",Paragraph
"ranks of low hedges, allées of specimen trees, serene reflecting",Paragraph
"pools, and pathways of terre pisée—rammed earth. The long",Paragraph
elevation of the building is set parallel to the north side of the,Caption
"Benjamin Franklin Parkway of 1917, the broad tree-lined boulevard",Caption
that the French urban planner and architect Jacques Gréber sliced at,Paragraph
a diagonal into William Penn’s symmetrical grid plan of 1683 in a,Paragraph
fanciful bid to give the staid Quaker City some Parisian élan. This,Paragraph
Beaux Arts—inspired outburst of Francomania was also responsible,Paragraph
"for Cret and Gréber’s jewel-like Rodin Museum of 1926-1929,",Caption
"directly northwest of the Barnes, devoted to the foremost modern",Paragraph
French sculptor.,Paragraph
Williams and Tsien’s $150 million structure is surfaced in pale,Paragraph
"beige Negev limestone, which harmonizes beautifully with the",Paragraph
limestone-clad Rodin next door. The architects’ handling of the,Paragraph
masonry is ravishing. They deployed large rectangles of the tawny,Paragraph
material in rhythmic patterns reminiscent of the geometric kente-,Paragraph
"cloth motifs woven by the Ashanti and Ewe peoples of West Africa,",Paragraph
"and interspersed the stone with thin, straight-edged, hammered-",Paragraph
bronze “fins” that protrude slightly beyond the wall plane. This,Paragraph
subtle detailing creates intriguing shadow patterns and alludes,Paragraph
obliquely to the artisanal metalwork hung in the galleries within.,Paragraph
"This likeness to tribal textiles is most fitting, given Albert Barnes’s",Paragraph
determination to accord African tribal objects the same exalted,Paragraph
"status as European art, and his deep interest in African-American",Paragraph
"culture. Beyond that specific reference, the exterior stonework is a",Paragraph
"compositional masterstroke, for the architects’ division of the",Caption
cladding into three huge horizontal bands at once brings the,Paragraph
structure down to human proportions while at the same time giving,Paragraph
it a civic monumentality.,Paragraph
One’s first view of the Barnes is reminiscent of the approach to,Paragraph
"Cret’s Folger Shakespeare Library of 1929-1932 in Washington,",Caption
"D.C., which is sited similarly, shares the same approximate",Paragraph
"dimensions, and is likewise masonry-clad but lacks the columns,",Paragraph
"balustrades, rounded pediments, and other traditional detailing of",Paragraph
the slightly earlier Lower Merion gallery. The close resemblance of,Paragraph
Barnes I and Barnes II is of course not surprising given that the new,Paragraph
building was designed to follow the layout of the original,Paragraph
installation exactly. That determination—which fortunately did not,Paragraph
extend to replicating the original building’s Neoclassical exterior as,Paragraph
part of the bargain—meant that Williams and Tsien decided to,Paragraph
retain the arrangement of windows and doors dictated by the rooms,Paragraph
"within. This has been all to the good, because the faultless",Paragraph
proportions characteristic of the Classical tradition were,Paragraph
"scrupulously observed by Cret, whose oeuvre evolved from the",Paragraph
conventional Beaux Arts proprieties of Barnes I to the more modern,Paragraph
Stripped Classicism of the Folger.,Paragraph
"Apart from their superscale handling of the exterior stonework,",Paragraph
Williams and Tsien’s boldest conceptual gambit was to surmount the,Paragraph
"93,000-square-foot Barnes with a gigantic horizontal superstructure",Paragraph
they call the Light Box: an immense translucent white-glass bar that,Paragraph
dramatically cantilevers forty feet beyond the building’s north end,Caption
and sixty feet beyond the south end. I will admit to having been,Paragraph
"highly skeptical of this particular aspect of the scheme at first, but",Paragraph
upon completion instantly understood its correctness. When,Paragraph
"illuminated from within at night, the Light Box serves as a wordless",Paragraph
marquee that announces this singular new presence and imparts a,Paragraph
"boldly contemporary quality that makes it apparent, even from afar,",Paragraph
that the new Barnes is not some gorgeously preserved cultural,Paragraph
corpse laid out for solemn visitation. The full impact of the,Paragraph
capacious Light Court beneath the Light Box—an internal plaza that,Paragraph
"measures 170 feet long, 45 feet wide, and 52 feet high at its apex—",Paragraph
is felt with particular force as one exits the gallery wing. After the at,Paragraph
"times claustrophobic impact of Barnes’s jam-packed installations,",Paragraph
you experience an astonishing whoosh of open space that comes as a,Paragraph
liberating relief.,Paragraph
To the rear of the site the architects placed a reverse-L-shaped,Paragraph
"office-and-temporary-exhibition wing, parallel to and touching the",Paragraph
"gallery structure, between which the Light Court serves as a central",Paragraph
gathering space. Entry to the Barnes is by advance ticket sale only,Paragraph
"and timed to a maximum of 125 visitors per hour, with a total of",Paragraph
"250 allowed in the galleries at any one time. Educational services,",Paragraph
"including a lending library, auditorium, and classrooms to",Paragraph
accommodate the art-appreciation lessons Barnes so passionately,Paragraph
believed in—he was a follower and friend of the philosopher John,Paragraph
"Dewey, whose pragmatism informed his ideas about culture in a",Paragraph
democracy—are housed in a subterranean story.,Paragraph
The offer by the Barnes Foundation to reproduce the old galleries,Paragraph
made many observers fear that this concession would limit the,Paragraph
"designers to an exercise in cultural taxidermy, with little scope left",Paragraph
"for architectural originality. Remarkably, Williams and Tsien found",Paragraph
unexpected expressive range within the confines they were bound to,Paragraph
observe. In that respect the outcome of this project is dazzling—the,Paragraph
new Barnes is infinitely superior to the vast number of museums,Paragraph
"designed with a completely free hand, and in hindsight, Judge",Paragraph
Stanley R. Ott’s 2004 ruling in favor of the move to Philadelphia,Paragraph
seems Solomonic in its wisdom.,Paragraph
Williams and Tsien are among several first-rank husband-and-wife,Paragraph
architectural teams to emerge in the generation that followed such,Paragraph
pioneering coprofessional couples as Alison and Peter Smithson in,Paragraph
Britain and Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown in the US. Tod,Paragraph
Culpan Williams was born in 1943 to a well-to-do WASP family in,Paragraph
"Michigan—his father, an automotive engineer, invented the",Paragraph
electrically controlled seat-adjustment device—and graduated from,Paragraph
the private Cranbrook School (part of Eliel Saarinen’s celebrated,Paragraph
campus of 1926-1943 in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills) four,Paragraph
years before Mitt Romney. He went on to study architecture at,Paragraph
"Princeton, and after an apprenticeship with the neo-Corbusian",Paragraph
"Richard Meier, set up his own Manhattan office in 1974. Billie Tsien",Paragraph
"was born in 1949 in Ithaca, New York, to Chinese-American parents;",Paragraph
"her father was an electrical engineer, her mother a biochemist. She",Paragraph
"received degrees in fine arts at Yale and architecture at UCLA, and",Paragraph
"joined Williams’s firm in 1977. They married six years later,",Paragraph
"officially became professional partners in 1986, and have one son,",Paragraph
"Kai Tsien Williams, an industrial designer. Apart from their",Paragraph
extraordinary individual talents and complementary balance of,Title
"design skills—he concentrates on structural aspects, she attends to",Paragraph
"materials and finishes, though neither confines themselves",Paragraph
exclusively to these tasks—Williams and Tsien stand out among,Paragraph
their contemporaries for a determination to keep their staff small,Paragraph
enough to maintain the hands-on control they deem essential to an,Paragraph
art-based practice. Their firm generally takes on only two new,Paragraph
"assignments each year, has never had more than forty employees,",Paragraph
and currently numbers around twenty.,Paragraph
"As a result, their output has been relatively small: twenty-seven",Paragraph
"institutional buildings completed thus far, and seven houses. Unlike",Paragraph
"several Pritzker Prize winners, they have never designed one of",Paragraph
those increasingly common retail showplaces or high-end,Paragraph
condominiums exploited as signature “branding” by international,Paragraph
luxury-goods conglomerates. They prefer to work solely for,Paragraph
"educational and cultural institutions, following the example of Louis",Paragraph
"Kahn, who likewise sidestepped involvement with corporations.",Paragraph
Among the couple’s best designs is the Williams Natatorium of,Paragraph
"1998-1999 at his high school alma mater, Cranbrook, to which his",Paragraph
parents bequeathed $2 million toward the $10 million cost of the,Paragraph
project. Because Eliel Saarinen’s vision for the campus was so,Paragraph
"comprehensive, it has been very hard for other architects to add to",Paragraph
his minutely coordinated ensemble. Far and away the most,Paragraph
successful post-Saarinen structure there is this majestic indoor,Paragraph
"swimming-pool hall, which numbers among the handsomest sports",Paragraph
facilities of recent decades.,Paragraph
Williams and Tsien evoke the spiritual essence of Saarinen’s,Paragraph
Nordic Arts and Crafts aesthetic through a combination of strong but,Paragraph
"simple massing, substantial but never ostentatious materials,",Paragraph
"subdued colors, contrasting textures, hand-wrought details, and an",Paragraph
"overall sense of self-contained dignity. Indeed, they surpass Saarinen",Paragraph
by imbuing a workaday athletics building with a mysterious aura,Paragraph
"akin to that attained by his greatest fellow Finnish architect, Alvar",Paragraph
"Aalto, peerless humanist of the Modern Movement. The ceiling over",Caption
the Cranbrook swimming pool is painted midnight blue and features,Paragraph
"two retractable ovoid skylights that open to the sky, evoking the",Paragraph
“clearing in a forest” motif found time and again in Aalto’s interiors.,Paragraph
Another of their outstanding efforts offered an unfortunate,Paragraph
demonstration of the vulnerability that even high-style architecture,Paragraph
is subject to in an age of cultural gigantism. The American Folk Art,Paragraph
Museum of 1997-2001 (see Illustration 15b) was erected on two,Paragraph
"narrow adjacent townhouse plots on Manhattan’s West 53rd Street,",Paragraph
just west of the Museum of Modern Art. That property once,Paragraph
"belonged to the longtime MoMA benefactor Blanchette Rockefeller,",Paragraph
who gave the land to the folk art museum much to the later chagrin,Paragraph
of MoMA when it embarked on Yoshio Taniguchi’s massive,Paragraph
aggrandizement of 1997-2003. The American Folk Art Museum,Caption
opened in the economically shaky aftermath of the 2001 terrorist,Paragraph
attacks and its financial footing was further undermined by the,Paragraph
Great Recession later in the decade. By 2011 its trustees felt,Paragraph
"compelled to sell the Williams and Tsien building to MoMA, which",Paragraph
two years later announced that it would demolish this architectural,Paragraph
"gem to make way for yet another expansion, thereby setting off",Paragraph
heated public protests.,Paragraph
"Sadly, Williams and Tsien’s brilliant maximizing of an absurdly",Paragraph
constrained mid-block site—which they overcame with illusionistic,Paragraph
sleights of hand much like those John Soane used to turn his London,Paragraph
house-museum of 1808-1824 into a marvel of soaring top-lit spaces,Paragraph
—mnever won an enthusiastic audience beyond design professionals.,Paragraph
"By ingeniously engineering a veritable exoskeleton of concrete,",Paragraph
Williams freed almost the entire volume of the building envelope,Paragraph
from the interior steel supports of conventional high-rise,Caption
"construction, All the same, a good deal of the space he gained had",Paragraph
to be devoted to vertical circulation—stairways and elevators—and,Paragraph
"the museum’s display areas sometimes felt hemmed in. Still,",Paragraph
architectural aficionados marveled at the ingenuity and care,Paragraph
Williams and Tsien invested in this difficult task and were outraged,Paragraph
by what more than one critic termed MoMA’s act of architectural,Paragraph
vandalism.,Paragraph
"Completed several months after the Barnes, the Reva and David",Paragraph
Logan Center for Creative and Performing Arts of 2007-2012 at the,Caption
University of Chicago (see Illustration 15c) is situated at the,Paragraph
southwest corner of the school’s Midway campus. Logan Center was,Paragraph
"envisioned not only to consolidate related cultural activities—music,",Paragraph
"theater, film, dance, studio art, and art history—that had been",Paragraph
scattered throughout the sprawling complex but also to act as a,Paragraph
"gateway between the university and the South Side community,",Paragraph
whose residents (well over 90 percent of whom are African-,Paragraph
American) have long felt alienated from an institution they view as,Paragraph
elitist and indifferent to them. The striking 170-foot-high tower that,Paragraph
makes Logan visible from afar—a syncopated flat-topped high-rise,Paragraph
pylon that subliminally channels the Art Deco flair of Chicago’s,Paragraph
1933 Century of Progress exposition—signifies the welcome being,Paragraph
offered there to neighborhood performing arts groups.,Paragraph
The $114 million Logan Center cost about 20 percent less than,Paragraph
"the Barnes but at 184,000 square feet is twice as large. The rich",Paragraph
materials of the Barnes are contrasted here with far more modest,Paragraph
"components—steel instead of bronze, tile instead of mosaic, cork",Paragraph
"instead of parquet flooring, industrial felt wall coverings instead of",Paragraph
custom silk weavings. The exterior is clad in supersized “bricks” of,Paragraph
"midwestern limestone four feet long, four inches high, and four",Paragraph
"inches deep, which the architects wanted to relate to the limestone",Paragraph
employed throughout the campus but also to allude to the elongated,Paragraph
Roman brick that Frank Lloyd Wright used for his nearby Robie,Paragraph
house of 1906-1910. Yet the architects’ commitment to quality and,Paragraph
attention to detail are identical in both the Logan and the Barnes,Paragraph
"schemes, as is the intricate organizational planning that fits a",Paragraph
"bewildering array of functional requirements—at Logan, rehearsal",Caption
"rooms, recital halls ranging from black-box experimental spaces to a",Paragraph
"full-dress auditorium, screening room, classrooms, offices, and",Caption
common areas—into a coherent and thoroughly satisfying whole.,Paragraph
"The Barnes, however, will be very hard for Tod Williams and",Paragraph
Billie Tsien to surpass no matter how long their project list grows,Paragraph
over time. It must now be included among the tiny handful of,Paragraph
intimately scaled museums in which great art and equally great,Paragraph
architecture and landscape design coalesce into that rare experience,Paragraph
wherein these three complementary mediums enhance the best,Paragraph
qualities of one another to maximum benefit. Such institutions,Paragraph
"include, for example, Jorgen Bo and Vilhelm Wohlert’s Louisiana",Paragraph
"Museum of Modern Art of 1958-1966 outside Copenhagen, Louis",Caption
"Kahn’s Kimbell Art Museum of 1966-1972 in Fort Worth, and Renzo",Caption
Piano’s Nasher Sculpture Center of 1999-2003 in Dallas. The,Paragraph
incorrigibly contentious and gleefully litigious Albert Barnes—who,Paragraph
"loved a good lawsuit as much as a good Cézanne, it would seem,",Paragraph
and who got no end of pleasure from rebuffing the great and the,Paragraph
good of the art establishment—would probably have railed against,Paragraph
the ultimate disposition of his life’s work. Yet what cannot be,Paragraph
"disputed is that with the final withering of his posthumous grip, a",Paragraph
generous vision of art’s life-enhancing potential at long last came,Paragraph
into full focus.,Paragraph

KAZUYO SEJIMA AND RYUE NISHIZAWA,Title
FoR MorE THAN three decades an often dolorous springtime ritual for,Paragraph
lovers of the building art has been the announcement of the latest,Paragraph
winner of the Pritzker Prize for Architecture. Skepticism about the,Paragraph
"Pritzker seemed hardly misplaced from its inception, when in 1979",Paragraph
"Philip Johnson, the dark prince of Modernism, was named its first",Paragraph
"recipient, a choice that hinted at a certain cynicism and want of",Paragraph
"imagination. The $100,000 award had been instituted a year earlier",Paragraph
"by the Chicago-based Pritzker family, owners of the Hyatt hotel",Paragraph
"chain, whose claim that this would become the Nobel of",Paragraph
"architecture struck some observers as quite presumptuous, to say",Paragraph
"nothing of rather ironic, given that the donors have erected so many",Paragraph
banal structures in cities around the world. Particularly vexing was,Paragraph
"their central role in promoting John Portman, the Atlanta-based",Paragraph
architect and developer whose glitzy but hermetic atrium hotels,Paragraph
made the Pritzkers billions but had a deeply destructive effect on,Paragraph
American urbanism. Though more admirable figures immediately,Paragraph
followed Johnson (Luis Barragdn in 1980 and James Stirling in,Paragraph
"1981), thereafter the prize too often went either to stars with",Paragraph
"overinflated reputations—Kevin Roche (1982), Hans Hollein (1985),",Paragraph
"Gordon Bunshaft (1988), and Jorn Utzon (2003)—or lesser-known",Paragraph
architects whose critical standing remained essentially unchanged,Paragraph
"by the accolade, including Gottfried B6hm (1986) and Christian de",Paragraph
Portzamparc (1994).,Paragraph
Thus the revelation in 2010 of what were widely perceived as,Paragraph
"surprise winners, Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa—the",Paragraph
principals of the Tokyo-based firm SANAA (Sejima and Nishizawa,Paragraph
and Associates)—was cause for rejoicing among those who treasure,Paragraph
the honorees’ delicately calibrated and deeply humane sensibility.,Paragraph
They are further unusual in architecture as a female-male pair who,Paragraph
"are not married to each other and, rarer still, one in which the",Paragraph
senior partner is a woman. The selection of Sejima and Nishizawa,Paragraph
marked a significant and encouraging departure from past Pritzker,Paragraph
practices—including at least one that adversely affected the prize’s,Paragraph
credibility. In 1991 the award went to Robert Venturi but not to his,Paragraph
"collaborator and wife, Denise Scott Brown, with the specious",Paragraph
"explanation that it is bestowed on individual practitioners, not",Paragraph
firms. Persistent rumblings about that gratuitous snub—made worse,Paragraph
because there were thirteen male winners before Venturi but no,Paragraph
women whatsoever—evidently prompted the Pritzker to play catch-,Paragraph
"up by selecting the first team to jointly win, Jacques Herzog and",Paragraph
"Pierre de Meuron (2001), and the first female recipient, Zaha Hadid",Paragraph
(2004).,Paragraph
"Kazuyo Sejima was born in 1956 in Ibaraki prefecture, northeast",Paragraph
"of Tokyo. She studied at Japan Women’s University, and upon",Paragraph
"graduation became an assistant in the Tokyo office of Toyo Ito,",Paragraph
winner of the 2013 Pritzker Prize and one of the leading architects,Paragraph
"of the preceding generation, which also includes Tadao Ando. Ito’s",Paragraph
"designs are noteworthy for a particular lightness of touch, a quality",Paragraph
"very much in evidence in the work of Sejima, his most celebrated",Paragraph
protégé. Her exceptional talent was recognized early on. During a,Paragraph
"visit to Japan in 1984 to see Ito’s buildings, I heard reports from",Paragraph
other young architects of a prodigiously gifted Miss Sejima in his,Paragraph
studio who mesmerized her male colleagues with both her fluent,Paragraph
design skills and considerable personal charms. In 1987 she struck,Paragraph
"out on her own and set up Kazuyo Sejima and Associates, the name",Paragraph
of which she changed in 1995 to SANAA to reflect her new,Paragraph
"partnership with Ryue Nishizawa. Ten years her junior, he was born",Paragraph
near Yokohama in 1966 and earned a degree at Yokohama National,Paragraph
University. The two architects’ pairing had its difficulties from the,Paragraph
outset—she is known to be as equable as he is volatile—and in 1997,Paragraph
"the younger partner set up an independent practice, Office of Ryue",Paragraph
"Nishizawa, to pursue projects apart from Sejima, an unusual",Paragraph
accommodation that has allowed their sometimes contentious but,Paragraph
nonetheless highly fruitful creative collaboration to continue.,Paragraph
Personal presentation plays an important role in architects’,Paragraph
advancement. Philip Johnson’s access to corporate boardrooms,Title
unquestionably benefited from his impeccable bespoke navy,Paragraph
pinstriped suits and commanding black Corbusier spectacles.,Paragraph
Hadid’s outsized éclat derives in large measure from her famously,Paragraph
"tempestuous demeanor and dramatic dress sense, which make her",Paragraph
seem the prima donna in her own private Aida. Thus a photograph,Paragraph
of Sejima and Nishizawa released at the time they won the Pritzker,Paragraph
was refreshingly antithetical to the norms of architectural power,Paragraph
"portraiture. In it, Nishizawa resembles an amiable novice yoga",Paragraph
"instructor in his rumpled white shirt, while the adorably dorky",Paragraph
"Sejima, wearing a doll-like frock (quite likely by her favorite fashion",Paragraph
"designer, Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons) and droopy",Paragraph
"eyeglasses, brings to mind a Roz Chast cartoon character in the",Paragraph
"flesh, bemused and a bit bewildered. Yet whether they look stylish",Paragraph
"or not, Sejima and Nishizawa’s architectural merit is so self-evident",Paragraph
that it negates any suspicion of remedial tokenism or backpedaling,Paragraph
for the Pritzker’s prior lapses.,Paragraph
The partners are best known in the United States for two,Paragraph
exceptional museum commissions: the Glass Pavilion of 2002-2006,Title
at the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio and the New Museum of,Caption
Contemporary Art of 2003-2007 on New York City’s Bowery. Along,Paragraph
with their 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art of 1999-2004,Paragraph
"in Japan, this nearly contemporaneous trio of public galleries offers",Paragraph
an impressive demonstration of the designers’ virtuosity within one,Paragraph
"functional category, and shows the remarkable breadth of",Paragraph
expression they are able to wrest from the restricted Minimalist,Paragraph
palette. Minimalist architecture is thought to require an,Paragraph
"extraordinary degree of perfection in materials, finish, and detailing",Paragraph
in order to compensate for the lack of range inherent in this severely,Paragraph
reductive aesthetic. Yet SANAA’s repeated (though never repetitive),Paragraph
"use of pure geometric forms, unadorned white surfaces, and large",Paragraph
expanses of clear glass (seemingly held in place by little more than,Paragraph
the designers’ willpower) is not in the least dependent on the top-of-,Paragraph

"elongated linear layout of the historic Palais du Louvre in Paris,",Paragraph

noteworthy amount of virtually unusable space where billowing,Paragraph

Sejima and Nishizawa’s ability to overcome physical and financial,Title
limitations is most apparent in their New Museum of Contemporary,Paragraph
"Art in Manhattan (see Illustration 16b), a slender, off-kilter high-rise",Paragraph
shoehorned into an improbably tiny mid-block site that the,Paragraph
architects exploit with all the cunning of urban planners inured to,Paragraph
the impossibly tight building lots of Tokyo. The New Museum is one,Paragraph
"of those rare, clarifying works of architecture that makes most",Paragraph
recent buildings of the same sort look suddenly ridiculous. This,Paragraph
mesmerizing 174-foot-high tower demonstrates the power of,Paragraph
understatement more convincingly than any Manhattan structure,Paragraph
since Mies’s Seagram Building was completed five decades earlier.,Paragraph
Some museum boards think that choosing an architect can be,Paragraph
"reduced to a science, but in the final analysis it comes down to a",Paragraph
"matter of taste, though also of courage in those instances when a",Paragraph
patron is willing to hire a relatively untested designer. A short list of,Paragraph
prospective designers speaks volumes about the likely outcome. If,Paragraph
"the candidates’ styles are too divergent, the search committee",Paragraph
doesn’t know what it wants. If one contestant seems the odd man,Paragraph
"out, the fix might be in. Thus many observers were both surprised",Paragraph
and impressed with the New Museum’s unconventional but highly,Paragraph
"informed short list, comprising five experimentally minded firms",Paragraph
"esteemed by architecture aficionados but otherwise unknown, and",Paragraph
they were even more impressed by the ultimate selection of Sejima,Paragraph
"and Nishizawa, who were poised on the threshold of greatness but",Paragraph
still needed a brave client to give them their big international break.,Paragraph
"When SANAA won this commission in 2002, the firm had not yet",Paragraph
built beyond Japan. In Manhattan the architects displayed the same,Paragraph
"engaging qualities they evidenced in Kanazawa, although this high-",Paragraph
rise scheme for a cosmopolitan audience could hardly be more,Paragraph
different from that Japanese museum in form and social setting.,Paragraph
What constitutes “contemporary” art is an interesting question in,Paragraph
itself. The big international auction houses now define,Paragraph
"contemporary art as works made during the past thirty-five years,",Paragraph
"with earlier pieces designated as “modern.” The New Museum, an",Paragraph
exhibition space freed from the burdens of building a permanent,Paragraph
"collection, can concentrate on the present in a way no longer",Paragraph
"possible for mainstream institutions, including what wags have",Paragraph
called the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art. Provocative,Paragraph
contemporary art of the kind championed by the New Museum since,Paragraph
its founding by Marcia Tucker in 1977 looks best in settings that,Paragraph
aren’t overly refined—one reason why recycled warehouses and,Paragraph
factories have made such effective galleries.,Paragraph
On Manhattan’s still gritty if increasingly fashionable Lower East,Paragraph
"Side, SANAA captured a utilitarian spirit without resorting to the",Paragraph
pseudo-industrial effects of Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers’s,Title
Pompidou Center in Paris. Here Sejima and Nishizawa managed to,Paragraph
"wrest a series of flexible, loftlike exhibition spaces from a site so",Paragraph
tiny that the designers’ sleight of hand approaches architectural,Paragraph
alchemy. The New Museum seems even more of an accomplishment,Paragraph
than SANAA’s venture in Ohio because the New York client couldn’t,Paragraph
"afford costly finishes on a no-frills, $50 million budget. Despite their",Paragraph
"commitment to Minimalism, Sejima and Nishizawa generally make",Paragraph
perfection a nonissue save in instances such as their Lausanne,Paragraph
"building, where minimal standards dip too low. They escape the",Paragraph
tyranny of costly detailing and sidestep the Modernist obsession,Paragraph
with finely wrought specifics in favor of boldly conceived,Paragraph
"generalities, and thereby get more bang for the buck (or euro, or",Paragraph
yuan). SANAA is also renowned within the profession for a,Paragraph
relentless work ethic that helps explain how this firm extracts so,Paragraph
"much from so little and for so relatively little money, a skill that",Paragraph
doubtless will be the subject of study in architecture schools.,Paragraph
Many perplexed observers find present-day museum design a,Paragraph
choice between outlandishly sculptural structures that ignore the,Paragraph
"proper display of art on the one hand, and on the other hand neutral",Paragraph
containers so submissive to art that all architectural presence is lost.,Paragraph
But the New Museum persuasively demonstrates that honoring art,Paragraph
and architecture need not be an either- or proposition. For Sejima,Paragraph
"and Nishizawa, whose expansive imaginations refuse to be cramped",Paragraph
"by the postage-stamp-size building plots typical of Tokyo, the",Paragraph
challenge of working with the New Museum’s L-shaped mid-block,Paragraph
plot—a mere 71 feet wide and 112 feet deep—was evidently no big,Paragraph
deal. Their previous experience with such restricted conditions,Paragraph
"encouraged the New Museum’s prescient director, Lisa Phillips, to",Paragraph
"push for SANAA among the contenders, and to her must go a great",Paragraph
deal of the credit for this miracle on the Bowery.,Caption
The shimmering two-ply exterior of the building—metal layered,Paragraph
"with an outer skin of perforated metal, which can look variously",Paragraph
"silver, gray, or off-white, depending on the time of day and the",Paragraph
"weather—imparts a mirage-like aura when the sunlight cooperates,",Paragraph
an effect intensified by the irregularity of the nonaligned boxes,Paragraph
"comprising the off-kilter tower. However, this slight syncopation,",Paragraph
which makes the almost windowless tower seem much larger at a,Paragraph
"distance, is far from the chaotic angular cascade proposed by Daniel",Paragraph
Libeskind in his unexecuted Spiral addition of 1996 for London’s,Paragraph
"Victoria & Albert Museum, which evoked a collapsing stack of",Paragraph
cartons. The varied height-and-width proportions of each,Paragraph
rectangular component at the New Museum are no mere aesthetic,Paragraph
whim but rather a practical strategy to create setbacks that provide,Paragraph
"most of the museum’s galleries with skylights, allowing the natural",Paragraph
lighting that many artists hope for and seldom get. (Those rooms,Paragraph
that lack natural toplighting have been reserved for video,Paragraph
installations and works requiring low illumination.),Paragraph
Natural lighting has become something of a fetish in,Paragraph
contemporary museum design. Although technological advances,Paragraph
have made artificial illumination every bit as effective as (and far,Paragraph
"more manageable than) the real thing, museum officials and donors",Paragraph
cling to the sentimental notion that natural light is inevitably,Paragraph
preferable. It’s easy to think that is so at John Soane’s Dulwich,Paragraph
"Picture Gallery of 1811-1817 in London, or Louis Kahn’s Kimbell",Caption
"Art Museum of 1966-1972 in Fort Worth, the two most frequently",Paragraph
invoked examples of natural toplighting among latter-day patrons.,Paragraph
But what is suitable for the display of the Old Master pictures in,Paragraph
those marvelously illuminated interiors is not universally desirable,Paragraph
for other kinds of art elsewhere. The skylights in the New Museum,Caption
galleries have a negligible effect in improving one’s experience of,Paragraph
"the works on view there, and fluorescent ceiling fixtures largely",Paragraph
cancel out the meager amount of daylight that filters through the,Paragraph
thin strips of overhead glazing in several rooms. Any benefit from,Paragraph
"the skylights is primarily architectural, giving the galleries added",Paragraph
"breathing space, as it were, and allowing the several sprawling",Paragraph
sculptural installations to be properly assessed from multiple,Paragraph
vantage points without feeling backed into a dark corner.,Paragraph
One serendipitous gain from the New Museum’s tight site is the,Paragraph
"structure’s necessary vertical emphasis, which gives unusual",Paragraph
"volumetric integrity to its one-per-story display areas on the second,",Paragraph
"third, and fourth floors, ranging in height from eighteen to twenty-",Paragraph
four feet and in area from three to five thousand square feet. There’s,Paragraph
none of the lost-in-space disorientation many visitors have,Paragraph
complained about at Yoshio Taniguchi’s MoMA expansion. Nowhere,Paragraph
is that contrast more evident than in the New Museum’s humanely,Paragraph
scaled lobby—enlivened by an undulating metal mesh partition,Caption
reminiscent of Alvar Aalto’s designs and screening the gift shop—,Paragraph
which makes MoMA’s megascale entry concourse feel even more,Paragraph
like the airport terminal of nightmares.,Paragraph
Contemporary art museums now face the dilemma of trying to,Paragraph
anticipate what kind of spaces will be needed for unimaginable,Paragraph
creations likely to emerge over the coming decades. The one-size-,Paragraph
fits-all approach of hangar-like enclosures with movable partitions is,Paragraph
"no solution, as demonstrated time and again since the grandpére of",Paragraph
"them all, the Pompidou Center. It will take quite some time to fully",Paragraph
determine how well the New Museum responds to the demands of,Paragraph
"an organization founded to disregard, indeed flout, art-",Paragraph
establishment convention. What is not in question is the instant,Paragraph
urban impact the New Museum’s new home had on its immediate,Paragraph
surroundings and the city in general.,Paragraph
Among the most delightful aspects of the SANAA scheme is the,Paragraph
"seventh-floor Sky Room, a glass-walled, wrap-terraced lounge with",Caption
exhilarating views of the downtown skyline. It is easy to imagine,Paragraph
this space as a reincarnation of the old members’ dining room and,Paragraph
"lounge atop the original Museum of Modern Art building, fondly",Paragraph
remembered by many as a space that encouraged socializing in a,Paragraph
"way that no other place in the city offered at the time, almost",Paragraph
domestic in its intimacy and informality. The current emphasis on,Paragraph
the museum experience as a form of elevated consumerism is as,Paragraph
"pernicious as it is pervasive, and the Sky Room, where ideas about",Paragraph
"the art on display might be exchanged in a_ stimulating,",Paragraph
"noncommercial atmosphere, could be a useful bulwark against the",Paragraph
museum as entertainment complex.,Paragraph
Beyond doubt the New Museum was a high point of New York’s,Paragraph
"postmillennial construction boom. For example, the grand",Paragraph
publishing skyscrapers of Midtown West—Piano’s New York Times,Caption
Building of 2000-2007 and Norman Foster’s Hearst Tower of 2001-,Paragraph

ALTHOUGH THERE ARE COUNtless tangents that a career in the building art,Paragraph
"can take, it is nonetheless most unusual for a major architectural",Paragraph

emergences in the building art during recent decades has been the,Paragraph
"husband-and-wife team of Ricardo Scofidio and Elizabeth Diller,",Paragraph
who first attracted attention beyond avant-garde architectural,Paragraph
"circles in 1999, when they were awarded a MacArthur Foundation",Paragraph
“genius” grant at the respective ages of sixty-four and forty-five.,Paragraph
"Along with Charles Renfro, who is ten years younger than Diller,",Paragraph
they comprise the New York firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro. Scofidio,Paragraph
and Diller (who founded their office in 1979 and made Renfro a full,Paragraph
partner in 2004) had long appeared determined to be among the,Paragraph
theoreticians and educators who infuse architectural thought with,Paragraph
vivid imagination but construct little if anything at all. In that,Paragraph
regard they followed the lead of their Cooper Union colleague John,Paragraph
"Hejduk, the school’s longtime dean, a poéte maudit who fantasized",Paragraph
in drawings and philosophized in print but built almost nothing.,Paragraph
The prevailing impression of this maverick couple as consummate,Paragraph
architectural luftmenschen was heightened by the Whitney Museum,Paragraph
of American Art’s enigmatic 2003 exhibition “The Aberrant,Title
Architectures of Diller + Scofidio.” Devoid of almost anything the,Paragraph
"lay public could comprehend as architecture or urbanism, the show",Paragraph
presented a series of the subjects’ more-or-less whimsical installation,Paragraph
"pieces. These displays included Mural (2003), a robotic power drill",Paragraph
that moved along 330 feet of wall-mounted track and randomly,Paragraph
"bored holes in a partition between two galleries. It was all great fun,",Paragraph
but the designers’ hermetic cleverness left many visitors baffled.,Paragraph
The first structure that Diller and Scofidio executed—their Blur,Paragraph
Building of 2000-2001 in Switzerland—was commissioned by the,Paragraph
Swiss national exhibition Expo.02. This aqueous caprice was created,Paragraph
atop an ovoid open-air platform in Lake Neuchatel at Yverdon-les-,Caption
"Bains. Connected to the shore by a pair of long gangways, the Blur",Paragraph
"Building was created by a sophisticated system of 31,500 high-",Paragraph
precision high-pressure water jets. This mysteriously cloudlike,Paragraph
"water-vapor “pavilion,” which measured more than three hundred",Paragraph

"could contain as many as four hundred visitors, who were given",Paragraph
waterproof ponchos to wear within the wraparound canopy of fine,Paragraph
mist expelled from the lightweight metal framework.,Paragraph
"In its shifting contours and indeterminate outlines, the phantom",Paragraph
structure obliquely commented on what the architect Greg Lynn in,Paragraph
1996 termed “blob architecture”—free-form constructs enabled by,Paragraph
new computer-aided technologies. Diller and Scofidio’s beguiling jeu,Caption
d’esprit became the hit of the Swiss fair. The idea of fashioning an,Paragraph
inhabitable space from water—a tantalizing contradiction in,Paragraph
"architectural terms—has fascinated visionaries for centuries,",Paragraph
especially writers in Islamic Spain who during the Middle Ages,Paragraph
fantasized about fountains with liquid domes that one could enter.,Paragraph
That evanescent dream was finally brought to dazzling life in this,Paragraph
triumph of the architectural imagination.,Paragraph
Ricardo Scofidio was born in New York City in 1935 and grew up,Paragraph
in a small town in western Pennsylvania. He has said that his family,Paragraph
"never discussed its ethnicity, and apparently only in adulthood did",Paragraph
he learn that some of his ancestors were black. He studied at New,Paragraph
"York’s Cooper Union, and after taking an architectural degree from",Paragraph
"Columbia returned to teach at his undergraduate alma mater, where",Paragraph
he is now a professor emeritus. Elizabeth Diller was born in 1954 in,Paragraph
"Ld6dz, Poland, to Holocaust survivors who emigrated to America",Paragraph
when she was six. After receiving her undergraduate diploma from,Paragraph
Cooper Union she enrolled in the school’s architecture program in,Paragraph
"1976, where one of her teachers was Scofidio. Their relationship",Paragraph
"moved from the professional to the personal, and Scofidio, who was",Paragraph
"married with four children, left his family and moved in with Diller.",Paragraph
They set up their architectural practice in 1979 and were later,Paragraph
"married. Charles Renfro was born on the Texas Gulf Coast in 1964,",Paragraph
"studied architecture at Rice and Columbia, and joined Diller and",Paragraph
Scofidio’s office in 1997. In an act of exceptional collegial,Paragraph
"generosity, the couple made him an equal partner and added his",Paragraph
surname to their firm’s title seven years later.,Paragraph
"In the decade following the frisson of the Blur Building, Diller,",Paragraph
"Scofidio, and Renfro executed several exemplary public spaces that",Paragraph
"provided pragmatic, cost-efficient solutions to underutilized or",Paragraph
ineffective urban settings. The most justly celebrated of these,Paragraph
"commissions is New York City’s High Line (see Illustration 17b),",Paragraph
"begun in 2004, for which the firm’s partners were a major part of",Paragraph
the collaborative design team. A pressing question that arises as,Paragraph
cities mature is what to do with outmoded infrastructure. Many,Paragraph
architectural preservationists were slow to concede the historical,Paragraph
merit of utilitarian landmarks until the 1960s and 1970s. The case,Paragraph
for the imaginative greening of brownfields—derelict industrial,Caption
"sites, in planners’ jargon—has been tremendously advanced by the",Paragraph
"High Line, a linear park superimposed on the eponymous long-",Paragraph
defunct cargo railroad trestle that wends through nearly a mile and,Paragraph
a half of Manhattan’s West Side from Midtown to Greenwich,Paragraph
Village. The High Line was erected some thirty feet above street,Paragraph
"level, between 1929 and 1934, by the New York Central Railroad, to",Paragraph
speed delivery of materials and foodstuffs directly to factories and,Paragraph
processing plants. Unlike the elevated trains that still clattered,Paragraph
"above the vehicular traffic of Manhattan’s Second, Third, Sixth,",Paragraph
"Ninth, and Lexington Avenues, the High Line followed a mid-block,",Paragraph
back-door path in the Chelsea district between and through,Paragraph
"buildings, which made the tracks virtually invisible except at",Paragraph
crosstown intersections. It began a veritable disappearing act in,Paragraph
1980 when the tracks carried their last shipment and by the end of,Paragraph
"the century, this disused vestige of the city’s once-vital",Paragraph
manufacturing economy had more or less faded from memory.,Paragraph
The collaborative retrofitting of the High Line was headed by,Paragraph
James Corner Field Operations (a firm specializing in converting,Title
"urban infrastructure) with Diller, Scofidio, and Renfro as",Paragraph
"architectural partners, and the Dutch landscape architect Piet",Paragraph
Oudolf in charge of the horticultural aspects. The High Line team,Paragraph
remained firmly committed to the project’s two fundamental,Paragraph
principles: to retain as much of the infrastructure’s gritty character,Title
"as practicable, and to ensure that all new interventions reinforced",Paragraph
the site’s original qualities. The Corner office largely focused on,Paragraph
shoring up the decaying freight rail trestle to make it safe for heavy,Paragraph
"pedestrian traffic, whereas Diller, Scofidio, and Renfro addressed",Paragraph
broader questions of how this new kind of park might best be used,Paragraph
and enjoyed.,Paragraph
Well versed in such theoretical concerns as “the gaze”—the ways,Paragraph
in which visual perception translates into social (and sexual),Paragraph
interaction—the architects devised a host of basic but effective ways,Paragraph
to encourage visitors to the High Line to view the city and its,Paragraph
inhabitants from a variety of new perspectives. Rather than relying,Paragraph
on traditional park benches or movable chairs in the manner of,Paragraph
"London and Paris parks, they designed several built-in seating areas,",Paragraph
ranging from banquettes to recliners to stadium-style bleachers.,Paragraph
These socially attuned partners’ encouragement of people-watching,Paragraph
emanates from their canny understanding that seeing and being,Paragraph
"seen—voyeurism and exhibitionism, if you will—are central to the",Paragraph
civic transaction. They abetted this universal pleasure with devices,Paragraph
as uncomplicated but potent as a dramatic cascade of bleacher,Paragraph
"seating called the Tenth Avenue Square, a glass-walled amphitheater",Paragraph
perched above the thoroughfare at West 17th Street.,Caption
The decade-long struggle to save the High Line from demolition,Title
"and turn it into a civic amenity began in 1999, when Joshua David",Paragraph
(then a magazine writer and editor) and Robert Hammond (at the,Paragraph
time a consultant for commercial and nonprofit organizations) met,Paragraph
"at a local community board meeting, discovered their mutual",Paragraph
"enthusiasm for the moldering railroad spur, and eventually devoted",Paragraph
themselves full time to its salvation. These oft-thwarted civic,Paragraph
crusaders remained cheerily undaunted as they confronted and,Paragraph
overcame opposition from every quarter. Not the least of their many,Paragraph
"impediments was an obstructionist neighborhood group, Chelsea",Paragraph
"Property Owners, which for a decade and a half had been trying to",Paragraph
have the High Line torn down as a nuisance and an eyesore. City,Paragraph
"officials proved no less hostile. Joseph Rose, head of New York’s",Paragraph
"City Planning Commission during the Giuliani administration, called",Paragraph
the decaying High Line “the Vietnam of old railroad structures” and,Paragraph
"declared, “It must come down.” And as Hammond later wrote, “The",Paragraph

Washington Streets in the northwest extremity of Greenwich Village,Paragraph
known as the Meatpacking District (most of whose wholesale,Paragraph
"butchers have been supplanted by upscale boutiques, galleries, and",Paragraph
"restaurants). The sleek, silvery stairway ascending to the High Line",Paragraph
"at its southernmost terminus leads up to the promenade platform,",Paragraph
where the centered walkway is paved with oblong concrete blocks,Paragraph
laid end-to-end like wood-plank flooring and studded with dark gray,Paragraph
stones to mimic fine terrazzo. Flanking the path (which varies in,Paragraph
width along the meandering route) are planting beds meant to,Paragraph
"evoke the lush, self-sown greenery that thrived on the High Line",Paragraph
during its three decades of desuetude. To recapture some semblance,Paragraph
"of that volunteer vegetation, Oudolf—the best-known exponent of",Paragraph

into a saddle-like shape that touches plaza level at the lawn’s,Paragraph
southwest corner—was immediately embraced by Juilliard students,Paragraph
as their veritable campus center and by visitors who luxuriate in its,Paragraph
open south-facing vistas and calming purity.,Paragraph
The administrators of Lincoln Center approached Diller and,Paragraph
Scofidio shortly after Frank Gehry’s controversial plan for,Paragraph
revamping the urbanistically flawed sixteen-acre complex—which,Paragraph
advocated covering its principal plaza with a vast glass-and-steel,Paragraph
"canopy—was shelved in 2001. Unlike Gehry, Diller and Scofidio",Paragraph
viewed the task as a series of delicate surgical interventions rather,Paragraph
than a few large-scale impositions. Although the aging Lincoln,Paragraph
"Center was in urgent need of repair, a comprehensive overhaul",Paragraph
"struck some observers, including this one, as throwing good money",Paragraph
"after bad, considering the dubious architectural quality of the",Paragraph
complex and the estimated $1.4 billion price tag.,Paragraph
"The original architectural coordinator, Wallace K. Harrison (who",Paragraph
"designed its ever-garish centerpiece, the Metropolitan Opera House",Paragraph
"of 1958-1966), envisioned Lincoln Center as an acropolis elevated",Paragraph
atop a continuous plinth over the several city blocks conjoined for,Paragraph
"the ensemble. Owing to the gradually sloping site, the plinth is",Paragraph
lowest at the main plaza entry facing Broadway but rises to a height,Caption
of two stories on West 65th Street to the north and Amsterdam,Caption
Avenue to the west. Its blank peripheral base walls killed street life,Paragraph
"around most of Lincoln Center, but this was Harrison’s intention.",Paragraph
"The adjacent neighborhood, which includes low-income housing due",Paragraph
"west of the Met, was deemed too dangerous to have any interaction",Paragraph
"with the new cultural citadel, which unapologetically turned its",Paragraph
back on the urban poor.,Paragraph
To make Lincoln Center more welcoming and accessible in a,Paragraph
"much-changed postmillennial Manhattan, Diller, Scofidio, and",Paragraph
"Renfro rethought the principal arrival sequence, which from the",Paragraph
outset had been complicated by a service road parallel to Broadway.,Paragraph
"In order to allow a smoother entry, the architects eliminated the",Paragraph
"service road, repositioned the vehicular drop-off point below street",Paragraph
"level, and extended a broad stairway (embellished with eye-catching",Paragraph
messages from light-emitting diodes on the steps’ risers) over the,Paragraph
"new subterranean driveway, which is short enough not to feel like a",Paragraph
claustrophobic tunnel.,Paragraph
The most welcome portion of their scheme is the remaking of,Paragraph
West 65th Street between Amsterdam and Broadway. That busy,Paragraph
crosstown traffic artery was blighted for decades by the two-,Paragraph
hundred-foot-long platform bridge that covered most of the block,Paragraph
and linked Juilliard with the grand theaters to the south. Millstein,Paragraph
"Plaza, windswept and barren atop the span, never caught on as a",Paragraph
public space and turned the street below it into an urban abyss.,Paragraph

a dark and forbidding no-man’s-land even at noon. Activity is,Paragraph
"particularly lively at mid-block, with its alignment of the entrance",Paragraph

"Pietro Belluschi’s Juilliard School of Music of 1963-1969, with its",Paragraph
"longest elevation on the north side of 65th Street, was easily the",Paragraph
best of the Lincoln Center buildings. The finest example of Brutalist,Paragraph
"architecture in New York City, the Juilliard building (with Alice",Paragraph
Tully Hall tucked into its lower portions) was hardly an,Paragraph
"approachable presence, but it did possess an integrity lacking in the",Paragraph
"sub-Neoclassical Modernism of Philharmonic Hall, the Met, and the",Paragraph
New York State Theater. Because Belluschi made Juilliard’s,Paragraph
principal east-facing front parallel to the city’s grid plan rather than,Paragraph
"lining it up with the diagonal of Broadway, there was a capacious",Paragraph
triangular plot left vacant at the northwest corner of 65th Street. It,Paragraph
"was here that the new architects cantilevered a 50,000-square-foot",Paragraph
extension fifty feet over the sidewalk to diminish the bulkiness that,Paragraph
would have resulted had the large addition touched down at ground,Paragraph
level (see Illustration 17a).,Paragraph
Beneath that new overhang the designers placed yet another of,Paragraph
what has become their most familiar and popular motif: rising banks,Paragraph
"of built-in seats, this time relatively small, made of concrete, facing",Paragraph
inward from the street corner to the remodeled building’s lobby and,Paragraph
"adjoining café, and wittily suggesting where the corner of the",Paragraph
extension would be if it had been brought down to ground level.,Paragraph
The designers made the new facade as transparent and as free of,Paragraph
"metal supports as possible, exposing, to the full view of passersby on",Paragraph
"Broadway, dance studios, musical rehearsal spaces, and classrooms,",Paragraph
"an effect particularly mesmerizing at twilight and after nightfall,",Paragraph
when the vast glass elevation comes fully alive with all sorts of,Paragraph
motion. This is architectural populism of the very highest order.,Paragraph
The sound quality of Alice Tully Hall was never a problem,Paragraph
"comparable to the Philharmonic’s, but the tonal properties of the",Paragraph
smaller hall have been noticeably improved by the architects’,Paragraph
"collaboration with the acoustician J. Christopher Jaffe. Their subtle,",Paragraph
"not to say subliminal, reworking of Alice Tully Hall (the",Paragraph
performance space has now been renamed the Starr Theater) was,Paragraph
also informed by what has been called “psychoacoustics”—the idea,Paragraph
that our perceptions of a concert hall’s aural qualities are affected,Paragraph
by the room’s appearance. Here the designers devised an ingenious,Paragraph
illumination scheme whereby translucent wall panels of thinly sliced,Paragraph
wood veneers are illuminated from behind by LED lights on,Paragraph
computerized dimmers that impart an ethereal radiance—or,Paragraph

"of Modern Art in 1936, had occupied a series of converted spaces",Paragraph
until it acquired a dramatic waterside site to the east of the city’s,Paragraph
downtown business center on Harbor Walk soon after the,Paragraph
"millennium. Before the advent of the ICA, this fifty-mile-long",Paragraph
"shoreline park, begun in 1984, had been little more than a pathway",Paragraph
"for joggers and cyclists. Although the derelict waterfront gave Diller,",Paragraph
"Scofidio, and Renfro a virtual tabula rasa, their client’s desire for",Paragraph
maximum unobstructed exhibition areas (a must for the,Paragraph
unpredictable display requirements of today’s new art) inspired the,Paragraph
designers to lift the loft-like gallery area to the very top of the,Paragraph
structure and create an inviting public space below it on ground,Paragraph
level.,Paragraph
This organizing principle gives the pair of large rooftop display,Paragraph
spaces—which measure nine thousand square feet each—pellucid,Paragraph
natural lighting through thirteen rows of wall-to-wall north-facing,Paragraph
skylights. Overhead trusses leave these galleries free of columns and,Paragraph
"allow the open spaces to be reconfigured as needed, making them",Paragraph
among the most adaptable contemporary art interiors in America.,Paragraph
The architects’ most decisive gesture was to cantilever that,Paragraph
uppermost story sixty-four feet out toward Harbor Walk and the bay,Caption
beyond. They thereby created a large sheltered public space beneath,Paragraph
"the overhang, where they installed the first version of their urban",Paragraph
"grandstand, with tiers of wooden bleachers on which pedestrians",Paragraph
"can sit and observe the passing parade, which has become one of",Paragraph
the most popular outdoor gathering places in Boston. The ICA is,Paragraph
furthermore noteworthy for its comparatively low price tag. In a,Paragraph
period when $100 million museums were not uncommon and many,Paragraph
overreaching institutions subsequently suffered the dire,Paragraph
"consequences of competitive, excessive pre-crash spending on new",Paragraph

The completion of Disney Hall raised hopes that the environs of,Paragraph

at last become an active twenty-four-hour neighborhood instead of,Paragraph
"an enclave that comes to life only during performance hours, the",Paragraph
"same problem that plagued Lincoln Center until Diller, Scofidio, and",Paragraph
Renfro’s revitalizing makeover. Ambitious plans to transform Bunker,Paragraph
Hill through the $3 billion Grand Avenue Project were approved in,Paragraph
2007 but the redevelopment scheme stalled when the Great,Paragraph
Recession set in. Though the twelve-acre strip park linking the,Paragraph
"nearby city hall and other municipal buildings has been completed,",Paragraph
well-founded doubts remain about the scheme’s prospects for,Paragraph
"success, given sharp cutbacks in commercial and civic investment. It",Paragraph
will take more than a conventional park to establish and sustain,Paragraph
around-the-clock street life in what has intractably remained a,Paragraph
"desolate ghost town after dark. If only Diller, Scofidio, and Renfro",Paragraph
had been hired to give Bunker Hill the commonsensical but,Paragraph
uncommonly imaginative character of their urbanistic coups in New,Paragraph

More than almost any of their current peers (with the notable,Paragraph
"exception of the collaborative Norwegian firm Snghetta), they have",Paragraph
repeatedly demonstrated a keen understanding of the social,Paragraph
interactions that make for effective and enjoyable public spaces.,Paragraph
Thus there was well-founded dismay among their admirers when in,Paragraph
2013 they accepted the Museum of Modern Art’s controversial,Title
commission to replace Tod Williams and Billie Tsien’s former,Paragraph
"American Folk Art Museum building of 1997-2001, contrary to a",Paragraph

abet the destruction of living colleagues’ work.,Paragraph
The three New York partners are highly adept architects by any,Paragraph
"measure, but their keenest design skills are considerably deepened",Paragraph
and intensified by a humane outlook of the sort usually ascribed to,Paragraph
more earnest urbanists like Jane Jacobs and Lewis Mumford. This,Paragraph
dynamic trio has a better feel for the social workings of big,Paragraph

which these prodigiously gifted late bloomers reliably upend rote,Paragraph
responses to contemporary urban conditions makes them our,Paragraph

SN@HETTA,Title
DESPITE THE PERSISTENT image of the architect as a heroic loner erecting,Paragraph
"monumental edifices through sheer force of will, the building art",Paragraph
has always been a highly cooperative enterprise. Although the parti,Paragraph
(basic organizing principle) of a design may sometimes be the,Paragraph
"product of one intelligence, the realization of a structure of even",Paragraph
moderate complexity depends on a broad range of expertise seldom,Paragraph
"encompassed by any individual, no matter how singularly gifted. As",Paragraph
"an artistic endeavor, present-day architecture most closely",Paragraph
"resembles filmmaking, in which the prime creative mover, the",Paragraph
director—even the most visionary of auteurs—requires the,Paragraph
specialized technical skills of a large cohort of indispensable,Paragraph
collaborators. Thus an architectural team today comprises not only,Paragraph
"the long-familiar roster of structural engineers, HVAC (heating,",Paragraph
"ventilation, and air conditioning) specialists, acousticians, interior",Paragraph
"designers, lighting engineers, and landscape architects, but also",Paragraph
"computer software engineers, environmental impact managers, and",Title
(for certain public buildings) security analysts and antiterrorism,Title
"consultants, positions that did not exist a generation ago. One",Paragraph
leading New York architectural headhunter reports an even wider,Paragraph
"array of new job descriptions, including sustainability director,",Paragraph
"virtual design coordinator, and digital librarian.",Paragraph
Given the growing complexity of architectural tasks and the ever-,Paragraph
"advancing technologies available to resolve them, that high degree",Paragraph
of interdependence is only likely to increase. As Kjetil Tredal,Paragraph
"Thorsen, a founding member of the Norwegian architectural",Paragraph
"collaborative Snghetta, told me in his Oslo office in 2011:",Paragraph
Architecture is now far too complex to be designed by any one,Paragraph
person. It is truly a much more communal process than it ever,Paragraph

responsibility for the company.,Paragraph
Perhaps only a postindustrial social democracy as progressive as,Paragraph

described nonhierarchical cooperative whose principals avowedly,Paragraph
seek to avoid the personal celebrity we associate with Zaha Hadid or,Paragraph
"Daniel Libeskind, Snghetta is far different from the top-down model",Paragraph

that of mutually supportive friends who have banded together to,Paragraph
come up with ingenious ideas that will make life better for,Paragraph
"everyone, primarily but not exclusively their sponsors. It is an",Paragraph
uplifting ethos that a younger generation of enlightened clients has,Paragraph
found irresistible.,Paragraph
Snghetta promotes a more democratic workplace atmosphere than,Paragraph
most other architectural offices. This may merely reflect prevalent,Paragraph
"employment practices in Scandinavia, but Snghetta places a stronger",Paragraph
emphasis on group participation in the design process than typical,Paragraph
high-style firms. Rather than consigning junior assistants to,Paragraph
repetitive backroom drudgery like detailing fire stairs and other,Paragraph

makes a habit of handing over relatively small commissions to,Paragraph
younger associates in order to develop their problem-solving skills.,Paragraph

The firm’s gradual evolution from landscape-architecture specialists,Paragraph
to a more full-service operation remains evident in an unusual,Paragraph
attentiveness to environmental conditions and an exceptional,Paragraph
aptitude for site planning. The only two of the original group still,Paragraph

square-foot addition to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art,Caption
"(SFMoMA), scheduled to open in 2016. The selection of the firm for",Paragraph
that project is yet another example of the increasingly common,Paragraph
trend for museums to seek additions from architects other than the,Paragraph
last ones they employed. It used to be almost an ethical imperative,Paragraph
to ask the designer of a building to expand it and thus maintain,Paragraph
visual continuity with the original structure. Only if the initial,Paragraph
architect had died or if the firm did not want the new commission,Paragraph
was it considered permissible to seek another practitioner. In an,Paragraph
"extreme example to the contrary, the original Beaux Arts building of",Paragraph
Houston’s Museum of Fine Arts was given a discordant succession of,Paragraph
"modern wings by Kenneth Franzheim (1953), Ludwig Mies van der",Caption
"Rohe (1958 and 1974), and Rafael Moneo (2000), with a further",Paragraph
extension by Steven Holl announced in 2012. (Snghetta was among,Paragraph
the three finalists for that job.),Paragraph
The tendency to seek new architects for expansion schemes began,Paragraph
"to accelerate in the 1990s, around the time the High Museum of Art",Paragraph
in Atlanta decided to add to Richard Meier’s building of 1980-1983.,Paragraph
Although Meier’s eye-catching design gave the small regional,Paragraph
"institution a dynamic new image, the structure was soon found to be",Paragraph
"functionally deficient because of light-control problems, skylight",Paragraph
"leaks, and planning that seemed to favor circulation areas over",Paragraph
display space. In a move widely interpreted as a critique of his,Paragraph
"flawed design, Meier did not get the commission, which went",Paragraph
"instead to Renzo Piano, whose expansion of 1999-2005 added three",Paragraph
"wings and doubled the museum’s exhibition capacity, but effectively",Paragraph
reduced the showy but problem-plagued Meier structure to a,Paragraph
glorified entry pavilion.,Caption
A similar rejection occurred with Mario Botta’s San Francisco,Paragraph
Museum of Modern Art of 1989-1995. This ponderous brick-clad,Paragraph
Postmodernist pile was quickly deemed both stylistically passé and,Paragraph
"also too small for the museum’s many recent acquisitions, including",Paragraph
"the coveted collection of Doris and Donald Fisher, longtime",Paragraph
benefactors who unsuccessfully tried to build a private gallery,Paragraph
"designed by Richard Gluckman in the Presidio, the disused military",Caption
base next to the Golden Gate Bridge. Botta’s heavy-handed scheme,Caption
"was nonetheless notable for its stepped-back massing, which gave",Paragraph
almost all the galleries natural overhead illumination and took into,Paragraph
account the need for future expansion on an adjoining strip of land,Paragraph
(used in the interim for staff parking). Given the unpredictable,Paragraph
"vagaries of architectural taste, it might be argued that the museum’s",Paragraph
trustees—several of whom had generously contributed toward the,Paragraph
Botta design—ought to have had the courage of their convictions,Paragraph
"and returned to him, however démodé his aesthetic had become.",Paragraph
"Restricted to a narrow plot at the rear of Botta’s five-story structure,",Paragraph
the addition could well have become a nearly invisible backdrop,Paragraph
had Snghetta not decided to make its contribution contrast as much,Paragraph
as possible with its blocky and stolidly symmetrical precursor.,Paragraph
"The ten-story stepped-back expansion, estimated to cost $555",Paragraph
"million, is to be clad in striated fiber-reinforced white panels with a",Paragraph
"cement finish, interspersed with glass, and will rise like an iceberg",Paragraph
behind the original. That maritime impression will be underscored,Paragraph
"by the Botta building’s most idiosyncratic feature, a central,",Paragraph
smokestack-like cylinder that houses a grand stairway topped by a,Paragraph
"slanting glass oculus, which, with the icy new addition looming over",Paragraph
"it, may make Titanic buffs think of that doomed ocean liner. Yet the",Paragraph
new wing’s organization appears logical and likely to much improve,Paragraph
"visitors’ experience of SFMoMA, which heretofore has exuded the",Paragraph
sleek and somewhat snooty air of an upscale department store.,Paragraph

It is dispiriting to watch the ingratiating and patient Snghetta,Paragraph
team bending over backward to please an obtuse and somewhat,Paragraph
arrogant client as their subsequent schemes get progressively worse,Paragraph
"and worse, a syndrome that is not uncommon in the world of",Paragraph
architectural patronage. Snghetta’s accommodating stance is in,Paragraph

Snghetta’s extreme willingness to adapt to the desires of its,Paragraph
sponsors has never been more evident than in the collaboration,Paragraph
between the firm and the New York-based Norwegian artist Bjarne,Paragraph
"Melgaard, for whom the architects are designing a house in Oslo",Paragraph
that will be completed in 2014. This strange undertaking was the,Paragraph

lumber that seemed as if a pyromaniacal preteen had run amok with,Paragraph

"perfectly free to indulge their whims as they please, but even in a",Paragraph
"period of umprecedented architectural weirdness, _ this",Paragraph
embarrassment proved that there are necessary limits to unbridled,Paragraph
self-expression.,Paragraph
If you had to choose between a pompous grand vizier or a,Paragraph
pretentious myth-befuddled artist—both of whom bombard you,Paragraph
with endless “suggestions” on how you should design for them—it,Paragraph
might drive the faint of heart mad. Yet the project-to-project,Paragraph
struggle that is contemporary high-style architecture has rarely been,Paragraph
"pursued with more equanimity, or better results, than it has been by",Paragraph
the happy warriors of Snghetta. The firm’s eagerness (and,Paragraph
occasional overeagerness) to please has also been a subtext of its,Paragraph
"work at Ground Zero, a project that remains mired in disputes over",Paragraph
its funding and thus still languishes incomplete almost two years,Paragraph
after the dedication of Michael Arad and Peter Walker’s magnificent,Paragraph
National September 11 Memorial of 2003-2011. (The interiors of,Caption
"the Snghetta museum are the work of another firm, the New York—",Paragraph
based Aedas.),Paragraph
Even a cursory glance at Libeskind’s hypothetical renderings of,Paragraph
the former World Trade Center site indicates that Snghetta—which,Paragraph
adheres to no consistent design approach but varies its response,Paragraph
from project to project—followed his lead much too readily in its,Paragraph
"jittery-looking, diagonally scored National September 11 Memorial",Caption
"Museum Pavilion, which appears to mimic a structure falling down,",Paragraph
a dreadful miscalculation on this bedeviled site. The exterior of,Paragraph
Snghetta’s wedge-shaped visitors’ center is rendered in the sharply,Paragraph
"angular, diagonally striated Deconstructivist mode originally",Paragraph
"proposed for the site by Libeskind, who won the competition for the",Paragraph
Ground Zero reconstruction master plan but was sidelined from any,Paragraph
"serious implementation of his ideas by the property’s leaseholder,",Paragraph
the real estate developer Larry Silverstein. Apart from the pavilion’s,Paragraph
"nervously off-kilter, exaggeratedly slant-roofed form and 1990s",Paragraph

perforated portions of its metal-panel cladding give the museum,Paragraph

ventilation-equipment housing.,Paragraph
"Now, long after Libeskind was unceremoniously shuffled offstage,",Paragraph
this vestige of his aborted vision appears even more out of place,Paragraph
next to the solemn grandeur and timeless simplicity of Arad’s twin,Paragraph
memorial pools. If Snghetta is to advance into the very forefront of,Paragraph
"the profession, its unquestionably gifted team members must realize",Paragraph
"that as congenial and nurturing as their sheltered workshop may be,",Paragraph
in the rough-and-tumble world of architecture there can be such a,Paragraph

"emerged from such a fraught and contentious process, which at",Paragraph
several points during its ten-year saga seemed to stall indefinitely or,Paragraph

practice and after three years took a job in the design department of,Paragraph
"the New York City Housing Authority, where he worked on",Paragraph

Arad experienced the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center,Paragraph
in a very immediate and personal way—from the roof of his East,Paragraph
Village apartment building he watched in horror as United Airlines,Paragraph
"Flight 175, the second of the hijacked jets, slammed into the South",Paragraph
Tower. He participated in one of the many public vigils held in the,Paragraph
"aftermath of the buildings’ fall, and well before it was announced",Paragraph
"that plans would be solicited for an open memorial competition, felt",Paragraph
"the urge to create a commemorative design, which from the outset",Paragraph
featured two square black voids set amid a reflecting pool of water.,Caption
In due course Arad fleshed out his initial conceptual sketch and,Paragraph
proposed a more spatially complex version that expanded the,Paragraph
squares into subterranean cubic memorial chambers open to the sky,Caption
and enhanced with curtain-like vertical fountains. Visitors would,Paragraph
"have been able to proceed down to the bottom of the pools, which",Paragraph
"were to have been ringed by walkways, the walls behind them",Paragraph
"inscribed with the names of the dead, with the central square pools",Caption
shrouded by cascades of water pouring down steadily from above.,Paragraph
"For a variety of insuperable reasons—budgetary, infrastructural,",Paragraph
and security concerns high among them—Arad was forced to,Paragraph
abandon his initial idea of the below-ground memorial chambers,Paragraph
"accessible to the public, which he compared to Orpheus’s descent",Paragraph
"into the Underworld, “a vast emptiness that you cannot enter but",Paragraph
"can only contemplate as you look into the void.” From the outset,",Paragraph
"Arad, who had never had a commission of this magnitude, was wary",Paragraph
"of making the countless small, bureaucratically imposed",Paragraph
"compromises—“death by a thousand papers cuts,” as he put it—that",Paragraph
can sap all the life from a design. But the elimination of the,Paragraph
subterranean spaces struck at the very heart of his conception.,Paragraph
Here he was forced to consider either resigning this incomparably,Paragraph
prestigious and high-profile commission or coming up with an,Paragraph
alternative solution that retained the spiritual essence of his initial,Paragraph
"idea. “I was incredibly upset,” Arad later admitted, “but I had to go",Paragraph
from holding onto an idea to finding a way of articulating the same,Paragraph
set of ideas in other ways.” This he managed to do so well that,Paragraph
"when one experiences the memorial as it was finally realized, his",Paragraph
revised design conveys the same sense of inevitability that one,Paragraph
"senses with all great art—that it had to be like this, and no other",Paragraph
way.,Paragraph
"When the memorial first opened to the public, the eight-hundred-",Paragraph
foot-long arrival sequence presented a dismal prologue that so,Paragraph
closely replicated the security checks of a post-September 11 airport,Paragraph
"check-in—replete with metal detectors, jacket removals, pat-downs,",Paragraph
and conveyor belts for personal property scans—as to verge on,Paragraph
black comedy. Because Ground Zero at that time was (and for,Paragraph
"several years thereafter would remain) an active construction site,",Paragraph
visitors were channeled around the rising buildings through a series,Paragraph
"of fences and barriers that led them toward the south pool, an",Paragraph
emphasis that will change when the surroundings are fully,Paragraph
completed and the public is free to approach the memorial from any,Paragraph
"direction at will. After this ad hoc entry maze was negotiated, one",Paragraph
"came upon the pleasant park designed by Peter Walker, the",Paragraph
"Berkeley, California—based landscape architect with whom Arad was",Paragraph
"directed to work by the LMDC, which fretted about the young",Paragraph

"York firm Davis Brody Bond, who was deemed necessary to",Paragraph
supervise the untested young competition winner but died in 2009.,Paragraph
"The extreme animosity among the three principals, none of whom",Paragraph
"was shy about speaking to the press, was well documented, and",Paragraph
Arad came off for the most part as petulant and abrasive rather than,Paragraph
tenacious and principled.),Paragraph
"On the plaza adjacent to the pools, Walker planted a grid of some",Paragraph
four hundred swamp white oaks in an intriguing staccato pattern,Caption
that makes them seem either randomly positioned or formally,Paragraph
"aligned, depending on one’s vantage point. The low-hanging",Paragraph
branches of these vigorous-looking specimens have been clipped,Paragraph
"upward to about half of their approximately twenty-five-foot height,",Paragraph
"presumably to keep them from touching the heads of visitors, and",Paragraph
though those proportions looked somewhat artificial when the,Paragraph
"memorial first opened, the trees will ultimately form a handsome",Paragraph
"grove. As one nears the pools, walking across the light-gray granite",Paragraph
"paving stones installed by Walker, the murmur of rushing water",Caption
rises from the cascades that pour Niagara-like down all four sides of,Paragraph
"the sunken fountains. The sound becomes louder and louder, until it",Paragraph
reaches such a steady crescendo that the noise of the surrounding,Paragraph
"city, even heavy construction going on very close by, is drowned out",Paragraph
completely.,Paragraph
The veil-like flow of water down the dark-gray granite-clad sides,Paragraph
of the recirculating pools is a feat of hydraulic engineering achieved,Paragraph
by the installation of weirs (downward-curving comb-like spillways),Paragraph
set all around the upper perimeter of the giant squares. Looking,Paragraph
"down into the equilateral thirty-foot-deep pits, one sees yet another,",Paragraph
far smaller square that extends another fifteen feet below the pool’s,Paragraph
"surface, bringing to mind a simplified, monochromatic grisaille",Paragraph
"version of Josef Albers’s Homage to the Square series. With that last,",Paragraph
"centered quadrangle, the water vanishes into nothingness. The",Paragraph
propulsive aural and visual excitement of the three-story-deep,Paragraph
waterfall and its mysterious disappearance captures and holds your,Paragraph
attention in a way most unusual for the static medium of,Paragraph
conventional architecture. That distraction makes one’s next,Paragraph
"perception all the more shocking, as you focus on the names of the",Paragraph
"victims, incised into the continuous tilted rim of bronze tablets that",Paragraph
surround each pool. The initial perspective provided by the cascades,Paragraph
"mimics a technique employed in classical Japanese gardens, through",Paragraph
"which one’s gaze is briefly diverted by a change in paving,",Paragraph
"screening, or some other element to dramatize a coming transition.",Paragraph
"Here, after you take in the diaphanous waterfalls, you discover",Paragraph
"spread out before you at waist level the names, the names, the",Paragraph
names. Nearly three thousand victims—not only those lost at the,Paragraph
"World Trade Center, but also those who died at the Pentagon and",Paragraph
"near Shanksville, Pennsylvania—are memorialized with their names",Paragraph
inscribed in Hermann Zapf’s classic Optima typeface of 1952-1955,Caption
"(an elegant, slightly flaring sans-serif font), with the letters cut",Paragraph
through the bronze so they can be backlit after dark. This is a,Paragraph
"typographic tour de force. Phalanxes of firemen are listed, ladder",Caption
"company by ladder company, and cops precinct by precinct;",Paragraph
hundreds upon hundreds of Cantor Fitzgerald traders; teams of,Paragraph
Windows on the World busboys; an entire family on one plane; and,Paragraph
on two of the hijacked flights women with “unborn child.” The,Paragraph
names are grouped in what Arad termed “meaningful adjacencies”,Paragraph
"to suggest comradeship among those who died together at work, as",Paragraph
"first responders in the line of duty, or as travelers who would never",Paragraph
reach their destinations.,Paragraph
This was a deeply meaningful concept that Arad came up with in,Paragraph
"2004 but that was shelved until Bloomberg took charge in 2006,",Paragraph
with letters soliciting information about such interrelationships sent,Paragraph
out to the victims’ survivors only in 2009. The ecumenical,Paragraph
indifference of fate cannot have been more plainly or more,Paragraph
movingly put. At times this relentless roll call becomes too much to,Paragraph
"bear, and your eyes rise up to the buildings that surround the",Paragraph
memorial. But in purely architectural terms it is a sorry sight: not a,Paragraph
single building of any distinction is to be seen in any direction (one,Paragraph
reason why Arad wanted the memorial chambers he first envisioned,Paragraph
to be positioned below ground).,Paragraph
Looming over the northwest corner of the site is the 104-story,Paragraph
"One World Trade Center of 2003-2013, once called the Freedom",Paragraph
"Tower but later given its current, more market-friendly moniker,",Paragraph
which was the original name of one of the Twin Towers. This slick,Paragraph
mirror-glass-skinned office building—which retains the symbolic,Paragraph
"1,776-foot height first decreed by the site’s master planner, Daniel",Caption
"Libeskind—is the work of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill’s David",Paragraph
"Childs, who had been hired to renovate the Twin Towers shortly",Paragraph
before they fell. His banal design has attracted less comment than,Paragraph
"the building’s astronomical $3.1 billion price tag, making it by far",Paragraph
the most expensive high-rise ever erected in the US. (A class-action,Paragraph
lawsuit alleged that One World Trade Center was illegally financed,Paragraph
by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey through steep,Paragraph
increases in tolls and commuter fares that could lawfully be applied,Paragraph
"only to infrastructural improvements, not to real _ estate",Paragraph
speculations.),Paragraph
No less flagrant in its huge budget overruns is Santiago,Paragraph
"Calatrava’s Transportation Hub, a train station and underground",Paragraph
shopping mall linking the trans-Hudson PATH system with New,Paragraph
York City’s subways. Estimated to cost nearly $4 billion—twice,Paragraph
"initial projections—it is sited directly to the east of the north pool,",Paragraph
across Greenwich Street. Calatrava likened his design in its original,Paragraph
"form to doves of peace in flight. After costs began to skyrocket, its",Paragraph
"wings were clipped, and when it finally opens, years behind",Paragraph
"schedule, the hub seems more likely to resemble a skeletal dinosaur",Paragraph
carcass.,Paragraph
Although much has been made in the press of Arad’s manifold,Paragraph
"battles to preserve the integrity of his scheme, one must also",Paragraph
"sympathize with Local Projects, a New York-based design firm that",Paragraph
performed the daunting task of placing the victims’ names in,Paragraph
arrangements that would satisfy a seemingly infinite number of,Paragraph
demands from many constituencies. An algorithm devised by the,Paragraph
"software programmer Jen Thorp sped this complex process, but",Paragraph
further tinkering was needed to sort out many individual requests,Paragraph
from the bereaved. This component of the September 11 Memorial,Paragraph
got as close to the heart of the matter for the survivors as the,Paragraph
decision to leave the foundations of the Twin Towers inviolate.,Paragraph
"Because about 40 percent of the victims left no identifiable remains,",Paragraph
"their survivors look upon the site as an actual graveyard, and thus",Paragraph
the site’s afterlife became a source of constant contention among the,Paragraph
Families (as the next of kin were invariably called). Unidentified,Paragraph
"remains are to be placed at bedrock level, rendering the site an",Paragraph
actual rather than a virtual burial ground.,Paragraph
Perhaps the most vociferous of the mourners was Monica Iken,Paragraph
"Murphy, a September 11 widow who at one public hearing",Paragraph
"memorably if bathetically asked, “How can we build on top of their",Paragraph
souls that are crying?” Doubtless to the relief of those responsible,Paragraph
"for the memorial, she spoke favorably to the New York Daily News",Paragraph
about the results: “My Michael is home finally. They’re all home.,Paragraph
"This is his final resting place. When I come here, I feel him.”",Paragraph
"Predictably, not all among the families felt the same. One survivor",Paragraph
complained to a WINS radio reporter that the memorial was,Paragraph
"“cool”—as in cold, not hip—and said that “there should have been",Paragraph
flowers or pictures or something.” But of course it is precisely the,Paragraph
"abstract nature of Arad’s design, which eschews all representational",Paragraph
"imagery, that allows visitors to project onto it thoughts and",Paragraph
interpretations of a much more individual nature than if the,Paragraph
memorial had been laden with prepackaged symbols of grief.,Paragraph
"Although the locations and proportions of the square pools, which",Paragraph
"measure 176 feet on each side, were determined by the footprints of",Paragraph
"the Twin Towers, the overall dimensions—especially the relation of",Paragraph
"width to depth, and the juxtaposition of the two bodies of water to",Paragraph
each other—somehow seem so ideally balanced that they might,Paragraph
have been determined not by the disaster but by an environmental,Paragraph
sculptor of uncommon talent. The only discordant note at the,Paragraph
memorial is struck by the freestanding two-story pavilion that will,Paragraph
serve as the entry point to the subterranean September 11 Museum.,Paragraph
"Standing next to but fortunately not between the twin pools, it is the",Paragraph
"work of Snghetta. However, in an odd division of labor, the below-",Paragraph
"ground exhibition galleries were designed by another consortium,",Paragraph
the multinational architectural firm Aedas working in association,Title
"with Davis Brody Bond, a pairing that Arad saw as a conflict of",Paragraph
interest because of priorities he believes were given to the museum,Paragraph
by his nominal collaborator Bond. (The entire cost of the memorial,Paragraph
and September 11 Museum was at least $700 million.),Paragraph
"Whatever one’s opinions about the events of September 11, 2001,",Paragraph
"or their baneful political aftereffects, it seems impossible not to be",Paragraph
"moved in some way by Arad’s memorial. The first time I saw it, I",Paragraph
came away with the same devastated feeling that overtakes one,Paragraph
"after a funeral or memorial service for a relative or close friend,",Paragraph
even though I knew no one who perished at the World Trade Center.,Paragraph
In creating something at once so monumentally simple and yet so,Paragraph
"evocatively complex, Arad reconfirmed the radical reconception of",Paragraph
public memorial design that Maya Lin set in motion with her,Paragraph
Vietnam Veterans Memorial three decades ago. Lin herself was,Paragraph
accused at the time by some critics of basing her work too closely,Paragraph
