INTRODUCTION,Title
"For a million years, humans lived off hunting,",Paragraph
"food gathering, and fishing. From the",Paragraph
perspective of our advanced world today we,Title
tend to look back at this and wonder how,Paragraph
we could even have survived given all the,Paragraph
difficulties. We once labeled these people,Paragraph
"savages or barbarians, and then we called",Paragraph
them primitives. More recently we call them,Paragraph
"hunter-gatherers, as if all they do is obsess",Paragraph
"about food acquisition. But the !Kung, who",Paragraph
have lived in the Kalahari Desert in Botswana,Paragraph
"for hundreds of thousands of years, spend",Paragraph
only about 40 percent of their time hunting,Paragraph
"and gathering. The rest of the time, they do",Paragraph
"what most of us might do: they socialize,",Paragraph
"dance, cook, and rest.",Paragraph
"In the Kalahari, rmongongo trees, which",Paragraph
produce tasty and nutritious nuts by the,Paragraph
"thousands, proliferate in mile-long groves.",Paragraph
"Tubers can be dug from the ground, and",Paragraph
"animal herds migrate through the territory,",Paragraph
easy prey for a canny hunter and his poison-,Paragraph
tipped arrows. The !Kung live in camps that,Paragraph
are rebuilt every year near seasonal water,Paragraph
oles. Women make the huts around a,Paragraph
"common campfire, usually under the shade",Paragraph
of a large tree. The huts are not really to live,Paragraph
"in, since people tend to live mainly outdoors,",Paragraph
ut serve as storage areas for tools and as,Paragraph
shade on a hot day. The modern world has,Paragraph
ittle respect for its venerable ancestors.,Paragraph
"Because of forced relocations, mining on",Paragraph
"their territory, and fences cutting across their",Paragraph
"land, the 'Kung people’s survival into the",Paragraph
next decades is much in doubt. It is not the,Paragraph
"natural world that endangers them, but our",Paragraph
civilized world.,Paragraph
"As populations expanded, groups would",Paragraph
bud off to form new communities in the next,Paragraph
"valley or further along the shores. In this way,",Paragraph
the first groups of people left Africa some 1.5,Paragraph
"million years ago with a second group, our",Paragraph
"human ancestors, following around 60,000",Paragraph
BCE to slowly yet persistently colonize the,Paragraph
"globe, reaching the southern tip of South",Paragraph
"America around 13,000 BCE. First Society",Caption
"people, however, were not nomads as is so",Paragraph
mistakenly assumed. Instead they tended to,Paragraph
"live within prescribed and familiar territories,",Paragraph
moving seasonally between winter camps,Title
near rivers and upland summer camps for,Paragraph
hunting and fishing. The ancient people of,Paragraph
"Australia, for example, moved in predictable",Paragraph
cycles: in some parts of the year they lived,Paragraph
"in relative isolation, and in other parts",Paragraph
they would get together for large annual,Paragraph
ceremonial and social events.,Paragraph
"During the Ice Age (ca. 25,000 BCE-",Paragraph
"ca. 15,000 BCE), humans faced a global",Paragraph
phenomencn the likes of which we have,Paragraph
"never seen since. The extreme cold, which",Paragraph
"sent massive, mile-deep ice sheets far to",Paragraph
"the south of the polar regions, impacted",Paragraph
Europe in particular. But the people there,Paragraph
did not leave. This was not because they,Paragraph
were trapped. It was because those areas,Paragraph
"ad become a hunter's paradise, with bears,",Paragraph
"ions, and, above all, huge herds of horses,",Paragraph
"reindeer, and mammoth moving across the",Paragraph
grassy landscape. The Gravettian Culture was,Paragraph
the first to master the cold. They developed,Paragraph
leather-making and the needle to create fur-,Paragraph
"ined clothing, boots, and jackets. In great",Paragraph
"festivals, they congregated near caves where",Paragraph
artists had painted brilliant images of animals,Paragraph
on the walls and ceilings. What form of magic,Paragraph
"these places produced is still unknown, but",Paragraph
the quality of the art staggers the imagination,Paragraph
even today. The animals were painted not,Paragraph
as carcasses but as living creatures moving,Paragraph
"and breathing, and were made by artists who",Paragraph
had practiced their skills over a lifetime. As,Paragraph
"the weather warmed, the hunters moved to",Paragraph
"the east, crossed Siberia, and around 13,000",Paragraph
BCE crossed Alaska to enter the open plains,Paragraph
"of North America. Called the Clovis People,",Paragraph
"they hunted mammoth and then, when the",Paragraph
"mammoth were all hunted out, they switched",Paragraph
to bison. Their sacred landscapes include,Paragraph
"Seminole Canyon in Texas, with its ancient",Paragraph
rock art depicting shamans and sacred,Title
animal spirits.,Paragraph
"1.2 Haida settlement, Canada",Caption
The warming of the weather raised the,Paragraph
"levels of the oceans, separating Japan from",Paragraph
"China, and England from mainland Europe.",Paragraph
"It created vast rivers, swamps, and forests",Paragraph
"teeming with animals and plants, drawing",Paragraph
"humans to the river shores. It was, one",Paragraph
"might say, an age of affluence. At Lepenski",Paragraph
"Vir along the Danube River, a settlement of",Paragraph
triangular huts emerged. The people there,Paragraph
"caught sturgeon, a fish that averaged some 3",Paragraph
meters long. Why go hunting when catching,Paragraph
one fish would feed an entire community?,Paragraph
The nearby forests provided a wide,Paragraph
"assortment of berries, mushrooms, and nuts",Title
to complement the diet. Nor was this village a,Paragraph
solitary community. Similar villages lined the,Paragraph
"shores, and their inhabitants traveled by boat",Paragraph
to connect with each other for ceremonial,Paragraph
events.,Paragraph
"Half a world away, another affluent",Paragraph
society emerged along the northwest coast,Paragraph
of Canada. It was a favorable site for many,Paragraph
reasons. It was in a pocket of relatively mild,Paragraph
"weather, the result of cross-Pacific winds; it",Paragraph
was also sited along the migration path of,Paragraph
"whales, and salmon came in the thousands",Paragraph
to swim upstream to spawn. Huge cedar,Paragraph
"trees, sacred to the Haida, provided material",Paragraph
for houses and boats. The tree was not just,Paragraph
“wood.” Its red color and sweet smell were,Paragraph
indicators of its connection to the world of,Paragraph
the spirits. Linear settlements sprang up,Paragraph
"along the shore, cornposed of large, clan-",Paragraph
based community houses facing the water.,Paragraph
Each house was a sacred diagram designed,Paragraph
"in relation to the cosmos, which for the",Paragraph
Haida was divided into three shamanistic,Paragraph
"zones: the sky world, the earth, and the",Title
oceanic underworld. The building's frame,Paragraph
"systern consisted of massive roof beams,",Paragraph
often more than half a meter in diameter,Paragraph
"and spanning the width of the house, which",Paragraph
ranged from 7.5 to 15 meters. These beams,Paragraph
were supported by posts carved to represent,Paragraph
important family ancestors or supernatural,Title
beings associated with the family’s history.,Paragraph
Walls were clad with split-cedar planks tied,Paragraph
horizontally between paired upright poles.,Paragraph
lt was not just rivers and shores that,Paragraph
attracted human habitation to make the first,Paragraph
"settled communities, but also the emerging",Paragraph
great rain forests. The Bambuti in Congo still,Paragraph
"today pay homage to a forest spirit, Jengi,",Paragraph
whose power is thought to ernanate through,Paragraph
the world. Jengi is seen as a parental figure,Paragraph
and guardian. Society is organized around,Paragraph
"individual households consisting of a husband,",Paragraph
"a wife, and their children, forrning settlements",Paragraph
that can number up to about fifty residents.,Paragraph
"The women build the huts that, in the shape",Paragraph
"of upside-down baskets, are made out of a",Paragraph
frame of saplings and clad with leaves. Other,Paragraph
"rain forest cultures developed in Brazil, Central",Paragraph
"America, and Southeast Asia.",Paragraph
"Beginning around 10,000 BCE in some",Paragraph
"places, the great First Society traditions that",Paragraph
had sustained human life for so long began to,Paragraph
"change. Instead of hunting animals, humans",Paragraph
"began to herd them, and instead of gathering",Paragraph
"and tending plants, they began to domesticate",Paragraph
a few chosen plants and grow them in,Paragraph
organized fields. These changes altered,Paragraph
1.3 Village scene,Caption
the imaginaries of the spirit world. Cattle in,Paragraph
"particular were seen as living gods, requiring",Paragraph
daily attendance and a culture of respect. They,Paragraph
were not killed for food but were sacrificed,Paragraph
to mark special events in the life of the,Paragraph
"community. Among the Dinka in the Sudan, a",Paragraph
"man knows his cattle by special names, sings",Paragraph
"songs to them, and sleeps next to them for",Paragraph
long periods of time. Cattle are sacrificed only,Paragraph
"on special occasions, such as at weddings or",Paragraph
funerals. Although only a few cattle-centric,Paragraph
"societies remain today, the impact of this",Paragraph
worldview can be felt even in modern religions.,Paragraph
Just as important was the shift from,Paragraph
gathering plants to farming. Rice in southern,Paragraph
"China and eastern India, millet in Africa and",Paragraph
"northern China, wheat and barley in the",Title
"Levant, and corn in Guatemala—all rose from",Paragraph
being just one of thousands of plants that,Paragraph
humans tended to the precious focus of effort,Paragraph
and devotion. The combined transformation,Paragraph
of our relationship to animals and plants,Title
produced a new way of life: agropastoralism.,Paragraph
While today we call this period the birth of,Paragraph
"agriculture, we have to remember that crops",Paragraph
like rice and barley were not raised as food.,Paragraph
They were gods. We have so secularized food,Paragraph
production today that we forget that the birth,Paragraph
of what we call agriculture coincided wit!,Paragraph
profound transformations that deified certain,Paragraph
"foods and thus, it might be said, guaranteed",Paragraph
the proper and complex work ethic needed for,Paragraph
their production. The impact on women was,Paragraph
"particularly profound; harvesting, grinding,",Paragraph
"storing, and cooking were all largely women’s",Paragraph
"work, as was pottery making, basket weaving,",Paragraph
"and, of course, the raising of children.",Paragraph
The emergence of pastoral and agropastoral,Title
cultures produced village societies organized,Title
around chiefs with more or less power,Title
depending on circumstances. Villages were,Paragraph
well calibrated to meet the needs of the,Paragraph
"animals, to deal with the calendar of planting",Paragraph
"and harvesting, and to produce the necessary",Paragraph
"equipment for life, such as the bowls and",Paragraph
containers that stored grain and water and,Paragraph
that allowed fermentation and cooking to,Paragraph
take place. These activities were all governed,Paragraph
by ritual practices and unwritten rules of,Paragraph
behavior that shaped the destiny of all. But,Paragraph
village society could not spread just anywhere.,Paragraph
It needed the right combination of good soil,Paragraph
"for farms, grasslands for cattle, forests for",Paragraph
"firewood, and upland areas for hunting—and,",Paragraph
"of course, water and salt.",Paragraph
The Mesopotamian highlands were perfect,Paragraph
"for such agropastoral societies, and beginning",Paragraph
around 9000 BCE compact villages began to,Paragraph
spread along the slopes above the great rivers,Paragraph
1.4 Pottery making,Caption
in the plains. A similar expansion took place,Paragraph
"along the Sahel in Africa, where sorghurn was",Paragraph
"the main plant, as well as in the foothills of the",Paragraph
"Baluchistan Mountains (barley), in northern",Paragraph
"China (millet), and along the Yangtze River",Paragraph
(rice). By 5000 BCE these places had also,Paragraph
established themselves as profoundly different,Paragraph
from the First Society worlds that neighbored,Title
"them, even if they maintained some aspects of",Paragraph
the older traditions. Whereas the agropastoral,Paragraph
"tradition in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley,",Paragraph
"China, and Egypt remained confined by their",Paragraph
"ecological niches, a remarkable transformation",Paragraph
"took place in Europe, where between 9000.",Paragraph
"and 4000 BCE, agropastoral cultures rnoved",Paragraph
slowly along rivers and shores to reach even,Paragraph
northern Ireland. There the newcomers thrived,Paragraph
and built one of the greatest structures of,Paragraph
"the time, Newgrange, a vast artificial mound",Paragraph
with a sacred chamber in its interior that was,Paragraph
designed to mark the first rays of the winter,Paragraph
solstice.,Paragraph

RITUAL CENTERS,Title
"n the agropastoral environment, humans",Title
egan to think and act differently than,Title
their First Society ancestors had. Forests,Paragraph
"jad to be chopped down, clay had to be",Paragraph
gathered for pots that then had to be fired in,Paragraph
"ilns, granaries had to established, animals",Paragraph
"tended to, wool harvested and made into",Paragraph
cloth; plants that were once considered,Paragraph
food were now thought of as weeds that had,Paragraph
to be culled from gardens and farm plots.,Paragraph
Decisions had to be made about priorities;,Paragraph
children had to learn their respective roles as,Paragraph
adults; and priests had to secure the privilege,Paragraph
of the divine. Customs had to be followed,Paragraph
"about social ranking, finding a mate, and",Paragraph
building a house. Herds could die because,Paragraph
"of disease or predators, and crops could be",Paragraph
lost to pests or carelessness. Grains could,Paragraph
"rot, and neighboring tribes could attack.",Paragraph
The marshaling of energies that the village,Paragraph
"required, the stratification of gender activities",Paragraph
along with the creation of a new set of,Paragraph
powerful gods in privileged communication,Title
"with the elites, produced a type of cognitive",Paragraph
revolution. The cohesiveness that this,Paragraph
"required is impressive, and in many parts of",Paragraph
the globe the village world is still the glue that,Paragraph
holds society together.,Paragraph
One of the first sites where we see the,Paragraph
transformation is Nabta Playa in what is,Paragraph
"today southern Egypt, some 80 kilometers",Paragraph
west of Abu Simbel. It is now an inhospitable,Paragraph
"desert, but in 9000 BCE it was next to a large",Paragraph
lake with pastured shores. The site featured,Paragraph
"a circle of slender upright stones, the main",Paragraph
stones being four pairs set close together.,Paragraph
"Compared to Stonehenge, built 6.000 years",Paragraph
"later, the circle is small, measuring roughly",Paragraph
"4 meters in diameter, but its purpose was",Paragraph
similar: to organize time according to the,Paragraph
seasons. Two of the stone pairs are aligned,Paragraph
"north-south, the other two pairs northeast-",Paragraph
southwest. They aided in the observation,Paragraph
of the motion of the sun and probably of,Paragraph
the constellation Orion. Priests and their,Paragraph
associated clans probably came to live at,Paragraph
"Nabta Playa permanently, with the population",Paragraph
swelling periodically with the seasonal arrival,Paragraph
of herder tribes who would have come from,Paragraph
far afield with their cattle for large celebratory,Paragraph
O,Title
"events. By 3500 BCE, however, Nabta Playa",Paragraph
had become increasingly arid: the lake,Paragraph
"dried up, and the site was abandoned. The",Paragraph
exodus from the Nubian Desert to the Nile,Title
River played a large role in the development,Paragraph
of social differentiation in the pre-dynastic,Paragraph
cultures of the Nile Valley. One important link,Paragraph
between Egypt and the ancient cattle cult,Title
"of Nabta Playa was Hathor, the goddess of",Paragraph
fertility.,Paragraph
Another ritual site was on top of a hill near,Paragraph
the village of Urfa in southeastern Turkey.,Paragraph
"Here, too, the now arid site was once a lush",Paragraph
forest. The oldest layer of the site appears,Paragraph
to date back to around 9000 BCE. The,Paragraph
"structures, called Gébekli Tepe, consist of",Paragraph
"several circular dry-stone walls, each of which",Paragraph
contains monolithic pillars of limestone up to,Paragraph
3 meters tall. Since there is no indication of,Paragraph
"any roof covering, it seems that the circles",Paragraph
were open-air ritual chambers. They are now,Paragraph
"called temples, but it is unlikely that they",Paragraph
were temples in the sense of being used,Paragraph
by a priesthood with organized devotional,Paragraph
practices. What went on in these spaces is,Paragraph
"not known, but they most certainly had links",Paragraph
to ancestor cults and might have been used,Paragraph
in conjunction with mortuary rituals. The,Paragraph
floors consisted of a concrete-like substance,Paragraph
made of burnished lime. A low bench runs,Paragraph
around the inside of the circle walls. The,Paragraph
"pillars show detailed reliefs of foxes, lions,",Caption

"cattle, wild boars, herons, ducks, scorpions,",Paragraph
"ants, and snakes, all executed with great skill,",Paragraph
demonstrating that precision work—even,Paragraph
without metalworking tools—was possible,Paragraph
even at this early time.,Paragraph
f we add to these two sites the Niuheliang,Paragraph
Ritual Center (ca. 3500-3000 BCE) in,Paragraph
"northern China, with its numerous platforms",Paragraph
"and structures, and, of course, Stonehenge",Paragraph
"(ca. 3000 BCE}, we have four ritual centers—",Paragraph
and there are certainly countless more—that,Paragraph
served as gathering places and eventually,Paragraph
as religious centers for newly settled,Paragraph
communities. Niuheliang will be discussed,Paragraph
"in this chapter; Stonehenge, perhaps the",Paragraph
"last of the great early ritual centers, will be",Paragraph
discussed in the next.,Paragraph
Around 3500 BCE something quite,Paragraph
remarkable happened in four places on,Paragraph
the earth: groups of people developed,Title
something that we today call cities. This,Paragraph
transformation was not as natural as one,Paragraph
"might assume, even though it was dependent",Paragraph
on several thousand years of village life and,Title
the necessary cohesion that came with it. In,Paragraph
"Mesopotamia, the farmers in the hills at first",Paragraph
"stayed away from the vast, overgrown, flood-",Paragraph
prone swamps of the Tigris and Euphrates,Title
Rivers. But an intrepid group must have set,Paragraph
"out one day to try their luck. Finding a knoll,",Paragraph
"they dug up the reeds, planted barley, and",Paragraph
"carved out canals, activities that were hugely",Paragraph
"labor-intensive. It was a success, built on the",Paragraph
simple premise that by doing one thing well—,Paragraph
growing barley—the inhabitants of an isolated,Paragraph
place could trade for everything that they did,Paragraph
not have. They created the wheel to speed,Paragraph
up travel; they created writing to document,Paragraph
trade transactions; they created city-scaled,Paragraph
gods to protect them; they laid the foundation,Paragraph
for laws and regulations; and they created,Paragraph
walls to defend their precious grain surpluses,Paragraph
on which the entire operation depended.,Paragraph
The first cities of Mesopotamia were thus,Paragraph
experiments in an extreme landscape. They,Paragraph
"were governed by an elite, with most of the",Paragraph
work done by slaves from nearby conquered,Title
"regions. Some cities thrived, some did not,",Paragraph
"but over time, the power and wealth that they",Paragraph
created for themselves pushed their destiny,Title
"forward. In Egypt, the story is similar, but",Paragraph
here the rise of cities—more like sprawling,Paragraph
villages—was the consequence of the rapid,Paragraph
influx of refugees from the expanding Sahara,Title
Desert. Prior to about 5000 BCE the Nile was,Paragraph
"an unruly, lightly populated, swampy river,",Paragraph
but with the drier climate that created the,Paragraph
"desert, thousands of people came with their",Paragraph
animals and agricultural skills. Over tire they,Paragraph
refashioned the Nile into a fertile paradise.,Paragraph
The intensity of this foreshadowed the rise,Paragraph
"of a controlling elite who became first chiefs,",Paragraph
then gods.,Paragraph
"1.7 Gobekli Tepe, near Urfa, Turkey",Caption
"In India along the Indus River, cities also",Paragraph
"emerged, spectacular in nature, because",Paragraph
unlike in Mesopotamia and Egypt where the,Paragraph
"building material was largely mud-dried brick,",Paragraph
here the inhabitants made kiln-fired bricks,Paragraph
that could not only withstand the test of time,Paragraph
but also allowed them to build close to the,Paragraph
"river, and to build pools, drainage systems,",Paragraph
and multistory houses. Ships from these,Paragraph
cities traded with the Mesopotamians,Title
to the north.,Paragraph
"In China, the development of cities had",Paragraph
a slightly different cast. Village communities,Paragraph
had formed in the south in the swarnpy,Paragraph
regions around Hangzhou Bay and the,Title
"Yangtze River estuary, where rice could",Paragraph
be planted. Villages were also forming in,Paragraph
the north where people had long since,Paragraph
"discovered the value of millet, a hardy plant",Paragraph
that grows on hillsides. Here people used,Paragraph
a form of architecture well-known in the,Paragraph
"north since 25,000 BCE, the pit house. Dug",Paragraph
partially into the ground with a superstructure,Paragraph
"of thatch held in place by posts and beams,",Paragraph
these communal buildings were dry and,Paragraph
warm and the focus of a range of ritual,Paragraph
"activities. Unlike the Mesopotamian cities,",Paragraph
"which were import-export centers, these",Paragraph
dense villages were more self-sustaining as,Paragraph
they attained the scale of cities. There were,Paragraph
areas for the manufacturing of pottery and,Paragraph
"bronze, just as there were areas reserved for",Paragraph
the elites.,Paragraph
"1.8 Elam, a typical Mesopotamian city with",Caption
"walls and towers, as depicted in this bas-relief",Paragraph
commemorating Assyrian king Ashurbanipal’s,Caption
conquest and destruction of the city in 647 BCE.,Paragraph
These first cities produced a concentration of,Paragraph
wealth and power that was to have significant,Paragraph
implications for the destiny of humans and,Title
indeed for their definition of thernselves,Paragraph
as “civilized.” But as much magic as they,Paragraph
"worked on the human imagination, these",Paragraph
cities’ experimental nature should not be,Paragraph
forgotten. Cities were made; they were also,Paragraph
"made to be destroyed. The Chinese, in fact,",Paragraph
would continuously destroy their cities; with a,Paragraph
"new dynasty, the old capital was often burned",Paragraph
or leveled and the inhabitants forced to,Paragraph
relocate. The Mesopotamians and Egyptians,Paragraph
"glorified their destruction of enemy cities, and",Paragraph
so it went on—until even today.,Paragraph
Although urban densities were able to pull,Paragraph
"a large amount of resources into their orbits,",Paragraph
around 3500 BCE they constituted only a tiny,Paragraph
"percentage of the world population, maybe as",Paragraph
small as .001 percent. Most people lived in,Paragraph
"spread-out village societies, and many more",Paragraph
"lived in a world with no agriculture at all, as",Paragraph
humans had for hundreds of thousands of,Paragraph
years.,Paragraph
BEGINNINGS OF CHINA’S,Title
CIVILIZATIONS,Title
"In China, the shift to an agricultural/village",Paragraph
world took place around 9000 BCE. There,Paragraph
"was, however, no single “origin” of Chinese",Paragraph
"civilization. Instead, there was a gradual",Paragraph
multinucleated development taking place,Title
"somewhat independently at first, with the",Paragraph
emphasis to the south on rice and to the,Paragraph
north on millet and pigs. Rice grew wild,Paragraph
and was then domesticated on the swampy,Paragraph
shores and in the delta of the Yangtze River.,Paragraph
"Millet, which prefers a cooler climate, grows",Paragraph
"wild on hillsides, where it over time was",Paragraph
also domesticated. Pigs played a role in,Paragraph
"village life from early times and, along with",Paragraph
"sheep, were introduced to northern cultures",Paragraph
"by 5000 BCE, if not earlier. By 4000 BCE,",Paragraph
"especially in the north, small but well-",Paragraph
organized regional cormmunities emerged.,Paragraph
These included the Hongshan Culture,Paragraph
4700-2900 BCE) to the north of Bohai Bay,Paragraph
"in Inner Mongolia and Hebai Province, and",Paragraph
the Yangshao Culture (5000-3000 BCE) in,Paragraph
Henan Province. Geographically between the,Paragraph
"two, and developing later, was the Longshan",Paragraph
Culture (3000-2000 BCE) in the central,Paragraph
and lower areas of the Yellow River. The,Paragraph
emergence of walls around communities is a,Paragraph
clear indication that the political landscape,Paragraph
"was very much in flux. To the north, villages",Paragraph
were generally composed of pit houses,Paragraph
"that, whether large or small, trace their",Paragraph
"ancestry back to 20,000 BCE and possibly",Paragraph
earlier. Pit houses were used throughout,Paragraph
Inner Asia by steppe hunters. People to the,Paragraph
"south developed houses on stilts, a natural",Paragraph

"Though scattered over a large area, the",Paragraph
community's ritual life focused on a sacred,Paragraph
landscape in which a mountain known locally,Paragraph
"as Pig Mountain must have played a part,",Paragraph
as its silhouette is visible to the south. The,Paragraph
ritual center consisted of at least fourteen,Paragraph
urial mounds and altars over several hill,Paragraph

a tunnel-like space. Its main body was 25,Paragraph

its surviving footings show that its surface,Paragraph
was covered with geometric designs in high,Paragraph

To its north was a single detached room,Paragraph

Rivers were far different from the deserts,Paragraph

forests were interspersed with steppes and,Paragraph
savannas rich in flora and abounding with,Paragraph
"goats, boars, deer, and foxes. Farmers",Paragraph
"worked in the valley, but the community lived",Paragraph
in the more easily fortifiable hills. Shepherds,Paragraph
lived in the steppe regions between the farms,Paragraph
and the deserts. In the areas around the,Paragraph
"Black Sea, one would have found a similar",Paragraph
"fabric of habitation, except there the locals",Paragraph
"discovered that their hills contained obsidian,",Paragraph

commodities for trade. Around 5000 BCE the,Paragraph

formations: the Vinca in Romania and the,Title
"Samarra in Iraq. A few places stood out, like",Paragraph

which were larger than the rest. Also,Paragraph
"important was Catal HUytk in Turkey, which",Paragraph
"was a key source of obsidian, a volcanic glass",Paragraph
that was needed for sickle blades.,Paragraph
One of the most important groupings,Paragraph
of villages dating from this period (6000-,Paragraph
3500 BCE) was located just to the east of,Paragraph
a rain-fed agricultural zone that arches,Paragraph
northeastward from the northern tip of the,Paragraph
Persian Gulf along the flanks of the Zagros,Title
Mountains. Among these settlements was,Paragraph
"Tell es-Sawwan, on the left bank of the Tigris",Caption
near Samarra. It started as a small village,Paragraph
"that became fortified, growing over time into",Paragraph
a substantial community. The plan shows a,Paragraph
"clear hierarchy, with the important buildings",Paragraph
in the southern half. The central building is,Paragraph
symmetrical and has a hall or corridor down,Paragraph
the center; it was built at a later stage in,Paragraph
the development of the village. Its purpose,Paragraph
"is unknown, but it was possibly a granary.",Paragraph
There are about seven or eight houses that,Paragraph
have nearby areas for sheep and goats. The,Paragraph
basic building material was mud and timber;,Paragraph
the mud was mixed with reeds and dried in,Paragraph
"a mold to create bricks, an innovation that",Paragraph
remains a characteristic of the region even,Paragraph
"today. Rooms were rectilinear, measuring,",Paragraph
"on average, about 1.5 by 2 meters. The",Paragraph
horizontal roofs were made of beams of oak,Paragraph
on which were placed a layer of branches,Paragraph
"and reeds sealed with mud, bitumen, and",Paragraph
gypsum. The interior wall surfaces were,Paragraph
"decorated with gypsum plaster, which",Paragraph
had been developed as early as 7000 BCE,Paragraph
and which was to remain a central part of,Paragraph
building construction in the entire area.,Paragraph
From the extensive outcrops of rock gypsum,Paragraph
"in northern Iraq and Syria, stone blocks",Paragraph
"were mined, stacked, and burnt to form",Paragraph
an easily transportable white powder. This,Paragraph
building material was not only used locally,Paragraph
but also exported as a trade commodity.,Paragraph
"The development of trade in craft goods,",Paragraph
"pottery, building materials, and metal objects",Title
stimulated the economies of the region and,Paragraph
played a central part in its drift toward craft,Paragraph
specialization and urbanization. The Samarra,Paragraph
"Culture produced abundant grain, which was",Paragraph
then exported to surrounding regions.,Paragraph
Though we often think of the Tigris and,Paragraph
Euphrates region as the birthplace of urban,Paragraph
"civilization, the truth is that civilization—if",Paragraph
that complex and awkward word can be,Paragraph
"used, at least in this area—was the product",Paragraph
of a combined culture in which some people,Paragraph
raised grain while others built mines. The,Paragraph
oft repeated image of Mesopotamia as a,Paragraph
“Fertile Crescent” is flawed if one does not,Paragraph
add the Metal Crescent that embraced it. In,Paragraph
"Mesopotamia, grain and metal were mutually",Paragraph
reinforcing commodities. The principal,Paragraph
copper-producing areas stretched from the,Paragraph
Caspian Sea through Anatolia and around the,Title
Black Sea.,Paragraph
"An important early Copper Age society,",Paragraph
"known as the Vinca Culture, flourished from",Paragraph
5500 to 4000 BCE in an area that stretches,Paragraph
from present-day Bosnia to Romania.,Paragraph
Whereas the Mesopotamians developed mud-,Paragraph
brick walls covered with plaster to protect,Paragraph
"the walls against moisture, the Vinca lived in",Paragraph
freestanding rectangular houses with walls,Caption
made of wattle and daub. The roofs were,Paragraph
pitched and made of thatch. Their ritual,Paragraph
world was intense. The Vinca had house,Paragraph
shrines with an assortment of strangely,Paragraph
carved deities that governed fertility and that,Paragraph
spoke to the ancestors or gave omens.,Paragraph
1.27 Vinca statuette,Caption
"The Taurus Mountains in eastern Anatolia,",Paragraph
"known for their tin mines, played an equally",Paragraph
"important part in the West Asian economy,",Paragraph
"since tin was needed, along with copper,",Paragraph
to make bronze. Though there were many,Paragraph
"copper-producing areas, tin was more rare.",Paragraph
An ancient tin mine was discovered at a site,Paragraph
"named Géltepe, which was a large village",Paragraph
"from around 3290 to 1840 BCE. The miners,",Paragraph
"using narrow shafts, brought cassiterite",Paragraph
"ore to the surface, where it was crushed,",Paragraph
"washed, and smelted with charcoal in small",Paragraph
crucibles rather than in the large furnaces,Paragraph
characteristic of copper-smelting sites. By,Paragraph
measuring the enormous deposits of slag,Paragraph
"(600,000 tons in one pile), researchers have",Paragraph
ascertained that this was a major site during,Paragraph
much of the early and middle Bronze Age.,Paragraph
Metal began to play an important part in,Paragraph
international relations in the third millennium,Title
"BCE. Around 2350 BCE, Sargon of Akkad",Caption
invaded Anatolia from his lowland base to,Paragraph
secure trade routes. In records that have,Paragraph
"been found, he boasts that a single caravan",Paragraph
"carried about 12 tons of tin, which can make",Paragraph
125 tons of bronze—enough to equip a large,Paragraph
army. Today it is widely accepted that mining,Paragraph
was responsible for vast deforestation and,Paragraph
played an important part in the desertification,Paragraph
of western Asia.,Paragraph

With this in mind we can now better,Paragraph
understand the rise of the first cities in the,Paragraph
marshes of the Tigris and Euphrates areas.,Paragraph
Though villages spanned the area from,Paragraph
"the Levant into northern Syrian and Iraq,",Paragraph
"few people ventured into these marshes,",Paragraph
"overgrown with tall reeds, useful for boats",Paragraph
and thatching but little more. It was an,Paragraph
extreme landscape that had no lumber for,Paragraph
"roof beams, and no metal or even stone. But",Paragraph
around 5000 BCE we see the first atternpts,Paragraph
to transform this landscape. Societies gave,Paragraph
up their partial dependency on an integrated,Paragraph
farming-hunting lifestyle and concentrated,Title
"on farming alone, the aim being to produce",Paragraph
huge grain surpluses that would be traded,Paragraph
for other things. These cities were not secular,Paragraph
adventures. They were built at the command,Paragraph
of the deities who in a sense sponsored these,Paragraph

surplus-making enterprises. In Mesopotamian,Paragraph
mythology it was never the humans who,Paragraph
"created cities, but the gods themselves.",Paragraph
"But back in the realm of the humans,",Paragraph
the making of these places did go hand in,Paragraph
hand with technical advances. The Tigris,Paragraph
"and Euphrates, unlike the Nile, flooded",Paragraph
"before the harvest, in April and May; this",Paragraph
had made lower-lying reaches unusable for,Paragraph
agriculture. But sedimentation brought by the,Paragraph
rivers tended to build up natural levees that,Paragraph
"farmers could reinforce, allowing the canal",Paragraph
bed to become somewhat higher than the,Paragraph
surrounding countryside. Farmers could then,Paragraph
make openings in the levees to feed water,Paragraph
"into the irrigation channels, as they still do",Paragraph
today. Aerial photography has recently proven,Paragraph
the extensive nature of these ancient canals,Paragraph
"and dikes, some of them more than 100",Paragraph
kilometers in length.,Paragraph
"1.30 Temple atop the stone-faced platform at Eridu, near Abu Shahrain, Iran",Caption
The relationship with the rivers was a,Paragraph
delicate and dangerous one. The systern was,Paragraph
"vulnerable to flood, war, and neglect. Records",Paragraph
from Ur deal repeatedly with repair work.,Paragraph
But the investment was worth the effort. In a,Paragraph
few centuries the area became an economic,Paragraph
engine unparalleled anywhere in the world,Title
except in Egypt. Though these cities are,Paragraph
discussed in relationship to advances in,Paragraph
"agriculture, what we really see are cities",Paragraph
serving by necessity as export and import,Paragraph
centers.,Paragraph
"Eridu and Uruk were, in a sense, modern",Paragraph
cities dependent on a single economy of,Paragraph
"grain, requiring the control and movement",Paragraph
of goods. It thus stands to reason that it was,Paragraph
here that the wheel came into its full use,Paragraph
"to haul loads over long distances, and that",Paragraph
standardized weights were invented at this,Paragraph
time. Another innovation was one of the great,Paragraph
"civilizational achievernents: writing, which",Paragraph
was put to practical use to record trade,Paragraph
transactions and keep up with inventory.,Paragraph
Concomitant with this was the development of,Paragraph
a legal and archival system. Evidence of the,Paragraph
impact this made can be found in vestigial,Paragraph
remnants of words deeply embedded in our,Paragraph
"present-day language. In Ur, the ancient title",Paragraph
"designating “king” is /uga/, which is probably",Paragraph
the origin of the Latin word fex (“law”) and,Paragraph
the English word /ega/. And another ancient,Paragraph
"Mesopotamian word, pala, referring to the",Paragraph
"garment of kingship, constitutes the root of",Paragraph
our word palace.,Paragraph
We see the emergence of a cormplex religious,Paragraph
world in tune with the equally complex life of,Paragraph
"urban civilization. The mother goddess, who",Paragraph
"had ruled in many places throughout Eurasia,",Paragraph
now had to compete with an expanding list of,Paragraph
divine presences—including powerful male,Title
gods who tied society firmly into a network of,Paragraph
"obligations. Significantly, the mother goddess",Paragraph
"Apsu, who controlled the oceans, was “killed”",Paragraph
"by her son Ea, earth, who divided her unruly",Paragraph
waters into chambers. Concurrent with the,Paragraph
shift was the emergence of a priestly class,Paragraph
"responsible for all aspects of society, from",Paragraph
religion to administration to technology. The,Paragraph
priestly class was responsible not only for,Paragraph
the proper communication with the deities,Title

INTRODUCTION,Title
"By the beginning of the third millennium BCE,",Paragraph
the various river-oriented civilizations were,Paragraph
primed for rapid cultural developrnent. There,Paragraph
were at the time six principal cultural hubs:,Paragraph
"Egypt, Mesopotamia, Margiana, the Indus,",Title
"China, and Europe. In all these places, elites",Paragraph
"emerged who ruled not just by force, but with",Paragraph
some form of divine or ancestral blessing.,Paragraph
"Generally speaking, when things went well,",Paragraph
this was attributed to the gods; when things,Paragraph
"went badly, this was seen as a sign of divine",Paragraph
displeasure.,Paragraph
Mesopotamian cities were the most,Paragraph
unusual since they were created in the,Paragraph
context of an extreme landscape of marshes,Paragraph
that were converted into agricultural land.,Paragraph
The first Mesopotamian cities can be,Paragraph
"considered risk societies, based on the",Paragraph
gamble that producing huge surpluses,Paragraph
of grain would allow them to trade for,Paragraph
commodities that were not readily available.,Paragraph
The cities thus became ritual centers in,Paragraph
"their own right, where the relationship to the",Paragraph
sacred was organized and mastered with,Paragraph
calendric precision. The elites who governed,Paragraph
the city were devotees of a complex pantheon,Paragraph
of gods who in turn “governed” all aspects,Paragraph
"of nature, even human. The elites operated",Paragraph
in close alliance with a priestly class for,Paragraph
whom huge temples were built in the form of,Paragraph
artificial mountains rising in colorful terraces.,Paragraph
The ziggurats at Eridu and Ur were by far,Paragraph
"the most extensive buildings of the age,",Paragraph
Arabian Sea,Title
testament to the wealth flowing to the cities.,Paragraph
"They were prestige buildings, made just as",Paragraph
much by “deities” as by human labor. The,Paragraph
cities that were built around them consisted,Paragraph
of a dense fabric of houses. Most buildings,Paragraph
were made of mud brick with wooden roofs.,Paragraph
"Outside the walls, along the canals, one",Paragraph
would have found a vast network of small,Paragraph
villages that were controlled by the temple.,Paragraph
But these cities had limits on how far their,Paragraph
"authority could reach, and so they existed",Paragraph
in tense alliances with similar cities up and,Paragraph
down the river.,Paragraph
"Egypt, less prone to invasion, developed",Paragraph
a clear dynastic power structure and a,Paragraph
consistent set of religious traditions from an,Paragraph
"early age. Furthermore, due to the seasonality",Paragraph
"of local agriculture, farm workers could be",Paragraph
summoned by the pharaohs to perform,Paragraph
forced labor on building projects. Zoser's,Paragraph
"mortuary temple, built on an unprecedented",Paragraph
"scale, was one of the first monumental stone",Paragraph
buildings in the world. The mastery of stone,Paragraph
masonry is one of Egypt's great contributions,Paragraph
to architecture. The expansive mortuary,Paragraph
complex answered to the intricate cosmology,Paragraph
used by its Egyptian elites. The building was,Paragraph
made for a dead pharaoh who was deemed,Paragraph
to be still “alive” and thus in need of the,Paragraph
illusion of rulership in perpetuity. His spirit,Paragraph
"was embodied in a statue, called the Ka",Paragraph
"statue, which was ritually fed and housed in",Paragraph
a special chamber so that he could see the,Paragraph
western sunset through a small hole.,Paragraph
"Meanwhile, around 2500 BCE, people moved",Paragraph
down from the Baluchistan Hills and settled,Paragraph
in the river valleys that define the eastern,Paragraph
edge of the South Asian subcontinent—those,Title
of the Indus and the now dried-up Ghaggar-,Paragraph
Hakra Rivers. The Indus/Ghaggar-Hakra,Paragraph
region was the first urban civilization in,Paragraph
the true sense of the word. The reason for,Paragraph
its success is obvious. The 900-kilometer-,Paragraph
long valley is hemmed in to the north,Paragraph
and south by vast stretches of dry and,Paragraph
rainless mountains and deserts. One can,Paragraph
imagine it as a linear oasis. Irrigation here,Paragraph
"was easier than in Mesopotamia, and the",Paragraph
plentiful supply of trees allowed for the early,Paragraph
development of fired bricks that withstood,Paragraph
the ravages of water better than mud brick.,Paragraph
More than a thousand cities and towns have,Paragraph
"been discovered spread over 650,000 square",Paragraph
"kilometers, an area roughly equivalent to that",Paragraph
of modern-day France. Though these cities,Paragraph
"were distant frorn each other, they shared",Paragraph
a common language and a standardized,Title
system of weights and measures. Thousands,Paragraph
of terra-cotta seals depicting a wide range,Caption
"of human, animal, and mythical forms have",Paragraph
"been found, each with distinctive markings",Paragraph
that are presumably letters of an alphabet.,Paragraph
"The inhabitants, about whom we still know",Paragraph
"very little, seemed to have called themselves",Paragraph
"something akin to Meluhha. That, at least, is",Paragraph
what the contemporaneous Mesopotamians,Title
"called therm. Ships carried bricks, beads,",Paragraph
"lumber, metals, and lapis lazuli up the",Paragraph
"Persian Gulf to the cities of Mesopotamia,",Paragraph
where such items were scarce. The nature,Paragraph
"of the return freight is uncertain, since few",Paragraph
Mesopotamian objects have been found at,Paragraph
the Indus. The area between Mesopotamia,Paragraph
and the Indus was also urbanized with cities,Paragraph
"such as Tepe Yaha and Jiroft, in the once",Paragraph
fertile and expansive Soghun Valley. Tepe,Caption
Yaha specialized in mining a highly desired,Paragraph
stone used to make ritual bowls. Not far,Paragraph
"away was Jiroft, an even larger city, which",Paragraph
"specialized in the production of highly prized,",Paragraph
golden-flecked lapis lazuli.,Paragraph
This Zone of Interconnection was linked to,Paragraph
a fourth civilizational area that had been,Paragraph
developing around the Oxus River and was,Paragraph
known as the Adronovo Culture. It was,Paragraph
"based at first around small villages, but two",Paragraph
large cities were eventually built (in today's,Paragraph
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) that were,Paragraph
not only of great size but were designed,Paragraph
"with great geometrical precision. The area,",Paragraph
drawing on the steppe landscape of inner,Paragraph
"Asia, was a center of extensive pastoral",Paragraph
communities.,Paragraph
"In China the first recorded dynasty, the",Paragraph
"Xia dynasty, emerged around 2100 BCE. We",Paragraph
find there a horizontal civilization of villages,Paragraph
and towns unified around palace centers.,Paragraph
One of these was Erlitou (1900-1500 BCE).,Paragraph
"Lying on the Yi River, a tributary of the Luo",Paragraph
"River, Erlitou was located at the foothills of",Paragraph
the mountains and served as an interface,Paragraph
zone between the mountain area rich in,Paragraph
ore and the plains rich in grain. The palace,Paragraph
complex was surrounded by a 2-meter-thick,Paragraph
rammed earth wall that set it apart as an,Paragraph
ancestral ceremonial center for the elites. The,Paragraph
elites made extensive rituals that required,Paragraph
vessels and other instruments. This meant,Paragraph
that craftspeople lived near the palaces.,Paragraph
"In this way, cities emerged not as temple",Paragraph
"economies as in Mesopotamia, but as a",Paragraph
consequence of palace economies. In both,Paragraph
"cases, small elites ruled over large swaths of",Paragraph
population because of their association with,Paragraph
the gods and ancestral deities. But whereas,Paragraph
in Mesopotamia important ritual events were,Paragraph
"something on the order of public spectacles,",Paragraph
in China such rituals garnered esteem,Paragraph
because they were highly private.,Paragraph
"Meanwhile, Europe, between about 5000,",Paragraph

Ireland. But there were hundreds of lesser,Paragraph
"sites, from Scotland south to Portugal.",Paragraph
Around 2800 BCE commenced the spread,Paragraph
"of the Beaker People, whose origins are still",Paragraph
debated but who most likely came from the,Paragraph
Balkans. They are named after their culture's,Paragraph
distinctive pottery drinking vessels. Known for,Paragraph
"their advanced metalworking skill, the Beaker",Paragraph
People left their traces in various locations.,Paragraph
"They arrived in England, where they",Paragraph
"encountered such sites as Stonehenge, which",Paragraph
"they took over and redesigned, orienting it",Paragraph
to the sun rather than to the moon. While,Paragraph
physically this was largely a matter of,Paragraph
"fine-tuning, the cultural implications this",Paragraph
reorientation presupposes are imponderable.,Paragraph
"Stonehenge, since 3000 BCE, when the",Paragraph
"first stone circle was built, becarne a huge",Paragraph
ceremonial zone attracting people from,Paragraph
far afield. There they awaited the sacred,Paragraph
"moment of winter solstice, when contact",Paragraph
with ancestors was most propitious. Far,Paragraph
"to the south, on the island of Malta in the",Paragraph
"Mediterranean, emerged an astonishing",Paragraph
culture that built large “caves” mounded over,Paragraph
with tons of earth. The small island eventually,Paragraph
"had a dozen or so of these structures,",Paragraph
"probably used as places where supplicants,",Paragraph
under the spell of singing and hallucinogenic,Title
"drugs, would experience dream visions. Since",Paragraph
there were many more of these temples than,Paragraph
"the local population could possibly need, it is",Paragraph
quite likely that this was a sacred landscape,Paragraph
that also served people from surrounding,Paragraph
"Mediterranean communities, who would",Paragraph
arrive by boat. Stonehenge and Malta,Caption
represent the last such sacred landscapes.,Paragraph
"In other places, the ritual world was being",Paragraph
"pulled increasingly toward the city. In fact, the",Paragraph
great accomplishment of the Mesopotamian,Title
cultures was precisely to equate city with,Paragraph
ritual center.,Paragraph
Apart from an agropastoral zone that,Paragraph
stretched west to east just below the Sahara,Paragraph
"Desert, the rest of Africa was still First",Paragraph
"Society, as was all of the Americas. But",Paragraph
the Americas should not be written off as a,Paragraph

"example, thrived from about 3000 BCE until",Paragraph
the arrival of the Europeans in the 19t!,Title
"century, one of the most enduring First",Paragraph
Society cultures in the Americas. Another,Paragraph
site of importance was in the area to the,Paragraph
north of the Mississippi River delta. The,Paragraph
yearly flooding of the river allowed large,Paragraph
annual ceremonies to take place on a bluff,Paragraph
"overlooking the river, called Poverty Point,",Paragraph
"where a massive artificial mound, seemingly",Paragraph
"in the shape of a bird, was built. It seers that",Paragraph
different tribes helped build the mound with,Paragraph
clay brought to the site in basketfuls from,Paragraph
their home areas. To the east of the great,Paragraph
mound there was a 300-meter-wide dance,Paragraph
area surrounded by raised ridges on which,Paragraph
temporary huts were erected. Communal,Paragraph
construction of such large ceremonial sites,Title
became an important aspect of what is now,Paragraph
"called the Mississippi Culture, which lasted",Paragraph
into the 16th century.,Paragraph
"In Peru, we see a remarkable",Paragraph
transformation. Intrepid farmers left their,Paragraph
hillside terraces on the Andean mountain,Title
slopes for the arid valleys along the Pacific,Paragraph
Coast. The intent was purposeful. The newly,Paragraph
arriving farmers channeled the river waters,Paragraph
to grow cotton for the making of fishing,Paragraph
"nets, and gourds to be used as floats. But",Paragraph
they were not fishermen. The fishermen,Paragraph
"lived on the coast, and they traded with the",Paragraph
newly arriving agriculturalists in a way that,Paragraph
was mutually beneficial. It was a novel and,Paragraph
extraordinary arrangement that first took,Title
"place at what is now called Caral, about 200",Paragraph
kilometers north of Lima.,Paragraph
"2.3 Mnajdra Temple, Malta",Caption
he Zoser Mortuary Complex and the,Title
temples of Malta bring to the fore a way,Paragraph
of understanding the originating power of,Paragraph
architecture—as models. Today we tend to,Paragraph
think of models simply as practical devices,Title
used in the preparation of a design. Yet the,Paragraph
history of architecture is filled with structures,Title
that serve as built models. The Zoser,Paragraph
Mortuary Complex is entered through a portal,Paragraph
that leads past a corridor of colurnns painted,Paragraph
to look like gigantic reeds. The visitor literally,Paragraph
passed through a scaled-up model of the,Paragraph
"swampy shores of the Nile, symbolizing not",Paragraph
just the transition between life and renewal,Title
but also the difference between the human,Paragraph
and divine scales. Egyptians continued to,Paragraph
build such scaled-up models; their colurmns,Paragraph
"are all large models of flower bundles, richly",Paragraph
"painted and even emitting, in principle at",Paragraph
"2.2 Zoser Pyramid, Saqqara, Egypt",Caption
"least, a divine fragrance. Architecture as",Paragraph
"model is even more obvious in Malta, where",Paragraph
"the temples are models of caves, purposely",Paragraph
dark and mysterious. The Maltese also made,Paragraph
some of the earliest known representations,Paragraph
of buildings in history. The purpose of,Paragraph
"these small models, no more than a few",Paragraph
"centimeters across, is unknown, but it has",Paragraph
been suggested that they served as tokens,Paragraph
given to devotees after a visit. They were,Paragraph
more than trinkets; they were living pieces of,Paragraph
"the temple, which in turn was itself a living",Paragraph
"entity; thus, a model was a sure way to link",Paragraph
its owner to the life force of the temple. The,Paragraph
use of architecture as model remained a,Paragraph
key element of its core purpose. Even the,Paragraph
stepped structures of Caral are models of,Paragraph

The period around 2500 BCE was generally,Paragraph
one of expansion and prosperity throughout,Title
West Asia and the Indus. Certainly the cities,Paragraph
along the Ghaggar-Hakra River were being,Paragraph
"enlarged, and their builders became world",Paragraph
masters of hydrology. Burnt bricks were used,Paragraph
to construct huge platforms that served as,Paragraph
the bases for the cities and for defensive,Title
"walls, but also to control floodwaters. And",Paragraph
"most important, elaborate interconnected",Paragraph
drainage systerns were designed to disperse,Paragraph
storm waters. A central drain under the,Paragraph
main gate of Harappa still stands in place.,Paragraph
"lonetheless, the Indus flooded many times,",Paragraph
each flood burying the city under a thick,Paragraph
ayer of silt. Harappa was rebuilt at the same,Paragraph
spot at least eight times. It is thought to have,Paragraph
ad a population of about fifty thousand.,Paragraph
"There were also specialized cities, such",Paragraph
as a port and mining towns. Dholavira had to,Paragraph
solve a hydroengineering problem opposite of,Paragraph
Harappa's: Because the city sits in a very dry,Paragraph
"area, the issue was not keeping floodwater",Paragraph
"out, but ensuring that enough water could",Paragraph

was a Series of strategically located dams,Paragraph
that controlled water during a flood and,Paragraph
"also directed some of the water to huge,",Paragraph
"rectangular, shallow man-made lakes that",Paragraph
surrounded the city and that could be tapped,Paragraph

and administration of palace and temple. Though these,Paragraph
"cities seem small by today’s standards, at the time they",Paragraph

Memphis in Egypt. The economy of the Sumerians was,Paragraph
thus twofold: a northward-looking Mesopotamian-based,Paragraph
"one, and a southward-looking trade economy with the",Paragraph
measures that deliberately diminished the,Paragraph
power of local chieftains. This new concept,Paragraph
of kingship is expressed in the statue of a,Paragraph
"head representing an Akkadian ruler, found",Paragraph
in the city of Nineveh. It is notable for its bold,Paragraph
"features, artfully braided beard, and majesty",Paragraph
"of bearing. The mouth, from which the",Paragraph

Mesopotamia was now suddenly dependent,Paragraph
on kingdoms in the old Sumerian south. The,Paragraph
"Sumerians took up the challenge, drove the",Paragraph
"mountain people back, and reunited the",Paragraph
"realm under the kings of Ur. These kings,",Paragraph
"part of the Third Dynasty (2112-2004 BCE),",Paragraph

"cities along the Persian Gulf, such as those",Paragraph
"of the Elamites, but also perhaps with the",Paragraph
hundreds of cities in the upper Euphrates,Paragraph

region. The rulers of Ur defined kingship,Paragraph
as a privilege that descended from heaven,Paragraph

The political structure was thus a type of,Paragraph
theocratic socialism in which all the people,Title
worked in their various capacities—from,Paragraph
slave to priest—in the service of the city-,Paragraph
state. The chief god was Anu. Below him,Paragraph
"was Enlil, the earth or storm god, and Ea,",Paragraph
the water god whom we encountered in,Paragraph
"Eridu. Nanna, the moon god who ruled in",Paragraph
"Ur, was among a group of gods at a slightly",Paragraph
lower level. He measured tirne and provided,Paragraph
fertility. Senior members of the pantheon,Paragraph
"served as patron deities of individual cities,",Paragraph
while deities of lesser rank were associated,Paragraph
with smaller urban centers. There were over,Paragraph
three thousand other gods and demons,Title
that governed even inanimate objects like,Paragraph
pickaxes and brick molds. The flexibility with,Paragraph
which the minor gods and goddesses came,Paragraph
and went and syncretically changed their,Paragraph
names makes it difficult to be specific about,Paragraph
a Mesopotamian pantheon. Some of these,Paragraph
deities were shared across various regions;,Paragraph
some were part of local cults. This divine,Paragraph
population was thought to meet regularly in,Paragraph
an assembly and to arrive at agreements that,Paragraph
bound all deities to the more senior deities.,Paragraph
The ternple was the actual domicile of the,Paragraph
god rather than merely a place that permitted,Paragraph
contact between the ruled and the divine,Title
"powers, although one of the priests’ principal",Paragraph
"jobs was the interpretation of omens, which",Paragraph
had a powerful influence on every sphere of,Paragraph
activity in Sumerian society.,Paragraph
Mesopotamian religion was heavy in,Paragraph
superstitions and subscriptive behavior.,Paragraph
Life after death was portrayed as a sad and,Paragraph
"pitiable state, and the dead as potentially",Paragraph
hostile toward the living. Apart from rituals,Paragraph
"to appease the dead, burial architecture was",Paragraph
thus rare. A person's association with the,Paragraph
gods was based very much on the fulfillment,Paragraph
of his or her duties in the here and now and,Paragraph
on the principle of constant vigilance. For the,Paragraph

Ziggurat at Ur,Title
The Ziggurat at Ur was one of the most,Paragraph
"impressive structures of the time, and",Paragraph
remains of it are still extant at Tall al,Paragraph
"Mugayyar in lrag, about 42 kilometers south",Paragraph
of Babylon. Some reconstruction drawings,Caption
show it as a freestanding object similar to,Paragraph
an Egyptian pyramid; it was in actuality,Paragraph
surrounded by precinct walls to the east,Paragraph
within which was a large square-shaped,Paragraph
"sanctuary dedicated to Nanna’s divine wife,",Paragraph
Ningal. A law court was close by. The whole,Paragraph
was eventually enclosed by its own set of,Paragraph
defensive walls.,Paragraph
The ziggurat measured 65 meters by,Paragraph
"100 meters at its base, was 21 meters high,",Paragraph
"and consisted of three terraces, with the",Paragraph
sacred shrine on the highest one. Though,Paragraph
the ornamentation of the ziggurat cannot,Paragraph
"be confirmed, the building was not the",Paragraph
volumetric heap of bricks that we see today,Paragraph
in the 20th-century reconstruction.,Paragraph
300m,Title
Three monumental staircases rose up the,Paragraph
"northeast flank of the ziggurat, converging",Paragraph
at a canopied vestibule at the top of the first,Caption
"platform, 20 meters up from the ground.",Paragraph
"From there, the central stair continued on to",Paragraph
the next stage and then to the third. Though,Paragraph
"highly axial, the axis did not carry through to",Paragraph
the surrounding architecture. Access to the,Paragraph
court was not from the front but diagonally,Paragraph
from a gate at one of its corners. The plain,Paragraph
brick of the modern-day reconstruction can,Paragraph
give a misleading impression of the structure.,Paragraph
The sides would have been plastered,Paragraph
smooth and painted to serve as a visual key,Paragraph
"to a cosmological narrative, the principal",Paragraph
"character of which was Apsu, the god of",Paragraph
the primeval waters who fathered heaven,Title
"and earth. Despite his importance, he was",Paragraph
"defeated and killed by Ea, who transforrned",Paragraph
Apsu into still or stagnant subterranean,Title
"waters. The lowest terrace of the ziggurat,",Caption
"representing Apsu, was painted white. The",Paragraph
"next terrace, probably black, represented Ea",Paragraph
floating on and dominating the water. The,Paragraph
Mausoleum,Title
2.18 The Ziggurat at Ur within the temple complex of Nanna,Caption
"top level would have been red, representing",Paragraph
the sun-kindled air. The blue tiles that were,Paragraph
found on the site are thought to have come,Paragraph
"from the temple at the top, which would have",Paragraph
represented the blue heaven above the earth.,Paragraph
What made this structure so innovative is that,Paragraph
"the elements—the stairs, the platforms, and",Paragraph
the temple itsel—were no longer arranged,Paragraph
"as a geographical mass, as at Uruk, but were",Paragraph
brought into the embrace of a unified and,Paragraph
dramatic color-coded design. Geographical,Paragraph
simulation had been replaced by an,Paragraph
architectural abstraction.,Paragraph
The start of a construction of such a scale,Paragraph
was initiated by elaborate rituals in which the,Paragraph
king fashioned the first brick and carried up,Paragraph
the first basket of earth. This act of dedication,Paragraph
was commemorated by the burial of peg-,Paragraph
shaped copper figurines in the foundation.,Caption
The hard work was done by slaves taken,Paragraph
"from conquered lands, a common practice of",Paragraph
the time. The structure was made of square,Paragraph
flat bricks mortared with bitumen. Reed,Caption
matting soaked with bitumen was inserted,Paragraph
horizontally at various layers to add cohesion,Paragraph
and protect against vertical shear forces.,Paragraph
The bricks were stamped with an inscription,Paragraph
"reading “Ur-Nammu, king of Ur, who built the",Paragraph
temple of Nanna.”,Paragraph
That ziggurats served as symbolic,Paragraph
"conjugal sites is proven at Ur, where the",Paragraph
ziggurat was linked by a watercourse to a,Paragraph
small temple 6 kilometers west of the city,Paragraph
dedicated to the mother goddess Ninkhursag.,Caption
"She was represented by the cow, whereas",Paragraph
"Janna, the moon god who ruled over",Paragraph
"Ur, was sometimes referred to as a bull.",Paragraph
"Once a year, Ninkhursag, the Lady of the",Paragraph
"Mountain, whether embodied in statues or",Paragraph
"y a priestess, would have been brought to",Paragraph
the city in a procession and led up to the,Paragraph
shrine on top of the ziggurat to consummate,Paragraph
er marriage while sacrifices and chants,Title
proceeded outside. Similar notions exist in,Paragraph
"Hinduism and in ancient Greece, with the",Paragraph
"celebration of the mystic marriage, the hieros",Title
"gamos (from hiero, “sacred,” and gamos,",Paragraph
“marriage”). Ninkhursag thus represented,Paragraph
the older goddess tradition that had been,Paragraph
preserved and incorporated into the more,Paragraph
complex mythologies needed after the move,Title
into the Mesopotamian marshes.,Paragraph
"The city of Ur was almost oval in shape,",Paragraph
with the Euphrates River coursing around,Paragraph
its sides. There were harbors on its north,Paragraph
"and west sides, with the temple complex",Paragraph
clamped between them. The surrounding,Paragraph
"walls, as is the case in all Mesopotamian",Paragraph
"cities, were intended just as much to",Paragraph
impress as to protect. From their ramparts,Paragraph
one would have seen the vast stretches of,Paragraph
"cultivated fields in all directions, as well as",Paragraph
the villages of farm laborers tending them.,Paragraph
The presence of gardens and orchards near,Paragraph
the walls was also common. Much effort,Paragraph
was made in the design and outfitting of,Paragraph
"the gates, which were flanked by towers",Paragraph
whose tops were decorated with bands of,Paragraph
"shields. The visitor, upon entering through",Paragraph
"the gates, would immediately confront the",Paragraph
densely built-up jumble of the city. There,Paragraph
"was, however, little evidence of organized city",Paragraph
2.19 Massing of the Ziggurat at Ur,Caption
planning. Royal roads would be designed,Paragraph
only later. Streets varied from narrow lanes,Paragraph
to routes 2 to 3 meters wide and served,Paragraph
not only as passageways but also as a,Paragraph
"convenient place in which to dump garbage,",Paragraph
a practice that was still encountered even,Paragraph
in medieval Europe. Because windows were,Paragraph
"rare, the narrow lanes forrned curving chutes",Paragraph
punctuated only by doors or enlivened by,Paragraph
lean-tos where food or goods were sold.,Paragraph

Though later Egyptians described their early,Paragraph

basalt of Faiyurn—not to mention the various,Paragraph
types of soft sandstone brought downriver,Title

on a slight hill west of Memphis and just,Paragraph
"to the north of Saqqara, was enclosed by a",Paragraph
277-by-544-meter wall laid out in precise,Paragraph
orientation to the four cardinal points. The,Paragraph
walls were of white stone and rose to an,Paragraph
impressive 10.5 meters. They served the,Paragraph

the earliest monumental stone columns in the,Paragraph

"simulate a reed bundle, thus imposing on the",Paragraph
visitor the difference of scale that separates,Paragraph
the divine from the mortal world.,Paragraph
The shadowy entranceway led to the,Paragraph
south court in front of the step pyramid. This,Paragraph
"was the Sed festival court, where ceremonial",Paragraph
races were enacted. In the centuries before,Paragraph
"the Old Kingdom, the king had to prove",Paragraph
that he was strong and capable of ruling by,Paragraph
running a course for each of the provinces he,Paragraph
"governed. If he failed, he would be sacrificed",Paragraph
in a religious ritual. From this derives the,Paragraph
"name Sed, or “slaughter festival.” By the time",Paragraph
of the Old Kingdom this practice had died,Paragraph
"out, but it remained an important element",Paragraph
in the symbolic attributes of kingship. Zoser,Paragraph
conceived the complex as a review stand for,Paragraph
"this event, which lasted five days, ending with",Paragraph
a final ceremonial sprint. Originally it was to,Paragraph
be held for every king in the thirtieth year of,Paragraph
"his reign, but that was not always the case.",Paragraph
Ramesses || celebrated his Sed in grand style,Paragraph
by inviting foreign dignitaries.,Paragraph
PBR SS,Title
Since Zoser did not live long enough to,Paragraph
"perform this ritual, the court was designed",Paragraph
so that he could perform it in death.,Paragraph
his is confirmed by the complex’s two,Paragraph
"mastabas: one on the south side, next to",Caption
the wall—a type of fake mastaba—and the,Paragraph
"other, belonging to Zoser, to the north. The",Paragraph
two structures have almost identical tomb,Paragraph
"lesigns, a room at the bottom of a 28-meter-",Paragraph
leep shaft sealed by a 3-ton granite plug. In,Paragraph
"the southern mastaba, archaeologists found",Paragraph
the wall decorated with small blue tiles with,Paragraph
a glaze just as brilliant today as it was four,Paragraph
thousand years ago. The tiles represent a,Paragraph
reed matting set in stone posts designed to,Caption
"imitate the appearance of wood, the whole",Paragraph
thing creating the illusion of an outdoor,Paragraph
canopied room. Between the tile sections is,Paragraph
a large stone relief of Zoser “running” the,Caption
ceremonial race.,Paragraph
The northern mastaba was covered,Paragraph
with a stone superstructure with four gently,Paragraph
sloping steps. No sooner was that built than,Paragraph
it was decided that the structure should be,Paragraph
expanded yet again. It was transformed into a,Paragraph
"60-meter-high, six-tiered structure by adding",Paragraph
material in the northerly direction. The first,Paragraph
mortuary temple behind this step pyramid,Caption
was also rebuilt and expanded. To the east,Paragraph
"was another court, lined on both sides",Paragraph
"with chapels, one for each of the Egyptian",Paragraph
provinces. Behind them rose the facades,Paragraph
"of ten tall dummy buildings, replicating",Paragraph
a Be io for a,Title
2.25 Entrance hall to the Mortuary Complex of Zoser,Caption
"government buildings or, more likely,",Paragraph
"granaries. Slender colurnns, drawing on the",Caption
"imagery of reed bundles, ornamented their",Paragraph
surfaces. On their other side are engaged,Paragraph
columns with smooth-angled shafts holding,Paragraph
bell-shaped capitals modeled on the shape,Paragraph
of the papyrus flower. Like the reed-shaped,Paragraph
"columns, the papyrus also had symbolic",Paragraph
value. The north part of the cornplex was,Paragraph
dominated by a monumental altar to which,Paragraph
"offerings were brought each day, a metaphor",Paragraph
for the offering place of the northern heaven.,Paragraph
In a small chapel positioned against the north,Caption
side of the pyramid was a life-size statue of,Paragraph
"Zoser, showing him wearing a priest’s Sed",Paragraph
"festival cloak, a ceremonial beard, and a",Paragraph
"ritual headdress. Sitting in the dark chamber,",Paragraph
he gazes through two small holes in the,Paragraph
"wall placed at the statue's eye level, through",Paragraph
which he could watch the ceremonies taking,Paragraph
"place in the court. This is the Ka statue, and",Paragraph
"the structure was nothing without it, as it",Paragraph
embodied the still-living spirit of the king. The,Paragraph
statue had to be tended to and provided with,Paragraph
food and drink. Though a Ka statue might,Paragraph
"have been placed near the altar, others were",Paragraph
placed in the mortuary temple. If anything,Paragraph
"were to happen to the Ka statue, the spirit",Paragraph
of the deceased would never gain entrance,Paragraph
to the heavenly realm. The principle of living,Paragraph
ancestors is an ancient one and is common,Paragraph
to most cultures across Africa and Eurasia.,Paragraph

This building represents a shift in the idea of,Paragraph
death and its associated religious practices.,Paragraph
The low-lying mastabas of the pharaohs were,Paragraph
"no longer considered worthy of rulers, who",Paragraph
now ranked among the gods. In classical,Paragraph
"Egyptian, the word for tomb actually meant",Paragraph
"a “house of eternity” or, more precisely, a",Paragraph
“house for eternity.” The pyramids were,Paragraph
"certainly built for eternity, but they were now",Paragraph
"defined differently, as “the place where one",Paragraph
"ascends.” And this might explain the steps,",Paragraph
since that was a literal form of the Egyptian,Paragraph
"glyph, namely a set of giant steps.",Paragraph
"After Zoser, the pharaonic institution",Paragraph
began to assert its cosmological narrative,Paragraph
with ever-greater force and precision. One,Paragraph
of the places where this manifests is a cult,Paragraph
center for the falcon-god Menthu not far from,Caption
"Medamud, a provincial town 5 kilometers",Paragraph
northeast of Karnak at Thebes. The,Paragraph
"sanctuary, which dates frorn about 2500 BCE,",Paragraph
consisted of a roughly lozenge-shaped,Paragraph
"enclosure 83 meters at its widest, surrounded",Paragraph
by a high wall with a gate to the east. The,Paragraph

was the step-faced pyramid at Meidum.,Paragraph
The location of the two tomb chambers was,Paragraph
innovative. Separated horizontally in the Zoser,Paragraph

Snefru abandoned the building after fifteen,Paragraph

Dahshur. Originally planned to be a towering,Paragraph
"150 meters high, it was too bold, and the",Paragraph
ground gave way under part of it. In an effort,Paragraph
"to save the building, the designers added a",Paragraph
kink or bend to reduce the weight and angle,Paragraph

the Bent Pyramid.,Paragraph

The failure forced Snefru to ask his builders,Paragraph
to return to the Step Pyramid at Meidum.,Paragraph
They added a layer that transformed it into a,Paragraph

"preparation of the ground. (In Roman times,",Paragraph
the stone facing was removed to be made,Paragraph
into stucco. Hence it is possible to see the,Paragraph

Snefru. He constructed a third pyramid,Paragraph
two miles north of the Bent Pyramid. Not,Paragraph

Red Pyramid because of the reddish cast of,Paragraph
the stone. This is where Snefru is actually,Paragraph
buried. Construction was so well thought,Paragraph
out that despite the weight of the 2 million,Paragraph

The structure of Stonehenge as we see it,Paragraph
today is in fact a combination of the last two,Paragraph
phases of its several revisions and dates from,Paragraph
"between 2500 and 1800 BCE, making it more",Paragraph
or less contemporary with Ur in Mesopotamia,Paragraph
and the end of the age of pyramids in Egypt.,Paragraph
This is important because there is a tendency,Paragraph
"to overstate the primitivism of Stonehenge,",Paragraph
when in actuality it was an advanced Bronze,Paragraph
"Age structure. Furthermore, Stonehenge",Paragraph
must be contextualized as the last in a,Paragraph
line of such artificially enhanced sacred,Paragraph
"landscapes, a history that stretched back at",Paragraph
least two thousand years. Newgrange was,Paragraph
a similar site in that it was an important,Paragraph
"regional ceremonial attractor, but it dates",Paragraph
to a thousand years before Stonehenge.,Paragraph
"Today, because Stonehenge is isolated in the",Paragraph
"landscape, it is difficult to visualize the area",Paragraph
as a sacred landscape. In the immediate,Paragraph
"area, hundreds of burial mounds would have",Paragraph
"been visible, sorne dating back to the fourth",Paragraph
millennium BCE.,Paragraph
"2.38 Plan: Stonehenge, ca. 2500 BCE",Caption
“aHeel stone,Title
"The first version of Stonehenge, dating to",Paragraph
"about 3000 BCE, was consistent with the",Paragraph
"circular henges of that age, except that",Paragraph
this one was an impressive 100 meters,Paragraph
"across, with two or perhaps three spaces",Paragraph
left open for access to the inside of the,Paragraph
circle. Two alignments were built into it:,Paragraph
"one astronomical, at the northeast entrance",Caption
"toward the northernmost rising of the moon,",Paragraph
and the other to the cardinal point to the,Paragraph
south at the other causeway.,Paragraph
"Around 2500 BCE, the Beaker People",Paragraph
transformed Stonehenge from a local temple,Paragraph
to a focal point for a larger civilizational entity.,Paragraph
They filled the area for miles around with,Paragraph
their circular burial mounds and founded,Paragraph
"a new city to the northeast of Stonehenge,",Paragraph
"now called Durrington Walls, which was",Paragraph
defended by circular defensive walls 480,Paragraph
meters across. Their wealth shows up in their,Paragraph
"graves. In one grave, archaeologists found",Paragraph
gold ornaments as well as bronze pins from,Paragraph
"Bohemia, blue faience beads from Egypt, and",Paragraph
amber beads frorn northern Europe.,Paragraph
At the center of the Beaker People’s,Caption
cosmology was a connection between,Paragraph
the smelting of ore and the sun. For this,Paragraph
"reason they had to redesign Stonehenge,",Paragraph
transforming its orientation from the moon,Paragraph
to the sun. To do this they rotated the axis,Paragraph
an almost imperceptible 3 degrees eastward,Paragraph
to coincide with the rising midsummer,Paragraph
2.39 Reorientation of Stonehenge by the Beaker People,Caption
"sun, according to the research of Gerald",Paragraph
S. Hawkins in collaboration with John B.,Paragraph
White. The Beaker People also imposed,Paragraph
four large stones that point to summer and,Paragraph
winter risings and settings. Though the,Paragraph
precise nature of how the stones worked is,Paragraph
"in dispute, Stonehenge's latitude, as it turns",Paragraph
"out, is the only one in Europe where this",Paragraph
combination is even possible.,Paragraph
The most significant change attributed to,Paragraph
the Beaker People was the addition of a ring,Paragraph
of sixty large bluestones to the interior. The,Paragraph
"stones are not actually blue; they are a dark,",Paragraph
"eavy, medium-grained rock, harder than",Paragraph
"granite. The Beaker People also constructed,",Paragraph
"about 1 kilometer north of Stonehenge, what",Paragraph
archaeologists call a cursus—a 3-kilorneter-,Paragraph
"long, 100-meter-wide rectangular form,",Paragraph
slightly beveled at the ends. Created by,Paragraph
"incising a ditch into the landscape, it lies",Paragraph
in an east-west orientation. Though simply,Paragraph
"uilt, it is laid out with great precision. Its",Paragraph
"purpose is unknown, even though there are",Paragraph
"other cursi scattered across the region, some",Paragraph
predating the arrival of the Beaker People.,Paragraph
"t certainly was not a running track, as the",Paragraph
name unfortunately implies. One can surmise,Paragraph
that since the eastern sector was associated,Paragraph
with the sunrise and the western side with,Paragraph
"the sunset, the cursus played an important",Paragraph
part in the ritual expressions of life and,Paragraph
death. Was it a pathway for the soul?,Paragraph

No sooner had the Beaker People completed,Title
"their work, around 2300 BCE, than",Paragraph
Stonehenge underwent yet another and,Paragraph
even more impressive transformation. The,Paragraph
new designers were working at the behest,Paragraph
of a culture represented by chieftains whose,Paragraph
numerous cemeteries were added to the,Paragraph
landscape around Stonehenge. Their origin,Paragraph
is even more mysterious than that of the,Paragraph
Beaker People. The new overlords removed,Paragraph
the bluestones and added the now famous,Paragraph
"Sarsen Ring of trilithons, sarsen being the",Paragraph
name of the local sandstone boulders. The,Paragraph
"ring, 33 meters across, was composed of",Paragraph
thirty enormous stones with an average,Paragraph
weight of 26 tons. The transportation of,Paragraph
the blocks from a site 30 kilometers away,Title
would have been a feat in itself. Particularly,Paragraph
noteworthy was the e,Title
preparation of the stot,Title
and using stone mau,Title

"were done, the posts measured 4.1 meters",Paragraph

They were surmounted by thirty 6- to 7-ton,Paragraph
intels that formed a continuous circle around,Paragraph
the top.,Paragraph
wt,Title
"2.40 Plan: Stonehenge, ca. 2200 BCE",Caption
The precision was remarkable. The tops of,Paragraph
"the lintels, once they were in place, never",Paragraph
varied more than 10 centimeters from the,Paragraph
horizontal. Such carefully worked stone is not,Paragraph
"typical of other English henges, where stones",Paragraph
"were usually left natural, perhaps because",Paragraph
"they were seen as possessing a magical,",Paragraph
chthonic presence. The Sarsen Ring was,Paragraph
"architecture of a particular type, for it was in",Paragraph
reality something akin to carpentry in stone.,Paragraph
Possibly the designers were replicating in,Paragraph
"stone a wooden prototype, or perhaps they",Paragraph
were seeking to enhance the power of the,Paragraph
stone structure by embodying in it the more,Paragraph
familiar techniques of woodworking.,Paragraph
In the final phase of Stonehenge’s,Paragraph
"transformation, some of the bluestones that",Paragraph
had been removed were brought back to,Paragraph
"the site, with some being erected within",Paragraph
the Sarsen Ring and others placed in a,Paragraph
horseshoe configuration. Such a horseshoe,Paragraph
"was uncommon in England, but occurred",Paragraph
more frequently across the channel in,Paragraph

"as rollers, but these ruts do not lead to the",Paragraph

The interior spaces of the ternples were,Paragraph

"chambers, the surfaces of which were",Paragraph
sometimes finished with plaster and then,Paragraph
painted. The spaces between the outer and,Paragraph

The earliest temple on the Maltese,Caption
"archipelago is Ggantija, part of a cluster of",Paragraph
temples situated on the island of Gozo. Used,Caption
"continuously for hundreds of years, it dates",Paragraph
"to around 3500 BCE. It was a double temple,",Paragraph
nearly 30 meters long. The temple had a floor,Paragraph
of crushed limestone slurry that formed a,Paragraph
"hard, concrete-like surface. The portals from",Paragraph
chamber to chamber were huge post-and-,Paragraph
lintel configurations of megalithic stones. The,Paragraph
exterior was monumental and simple. The,Paragraph
core cloverleaf configuration to the west was,Paragraph
built first. Two more lobed chambers were,Paragraph
"then added along its entry passage. Later,",Paragraph
a second temple was built adjacent to the,Paragraph
first and enclosed within the original mound.,Paragraph
The reasons are unclear. Perhaps the local,Paragraph
population expanded and exceeded the,Paragraph
original temple's capacity. Perhaps a plentiful,Paragraph
harvest year prompted the farmers to renew,Paragraph
their thanks to the earth goddess. Whatever,Paragraph
"the reason, generations of Maltese continued",Paragraph

"the western uplands of the Amazon, and",Paragraph

it holds the key to the transformations that,Paragraph
were to take place first in Peru and then in,Paragraph
Mesoamerica. The rain forests were home to,Paragraph
"an astonishing variety of plants and animals,",Paragraph
making them an important incubator of,Paragraph
"human social networks. People formed tribes,",Paragraph
and developed a slash-and-burn gardening,Paragraph
"technique to better harness cashew, cocoa,",Paragraph
"and Brazil nuts, as well as the all-important",Paragraph
"manioc, used to make bread, soups, and",Paragraph
fermented drinks. The process began slowly,Paragraph
"around 10,000 BCE as the rain forests began",Paragraph
to expand. Groups pushed higher and higher,Paragraph
"into the mountains, where they encountered",Paragraph
"the potato, maybe around 5000 BCE. These",Paragraph
"people are not considered agriculturalists,",Paragraph
"however, because as far as we know they did",Paragraph
"not develop irrigation, one of the elements",Paragraph
associated with agriculture. That changed,Paragraph
"around 3000 BCE, when a group of intrepid",Paragraph
farmers settled in a high Andean valley that,Paragraph
"still today seems impossibly arid and remote,",Paragraph
and began a farming community there based,Paragraph
on irrigation. Using the slope of the valley to,Paragraph
"their advantage, they tapped the stream and",Paragraph
fed the water horizontally to garden plots.,Paragraph
"Their method worked, and soon the dusty",Paragraph
valley was turned into a gardener’s paradise.,Paragraph
Such activities were never just “farming” but,Paragraph
were part of a sacred landscape; and it is,Paragraph
now known how that landscape was defined.,Paragraph
Archaeologists call the place La Galgada—,Paragraph
"and the settlement was no casual affair, but",Paragraph
organized around a powerful family clan and,Paragraph
its sharnanistic leaders. And to emphasize,Paragraph
2.49 Galgada ruins today,Caption
"the authority of the clan lineage, the elders",Paragraph
over time developed a unique architectural,Paragraph
"form, an ancestor mound. The clan leaders,",Paragraph
"who were also probably shamans, met in",Paragraph
"something akin to a sweat lodge, a flat-",Paragraph
topped chamber that could hold about,Paragraph
"fifteen people. The idea of sweat lodges,",Paragraph
"a widespread phenomenon, developed in",Paragraph
Siberia and was brought to the Americas by,Paragraph
"its ancient settlers. At Galgada, when the",Paragraph
"chief died, he was ritually wrapped in a fetus",Paragraph
"position and buried in the lodge, which was",Paragraph
then mounded over and a new one built on,Paragraph
"top. Over the centuries, the mound grew",Paragraph
higher and higher in the shape of a stepped,Paragraph
mound. Its surface was plastered and,Paragraph
probably painted red.,Paragraph
Though the history of agriculture is often,Paragraph
"told as a story of Peru, it is really a story of",Paragraph
"the Amazonians, who, with their thousands of",Paragraph
"years of experience, took the step to what we",Paragraph
call agriculture by moving into the mountains,Paragraph
and developing irrigation and controlled,Title
farming.,Paragraph
Caral,Title
The experiment at Galgada was such,Paragraph
that soon other groups were setting out,Paragraph
to transform mountains into farmscapes.,Paragraph
The most ambitious group tackled what,Paragraph
might seem an almost impossible task—to,Paragraph
transform the uninhabitable coastal Peruvian,Title
desert into a fertile plain. The shores had,Paragraph
supported fishing communities for thousands,Title
of years. The fishing here is among the best,Paragraph
"in the world, but these fishing communities",Paragraph
"were isolated, and could only trade north",Paragraph
and south. Enter the highlanders who,Paragraph
"arrived at the Supe River floodplain, and in",Paragraph
a few decades made it into Peru's first great,Paragraph
"agricultural center. Known as Caral, it was",Paragraph
first settled around 2600 BCE. The farmers,Paragraph
"brought with them two plants in particular,",Paragraph
plants that they knew the fishermen would,Paragraph
need—cotton and the gourd. Cotton was,Paragraph
"needed for fishing nets, and the gourds",Paragraph
"served as floats. In essence, the farmers",Paragraph
supplied the fishermen with advanced,Paragraph
"equipment, and in return got fish. It was",Paragraph
"a brilliant arrangement, but it required a",Paragraph

INTRODUCTION,Title
How much different our world would be today,Title
had the carmel and horse not existed. The impact,Paragraph
"of the camel was felt first. Traditionally, the great",Paragraph
economic centers had all relied on boats or,Paragraph
oxcarts as the primary means of transport. With,Paragraph
"the camel, traders could now cross the deserts",Paragraph
and mountains that stretch thousands of miles,Paragraph
east and west and cut Asia into separate north,Title
and south regions. By the middle of the second,Paragraph
"millennium BCE, caravans with as many as six",Paragraph
hundred animals were plying trade routes across,Paragraph
the desert plains. The first place to monetize this,Paragraph
trade was a city called Mari. Located in modern-,Paragraph
"day Syria on the western bank of the Euphrates,",Paragraph
it flourished as a trade center and city-state from,Paragraph
2900 BCE until 1759 BCE. It was located halfway,Paragraph
between the Persian Gulf and the upland reaches,Title
"of the river. In other words, it was designed as",Paragraph
a short cut to the Mediterranean and thus was,Paragraph
perfectly sited to collect and distribute goods.,Paragraph
But this was not a city in the conventional old-,Paragraph
Mesopotamian sense. It did not really produce,Paragraph
"anything but instead was an entrepét city, a",Paragraph
transshipment hub of the third millennium. That,Paragraph
the city was a perfect circle makes sense.,Paragraph
"The palace, thought to have been built by King",Paragraph
"Zimri-Lim (r. 1779-1757 BCE), had at its core",Paragraph
"a vast rectangular throne room, at the entrance",Caption
of which was a statue of a maiden holding a jug,Paragraph
of water from which water actually poured. It,Paragraph
was meant to impress the visitor that here in the,Paragraph
"desert, water could be poured away. Behind the",Paragraph
"throne room, protected by a guardroom, were",Paragraph
special storage areas where the king kept his,Paragraph
most precious items. Nearby was an area for,Paragraph
the bureaucrats who recorded what went in and,Paragraph
out of the city. Contrast Eridu with Mari: the first,Paragraph
was a ritual center designed for the agricultural,Paragraph
production of surplus and dependent on an,Paragraph
exchange economy primarily through boats,Title
"(canals and seaports) and oxcarts, whereas the",Paragraph
latter was dependent on the rapid turnover of,Paragraph
"goods. More than 25,000 tablets in the Mari",Paragraph
"archives have survived, including economic",Paragraph
reports and juridical texts. The records describe,Paragraph
an astonishing abundance of material and food,Paragraph
"going through the city, including prized spices",Paragraph
"such as coriander, cumin, saffron, and cloves;",Paragraph
"and even ice, a luxury item imported from the far-",Paragraph
off mountains. The records also show that things,Paragraph
did not always go smoothly. Letters describe the,Paragraph
difficulties of moving a massive shipment of some,Paragraph

At least a dozen temples were built over a,Paragraph

Thebes had been used as a burial site since,Paragraph

expansions and transformations until the 5th,Title
century BCE.,Paragraph
At the ritual core of all of this construction,Paragraph
"was a simple, small chamber in the Karnak",Paragraph

Some sixty festivals were celebrated in,Paragraph
Thebes annually. Some took place within the,Paragraph
temple confines; others involved moving cult,Paragraph
images from temple to temple. The three,Caption
most important of these traveling festivals,Title
"involved Amun; his wife, Mut, the Egyptian",Paragraph
"mother goddess; and Mut's son, Khonsu, the",Paragraph
lunar deity.,Paragraph
1. Preeminent was the Opet (“secret,Caption
chamber”) festival during which the statues,Paragraph
"of Amun, Khonsu, and Mut were escorted",Paragraph
from Karnak to the Temple of Luxor. At a,Paragraph
"particular moment during the events, the",Paragraph
deity “spoke” to confirm the legitirnacy of the,Paragraph
king. The god's legitimization of the king was,Paragraph
reciprocated by gifts to the temple from the,Paragraph
royal family. The festival took place during,Paragraph
"Akhet (roughly our September), the season",Paragraph
"when the Nile flooded, and lasted for eleven",Paragraph
"days, but as time progressed, the number",Paragraph
of festival days grew. The journey from,Paragraph
Karnak to Luxor was made over land along,Paragraph
a processional street; the return journey was,Paragraph
made along the Nile by boat.,Paragraph
2. The Beautiful Feast of the Valley,Caption
coincided with a celebration of the dead in,Paragraph
"which Amun, Mut, and Khonsu would travel",Paragraph
to the western shore to visit the gods of the,Paragraph
West and the deified dead kings. The festival,Paragraph
came to be associated with renewal and,Paragraph
regeneration. It occurred during the second,Paragraph

"Apart from the living ancestors, there were",Paragraph
an assortment of nature deities with various,Paragraph

It was during the Shang period that there,Paragraph
is the first clear evidence of the rise of cities,Paragraph
in China. They dominated the great northern,Paragraph
"plain that was enclosed on the north, west,",Paragraph

to the sea on its eastern rim. The Huang,Paragraph
River and its tributaries flowed through the,Paragraph
plain from the mountains in the west. In,Paragraph
"those days, the eastern parts consisted of",Paragraph
"extensive marshes, and the coastline was",Paragraph
farther west than it is today. But the middle,Paragraph
"zone, well watered and with fertile soil, was",Paragraph
an excellent place for agricultural exploitation.,Paragraph
It comprises a territory known as the Middle,Paragraph
"Plain. In this, Chinese urbanism began in a",Paragraph
way that was fundamentally different from,Paragraph
"in Mesopotamia, where cities began as",Paragraph
risky endeavors in the marshes. They were,Paragraph
"dependent on extensive irrigation techniques,",Paragraph
and their power could rise and fall with the,Paragraph
next flood. The first Chinese cities were built,Paragraph
"in much less stressful situations, and the",Paragraph
Chinese did not yet have extensive irrigation.,Paragraph
These cities were at their core ceremonial,Paragraph
"centers for the elite, and for the construction",Paragraph

important difference between these early,Paragraph
Chinese cities and their Mesopotamian,Title

"they contained, either inside the walls or",Paragraph
"nearby, workshop districts where the artisans",Paragraph

"friction there was between centers, if any, is",Paragraph
"not known. The people, as would have been",Paragraph

"from the highlands, and the wood used for",Paragraph
roofs and doorways came from a tree that,Paragraph

Between the two structures are several large,Paragraph

"The valley contains a most unusual building,",Paragraph

roughly square rooms packed into a large,Paragraph
rectangular building about 150 meters,Caption
"long, with a courtyard in its center. The",Paragraph
organization of the roorns is complex. The,Paragraph
"structure, symmetrical around both axes,",Paragraph
consists of four approximately equivalent,Paragraph
quadrants. Three large spaces define its,Paragraph
"dominant central axis, with smaller rooms to",Paragraph
the sides. There are no shared walls between,Paragraph
"the room units. The units, each with walls",Paragraph
"about 2 meters thick, were constructed as",Paragraph
"if they were freestanding elements, even",Paragraph
when placed next to one another. In some,Paragraph
instances there no usable space between,Paragraph

are separated by corridors. There is also a,Paragraph
substantial increase in the elevation of room,Caption
floors as one moves away from the center.,Paragraph
he floor level of the corner rooms is 4,Caption
meters higher than the floor of the central,Paragraph
court. There can be no doubt that the rooms,Paragraph
"held important commodities, since access to",Paragraph
the various rooms was regulated by wooden,Paragraph
gates and bar closures. The rooms are not,Paragraph
freely interconnected; most of the large,Paragraph
rooms are accessible only from the two large,Paragraph
"3.68 Reconstruction: Huaca A, near Casma, Peru",Caption
"entrance lobbies. Similarly, the smaller rooms",Paragraph
can be accessed only through a carefully,Paragraph
designed system of corridors. The building,Caption
was Clearly meant to impress. Ascending the,Paragraph
"central staircase, one enters an atrium and",Paragraph
is immediately confronted by an enormous,Paragraph
"frieze of a pair of felines, 10 meters long and",Caption
"about 6 meters tall, facing each other across",Paragraph
the entrance. The three-dimensional aspect,Paragraph
of the animals would have been enhanced,Paragraph
by the curvature of the atrium’s walls. A,Paragraph
"low bench, 120 centimeters wide and 25",Paragraph
"centimeters high, further accentuates the",Paragraph

discourage too close an approach. It seems,Paragraph
"that the building was a sacred storehouse,",Paragraph
given that the remains of a variety of plant,Paragraph
"foods such as peanuts, beans, and tubers",Paragraph
were found in the niches. And since other,Paragraph

THE OLMECS,Title
"In the Americas, by 7000 BCE a huge",Paragraph
assortment of plants had come into being,Paragraph
that required little more than rudimentary,Paragraph
plant-tending to harvest. Arnong these were,Paragraph
"the potato, peanuts, cacao, beans, manioc,",Paragraph
"squash, and avocado. Nowhere else in the",Paragraph
world did such a wide variety of plants appear,Paragraph
in such close geographical proximity. Milling,Paragraph
stones appeared along the southwest coast in,Paragraph
"Belize and in northeast Mexico. By 3000 BCE,",Paragraph
"hoes start to appear in Gulf Coast sites, and",Paragraph
in Oaxaca and Puebla the first indications,Paragraph
of settlements and village life emerge. The,Paragraph
agricultural revolution had begun. If the,Paragraph
people of the contemporaneous Mississippi,Title
culture had seemed affluent compared to,Paragraph
"their neighbors of the open plains, even they",Paragraph
would have been amazed had they traveled,Paragraph
to Mexico and seen the tended garden fields.,Paragraph
It might seem counterintuitive that in a,Paragraph
land where so many different foods were,Paragraph
so easily available that these same people,Paragraph
would master the production of corn. Unlike,Paragraph
"wheat, barley, and rice, which in their edible",Paragraph
forms are relatively similar to their wild,Paragraph
"forms, corn was the product of hundreds of",Paragraph
years of genetic development. It seems that,Paragraph
this took place in the area that straddles,Paragraph
"the El Salvador—Guatemala border, where a",Paragraph
wild grass known as teosinte grows. What,Paragraph
"attracted people to the plant is not known,",Paragraph
since it is inedible. Perhaps it was discovered,Paragraph
that the seeds could be “popped” when,Paragraph
roasted. This might have had some ritualistic,Paragraph
significance that focused growers on,Paragraph
perfecting the plant until it finally yielded corn,Paragraph
"in the modern sense. At any rate, it is clear",Paragraph
that that corn was not merely a plant—it was,Paragraph
"a god, which mean that planting corn was not",Paragraph
only an agricultural process but a theological,Paragraph
"one. Soon, certainly before 1000 BCE, it was",Paragraph
discovered that soaking the corn in lime or,Paragraph
ash softened the kernels and allowed the,Paragraph
pods to be made into cornmeal. The process,Paragraph
created significant nutritional advantages over,Paragraph
untreated maize.,Paragraph
"4.3 Trade in the Americas, ca. 800 BCE",Caption
Corn came in different types and sizes and,Paragraph
was used in a variety of cuisines. One type,Paragraph
was used for cornmeal; another for roasting;,Paragraph
"another for hominy, a type of grits; and yet",Paragraph
"another for bread. For corn bread, the corn",Paragraph
was grated from the cob and made into a,Paragraph
milky mush—which could also be combined,Paragraph
with bean meal—and was slowly baked until,Paragraph
it became a type of cake. Some types of corn,Paragraph
"were best when preserved, which was done",Paragraph
in the sun or over a fire. Corn could also be,Paragraph
used to make a fermented drink.,Paragraph
"4.4 A fired-clay Toltec votive vessel with an image of corn priest, dedicated to Xilonen,",Caption
"the Aztec goddess of maize, from around 1500 ce",Paragraph
It was the Olmecs who set in play the corn-,Paragraph
centric worldview that would become the,Paragraph
marker of civilization in the Americas. They,Paragraph
"did so by making a risky move, leaving the",Paragraph
wet forests for uninhabited marshes on the,Paragraph
east coast of Mexico. The only wildlife of,Paragraph
any size in these swampy areas were turtles,Paragraph
and birds. The Olmecs’ decision to build in,Paragraph
"stone was even more extraordinary, since",Paragraph
the massive stones that they used had to,Paragraph
be dragged for many kilometers from the,Paragraph
"mountains to the north. Two elements were,",Paragraph
"however, in their favor: One was salt from",Paragraph
"the shore, which they processed and used",Paragraph
to trade for many things they needed. They,Paragraph
"also had bitumen from various oil seeps,",Paragraph
which was useful to make watertight baskets,Paragraph
and boats. It might be a stretch to compare,Paragraph
the situation to the modern-day difference,Title
"between a family farrn and a corporate one,",Paragraph
"but holding this difference in mind, even in",Paragraph
"general terms, helps illurninate the drarna set",Paragraph
in play by the Olmecs. This was no gradual,Paragraph
expansion of plant-tending lifestyles; it was a,Paragraph
purposeful industrialization of the landscape.,Paragraph
This means that the Olmecs settled in the,Paragraph
region specifically to transform it from swamp,Paragraph
"to a corn-producing center, controlled by",Paragraph
a cult of powerful personalities who were,Paragraph
"probably part shaman, part deity, and part",Paragraph
ruler.,Paragraph
4.5 A characteristic motif of Olmec,Caption
"art was the were-jaguar, a human face",Paragraph
with the mouth of a jaguar,Title
The religious life of the Olmecs centered,Title
"on sacred caves, springs, and volcanoes.",Paragraph
"The volcano, a symbol frequently used in",Paragraph
"Olmec imagery, was associated with the",Paragraph
world being born from below but was also,Paragraph
"viewed as the home of the storm clouds,",Paragraph
"lightning, and rain. It was depicted as a",Paragraph
dragon with a gaping mouth representing,Title
the portal to the underworld. The sky was,Paragraph
ruled by a bird monster or sun god whose,Paragraph
energy powered the cosmos and made,Title
"the plants grow. Underneath the dragon,",Paragraph
the Olmecs visualized a watery void out,Paragraph
of which the world was formed. The main,Paragraph
"deity in their mythology was the rain god,",Paragraph
"depicted as a jaguar, a shamanistic symbol",Paragraph
of transformation. This jaguar could assume,Paragraph
other forms—even human ones. The sexual,Paragraph
union of a woman and a jaguar gave birth to,Paragraph
a special class of gods that were represented,Paragraph
"in sculpture as having toothless gums, fangs,",Paragraph
"a snarling mouth, and a cleft head. The",Paragraph
Olmecs learned to drag and float stones and,Paragraph
columns of up to 40 tons over a distance,Paragraph
of 160 kilometers. Most were chiseled into,Paragraph
jaguars or human heads by Olmec sculptors.,Caption
Unlike the angular and sharp features of,Paragraph
"the sculpture of later civilizations, the Olmec",Paragraph
"heads were round, soft, and very lifelike.",Paragraph
They were also quite large—some of them,Paragraph
over 3 meters high.,Paragraph
"4.6 Colossal monolithic head uncovered at San Lorenzo, Mexico",Caption
Ball playing was an important element of,Paragraph
"Olmec ritual, as evidenced by clay figures",Paragraph
showing players wearing heavy leather belts,Title
and possibly headgear. It seems that the ball,Paragraph
"players also wore mirrors, giving us some",Paragraph
indication of the magical nature of the games.,Paragraph
Balls ranged from 10 to 22 cm and were,Paragraph
"heavy, 3 or 4 kilograms. In a modern-day",Paragraph
game known as u/ama that is played in some,Paragraph
"Mesoamerican villages, the play resembles a",Paragraph
"net-less volleyball, with each team confined",Paragraph
to one half of the court. The ball is hit back,Paragraph
and forth using only the hips until one tearn,Paragraph
fails to return it or the ball leaves the court.,Paragraph
But why the games were held and what they,Paragraph
signified is not known. Were they to defuse,Paragraph

San Lorenzo and La Venta,Title
The site of San Lorenzo (founded around,Paragraph
"1300 BCE), named after a nearby modern",Paragraph
"village, is located in the lower reaches of",Paragraph
the Coatzacoalcos River. It was on a hill,Paragraph
overlooking a large agricultural floodplain.,Paragraph
The highest point of the hill was landscaped,Paragraph
to create a plateau covering an area of about,Paragraph
7 square kilometers and resembling in plan,Paragraph
the shape of a bird. Though the wooden,Paragraph
and thatch architecture has long since,Paragraph
"disappeared, the use of basaltic stones,",Paragraph
"brought from the distant Tuxtla Mountains,",Paragraph
"for steps, columns, and aqueducts gives a",Paragraph
vivid picture of the scale and grandeur of,Paragraph
Olmec skills. The main ceremonial complex,Paragraph
consisted of a series of earth platform,Paragraph
mounds arranged north-south in a series of,Paragraph
courts.,Paragraph
Though the mounds are not aligned,Paragraph
"according to a single design, huge monolithic",Paragraph
heads stood in the middle of the courts.,Paragraph
The central court also had a series of cut-,Paragraph
"stone cisterns that, given their location and",Paragraph
"drainage system, must have had had ritual",Paragraph
purpose. One can assume that sites for a,Paragraph
city in this era were not chosen for purely,Paragraph

economic purposes. San Lorenzo was a ritual,Paragraph
"site, but what made it so special compared",Paragraph
to other locations on the plateau? According,Paragraph
"to one argument, it was the only place along",Paragraph
the river where the sunset aligned with the,Paragraph
volcano Cerro Zempoaltepec at the winter,Title
solstice.,Paragraph
"For unknown reasons, San Lorenzo went",Paragraph
into decline. Many of the great colossal heads,Paragraph
that had been so laboriously brought to the,Paragraph
site were rolled down into the ravines that,Paragraph
divide the edges of the terrace and were,Paragraph
carefully covered up; within a generation,Paragraph
"or two, the jungle had totally reclaimed the",Paragraph
site. It is unknown whether this was done to,Paragraph
ritualistically deactivate the site or for other,Paragraph
reasons.,Paragraph
A new center had by then already been,Paragraph
"built and prepared, and perhaps the priests",Paragraph
of that center were eager to be the solitary,Paragraph
overlords of the region. It is known as La,Paragraph
Venta and is 80 kilometers northeast of,Paragraph
San Lorenzo and closer to the shore of the,Title
Gulf of Mexico. La Venta was perhaps the,Paragraph
first use of symmetry in the overall design,Paragraph

appearing to be oriented to the summer,Paragraph

"an unusual fluted, conical shape (although",Paragraph
this could have been caused by subsequent,Paragraph
erosion). It was not just the symmetry of the,Paragraph
composition that was new. The designers,Paragraph

"laboriously cut and hauled from Niltepec, sorne 180",Paragraph
kilometers to the south across the Tehuantepec Gap.,Paragraph
"La Venta, like San Lorenzo before it, was a place",Paragraph

Sacred landscapes had historically been deeply,Paragraph

there was no such deep tradition. Here the sacred was,Paragraph
The site thus revolved around the concepts,Paragraph
of the timeless repetition of life and death.,Paragraph
But how the Olmecs experienced this is,Paragraph
conjecture. Was a yearly festival celebrated,Paragraph
here? Was the site a type of religious,Paragraph
"sanctuary used only by initiates? Regardless,",Paragraph
the site was a man-made spiritual landscape,Paragraph
designed to serve both as a pilgrimage site,Paragraph
and as a massive energizer that would keep,Paragraph
the corn fields productive.,Paragraph
Most astonishing of all were several large,Paragraph
buried plazas that constituted offerings in,Paragraph
"their own right, made up of hundreds of tons",Paragraph

imbricated with colored clays. Archaeologists,Caption
speculate that they were created as effigies of,Paragraph
a female life-force taking the form of artificial,Paragraph

CHAVIN DE HUANTAR,Title
"By 800 BCE, the innovative Peruvian shore",Paragraph
civilizations at Casma and Supe valleys had,Paragraph
gone into decline and were conquered by,Paragraph
"invaders, probably frorn the highlands; no",Paragraph
one knows for sure. The rise and decline,Paragraph
of these civilizations within a relatively short,Paragraph
"time, along with the militarization of society,",Paragraph
must have had a powerful impact on the,Paragraph
psyche of the times and seems to have led,Paragraph
to a shift in ideological focus. Power shifted,Paragraph
to centers away from the coast to the rugged,Paragraph
"highlands, the most important of which was",Paragraph
"Chavin de Huantar, founded around 900 BCE.",Paragraph
It is located halfway between the Supe Valley,Paragraph
to the south and the Casma Valley to the,Paragraph
"north, at a place where the Mosna River",Paragraph
narrows dramatically into a precipitous gorge.,Paragraph
"There, at the convergence point of two major",Paragraph
passes crossing the snowcapped Cordillera,Title
"Blanca, the Mosna meets the Wachesqua",Title
River at a triangular space wedged between,Paragraph
descending mountain slopes that is the only,Paragraph
flat area for miles around. Though seemingly,Paragraph
"remote, Chavin de Huantar was only about a",Paragraph
six-day trek to the Pacific Ocean to the west,Title
and to the tropical forests to the east. The,Paragraph
tight valley could never have supported the,Paragraph
population density of Casma; agriculture here,Paragraph
was thus pursued by the more traditional,Paragraph
means of small terraced plots.,Paragraph
"The temple of Chavin de Huantar was,",Paragraph
"therefore, of a new type of institution deriving",Paragraph
its economy almost entirely from the draw,Paragraph
of its cerernonies and rituals. Unlike ritual,Paragraph
"centers in the Supe and Casma valleys, with",Paragraph
their open plazas and relaxed and generously,Paragraph
"scaled monuments, here the temple was in",Paragraph
fact less a temple than a type of machine,Title
lesigned to enhance and produce certain,Paragraph
effects. The measure of divinity was not,Paragraph
"istance but psychological intimacy, and",Paragraph
perhaps even fear.,Paragraph
The first structure that was built was a,Paragraph
U-shaped platform called the Old Temple.,Paragraph

labyrinthine passages. Roofed with large,Paragraph
"slabs of stone, these passages are no more",Paragraph
"than a meter wide and vary in height, but are",Paragraph
large enough for a person to walk through.,Paragraph
One passage oriented directly on axis with,Paragraph
the round plaza contained a mysterious,Paragraph
and imposing 3-meter-high slender granite,Paragraph
stone known today as the Lanzén. It was not,Paragraph
"a natural stone, but a sculpture that is half",Paragraph
"cat and half human, the design of which is",Paragraph
wrapped around the stone so that it is never,Paragraph
entirely visible from one standpoint. Facing,Paragraph
east along the axis of the Old Temple but,Paragraph
"invisible from outside, its right arm is raised",Paragraph
with open palm of the hand exposed and its,Paragraph
left arm is lowered with the back of the hand,Paragraph
visible. This pose seems to express the role,Paragraph
of the deity as a mediator of opposites or as a,Paragraph
personification of the principle of balance and,Paragraph
"order. Its narrow, tapered upper section fits",Paragraph
accurately through a tailor-made hole in the,Paragraph
"roof, indicating that the temple was designed",Paragraph
around the statue. Why was this sacred relic,Paragraph
"hidden away in the depths of the temple, and",Paragraph
in such a way that it could not be rernoved?,Paragraph
There is a depression on the deity’s head,Paragraph
into which the blood of sacrificed victims,Title
may have been poured from the hole above.,Paragraph
The entire structure was enlarged several,Paragraph
times; the two principal additions affected,Paragraph
"the south wing, which ultimately formed a",Paragraph
solid rectangular structure 70 by 72 meters in,Caption
plan.,Paragraph
An aspect of the design that seems to,Paragraph
have been at the core of the experience was,Paragraph
sound. Water channels route water beneath,Paragraph
the temple and would have been amplified,Paragraph
in the passageways. The ducts leading to the,Paragraph
"outside were perhaps not for air, but to emit",Paragraph
the sound. During the spring flood and when,Paragraph
"the underground channels were opened, the",Paragraph
building would have probably come alive with,Paragraph
"its roaring. The aqueducts, coming from the",Paragraph
"direction of the setting sun, might symbolize",Paragraph
the underground river along which the sun,Title
travels to be born again in the east. This,Paragraph

controlled the building's inner mechanisms.,Paragraph
Light might also have played a part. The,Paragraph
corridors are connected to the outside by a,Paragraph

GREECE: THE GEOMETRIC PERIOD,Title
Post-Mycenaean Greece was a period of,Paragraph
"migrations, confusion, and poverty. But",Paragraph
"over time, the Dorians in Greece and the",Paragraph
lonians along the Turkish coast came to,Paragraph
develop common cultural practices that fused,Paragraph
elements unique to them with residues of,Paragraph
the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures. This,Paragraph
explains some of the differences in their,Paragraph
development from that of the Etruscans.,Paragraph
"The Minoans and Mycenaeans, having had",Paragraph
"no temples in the technical sense, held",Paragraph
"caves and mountains sacred, with worship",Paragraph
augmented by shrines. Homer represents the,Paragraph
gods as highly mobile creatures constantly,Title
visiting each other in their palaces. The,Paragraph
early Dorian religious practices took place,Paragraph
"in natural settings, which made it easy to",Paragraph
incorporate some of the features and even,Paragraph
locations of Minoan religion into their own.,Paragraph
"These rites, as described by George Hersey,",Paragraph
"also often involved trees, or groves of trees,",Paragraph
that were fenced off and decorated with,Paragraph
"materials used in sacrifices—bones, horns,",Paragraph
"urns, lamps, weapons, fruits, and vegetables.",Paragraph
"Trees held a special place in Greek culture,",Paragraph
and almost every god was associated with,Paragraph
"one. Athena was, for example, associated",Paragraph
with the olive tree. The altar dedicated,Caption
to a god was set out in front of his or her,Paragraph
particular tree or grove.,Paragraph
Participants in the rites would bathe and,Paragraph
"dress in special clothes and, accompanied",Paragraph
"by flutists, sing while processing to the place",Paragraph
of sacrifice. They were led by a girl carrying,Paragraph
a basket of grain on her head. Under the,Paragraph

participants would wash their hands by,Paragraph
"pouring water from a jug, which they would",Paragraph
also sprinkle on the animal. The barley grains,Paragraph
from the girl’s basket would be flung over the,Paragraph

"revealed, the priest would step forward, take",Paragraph
"it, and prepare for the sacrifice.",Paragraph
"The beast, which had to be a prime",Paragraph
"specimen from the domestic herd, rather",Paragraph
"than a wild animal, had to be willing to",Paragraph
"submit to the sacrifice, so the priest placed",Paragraph
a bowl of milk at the base of the altar. As,Paragraph
"the animal stepped forward, it would bow",Paragraph
"its head to drink, which was interpreted as",Paragraph
a sign of submission. Another indication of,Paragraph
its assent was its shivering in the sight of the,Paragraph
"god, a process helped along by the liberal",Paragraph
use of cold water. As the blood was held to,Paragraph
"be precious, it was drained into conduits",Paragraph
and pits beneath the altar. The animal was,Paragraph

"to various parts, with the liver being, of",Paragraph

The meaning of this sacrificial process is,Paragraph
"explained in the myth of Prometheus, who",Paragraph
stole fire from the gods and brought it to,Paragraph
"mankind. In so doing, he made it possible",Paragraph
for humankind to civilize itself. The gods,Paragraph
did not take the fire back but punished,Paragraph
Prometheus by chaining him to a cliff and,Paragraph
having an eagle eat his liver. His liver would,Paragraph
"grow back every day, only to be eaten",Paragraph
again. The sacrifice was thus part of a ritual,Paragraph
remembrance of humankind’s emergence,Title
into civilization and of their dependence,Title
on the gods for the regulation of their lives.,Paragraph
But the sacrifice also marked the difference,Paragraph
"tween humankind and gods, for unlike",Paragraph
"the gods, who existed in an ethereal form,",Paragraph
umankind had to work and show sincerity,Paragraph
to keep the communication alive. Only by,Paragraph
making a sacrifice—in sorne ways a labor of,Paragraph
jove—could men demonstrate that they were,Paragraph
thankful to the deities. That is why a skinny,Paragraph
ull or decrepit goat would not do: the animal,Paragraph
jad to be the best of the lot.,Paragraph
"Nevertheless, Dorians, Minoans, and even",Paragraph
Etruscans had somewhat differing notions,Paragraph
about sacrifice. Etruscan sacrifice was,Paragraph
more formulaic and Minoan sacrifice more,Paragraph
intimate than that of the Greeks. Unlike the,Paragraph
"Egyptians, Greek sacrifice was connected to",Paragraph
"the principles of farming and herding, rather",Paragraph
than to the palace garden. Bread and meat,Paragraph
were at the center of Greek sacrifice. Even,Paragraph
"in the Christian Eucharist, which developed",Paragraph
"later, the importance of bread and wine is",Paragraph
"encountered in veiled form, a comparison",Paragraph
that raises important questions about,Paragraph
the influence of Greek practices on early,Title
Christianity. The importance of the Greeks’,Paragraph
attitudes toward sacrifice might easily be,Title
overlooked because so many of their altars,Paragraph
were removed when Christianity tried to,Paragraph
destroy any evidence of heathen practices. In,Paragraph
"fact, in the early days of Greek religion, there",Paragraph
"were no temples, only altars built out in the",Paragraph
open.,Paragraph
One of the earliest and most sacred of,Paragraph
"the Greek altars, on the top of Mt. Lykaion",Caption
"in the Greek Peloponnese, dates back to",Paragraph
3000 BCE—Mycenaean times. It eventually,Paragraph
"became associated with Zeus, the king of",Paragraph
"the Greek gods, but whether that was true",Paragraph
in the earlier period is unknown. Below the,Paragraph
"summit there was a stadium, indicating",Paragraph
the site’s association with an athletic,Paragraph
"festival, a combination that was to become",Paragraph
another important element of many Greek,Paragraph
sanctuaries.,Paragraph
"The Mt. Lykaion altar, like the Temple of",Paragraph
Hera at Samos (8th century BCE) consisted of,Paragraph
no more than a low enclosure of flat stones,Paragraph
forming a rectangle of about 2 by 3.5 meters.,Paragraph
Altars became larger as time progressed; the,Paragraph
"one on the Acropolis at Athens, for exarnple,",Caption
"from the 5th or 4th century BCE, could hold",Paragraph
a dozen bulls at one time. The Altar of Zeus,Caption
"at Pergarnon, now in the Pergamon Museum",Caption
"in Berlin, was the most spectacular of all.",Paragraph
"Built from 197 to 159 BCE, it featured a flight",Paragraph
of steps on its west side and flanking lonic,Paragraph
"colonnades. It stands on a five-stepped,",Paragraph
almost square plinth. The altar proper was,Paragraph
inside the court.,Paragraph
The altars were not necessarily aligned,Paragraph
"symmetrically on axis with the ternple,",Paragraph
especially during the Archaic period. At,Paragraph
"Samos, the altar, with its sacred tree, stood at",Paragraph
"irst at an oblique angle, referring perhaps to",Paragraph
a different celestial moment than that of the,Paragraph
temple.,Paragraph
The emergence of the altar-plus-temple,Title
form coincided with the personification of,Paragraph
"gods in statues and, once again, seems to",Paragraph
ave been part of the assimilation process,Paragraph
the Dorians underwent when they came into,Paragraph
contact with older Mediterranean practices.,Paragraph
Early Greek representations of their gods,Title
show influences from both the Mesopotamian,Paragraph
and Egyptian cultures. But Greek,Paragraph
representations were rarely as diminutive as,Paragraph
the Mesopotamian and Minoan statues could,Paragraph
"be, nor as large as the Egyptians’ often were.",Paragraph
And perhaps therein lies the origin of the,Paragraph
Greek advancement of the depiction of the,Title
human figure. The earliest three-dimensional,Paragraph
"representations of divinities, known as korai",Paragraph
(draped female statues standing with feet,Caption
together) were carved from wooden columns,Paragraph
or planks at a roughly life-size scale. The,Paragraph
"Greeks called such statues kofossos, which",Paragraph
had nothing to do with their size but denoted,Paragraph
an image that was shaped like a pillar or,Paragraph
column. The statues gradually came to,Paragraph
"represent gods in a more relaxed stance,",Paragraph
one foot forward with the weight of the body,Paragraph
balanced naturalistically on the rear leg.,Paragraph

"elongated, windowless room—a naos or cella",Paragraph
(from which the word cellar cormes}—that,Paragraph

"in western Greece, where a low stone wall",Paragraph
"supported a high, steeply pitched thatched",Paragraph
"roof. There were no side chambers, ancillary",Paragraph

the regularized form of later temples. The,Paragraph

Though Greek ternples can be found facing,Paragraph

certain ammount of Egyptian influence at the,Paragraph

articulated this as the “mandate of heaven”,Paragraph

detail in a later chapter. It is thus safe to,Paragraph
"say that during the Zhou dynasty, many of",Paragraph
the cultural and political ideals that were,Paragraph

INTRODUCTION,Title
"From China to Greece, religious, ethical,",Paragraph
and social thinking was undergoing various,Paragraph
evaluations that contrasted with centuries-old,Paragraph
traditions that had accepted the notion that,Paragraph
"power was imposed from the top, by force",Paragraph
"or by ancestral privilege, rather than that it",Paragraph
should be examined from a theorized point of,Paragraph
"view. In the 6th century BCE, however, we see",Paragraph
the emergence of a more conscious attempt,Title
to think though the question of ethics and,Paragraph
"governance. In China, for example, Confucius",Paragraph
(551-479 BCE) envisioned a world defined by,Paragraph
"reason and proper conduct, while Daoism,",Paragraph
"which existed alongside Confucianism,",Paragraph
stressed a sort of quietist noninterference and,Paragraph
the paradox of complementary opposites.,Paragraph
"In India, Buddha and Mahavira challenged",Paragraph
"the highly stratified world of Vedic orthodoxy,",Paragraph
emphasizing the discipline of self-abnegation.,Paragraph
Buddhism might have remained tangential to,Paragraph
history had it not been made a state religion,Paragraph
"by Asoka (304-232 BCE), the creator of the",Paragraph
first empire of South Asia. Since Buddhism,Paragraph
"at the time was largely an ascetic practice,",Paragraph
Asoka did not order the construction of large,Paragraph
"temples, but set up pillars with the teachings",Paragraph
of the Buddha etched onto them. In western,Paragraph
"and Central Asia we find Zoroastrianism, an",Paragraph
ethically based religion that perceived the,Paragraph
world as a struggle between good and evil.,Paragraph
"Man was viewed as a potential helper of God,",Paragraph
"capable of eradicating evil. And in Greece,",Paragraph
"Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and others engaged",Title
"in vigorous debates about democracy, law,",Paragraph
"and social philosophy. Athens, adopting",Caption
"democracy, became seminal in prefiguring the",Paragraph
modern state.,Paragraph
- «,Title
"Politically, however, the major player in",Paragraph
western and Central Asia was Persia. Filling,Paragraph
the vacuum created by the collapse of the,Paragraph
"Egyptian, Assyrian, and Babylonian empires,",Paragraph
it extended its reach from northern India to,Paragraph
"Greece, giving rise to new architectural forms",Paragraph
in the expansive capitals of Pasargadae and,Paragraph
Persepolis. Persepolis was a showplace of,Paragraph
"prestige. It was not a city and not a fortress,",Paragraph
but an array of vast palaces for feasting and,Paragraph
"banqueting, all set up on a terrace that made",Paragraph
it visible to the thousands of people who,Paragraph
came there annually to pay their respects to,Paragraph
"the great kings. The Mediterranean, however,",Paragraph
"remained firmly under Greek control, with the",Paragraph

an architectural vocabulary that was later to,Paragraph
become foundational for Roman architecture.,Paragraph

of the greatest buildings in the world.,Paragraph
The famous battles between Greece,Title
"and Persia can deflect us, however, from",Paragraph
understanding the geopolitical energy that,Paragraph
these two areas brought to the Eurasian,Paragraph
world. Persia was the link between the,Paragraph
Mediterranean Sea and India; and just as,Paragraph
Greece was working to expand its trade,Paragraph
relations with the agropastoral communities,Title
"to their north, so too the Indians sought to",Paragraph
expand their connections to the south of the,Paragraph
"subcontinent. These three regions—India,",Paragraph
"Persia, and the Mediterranean/Black Sea—",Title
were knit into a tight economic unit.,Paragraph
Persia’s unsuccessful atternpt to,Paragraph
conquer Greece was to have unintended,Paragraph
consequences. It stimulated the fantasy and,Paragraph
"ambitions of Alexander (356-323 BCE), who",Paragraph
conquered Persia and its territories. For a,Paragraph
while it seemed that the Greek Empire would,Paragraph
"stretch all the way to the Indus River, but",Paragraph
Alexander's ambitions were cut short by his,Paragraph
death in Babylon in 323 BCE. The conquered,Paragraph
"lands, divided among his generals, turned",Paragraph
into quasi-independent states and regional,Title
power centers. The strongest of these was,Paragraph
"Egypt, ruled by the Ptolemies, who governed",Paragraph
from Alexandria. An equally important city-,Paragraph

"however, underwent a transformation when",Paragraph
"the Persians, a branch of the Medians, tock",Paragraph
"control under Cyrus the Great (559-530 BCE),",Paragraph
who picked up where Cyaxares had left off,Paragraph
"and, in effect, united the Elamite, Median,",Paragraph
and Babylonian realms into the Achaemenid,Title
Empire (also known as the First Persian,Title
Empire) that extended from Anatolia to the,Paragraph
Persian Gulf. The ascendency of the Persians,Paragraph
had important geopolitical consequences in,Paragraph
that their lands were halfway between India,Paragraph
and the Mediterranean. They were well aware,Paragraph
"of this, of course, and indeed, their existence",Paragraph
depended on extending trade in these two,Paragraph
directions.,Paragraph
"Like all ermpires, the Persians went through",Paragraph
"their expansionary mode, with famous military",Paragraph
campaigns by both Darius and his son,Title
"Xerxes | (in 490 and 480 BCE, respectively)",Paragraph
against the Greeks. Both campaigns were,Paragraph
"unsuccessful, but the Persian alliance",Paragraph
"with the Phoenicians, who contributed",Paragraph
"substantially to their fleet, brought prosperity",Paragraph
to the Levant and its cities along the eastern,Title
Mediterranean coast. Phoenician cities like,Paragraph
Byblos and Sidon experienced an economic,Paragraph
"upturn. The Persians, seeing for the first time",Paragraph
"the great buildings of Egypt and western Asia,",Paragraph
were eager to match these accomplishments.,Paragraph
"From the lonians, Persia not only collected",Paragraph
taxes but also took their farnously skilled,Paragraph
craftsmen. An inscription of Darius’s relates,Paragraph

that the stonecutters who worked on his,Paragraph
"palaces were from lonia, and the wood",Paragraph

"under Darius (522-486 BCE), who extended",Paragraph
the boundaries of the empire into the heart,Title

Persia was to a large extent surrounded by,Paragraph

administrative core is remarkable for its,Paragraph
"spaciousness; palace, audience hall, altars,",Caption
"and pavilions, all distant from each other yet",Paragraph
"integrated into a parklike setting with trees,",Paragraph
"watercourses, and gardens. The Egyptians",Caption
"and Babylonians had palace gardens, but",Paragraph
"such an expansive landscape of palaces,",Paragraph
"gardens, and orchards was quite novel. It",Paragraph
"was also a sacred landscape, for to the north",Paragraph
there was a sacred enclosure consisting of a,Paragraph
walled precinct with a series of flat terraces,Paragraph
"supporting an open altar. Much later, the",Paragraph
Persian garden was to become the prototype,Paragraph
of Islamic gardens.,Paragraph
The Tomb of Cyrus the Great is located,Paragraph
not far from Pasargadae. Its cefla is 6 meters,Paragraph
high and rests on a six-level stepped plinth,Caption
that measures 13.5 by 12.2 meters at the,Paragraph
base. The entire 13-meter-high edifice,Paragraph
is of white limestone. Five huge slanted,Paragraph
"stones make up the roof. The monument,",Paragraph

awe-inspiring fluted and tapered limestone,Caption
columns 7 meters high surmounted by bull-,Caption
or lion-shaped capitals. The ceiling beams of,Paragraph
"cedar, ebony, and teak were gold plated and",Paragraph

general concept of a columnar hall dates to,Paragraph
early Median architecture: a palace-citadel,Title
in Gobin Tepe from the 8th century BCE had,Paragraph
"a hall with thirty columns, as did Cyrus's",Paragraph

peoples of the vast empire dressed and what,Title
"kinds of ornaments, weapons, and hairstyles",Paragraph
they sported. A group from India carries,Paragraph

"a gate, with black marble benches where",Paragraph
visitors could wait.,Paragraph
The frieze helps us understand the,Paragraph
meaning of this innovative structure. It was,Paragraph
the backdrop to a great annual celebration—,Paragraph
perhaps a new year celebration—with people,Title
"arriving from all over to bring gifts, make",Paragraph
"treaties, and socialize. The flatlands to the",Paragraph
west of the complex would have been filled,Paragraph

5.18 Greek temple terminology,Caption
The most basic element of the temple was the,Paragraph
colonnade. Though so common today that it,Paragraph
"might seem to be a natural architectural form,",Paragraph
it was actually a unique innovation of the,Paragraph
"Greeks. Called a pteron, it was a sacred form",Paragraph
always reserved for temples. Pteron means,Paragraph
"“wing” or “fin,” but also “oar” and “sail.”",Paragraph
It perhaps refers to early awnings placed,Paragraph
against buildings. But it also indicates that,Paragraph
the Greeks saw the building as a dynamic,Paragraph
location—as something that literally catches,Paragraph
the wind and hears the voices of the gods.,Paragraph
"In addition, the pteron evoked the idea of a",Paragraph
"grove of trees, especially because columns",Paragraph
were originally made of wooden trunks. The,Paragraph
pteron has also been associated with stout,Paragraph
soldiers forming a phalanx—a rectangular,Paragraph
military formation—symbolically protecting the,Paragraph
statue within the cefla.,Caption
The following terms describe the type of,Paragraph
colonnade surrounding the naos of a Greek,Paragraph
temple:,Title
Peripteral: one row of columns.,Paragraph
* Dipteral: two rows of columns,Title
* Tripteral: three rows of columns,Title
* Pseudodipteral: suggesting a dipteral,Title

A corona is the projection at the,Paragraph
top of a cornice; the word was,Paragraph
associated with the forehead and,Paragraph
with controlling things from above. It,Paragraph

"century BCE are often monolithic, but later the",Paragraph
shaft came to be composed of superimposed,Paragraph
"drums, which were rounded by turning them on",Paragraph
a lathe.,Paragraph
The drums were doweled together with wooden,Paragraph
or bronze spikes enclosed in concavities at,Paragraph
the center. The shafts were fluted after the,Paragraph
columns were in place. There are usually twenty,Paragraph
broad and shallow flutes that meet to form,Paragraph
"sharp edges, or arrises. The joints between the",Paragraph
columns would have been concealed by marble,Paragraph
stucco.,Paragraph
The steps were often too tall to ascend,Paragraph
"comfortably, so a flight of stairs or a ramp was",Paragraph
provided at the entrance. This demonstrates,Paragraph
that the steps had nothing to do with the,Paragraph
"necessities of construction, for they could",Paragraph
easily have been designed with more risers.,Paragraph

"5.20 Site plan showing the relationship between the agora and the acropolis, Athens",Caption
Athens,Title
The city of Athens had three main,Paragraph
"components: the acropolis, which was the",Paragraph
great ritual and spiritual core of the city; the,Paragraph
"agora, which was its economic hub; and the",Paragraph
"urban fabric itself, where one found small",Paragraph
"shrines and temples. The agora, probably",Paragraph
laid out in the 7th century BCE and developed,Paragraph
in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE with the,Paragraph
"construction of temples to Hephaestus, Zeus,",Paragraph
"and Apollo, was a unique Athenian invention.",Paragraph
It was a specially demarcated space outside,Paragraph
of the core of the city that brought together,Paragraph
the different dimensions of urban life. Though,Paragraph
"often called a public space, it was just as",Paragraph
much a religious space as a social one. One,Paragraph
of the key temples overlooking the agora was,Paragraph
the temple to Hephaestus. Hephaestus was,Paragraph
"the god of the smithies, and his presence",Paragraph
there was a testament to the role of bronze,Paragraph
casting in the Athenian economy. It was set,Paragraph
"on a hill to the west, its elevated presence",Paragraph
signifying its importance.,Paragraph
"The agora was also the site of the Leokoreion,",Paragraph
a small shrine associated with a well in the,Caption
northern part of the agora. It was narned after,Paragraph
"the daughters of Leos, who were sacrificed",Paragraph
to save the city from a terrible plague. Also,Paragraph
"on the agora was a stoa, a long colonnaded",Paragraph
building with shops on the back facing the,Paragraph
agora. These shops were for the more elite,Paragraph
merchants. Council meetings were held in,Paragraph
a building known as the bouleuterion. The,Paragraph
law courts were located there as well. The,Paragraph
"central space was used for markets, ritual",Paragraph
"gatherings, or the making of speeches and",Paragraph
"pronouncements. But most importantly, the",Paragraph
area served as a market. One could find,Paragraph
"almost anything in the agora: confectioners,",Paragraph

to which they would periodically go for,Paragraph
ritual communal events. What they learned,Paragraph
rom the Egyptians was to dramatize these,Paragraph
journeys into spectacular processions,Title
"involving music and dancing. They did not,",Paragraph

to their fundamental belief in the deity being,Paragraph

"the number of these processions multiplied,",Paragraph
with some becoming elevated to the level,Paragraph
"of state protocol. One was the Dionysia, a",Paragraph
jarge Athenian festival in honor of the god,Title
Dionysus that was held in early spring. It,Paragraph
involved a procession of phalluses and,Paragraph
"military equipment, and ended in theatrical",Paragraph
"performances. A few weeks later, there was",Paragraph
the more official Panathenaic procession that,Paragraph
started at the Leokoreion and ended at the,Paragraph
acropolis. That it began at the Leokoreion was,Paragraph
an indication of the procession’s attempt to,Paragraph
connect deeply to the principle of sacrifice,Paragraph
and triumph.,Paragraph
The procession was an elaborate affair. For,Paragraph
"months before, a team of maidens from",Paragraph
aristocratic families would weave a special,Paragraph
new garment for the deity in the temple. By,Caption
the late 5th century BCE the robe was as,Paragraph
"big as a ship's sail and was, in fact, fixed",Paragraph
on the model of a ship mounted on wheels.,Paragraph
This ship-cart had a crew of priests and,Paragraph
priestesses wearing golden and colorful,Title
"garlands. When all was set, a nocturnal",Paragraph
"festival took place, and at sunrise a new fire",Paragraph
"was fetched, carried in a torch race from",Paragraph
outside the city—where sacrifice was made,Paragraph
to Eros and Athena together—through the,Paragraph
"agora, and up to the altar of Athena on",Paragraph
the acropolis. A procession then formed in,Paragraph
which all members of the community had,Paragraph
"their place. The high point was the sacrifice,",Paragraph
in which more than a hundred animals,Paragraph
"were slaughtered at the Great Altar, and",Paragraph
the meat distributed to the whole populace,Paragraph
in the agora. From 566 BCE onward an,Paragraph
athletic contest was added to the program,Paragraph
"of activities, including foot races, wrestling,",Paragraph
"horse racing, boxing, and javelin-throwing.",Paragraph
The frieze of the Pantheon seems to portray,Paragraph
such a celebratory procession. The narrative,Paragraph
"of the frieze begins at the southwest corner,",Paragraph
where the procession appears to divide into,Paragraph
two separate files.,Paragraph
What does it represent? According to,Paragraph
"traditional interpretation, it depicts the annual",Paragraph
"Panathenaic procession. But this view,",Paragraph
"though oft repeated, has been challenged",Paragraph
by scholars who argue that it must be a,Paragraph
"representation of a mythological moment,",Paragraph
not a real procession involving mortals. Since,Paragraph
the pediments and metopes alll illustrate,Paragraph
"mythological scenes, it is natural to reach",Paragraph
for a mythological explanation for the frieze,Paragraph
as well. John Boardman has suggested that,Paragraph
the cavalry portrayed on the frieze depict,Paragraph
the heroization of the soldiers who fell at,Paragraph
"Marathon in 490 BCE, and that therefore",Paragraph
these riders were the Athenians who took,Paragraph
part in the last prewar Greater Panathenaia.,Paragraph
Chrysoula Kardar has ventured that the,Paragraph
relief shows an imagined first Panathenaic,Caption
procession as instituted under the mythical,Paragraph
King Kekrops.,Paragraph
A perplexing issue is that the frieze's,Paragraph
location high in the building's porch would,Paragraph
have made it difficult to see. In the museum,Paragraph
"today, the figures are on eye level, whereas",Paragraph
originally they were 7 meters up. This,Paragraph
suggests that they were not meant to be,Paragraph
“seen” in the conventional sense.,Paragraph
"Thomas Bruce, the Seventh Earl of Elgin,",Title
dismantled about two-thirds of the frieze and,Paragraph
had it shipped to England between 1801 and,Paragraph
"1806, and today the so-called Elgin Marbles",Paragraph
"are in the British Museum, to the outrage",Caption
"of many. In looking at the frieze, one has",Paragraph
"to remember that it, as indeed the entire",Paragraph
"building, was painted.",Paragraph
5.23 Approach to the Parthenon from the Propylaea,Caption
The Parthenon,Title
Because of the constant warfare in ancient,Paragraph
"Greece, almost every city was divided",Paragraph
"into a lower town and an acropolis, which",Paragraph
literally means a “city on the height.” The,Paragraph
acropolis of Athens was no exception. It,Paragraph
sits on a great isolated slab of limestone,Paragraph
"tilted toward the west side, from which it",Paragraph
had to be approached. Already fortified,Paragraph
"with a wall by the Mycenaeans, it was held",Paragraph
to be invested with divine presences from,Paragraph
ancient times. The waters from a spring on,Paragraph
its southern flank are today still considered,Paragraph
to have healing powers. An olive tree rooted,Paragraph
to a rock on its summit was dedicated to,Paragraph
Athena. It was here that the Parthenon was,Paragraph
built under the political leadership of Pericles.,Paragraph
"The building, replacing one that had been",Paragraph
"destroyed by the Persians, was designed",Paragraph
by Ictinus (with advice from Callicrates and,Caption
Phidias) and built between 447 and 438 BCE.,Paragraph
Designed as a monument to Athena and,Paragraph
"housing her sacred statue, it was bigger than",Paragraph
any temple ever before built on the Greek,Paragraph
"mainland, its stylobate measuring 30.9 by",Paragraph
69.5 meters. Early accounts of the temple,Caption
"call it Hekatornpedos, or “hundred-footer,”",Paragraph
referring either to its overall width or the,Paragraph
"length of the large eastern room of its cefa,",Paragraph
also known as the hekatompedos.,Paragraph

that the columns in the naos supported a,Paragraph

"would have been painted inside and out, with",Paragraph

5.26 Diagram of the curved stylobate and inclined vertical axes of the perimeter columns of the Parthenon,Caption
Underlying the construction is a system,Paragraph
of refinements that control the delicate,Paragraph
"curvature of horizontal lines, the elegant",Paragraph
"convergence of vertical lines, and the",Paragraph
nuanced size and spacing of the fluted,Paragraph
marble columns. The stylobate was not a,Paragraph
flat plane but rather like a section of a very,Paragraph
large sphere; it curved upward toward the,Paragraph
"middle, rising 41 millimeters on its short",Paragraph
sides and 102 millimeters on its long flanks.,Paragraph
This curve was carried upward through the,Paragraph
"entire structure, imparting a subtle upward",Paragraph
"curvature even on the architrave, the cornice,",Paragraph
and nearly every “horizontal” line of stone.,Paragraph
"Furthermore, every column was given an",Paragraph
"entasis, or a slight bulging of the middle of",Paragraph
the column's shaft. The entasis measures,Paragraph
only 20 millimeters of deviation from a,Paragraph
"straight line. Moreover, each of the forty-six",Paragraph
"perimeter columns was tilted slightly inward,",Paragraph
with the corner column tilting on a diagonal.,Paragraph
If the columns of the short sides were,Paragraph
"extended upward, they would meet around",Paragraph
4.8 kilometers above the roof.,Caption
While each of these refinements have,Paragraph
functional advantages—the curvature to,Paragraph
"shed water, the angling to increase lateral",Paragraph
"structural support during earthquakes,",Paragraph
and the corner adjustments to maintain,Title
proper column alignments with the metopes,Paragraph
"above—scholars, beginning with the Roman",Paragraph
"architect and historian Vitruvius, have argued",Paragraph
that the nuances were mostly for aesthetic,Paragraph
"effect; and indeed, in no other temple was",Paragraph
this visual tension as subtle and refined as,Paragraph
in the Parthenon. It nevertheless seems,Paragraph
astonishing that in contrast with other,Paragraph
"attempts at making grand statements, where",Paragraph
architects sought height or the addition of,Paragraph
"special embellishments, here the architects",Paragraph
sought a level of precision that was almost,Paragraph
"imperceptible, yet could not be matched",Paragraph
anywhere else in the world at the time.,Paragraph
How these astonishing curves were made is,Paragraph
"something of a mystery, since the building,",Paragraph
"like all Greek temples, is made of precut",Paragraph
pieces allowing for few on-site adjustments.,Paragraph

the base of the capital there is a flat-topped,Paragraph
molding with a profile like that of the Doric,Paragraph
"echinus, but it is usually carved with egg-",Paragraph
"and-dart moldings. Above this lies the volute,",Paragraph
its loose ends winding down in dropping,Paragraph
spirals on each side of the shaft and ending,Paragraph
in buttonlike oculi (eyes). The entablature,Paragraph
usually consists of three bands of fasciae,Paragraph

one possibly once linked to the Eleusinian,Paragraph

"festival (thesmoj meaning “law,” and phoria",Paragraph

"was a seven-day celebration in the late fall,",Paragraph
beginning on the fifteenth day of the Greek,Title
month of Boedromion. People streamed,Paragraph
"to it from all of Greece, and even slaves",Paragraph
were admitted. This festival was so deeply,Paragraph
entrenched in the folk practices and the,Paragraph
communal memory that it continued on into,Paragraph
early Christian tires—until the early Christian,Title
fathers put a stop to it. The procession,Paragraph
followed the sacred road from Athens to,Title
"Delphi that had, according to myth, been",Paragraph
traveled by Apollo. The route started at the,Paragraph
sacred gate in the city walls of Athens and,Caption
proceeded through Eleusis to the sanctuary,Paragraph
of Demeter on the Thriasian Plain.,Paragraph
Every September a great torch-lit,Paragraph
procession wound its way along this route.,Paragraph
"Two days before it was to begin, the Aiera",Paragraph
(sacred objects) were brought in baskets,Paragraph
to Athens by young Athenians in military,Title
training. The initiates met their mystagogus (a,Paragraph

and purified themselves with their blood. On,Paragraph
"the fifth day, they made the long 25-kilometer",Paragraph

was carried at the head of the procession.,Paragraph
Then came the priests with the sacred cult,Paragraph
objects hidden in baskets and finally a huge,Paragraph
crowd of mystai (initiates). The high point,Paragraph
of the festival took place in the Telesterion,Paragraph
"at Eleusis, a square, windowless building",Caption

seats to accommodate some three thousand,Paragraph
people.,Paragraph

countries as well. After depositing his own,Paragraph

"the far end of the chamber, where steps",Paragraph
descend to a sunken area a meter below,Paragraph
the level of the floor. From there he made,Paragraph
"his way into the adytum, at the back wall of",Paragraph

"After a particularly brutal battle, Asoka lost",Paragraph

is throne and became a Jain ascetic. His,Paragraph
"son, Bindusara (r. 298-272 BCE) became",Paragraph
a follower of an even more extreme ascetic,Paragraph

interest of these rulers derived from the,Paragraph
fact that they were not born into the Aryan,Paragraph
"Kshatriya (warrior) caste, but were low-caste",Paragraph
upstarts who became Kshatriya after seizing,Paragraph
the Magadha throne. The difference between,Paragraph
Asoka and his predecessors was that he,Paragraph
adapted Buddhist teachings into a new moral,Title
and social order for his empire that he called,Paragraph
the dhamma. In essence Buddhism became,Paragraph
a state religion.,Paragraph
Though most of Asoka’s dhamma derives,Paragraph
from Buddhism—including vegetarianism,Title
"5.68 Vajrasana (“Diamond Throne”) at Bodh Gaya, India",Caption
and belief in nonviolence—it was not identical,Paragraph
"to Buddhism. In fact, Asoka rarely mentioned",Paragraph
"the Buddha while describing his dhamma,",Paragraph
"which, significantly, included respect for",Paragraph
all religions as a core part of its tenets. To,Paragraph
"promote his dhamma, which consisted of",Paragraph
"about thirty-three edicts, Asoka had them",Paragraph
"etched in stone tablets, on the side of",Caption
"prominent rocks, and inside cave sanctuaries,",Paragraph
all in the vernacular language of his kingdom.,Paragraph
"He also carved them on the sides of pillars,",Paragraph
about twenty of which have survived. One,Paragraph
"such pillar, in Lauriya Nandangarh (in",Paragraph

"sandstone, rises 12 meters above the ground",Paragraph
and extends 3 meters into the earth. Though,Paragraph
"the pillar is surmounted by an ornate capital,",Paragraph
it is the shaft with the inscribed edicts that,Paragraph
is of primary significance. The Asokan pillars,Paragraph
consist of a stylized lotus base that supports,Paragraph
an ornamental drum on which there are,Paragraph
sculptures of animals ranging from the bull,Caption
to the lion signifying royal authority. Most,Paragraph
"famous is the pillar found at Sarnath, the",Paragraph

symbol of the modern Indian nation.,Paragraph
"To further promote the Buddhist order,",Paragraph
Asoka convened a council of all significant,Paragraph
"Buddhist practitioners, whose mission it was",Paragraph
to codify the Buddha's teachings. Asoka also,Paragraph
memorialized the major sites associated with,Paragraph
the Buddha—in particular his birthplace,Paragraph
"(Lumbini), the site of his enlightenment",Paragraph
"(Bodh Gaya), the location of his first sermon",Paragraph
"(Sarnath), and the place of his death",Paragraph
(Kushinagar). He sent emissaries throughout,Paragraph

"Lanka, Afghanistan, Persia, and Greece.",Paragraph
"Most importantly, he collected all the known",Paragraph
relics of the Buddha and distributed them to,Paragraph
"about eight sites, at which the first centers",Paragraph

CHINA: THE WARRING STATES PERIOD,Title
"In the Warring States period (481-221 BCE),",Paragraph
the old league of cities ruled by the Zhou,Title
nobility was replaced by a systern of,Paragraph
territorial states (seven major and about,Title
seven minor ones) under the carmmand of,Paragraph
monarchs who seem to have engaged in,Paragraph
feverish construction activity. They fortified,Paragraph
"existing city walls, multiplied enclosures",Paragraph
"and barricades, and established satellite",Paragraph
"towns, all primarily for the purpose of",Paragraph
"defense. Prior to the Warring States period,",Paragraph
cities were cultic and political entities,Paragraph
inhabited by the nobility and their followers.,Paragraph
Populations were in the tens of thousands,Paragraph
"at most. During the Warring States period,",Paragraph
"as cities became capitals of states, their",Paragraph
"nature changed, becoming divided between",Paragraph
"a political center and an economic center,",Paragraph
the two holding each other in mutual,Paragraph
suspicion. This suspicion was articulated in,Paragraph
laws that attempted to control the actions,Paragraph
and influence of merchants. The result was,Paragraph
that new and sharp boundaries were drawn,Paragraph
"within the city between the political district,",Paragraph
"which was protected with its own wall, and",Paragraph
the merchants’ district. New architectural,Caption
"elements appeared that, through height and",Paragraph
"verticality, emphasized the ruler’s authority.",Paragraph

were all used to demonstrate power. When,Paragraph
Shang Yang began constructing the new Qin,Paragraph

gate towers.,Paragraph

Stepped terraces—called fai platforms—,Paragraph

give the impression of multiple-storied,Paragraph
buildings. In an age that lacked the ability,Paragraph
"to construct true multistoried buildings, this",Paragraph
design allowed for structures that seemed,Paragraph
to rise above the city. The ruler was bot!,Paragraph
"all-seeing and yet invisible. Furthermore, it",Paragraph
was believed that the ruler should move in,Paragraph
secret to avoid evil spirits and that he should,Paragraph
live as much as possible in towers. For this,Paragraph
"reason, Shi Huangdi, the First Emperor,",Paragraph
built elevated walks to connect all 270 of his,Paragraph
palaces and towers. Anyone who revealed,Paragraph
where the emperor was visiting was put to,Paragraph
death. This withdrawal from the gaze of the,Paragraph
"populace, and even from the court, became",Paragraph

"visible remnants of Zhou architecture are, in",Paragraph
"fact, tombs, of which more than six thousand",Paragraph
have been discovered. The tomb of Zeng Hou,Paragraph
Yi (Marquis Yi of Zeng) attracted international,Paragraph
attention when a large collection of bronze,Paragraph
"objects was found there, including a set",Paragraph
of sixty-five ritual bells weighing a total of,Paragraph
"2,500 kilograms. The tomb consisted of an",Paragraph
"irregularly shaped vertical pit, 13 meters deep",Caption
and more than 200 square meters in area. It,Paragraph
was divided into four chambers by wooden,Paragraph
"planks, with the principal chamber, on the",Paragraph
"east, containing the marquis’s body.",Paragraph
The body was placed in a double-layered,Paragraph
coffin. The space between the coffin and the,Paragraph
"chamber walls was filled with charcoal, clay,",Paragraph
and earth to seal it as completely as possible.,Paragraph
The eastern chamber also had coffins for,Paragraph
eight women—possibly musicians who were,Title
sacrificed at the time of the burial (although,Paragraph
human sacrificial internment was almost over,Paragraph
by this time in Chinese history). The western,Paragraph
chamber held skeletons of thirteen young,Title

were filled with ritual objects and weapons,Paragraph

A curious aspect of this tomb is that,Paragraph
small window-like openings connect all four,Paragraph
chambers. Even the marquis's outer coffin,Paragraph

is painted with doors and windows with lattice,Paragraph

"Eurasia was dominated by China and Rome,",Paragraph
interconnected by an increasingly vast,Paragraph
system of land and sea trade routes known,Title
in their entirety as the Silk Route. In spite,Paragraph
"of its name, it wasn’t only silk that moved",Paragraph
westward; in actuality the Silk Route economy,Paragraph
was a transcontinental trade in not just silk,Paragraph
"but also other luxury items such as rugs,",Paragraph
"gold, silver, craft objects, gems, ivory, and",Paragraph
perfumes—all things that could be easily,Title
packed and transported on the backs of,Paragraph
camels. The term Si/k Route emphasizes,Paragraph
"the trade that went from east to west, but",Paragraph
trade also went from west to east. The,Paragraph
Chinese valued horses as well as woolen,Paragraph
"goods, carpets, curtains, blankets, rugs, and",Paragraph
Parthian tapestries since they were unfamiliar,Paragraph
with carpet manufacture and weaving. Also,Paragraph
"imported into China were military equipment,",Paragraph
"gold and silver, semiprecious stones, and",Paragraph
"glass items, all of which were rare in China.",Paragraph
"In addition to the trade in luxury items,",Paragraph
"there was bulk trade in grain, lumber, and",Paragraph
building materials. This trade belonged to a,Paragraph
different economic universe and was usually,Paragraph
transported by boat along rivers and shores;,Paragraph
"here, the southern route through India and",Paragraph
along the coast around Southeast Asia was,Paragraph
"preferred. That trade, along with cinnamon",Paragraph
"from the Indonesian spice islands, was to",Paragraph
escalate in importance in the next centuries.,Paragraph
"The Chinese, in order to get rice and other",Paragraph
"bulk material, such as bricks and lumber,",Paragraph
"from the rural south to the urban north,",Paragraph
"built a vast network of canals, some 1,776",Paragraph
"kilometers in total length, called the Grand",Paragraph
Canal. The oldest parts date back to the 5th,Paragraph
"century BCE, although the various sections",Paragraph
were not connected until the Sui dynasty,Paragraph
"(581-618 CE). The Romans, meanwhile, are",Paragraph
still famous for their roads today. Estimated,Paragraph
"at about 400,000 kilometers in total, these",Paragraph
roads ranged from small local connectors to,Paragraph
"broad, long-distance highways built to link",Paragraph
"cities, towns, and military bases. The major",Paragraph
roads were stone-paved and flanked by,Paragraph
footpaths and drainage ditches.,Paragraph
The city of Rome developed from,Paragraph
a relatively small town to a sprawling,Paragraph
metropolis. Though the Romans planned,Paragraph
the layout of their military camps with great,Paragraph
"ceremonial precision, the city of Rome",Title
developed with little top-down planning. At,Paragraph
"its center was the forum, the political core of",Paragraph
the city. It was located in a valley surrounded,Paragraph
by hills over which the city began to spread.,Paragraph
Though almost all cities in the Mediterranean,Paragraph
"world were associated with deities and ritual,",Paragraph
and linked to sacred acts when they were,Paragraph
"created, the Roman Forum was designed as",Paragraph
"a particularly intense site, from its mythical",Paragraph
origins with Romulus and Remus to the,Paragraph
Vestal Virgins who lived in a special residence,Paragraph
and maintained the sacred fire. It was the,Paragraph
site of the umbilicus of the earth and the site,Caption
where the sacred law tablets were on display.,Paragraph
"And as the ceremonial center of the republic,",Paragraph
(ending in 27 BCE with the establishment,Paragraph
"of the Rornan Empire), it was politically far",Paragraph
different from almost every model of rulership,Paragraph
"to date, with the exception of Athens. The",Paragraph
"transition to the empire was much contested,",Paragraph
but it was more than just a grab for power,Paragraph
by certain elites. The enormous sale of the,Paragraph
territory did not match well with the still rather,Paragraph
loose mercantile ethos of the republic. The,Paragraph
"shift began when Caesar invaded Gaul, not",Paragraph
just for his personal glory but to gain access,Paragraph
to some of the best farmland in Europe as,Paragraph
"well as to metal. For several centuries, the",Paragraph
Romans had traded with the Gauls and,Paragraph
"Celts for iron, which they needed for their",Paragraph
military. Despite early resistance to Roman,Paragraph
"domination, the Celts largely accommodated",Paragraph
themselves to a Roman way of life that,Paragraph
brought protection and prosperity.,Paragraph
"Initially, the economic ascendancy o",Paragraph
"Rome cast a pall over western Asia, and very",Paragraph
little of consequence was built during the,Paragraph
Ist century BCE. But soon Rome was able,Paragraph
to impose a cohesive appearance over its,Paragraph
expanding domains. Roman emperors from,Paragraph
"Augustus to Trajan built impressive temples,",Paragraph
"forums, villas, and cities, all with the typical",Paragraph
"Roman imprint. Cities, roads, theaters, baths,",Caption
"markets, and military camps began to be",Paragraph
"built, from Hadrian’s Wall in England (122",Caption
CE) to Timgad in Algeria (founded by Emperor,Paragraph
Trajan ca. 100 CE).,Paragraph
Between the great centers of Rome and,Paragraph
"China, there stretched trackless steppe and",Paragraph
"desert; to get material across this area, the",Paragraph
"Chinese, like the Romans, had to rely on",Paragraph
"people who lived in gers, yurts, and tents,",Paragraph
and whose survival depended just as much,Paragraph
on their reliability as on their cunning and,Paragraph
"prowess. These nomadic cultures, however,",Paragraph
"get little credit for their efforts, as they were",Paragraph
"generally seen as rootless barbarians, but",Paragraph
"without them, there would have been no",Paragraph
"China and no Rome. For instance, it was",Paragraph
the Xiongu khanate’s confederation of tribes,Title
north of China that fed the ravenous needs of,Paragraph
the empire. Such confederations would come,Paragraph
"and go over the centuries, but they were",Paragraph
indispensable to the Eurasian economy.,Paragraph
"The Romans, at their end of the Silk",Paragraph
"Route, had to deal in particular with the",Paragraph
"Parthians, the great horseback warriors who",Paragraph
controlled the deserts of western Asia. The,Paragraph
Romans tried to conquer them again and,Paragraph
again in a series of battles that lasted over the,Paragraph
entire period of their empire. But although the,Paragraph
"6.2 The Colosseum, Rome",Caption
"history books emphasize war and conquest,",Paragraph
"war or no war, it was the trade exchange",Paragraph
that linked people across the landscape. A,Paragraph
significant border city was Dura-Europos (in,Paragraph
"modern-day Syria), built on a bluff 90 meters",Paragraph
above the right bank of the Euphrates River to,Paragraph
control the river crossing on the route between,Paragraph
the Mediterranean port city of Antioch,Title
and the inland caravan cities to the east.,Paragraph
"Initially founded in 303 BCE, Dura-Europos",Paragraph
was redesigned in the 2nd century BCE in,Paragraph
"the Greek manner, with rectangular blocks",Paragraph
around a large central agora. At the end of,Paragraph
the 2nd century BCE it came under Parthian,Paragraph
control and was known as a cosmopolitan,Paragraph
center. It contained not only a well-preserved,Paragraph
synagogue but also an early Christian church.,Paragraph
he city was captured by the Romans in 165,Paragraph
CE and all but abandoned in the middle of,Paragraph
the 3rd century CE. To enhance their trade,Paragraph
"position, the Romans tried to do an end run",Paragraph
around the Parthians by making alliances,Paragraph
"with the Nabataeans, a caravan-based culture",Paragraph
centered in Jordan; the Nabataeans controlled,Paragraph
the routes to the south and to India. The,Paragraph
Roman attitude toward the Nabateans was,Paragraph
different than toward the Parthians. The,Paragraph
Nabataeans were made citizens of Rome,Paragraph
and were showered with privileges. The,Paragraph
extravagant tombs the Nabataeans built for,Paragraph
themselves are showpieces of architectural,Paragraph
luxury and testaments to their important,Title
position in global trade.,Paragraph
The Roman attempt to control the eastern,Title
Mediterranean included the all-important,Paragraph
"Levant, and in 70 CE they conquered the",Paragraph
city of Jerusalem and destroyed its farnous,Title
"Second Temple, an act still mourned annually",Paragraph
"as the Jewish fast Tisha B’Av. Back in Rome,",Paragraph
Emperor Titus built an arch celebrating,Paragraph
the sacking of Jerusalem and its temple.,Paragraph
"At the center of this prosperity was Rome,",Paragraph
which underwent a profound transformation,Paragraph
between 50 CE and 150 CE. It is clear that,Paragraph
architecture in the Roman heartland in the,Title
1st century CE was often magnificent in scale,Paragraph
"and material, but in design terms it was",Paragraph
notably conventional compared to that found,Paragraph
in West Asia at the time. The architecture at,Paragraph
"Petra, the Nabataean capital, parallels the",Paragraph
"spatial innovation seen elsewhere, such as at",Paragraph
"Herod’s Palace at Masada, which works its",Paragraph
way down a difficult slope.,Paragraph
"The Romans built extensive villas,",Paragraph
"including a new palace for the emperor,",Paragraph
the Palace of Domitian (also known as,Paragraph
"Flavian Palace), which was completed",Paragraph
in 92 CE during the reign of Titus Flavius,Paragraph
Domitianus and attributed to his master,Paragraph
"architect, Rabirius. The very word palace",Paragraph
is thought to have derived from its location,Paragraph
on the Palatine Hill. It consisted of a series,Paragraph
"of open courtyards that define imperial,",Paragraph
"ceremonial, and private activities. The plan",Paragraph
is a master class in spatial organization.,Paragraph
This period also saw the construction of the,Paragraph
"Colosseum (72-80 CE), which could hold up",Paragraph
"to 80,000 spectators, and the rise of vast",Paragraph
urban-scale entertainment. Unlike earlier,Paragraph
"such structures that were built into hillsides,",Paragraph
"this is an entirely freestanding structure, its",Paragraph
monumental facade comprising three stories,Caption
of superimposed arcades surmounted by,Caption
a tall attic story. The building was used to,Paragraph
host gladiatorial shows and a variety of other,Title

"great variety of wild beasts, mainly imported",Paragraph
"from Africa and the Middle East, and battles",Title
that required elaborate sets with movable,Paragraph
buildings. Apparently there were even,Paragraph
simulated sea battles. The Colosseum was,Paragraph
so vast that the building was also used as a,Paragraph
quarry until well into the 15th century. Most,Paragraph
significant in the transformation of Rome was,Paragraph
"the construction of the Imperial Forums, built",Paragraph
between 46 BCE and 113 CE. These are a,Paragraph
series of interconnected monumental plazas,Paragraph
celebrating the accomplishments of emperors,Title
"Caesar, Augustus, Nerva, and Trajan. This",Paragraph
"ensemble of forums was unique in the world,",Paragraph
"with an interconnected fabric of colonnades,",Paragraph
"temples, libraries, statues, altars, and public",Title
spaces.,Paragraph
"In China, the Qin dynasty, systernatically",Paragraph
"annexing all competing states, created",Paragraph
a centralized government with a,Title
correspondingly large bureaucracy. For this,Paragraph
achievement the Qin emperor Shi Huangdi,Title
"is known as the First Emperor. It is, in",Paragraph
"fact, from the word gin (or ch’in) that the",Paragraph
name China derives. Shi Huangdi’s public,Paragraph
works included the unification of diverse,Paragraph
efforts at building defensive walls into a,Paragraph
"single effort, known as the Great Wall, that",Paragraph
would be the hallmark of China’s defense,Paragraph
against the northern nomads for centuries to,Paragraph
come. He divided China into a hierarchy of,Paragraph
"administrative units: commanderies, districts,",Paragraph
and counties. The system was different from,Paragraph
"that of previous dynasties, which had loose",Paragraph
alliances and federations. He also created a,Paragraph
systern of advancement in the bureaucracy,Title
based on merit instead of hereditary rights.,Paragraph
"His rule was brutal, however, and his dynasty",Paragraph
collapsed with his death. The tomb that he,Paragraph
"built was at the time, and perhaps remains to",Paragraph
"this day, one of the most elaborate ever made",Paragraph
anywhere in the world. It had at its core a,Paragraph
room that contained a vast landscape model,Paragraph
of the empire. The building was surrounded,Paragraph
"by high walls of tamped earth, and the whole",Paragraph
was covered with tons of earth to make a,Paragraph
"gigantic mound, in the vicinity of which were",Paragraph
extensive pits that contained thousands of,Paragraph
statues of soldiers and horses. This army was,Paragraph
there to protect the deceased in the afterlife.,Paragraph
The representations of both man and animal,Title
were so meticulous that we have an excellent,Paragraph
idea of the clothing and even the bridles of,Paragraph
the time.,Paragraph
The Qin dynasty gave way to the Han,Paragraph
dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE). It was an age,Paragraph
"of economic prosperity, with the economy",Paragraph
of the Silk Route drawing China ever,Title
closer to both the wealth and the problems,Paragraph
associated with cross-continental trade. The,Paragraph
lynasty had contact with the Kushans and,Paragraph
the Parthians as well as with Burma and,Paragraph
"Japan. An embassy frorn Rome, perhaps",Paragraph
"of merchants, is recorded to have reached",Paragraph
the court in 166 CE. But as was typical of,Paragraph
"the Chinese imperial system, court politics",Title
and power struggles between the various,Title
clans and military elites caused the Han’s,Paragraph
"ultimate downfall. Their capital was Chang'an,",Paragraph
the largest and wealthiest city in the world,Paragraph
at the time. When the Han lost control of,Paragraph
"the city in 9 CE, they moved their capital to",Paragraph
"the relative safety of the east, to Luoyang.",Paragraph
"Chang'‘an (which means “Perpetual Peace"")",Paragraph
was destroyed in 24 CE (to be refounded,Paragraph
and redesigned at an even greater scale in,Paragraph
"582). Unlike almost every other civilization,",Paragraph
the great cities of China were often destroyed,Paragraph
not by foreign invasion but by inner rebellion,Title
or the transformation from one dynasty to,Title
"another, when entire cities would be put to",Paragraph
the torch. This is one of the reasons that so,Paragraph
little Chinese architecture has survived the,Paragraph
ages.,Paragraph
"From a religious point of view, this period",Paragraph
was one of extraordinary experimentation,Paragraph
and transformation that developed out of,Paragraph
Hellenistic experimentations. Old static,Paragraph
religions were replaced by mystery cults,Paragraph
and religions that emphasized personal,Paragraph
salvation. Along with the established mystery,Paragraph
"cults at Eleusis and elsewhere, Judaic cults",Paragraph
developed a new concept known today,Paragraph
as heaven. Christians began following the,Paragraph
"teachings of Christ; and Mithraism, with its",Paragraph
complex system of purification rites and ritual,Title
"meals in underground temples, was popular",Paragraph
"among Roman soldiers. The cult of Isis, with",Paragraph
"its emphasis on mother and baby, was also",Paragraph
spreading throughout the Mediterranean.,Paragraph
"In India, Buddhism began to develop",Paragraph
into a set of codified written sutras around,Paragraph
the 1st century BCE. These sutras allowed,Paragraph
the teachings to be easily disserninated and,Paragraph
translated. One of the key sites of the new,Paragraph
"religion was at Sanchi, where a stupa was",Paragraph
built in the 3rd century BCE. It consisted,Paragraph
"of a simple hemispherical brick structure,",Paragraph
"crowned by a chatra, a parasol-like structure,",Paragraph
the traditional symbol of high rank. It was,Paragraph
covered with stone during the period of the,Paragraph
Sunga Empire (187-75 BCE). The idea of,Paragraph
a structure as a solid mass harkens back,Paragraph
"to Egyptian and Mesopotamian worldviews,",Paragraph
but it also relates more possibly to traditions,Paragraph
brought into India from steppe people who,Paragraph
commemorated the dead by making stone,Title
"heaps. During this time, however, Buddhism’s",Paragraph
importance as a stand-alone religion began to,Paragraph
"wane in India, even though it spread rapidly",Paragraph
into other parts of Asia.,Paragraph
India was mainly controlled by the,Paragraph
"Satavahanas (230 BCE-220 CE), who",Paragraph
were known for their commercialism. A,Paragraph
contemporary text (ca. 60 CE) notes that,Paragraph
ships were outfitted to bring “the products,Paragraph
"of their own places; wheat, rice, clarified",Paragraph
"butter, sesame oil, cotton cloth...and honey",Paragraph
from the reed called sacchari [sugar]. Some,Paragraph
make the voyage especially to these market-,Paragraph
"towns, and others exchange their cargoes",Paragraph
while sailing along the coast.” (Periplus of,Paragraph
"the Erythraean Sea, chapter 14). It was along",Paragraph
the trade routes that Buddhism spread.,Paragraph
The Satavahanas produced the first wave,Paragraph
of Indian cultural expansion eastward into,Title
"Southeast Asia, a process that would be",Paragraph
known as Indianization and that would have,Paragraph
profound consequences to political and,Title

modern scholars is t,Title

a summary of folk memories enhanced by,Paragraph
wishful thinking.,Paragraph
"Nonetheless, archaeological evidence",Paragraph
has not yet been able to undermine this,Paragraph
general narrative. Around the 4th century,Paragraph
"BCE, Rome became conquest-oriented, and",Paragraph
one by one the neighboring cities and tribes,Title
were brought under its control. When the,Paragraph
Greek city of Tarentum in southern Italy,Title
"(Apulia) fell in 272 BCE, Rome enslaved all",Paragraph
its citizens. The fall of Syracuse in Sicily,Paragraph
followed in 212 BCE. The sack of the Greek,Paragraph
city of Corinth in 146 BCE brought Greece,Paragraph
"itself under Roman control, and with the",Paragraph
conquest of Carthage on the north coast of,Paragraph
"Africa, Rome assumed uncontested control",Paragraph
over the Mediterranean basin. The religious,Paragraph
life of the Romans centered on the Temple of,Paragraph
Saturn (498 BCE) and the Temple of Concord,Title
(367 BCE) on the Capitoline Hill. Little is,Paragraph
"known about these temples, but they were",Paragraph
most probably Etruscan in style. The civic,Paragraph
heart was the Comitium (whence comes the,Paragraph
"word committee), a meeting place located",Paragraph
on the forum just below the Capitoline Hill. It,Paragraph
was a shallow circular amphitheater in front,Paragraph
"of the council chamber, or curia. Though not",Paragraph
"a building, it was nonetheless a fempilum, or",Paragraph
sacred space laid out on a north-south axis.,Paragraph
"Over time, a speaker's platform—the",Paragraph
"rostrum, named after the ships’ prows that",Paragraph
were hung there following the Battle of Antium,Paragraph
in 338 BCE—was added. The forum (which,Paragraph
is the Latin word for “outdoor public place”),Paragraph
was more than just an open space. It was a,Paragraph
composite of several symbolic layers. A few,Paragraph
"feet away from the Comitium, for example,",Paragraph
"was the Umbilicus, the navel of the city of",Paragraph
Rome. It was the syrnbolic center of the city;,Paragraph
all distances in ancient Rome were measured,Paragraph
from it. The Umbilicus had a cylindrical shape,Paragraph
"and was about 4 meters in diameter, but",Paragraph
most importantly it had a door that allowed,Paragraph
priests to ritually feed the “navel” over which,Paragraph
"it stood. Behind rose the Capitoline Hill, on",Paragraph
the upper slopes of which stood a building,Paragraph
"called the Tabularium, constructed around",Paragraph
"78 BCE. Built out along the cliff edge, it",Paragraph
featured two stories of arcades overlooking,Caption
the forum. The building housed the Roman,Paragraph
law tablets. At the southern end of the forum,Caption
"was the Temple of Vesta, tended by the Vestal",Paragraph
Virgins. Vesta means simply “hearth.” The,Paragraph
women who served the temple took a vow of,Paragraph
chastity in order to devote themselves to the,Paragraph
study and correct observance of state rituals.,Paragraph

and proceeded through the Roman Forum. It,Paragraph
was eventually paved and during the reign of,Paragraph
Nero was lined with colonnades. On both sides,Paragraph
of the forum there was a building type invented,Paragraph
"by the Romans, the basilica. These were",Paragraph
rectangular buildings somewhat similar to a,Paragraph
"Greek stoa, except that they had a central aisle",Paragraph
that tended to be higher than the flanking aisles,Paragraph
so that light could penetrate through clerestory,Paragraph
windows beneath the roof of the higher center,Caption
section. The buildings served as law courts,Paragraph
and as places where legal matters could be,Paragraph
transacted. Temporary partitions were set up for,Paragraph
"proceedings, as there were no wall partitions.",Paragraph
"6.7 Plan: Basiica Aemilia, Rome",Caption
Though there is a debate about who exactly,Paragraph
"the Romans were, there can be no doubt",Paragraph
that they were deeply rooted in Etruscan,Paragraph
custom. This means that almost everything,Paragraph
"was connected to ritual observances, at the",Paragraph
core of which was the sacrifice that served,Paragraph
as a type of consummation of deals made,Paragraph
between the supplicant and a specific god.,Paragraph
Supplicants could be an individual or an,Paragraph
entire city. Precise adherence to ritual was,Paragraph
"essential, since deviations could contaminate",Paragraph
the results. Important sacrifices involved,Paragraph
animal victims. Each deity had his or,Paragraph
her own preference as to what was to be,Paragraph
sacrificed. The sex of a chosen animal was,Paragraph
"also significant: male for gods, female for",Paragraph
goddesses. So was its color: white beasts were,Paragraph
"offered to deities of the upper world, black",Paragraph
to those of the underworld. The sacrifice for,Paragraph
"Mars was usually a combination of an ox, a",Paragraph
"ram, and a boar. Sacrifices took place in front",Paragraph
of an altar and were elaborate and messy,Paragraph
routines. The head of the victim was sprinkled,Paragraph
with wine and with bits of sacred cake made,Paragraph
from flour and salt. The animal was then,Paragraph
stunned with an axe or mallet before its throat,Paragraph
"was slit. It was then disemboweled, and the",Paragraph
liver and other organs were inspected. If there,Paragraph
"was something wrong, this was considered",Paragraph
a bad omen and the process had to be,Paragraph
repeated with a fresh animal until it came,Paragraph
out right. The vital organs were burnt upon,Paragraph
the altar and the carcass was cut into pieces,Paragraph
"and eaten on the spot, with all participants in",Paragraph
the ritual receiving a piece of the animal. For,Paragraph
"large urban-scale sacrifices, this could entail",Paragraph
a large number of animals. All sacrifices and,Paragraph
offerings required an accompanying prayer,Title
to be effective. Public religious ritual had to,Paragraph
be enacted by specialists and professionals,Paragraph
faultlessly; a mistake might require that the,Paragraph
"action, or even the entire festival, be repeated",Paragraph
from the start. Even private prayer by an,Paragraph
"individual was formulaic, a recitation rather",Paragraph
than a personal expression. The disasters of,Paragraph
the early part of the Second Punic War were,Paragraph
attributed by the Roman historian Livy to a,Paragraph
"growth of superstitious cults, errors in augury,",Paragraph
"and the neglect of Rome's traditional gods,",Paragraph

"The building did, however, make a",Paragraph
unigue Roman contribution to the field of,Paragraph
architecture. Except for the columns and,Paragraph
"other architectural elements, the structure,",Paragraph
"including the support vaults, was built entirely",Paragraph
of concrete. Exploiting the potential of the,Paragraph
"new material, several kinds of vaults were",Paragraph
"used, including ramping and annular forms.",Paragraph
That the facade of the upper level rested on,Paragraph
"a vault, rather than on the wall beneath it,",Paragraph
would have been unthinkable in the days,Paragraph
before concrete. Though concrete had been,Paragraph
"known to Romans since 190 BCE, it was not",Paragraph
able to support great weight. But during the,Paragraph
period of Praeneste’s construction a new form,Paragraph
"of cement, known as pozzolana, came into",Paragraph
use. It was made with volcanic ash from the,Paragraph
Vesuvius area—especially from the city of,Paragraph
"Pozzuoli, from which it took its name. Roman",Paragraph
architects might not have understood the,Paragraph
"chemistry, but they were well aware of its",Paragraph
exceptional properties—especially of its ability,Paragraph
"to set underwater, which facilitated the design",Paragraph
of ports and harbors. Though the famous,Paragraph
Roman architectural theorist Vitruvius was,Paragraph
still highly suspicious of the material when he,Paragraph
"wrote his treatise in 40 BCE, the architects of",Paragraph
the Temple of Fortuna Primigenia showed no,Paragraph
lack of confidence.,Paragraph
Roman concrete consisted of three parts:,Paragraph
"hydrate lime, pozzolan ash, and a few pieces",Paragraph
of fist-sized rocks. The trick to a strong bond,Paragraph
was not just in the mix but also in the proper,Paragraph
application. A formwork was constructed of,Paragraph
wood in the desired shape. Laborers hand-,Paragraph
mixed the wet lime and volcanic ash in a,Paragraph
mortar box with very little water to give a,Paragraph
nearly dry composition. They carried it to the,Paragraph

"job site in baskets, placing it over a prepared",Paragraph
"layer of rock pieces, and then pounded the",Paragraph

Once the process of laying the concrete,Paragraph
"had begun, it had to be carried through",Paragraph
without pause in order to avoid seams.,Paragraph
"Pouring large structures was a complex,",Paragraph
"around-the-clock process. Modern concrete,",Paragraph
"being wetter, shrinks when it dries and is,",Paragraph

"concrete was pounded—the pounding, as",Paragraph
"the engineer David Moore has discovered,",Paragraph

process that makes the material hard.,Paragraph
Opus testaceum,Title
The earliest form of Roman concrete is,Paragraph
known as opus incertum. Opus is the Latin,Paragraph
"word for “work,” so opus incerturm means",Paragraph
"something like “worked in,” which makes",Paragraph
sense since the concrete was layered with,Paragraph
irregularly shaped uncut stones or fist-sized,Paragraph
locks of tufa. Tufa is a relatively lightweight,Paragraph
"stone and is thus easy to use. Over time,",Paragraph
a more finished look was produced using,Paragraph
more regularly shaped stones. A variant is,Paragraph
nown as opus reticulatum. Reticulatum is,Paragraph
Latin for “netlike.” This form of concrete wall,Paragraph
consists of diamond-shaped bricks of tufa,Paragraph
placed around a core of cernent. The blocks,Paragraph
were placed at an angle of 45 degrees to,Paragraph
form a diagonal pattern. This construction,Paragraph
technique was used from the beginning of,Paragraph
the 1st century BCE until opus /atericium,Title
came common in the imperial age. In opus,Paragraph
"fatericium, the concrete wall is surfaced with",Paragraph
rick.,Paragraph
The Romans also industrialized the,Paragraph
production of bricks. Their armies operated,Paragraph
mobile kilns so that they could build,Paragraph
"structures rapidly. In this way, they introduced",Paragraph
bricks to many parts of the empire. Roman,Paragraph
bricks are often stamped with the mark of the,Paragraph
army legion that supervised their production.,Paragraph

"these activities. The Celts also exported salt,",Paragraph

"the Greek and Roman territories was wine,",Paragraph
transported northward with great difficulty in,Paragraph
large amphorae. The Celts had a polytheistic,Paragraph
"and animistic religion, with shrines situated",Paragraph
"on hilltops, in groves, and on lakes. They",Paragraph
"worshipped both gods and goddesses, many",Paragraph
associated with natural features like springs,Paragraph

Rome's shift from republic to empire,Title
coincided with the trend of deifying rulers.,Paragraph
Caesar was the first to experience such an,Paragraph
"apotheosis; after that, it became common",Paragraph
practice for emperors to be equated with,Paragraph
"divinity. Emperor Augustus, who followed",Paragraph
"Caesar, changed Rome. It is said that he",Paragraph
"found Rome a city of brick, but that when",Paragraph
"he died, he left it a city of marble. This is not",Paragraph
"far from the truth, for in the forty years of his",Paragraph
"reign, Augustus practically rebuilt the entire",Paragraph
"city, and more than anything, he remodeled",Paragraph
the Roman Forum.,Paragraph
To understand the magnitude of these,Paragraph
"efforts, we have to remember that before",Paragraph
"Augustus’s long tenure (27 BCE-14 CE),",Paragraph
Rome was an unattractive and even unsafe,Paragraph
"city. It had a population of one million; crime,",Paragraph
"corruption, speculation, and misrnanagernent",Title
caused the temples to be neglected and the,Paragraph
public structures to crumble. Many parts of,Paragraph
the city were nothing better than slums. Fires,Paragraph
"broke out continuously—in 16, 14, 12, and",Paragraph
7 BCE—while floods ravaged low-lying areas.,Paragraph
Among Augustus's efforts was an attempt,Paragraph
to bring order to the core of the city. After,Paragraph
"a major storm, he asked for a study of roof",Paragraph
"tiles. He also created a new water system,",Paragraph
"restored eighty-two temples, increase",Caption

today as the Ten Books on Architecture.,Paragraph
Though the book contains a vast amount of,Paragraph
"useful information on construction materials,",Paragraph
"choice of site, and even the education of an",Paragraph
"architect, Vitruvius was generally critical of",Paragraph
the architectural developments of his age. He,Paragraph
was hesitant to accept concrete and felt that,Paragraph
many of the new buildings commissioned,Paragraph
y Augustus were built without guiding,Paragraph
principles. In attempting to reestablish,Paragraph
"these principles, he argued that the three",Paragraph
"orders—Doric, lonic, and Corinthian—should",Paragraph
e governed by proportions unique to,Paragraph
each. Vitruvius also differentiated between,Paragraph
"firmitas, utilitas, and venustas (“durability,”",Paragraph
"“usefulness,” and “beauty”). Each building,",Paragraph
"e argued, needed to be designed with these",Paragraph
"criteria in mind. A warehouse, for example,",Paragraph
"should be built with usefulness in mind,",Paragraph
"ut not be unpleasant to look at, whereas a",Paragraph
"palace should be built with beauty in mind,",Paragraph

DEVELOPMENT OF MAHAYANA,Title
BUDDHISM,Title
"Late in the 2nd century BCE, Asoka’s",Paragraph
"Mauryan Empire began to disintegrate,",Paragraph
resulting in the formation of a series of,Paragraph
"smaller kingdoms: the Sunga in the west, the",Paragraph
"Satavahanas to the south, and in the north,",Paragraph
the Shakas. This transformation paralleled,Paragraph
an equally significant transformation within,Paragraph
Buddhism that had important implications,Title
in the field of architecture. As originally,Paragraph
"conceived, Buddhist monkhood was strictly",Paragraph
mendicant. Its members lived without,Paragraph
money and survived by begging; they,Paragraph
"were not allowed to erect shrines, acquire",Paragraph
"property, or deify the Buddha. This form",Paragraph
of Buddhism was subsequently referred to,Paragraph
as Hinayana (or the “Lesser Vehicle”). In,Paragraph
"time, as Buddhism began to receive royal",Paragraph
patronage and its practitioners became more,Paragraph
"diverse, a more monastic and populist form",Paragraph
"of Buddhism, known as Mahayana (or the",Paragraph
“Greater Vehicle”) emerged that required the,Paragraph
establishment of institutions where monks,Title
could live and study.,Paragraph
The transformation can be tracked,Paragraph
through the four great Buddhist councils,Title
called to reconcile differences in,Paragraph
interpretation. King Ajatsatru convened the,Paragraph
first Buddhist council in the 5th century,Title
"BCE, soon after the Buddha’s death, in",Paragraph
order to record the extant sayings of the,Paragraph
Buddha (sutras) and to codify the rules of,Paragraph
mendicancy. Continuing conflicts between,Paragraph
the Hinayana and Mahayana schools of,Paragraph
Buddhism prompted the convening of the,Paragraph
"second Buddhist council in 383 BCE, a third",Paragraph
"in 250 BCE, and a fourth around 100 CE, at",Paragraph
which time three hundred thousand verses,Title
and over nine million statements were,Paragraph
compiled and written in Sanskrit. These,Paragraph
"became the basis of Mahayana Buddhism,",Paragraph
which soon began to flourish and spread into,Paragraph
"Central Asia, China, Korea, and Japan.",Paragraph
Significant parts of the Mahayana,Title
"credo were articulated by Nagarjuna, the",Paragraph
2nd-century Indian philosopher and the,Title
most influential Buddhist thinker after the,Paragraph
Buddha himself. Nagarjuna promoted what,Paragraph
"is known as the Middle Path, a compromise",Paragraph
between the ascetic and the worldly sects,Title
"of Buddhism. He argued that Asoka, as a",Paragraph
"virtuous Buddhist king, was a cakravartin",Paragraph
and should thus be considered to have,Paragraph
"direct access to nirvana, or Buddhahood.",Paragraph
Nagarjuna’s definition of kingship served as,Paragraph
a model for generations of rulers throughout,Paragraph

Sanchi Complex,Title
The Buddhist sanctuary known as Sanchi,Paragraph
was founded by Asoka and flourished for,Paragraph
thirteen centuries. The complex is located,Paragraph
"near the ancient town of Vidisa, along the",Paragraph
fertile river valleys of the southern trade route,Title
(or dakshinapatha). It is located on a hill,Paragraph
"that rises sharply above the valley, making",Paragraph
its stupas distinctly visible from afar. The,Paragraph
surrounding hills are also surmounted by,Paragraph
"stupas, all of which establish the area as a",Paragraph
sacred landscape. Originally the stupas were,Paragraph
"plastered and painted, and on festival days",Paragraph
gaily decorated with flowers and other ritual,Paragraph
offerings. Large groups of visiting monks and,Paragraph
laity alike came to Sanchi in processions.,Paragraph
"Stupas started out as reliquary mounds, or",Paragraph
"caityas, which can denote any sacred place—",Paragraph
such as where a funeral pyre or consecration,Paragraph
had occurred; they were usually marked off,Paragraph
by a wooden railing. Asoka had the Buddha’s,Paragraph
bodily remains divided into eight parts and,Paragraph
"distributed throughout his empire as relics,",Paragraph
with their locations marked by ceremonial,Paragraph
mounds (stupa means “piled up”).,Paragraph
"6.75 Stupa II at Sanchi, near Bhopal, India",Caption
"Built by the thousands, stupas became the",Paragraph
"dominant symbol of Buddhism. Conceptually,",Paragraph
a stupa is a cosmological diagrarn linking,Paragraph
the body of the Buddha to the universe.,Paragraph
The fundamental elements of a stupa are,Paragraph
"present in the oldest of Sanchi’s stupas,",Paragraph
Stupa II (ca. 100 BCE). The central mass,Caption
consists of an earthen hemispherical mound,Paragraph
"faced with fired bricks, with a shallow berm",Paragraph
(or medhi) ringing its base. This round,Paragraph
structure is then surrounded by a stone,Paragraph
balustrade (or vedika) that replicates a,Paragraph
construction out of wood. Both the interior,Caption
and exterior surface of the vedika are,Paragraph
carved with shallow reliefs and medallions,Caption
depicting scenes and events of Budchist,Paragraph
significance. The vedika has openings on,Paragraph
"four sides, aligned to the cardinal directions.",Paragraph
"These are accessed not on axis, however,",Paragraph
"but at right angles, through entrances whose",Paragraph
openings face counterclockwise. The cross-,Paragraph
"axis of the cardinal directions, coupled with",Paragraph

in the form of a svastika (or “swastika”).,Paragraph
"The directions represent space, and the",Paragraph
"entrances, replicating the movement of the",Paragraph
"stars, represent time. The purpose of the",Paragraph
vedika is to also give spatial definition to the,Paragraph
ritual counterclockwise circumambulation of,Title
"parikrama. A Buddhist monk, or a pilgrim,",Paragraph

Rock-cut architecture has a venerable history,Paragraph

"At its peak, it was one of the most densely",Paragraph
populated and culturally dynamic societies,Title
in the world. Many of the pre-classical sites,Paragraph
"declined by the 3rd century CE, leaving the",Paragraph
cities in northern Guatemala dominant. The,Paragraph
Mayas developed a religious philosophy,Paragraph
controlled by a professional priesthood built,Paragraph
around the importance of astronomical,Title
manifestations that were part of the eternal,Paragraph
struggle between the powers of good and,Title
"evil. The benevolent gods brought thunder,",Paragraph
"lightning, and rain, and insured abundance,",Paragraph
"whereas the malevolent ones brought death,",Paragraph
"destruction, hurricanes, and war. The religion",Paragraph
developed into a worship of time in its various,Paragraph
manifestations; it was highly esoteric in,Paragraph
"nature, requiring priests, rathernaticians,",Paragraph
and prophets. Dancing was an important,Paragraph
"aspect of religious ceremonies, as was the",Paragraph
giving of sacrifices. These ranged from food,Paragraph
offerings and ornaments (like feathers and,Paragraph
shells) to the practice of human sacrifice.,Paragraph
This specialized production and,Paragraph
dependency on foreign trade might have,Paragraph
been the reason for both the success and the,Paragraph
eventual demise of the Mayas. Trees were,Paragraph
felled to fuel the kilns in which limestone was,Paragraph
"burned. Deforestation, it has been suggested,",Paragraph
led to a gradual erosion of both land and,Paragraph
"wealth. By 350 BCE, a centralized elite was",Paragraph
able to control large labor populations whose,Paragraph
rapid rate of production was aided by the,Paragraph
development of standardized construction,Title
modules and faster stonecutting techniques.,Paragraph
It is during this period that monumental,Paragraph
Mayan architecture—at a scale never,Title
seen previously—emerged in the Yucatan,Paragraph
Peninsula. An abundance of massive,Paragraph
"architectural assemblages, ranging from 40",Paragraph
"to 72 meters high, are found in the Mirador",Paragraph
"basin. Since they are located in marshes,",Paragraph
all the major building groups were raised on,Paragraph
large platforms that were then connected by,Paragraph
elevated causeways.,Paragraph
"Located in the Petén region of Guatemala,",Paragraph
"habitation at Nakbe started around 1400 BCE,",Paragraph
reaching its height between 600 and,Paragraph
350 BCE. Its central area was constructed on,Paragraph
a massive man-made platform surmounted,Paragraph
by three mounds. The mounds contained,Paragraph
"clusters of temples, with the tallest structure,",Paragraph
"at 50 meters, on the west platform; the one",Paragraph
on the east platform was 30 meters high.,Paragraph
Nakbe was linked by causeways made of,Paragraph
"white crushed rock to adjoining settlements,",Paragraph
"including the one at El Mirador, its rival to the",Paragraph
north.,Paragraph
"In general, the organization of early",Paragraph
Mayan ceremonial complexes was devoted to,Paragraph
creating distinct visual hierarchies by means,Paragraph
of a system of interconnected raised platform,Paragraph
terraces surmounted by ternples. The central,Caption
ceremonial complex at Nakbe consists of,Paragraph
"two major, connected, built-up platforms (the",Paragraph
"eastern one 32 meters high, and the western",Paragraph
"one 45 meters high), on top of which the",Paragraph
principal structures are clustered.,Paragraph

The eastern platform has two parts. One,Paragraph
is a cluster of low-platform structures on a,Paragraph
"terrace, creating a court that is anchored on",Paragraph
its west side by a large freestanding pyramid.,Paragraph
"The other part has a larger pyramid, which",Paragraph
"is visible from the court, but whose access",Paragraph
was restricted to priestly use. Thus a complex,Paragraph
ceremonial whole was forrmed—with multiple,Paragraph
hierarchically organized spatial and visual,Title
centers—that was used for a variety of,Paragraph
ceremonial functions.,Paragraph
Across the causeway is the western,Paragraph
"platform, which consists of three terraced",Paragraph
"courtyards, the highest of which supports the",Paragraph
"large pyramid; as with the others, access is",Paragraph
restricted through the small courtyard in front,Paragraph
of it. Since the function of Mayan pyramids,Paragraph
"was to support the temple, they were always",Paragraph
flat-topped. The pyramid itself consisted of,Paragraph
tightly cornpressed layers of stones and clay,Paragraph
sealed by a brick casing.,Paragraph
El Mirador,Title
"Just north of Nakbe, El Mirador (Spanish",Caption
or “lookout”) was an early Mayan city that,Paragraph
reached its cultural high point between,Paragraph
150 BCE and 150 CE. Though the city,Paragraph
was spread out over an area of 16 square,Paragraph

INTRODUCTION,Title
"In the year 200 CE, Rome, Chang'an, and",Paragraph
Teotihuacan were the world's megacities; all,Paragraph
three were the capitals of vast empires. Cities,Paragraph
at this scale impacted the world even in far-,Paragraph
off places. They required an extensive trade,Paragraph
"in luxury items, with everything embedded in",Paragraph
"a system of revenue production, collection,",Paragraph
"and control, not to mention an army and",Paragraph
"territorial mastery. Above all, there had to be",Paragraph
"an imperial awe. And in this respect, the idea",Paragraph
of “tradition” in both Rome and China was,Paragraph
not a phenomenon emerging naturally over,Paragraph
time. It had to be enforced and re-enforced,Paragraph
"from the top down, against the rising tide of",Paragraph
social and economic transformations.,Paragraph
"Between 100 and 300 CE, the Roman",Paragraph
Empire in particular grew into one of the,Paragraph
greatest and most extensive empires in,Title
"the world. For centuries, it had traded with",Paragraph
"the Celts to the north, mainly exchanging",Paragraph
"metals for Roman wine, but once Rome had",Paragraph
"conquered the Celts and Romanized them,",Paragraph
the Romans discovered that the Germanic,Paragraph
tribes to the east were much more difficult,Paragraph
to pacify. The expansion of the territory,Paragraph
"paid off, however, in the short term. Wealth",Paragraph
"was lavished on temples, palaces, baths,",Paragraph
"aqueducts, libraries, courts, streets, theaters,",Paragraph
and amphitheaters. The development of,Paragraph
"Roman architecture, the most extensive",Paragraph
urban architecture of any civilization to that,Paragraph
"date, reached from England to North Africa",Paragraph
"and from Spain to the Levant, and would",Paragraph
have a profound impact on subsequent,Paragraph
developments throughout Europe and beyond,Title
for centuries to come. The Han dynasty,Paragraph
"in China was also building cities, palaces,",Paragraph
"and tombs on a massive scale, helped by",Paragraph
remarkable advances in technology and,Title
mining. But because their architecture was,Paragraph
"all built out of wood and tamped earth,",Paragraph
comparatively little has survived the ages.,Paragraph
"Their western capital, Chang'an, served as",Paragraph
the Silk Route’s eastern terminus.,Paragraph
"Both Rome and China, in facing the",Paragraph
rapid changes that came with expansion,Title
"and cross-cultural contact, came to place",Paragraph
"strong counter-emphasis on tradition, which",Paragraph
was instrumentalized as a condition of state,Paragraph
control. Traditions were promulgated and,Paragraph
enforced as a way to define the principle of,Paragraph
"stability. Augustus, the first emperor, claimed",Paragraph
that he needed to create an empire precisely,Paragraph
to restore Roman tradition to its former,Paragraph
"glory. And in China, tradition was imposed",Paragraph
and self-imposed on the Chinese through,Paragraph
"Confucianism, which promoted security and",Paragraph
predictability for the elites.,Paragraph
Linking China and Rome were the,Paragraph
"Parthians, a horse-based tribal society of",Paragraph
former nomads who established themselves,Title
as a ruling elite in Mesopotamia and Central,Paragraph
Asia. Since they were not an architecture-,Paragraph
"oriented culture, they allowed local cults to",Paragraph
continue. But they were keen traders and,Paragraph
played an important part in maintaining,Paragraph

The Parthians eventually lost control of the,Paragraph

"came to be known as the Sassanians, who",Paragraph
unified their control under the heading of,Paragraph
"Zoroastrianism. They built numerous cities,",Paragraph
"many of them circular, presumably to give the",Paragraph
inhabitants a defensive tactical advantage.,Paragraph
"Among these was Firuzabad, built under",Paragraph
Ardashir | (r. 224-42 Ce). It had a diameter,Paragraph
"of 2 kilometers, with two roads dividing it",Paragraph
"into four districts, which in turn were divided",Paragraph
into five smaller sectors and thus ordered,Paragraph
the entire city in twenty sectors. The detailed,Paragraph
planning seems to have continued in the,Paragraph
surrounding landscape. The Sassanians,Paragraph
"also built enormous citadels, such as the",Paragraph
"Falak-ol-Aflak Castle (226-651 CE), situated",Paragraph
on the top of a large hill within the city of,Paragraph
"Khorramabad, Iran. This gigantic structure",Paragraph
measured approximately 300 by 400 meters,Paragraph
and had twelve towers and massive walls.,Paragraph
The religious innovations taking place,Title
"in various parts of Eurasia, in combination",Paragraph
with the cross-Asian circulatory system,Paragraph
"that was now abuzz with traffic, led to",Paragraph
important transformations in western Asia,Title
with long-term ramifications beyond its,Paragraph
immediate geographical range. The old,Paragraph
Mesopotamian religions with their complex,Title
pantheons were superseded by Hellenistic,Paragraph
"and Iranian mystery cults, by sun cults,",Paragraph
by Zoroastrianism’s fire worship—and by,Paragraph
"Christianity, itself an outgrowth of Hellenistic",Paragraph
"sensibilities. Generally, these new religious",Paragraph
practices were more personal than their,Paragraph
"forerunners. Another emerging religion,",Paragraph
"Mithraism, was increasingly practiced",Paragraph
by the soldiery in the far-flung provinces,Paragraph
of the Roman Empire and would impact,Paragraph
"Christianity. Buddhism, which has to be",Paragraph
understood as part of this search for ethical,Paragraph
"self-transformation, was also developing",Paragraph
"rapidly, moving deeper and deeper into China",Paragraph
and Southeast Asia in the form of monastic,Paragraph
schools located along the trade routes.,Paragraph
"In Central Asia, the nomadic Yueh-chi",Paragraph
from Mongolia established the Kushan,Paragraph
Empire (1st century BCE to 3rd century CE),Title
that stretched from parts of Afghanistan and,Paragraph
lran to Pataliputra in the central Gangetic,Title
Plains in the east and down to Sanchi in the,Paragraph

they quickly adopted the typical cross-Asian,Paragraph
"organization of society, where they, as the",Paragraph
"aristocratic warrior class, were on top. Below",Paragraph
"them were the merchants, and below the",Paragraph
merchants were the artisans and peasants.,Paragraph
The Kushans understood the uniqueness,Paragraph
of their geographical location in the former,Paragraph
Graeco-Bactrian world. They had three,Paragraph
basic agendas: to actively promote trade,Title
along the Silk Route; to promote artisanal,Paragraph

"production of luxury goods; and finally, to",Paragraph
promote the expansion of agriculture in the,Paragraph
otherwise mountainous and arid lands. India,Paragraph
"exported spices like pepper, ginger, and",Paragraph
"saffron, as well as sugar, dyes, perfumes,",Paragraph
and gems. Trade was a hugely lucrative,Paragraph
"business for Kushans, who augmented",Paragraph
"this with commodities that they produced,",Paragraph
"like bronze, tin, and glassware. The new",Paragraph
rulers also developed local industries like,Paragraph
silversmithing for jewelry and ironsmithing for,Title
"weapons. And finally, they made miles and",Paragraph
miles of canals to irrigate mountain slopes,Title
"and valleys. One of these is the Zang Canal,",Paragraph
"located in Surxondaryo, Uzbekistan, which",Paragraph
drew water from Surkhan River. There were,Paragraph
similar canals along the Amu Darya. The,Paragraph
water irrigated the vineyards the Kushans,Paragraph
"planted, as wine, the drink of the Greeks,",Paragraph
was now an important luxury export to India.,Paragraph
"This astonishing burst of activity, far from",Paragraph
"the traditional centers of civilization, resulted",Paragraph
in an empire that was unique. It became a,Paragraph
"melting pot for people and ideas from India,",Paragraph
"Persia, China, and even the Roman Empire.",Paragraph
At first the Kushans absorbed the,Paragraph
remnants of the Greek culture of the,Title
"Hellenistic kingdoms, becoming at least partly",Paragraph
Hellenized. They even spoke Greek. Some,Paragraph
of the elites adopted Zoroastrianism from,Paragraph
"the Persians, others embraced some form of",Paragraph
"Hinduism, and yet others became Buddhist.",Paragraph
Whereas their first coins depict the Kushans,Paragraph
dressed in heavy coats and big felt hats,Title
"appropriate to the steppe, later coins show",Paragraph
them dressed in Greek togas or lightweight,Paragraph
tunics. The first documented translation,Paragraph
efforts by foreign Buddhist monks in China,Title
"were in the 2nd century CE, probably as a",Paragraph
consequence of the expansion of the Kushan,Paragraph
Empire into the Chinese territory of the Tarim,Title
Basin. Their most lasting contributions to,Paragraph
architecture were the stupas that they began,Paragraph
to erect along the trade routes. Few have,Paragraph
"survived, but the Kanishka Stupa—built for",Paragraph
anishka | (ca. 127-40 Ce}—on the outskirts,Paragraph
"of today’s Peshawar, Pakistan, was described",Paragraph
y Chinese pilgrims in the 7th century as,Paragraph
the tallest stupa in all of India. It rose to,Paragraph
about 200 meters and contained three bone,Paragraph
"ragment relics of the Buddha, which have",Paragraph
"now been transferred to Mandalay, Myanmar",Paragraph
(Burma). Only a sturip remains of the,Paragraph
original building. Hans Loeschner suggests,Caption
that it might have appeared similar to the,Paragraph
"stone relief from Butkara III in Swat Valley,",Caption
which shows a stupa placed on a tall square,Caption
base. In the corners there are four pillars with,Paragraph
"lions at the top, similar to many of the Ashoka",Paragraph
"pillar with lion capitals, such as the one at",Paragraph
"Vaisali, India.",Caption
One of the major impediments on the Silk,Paragraph
"Route was the Taklamakan Desert, a vast oval",Paragraph

rivers running down from the mountains,Title
provided enough water for caravans to move,Paragraph
around the edges of the desert from one,Paragraph
"oasis to another. One of these was Khotan,",Paragraph
the center of a small kingdom. The Chinese,Paragraph
pilgrim Xuanzang passed through Khotan,Paragraph
around 644 CE on his way back from India to,Paragraph
China and wrote:,Paragraph

network as important as the land-based Silk,Paragraph
"Route. The Romans, seeking to circumvent",Paragraph
"the vicissitudes of the cross-desert trade,",Paragraph
saw places like Petra as veritable port cities,Paragraph
linking trade to India and beyond. And,Paragraph
"like Petra, Aksum in modern Ethiopia had",Paragraph
become by this time a significant regional,Paragraph
"force, trading with India and, northward,",Paragraph
"with the Roman Empire. In summary, it",Paragraph
can be said that the 3rd century CE saw the,Paragraph
"maturation of a new world order, namely",Paragraph
"that of transregional, transcontinental trade",Paragraph
"interdependency, especially in luxury goods.",Paragraph
It was a world order that would continue to,Paragraph
escalate with the emergence of the great,Paragraph
Mongolian Empire in the 13th century.,Paragraph
"In all of this, it is important to remember",Paragraph
that the trading world that stretched,Paragraph
from Rome through India and China was,Paragraph
extraordinarily narrow. It did not yet include,Paragraph
"Southeast Asia; Africa, apart from the",Paragraph
"Ethiopian and Mediterranean coasts, was",Paragraph
"largely on its own, as was the Siberian north.",Paragraph
"In Peru, one sees regional states",Paragraph
"emerging: the Moche in the north and, in",Paragraph
"the south, the Nazca, who produced large",Paragraph
"pilgrimage centers such as Cahuachi,",Paragraph
where mysterious patterns on the ground,Paragraph

elaborate designs—whose full impact can,Paragraph
only be appreciated from the air—remains,Paragraph
"unresolved, as do questions about the",Paragraph

superpower of the region was unquestionably,Paragraph
"Teotihuacan, the capital of an empire that",Paragraph

ROMAN EMPIRE,Title
The Roman Republic (509 BCE-27 BCE),Title
"focused largely on the Mediterranean,",Paragraph
especially once Rome took over Greece,Paragraph
in 146 BCE. But with the Gaulic Wars and,Paragraph
"the conquest of northern territories, Rome",Caption
could combine trade over both sea and land.,Paragraph
And though this was perhaps the vision of,Paragraph
"Caesar, the process of fusing everything into",Paragraph
"a single imperial unit, rather than a network",Paragraph
"of unequal principalities, would ultimately",Paragraph
"be cornpleted by Caesar's successor, the",Paragraph
emperor Augustus. The land/sea combination,Title
was the first such empire at that scale. By the,Paragraph
"2nd century CE, the empire extended north",Paragraph
"all the way to England. Under Hadrian, North",Caption
Africa was absorbed. Inroads were made,Paragraph
into western Asia in order to secure trade,Paragraph
links to the East. The eastern reaches of the,Paragraph
"empire were defined by older cities like Petra,",Paragraph
"Antioch, and Alexandria as well as by newly",Paragraph
expanded cities like Palmyra and Duros,Title
Europus.,Paragraph
The development of cities was now at its,Paragraph
"peak, and the consequences can be seen",Paragraph
throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.,Paragraph
The list of Roman foundations includes,Title
"Aosta, Bordeaux, Florence, London, Mainz,",Caption
"Mantua, Paris, Milan, Silchester (Hampshire,",Caption
"England), Trier, Cologne, Turin, Verona, and",Paragraph
"Vienna, to name only a few. Many cities, like",Paragraph
"Florence, Milan, Paris, and Trier, still carry",Paragraph
the imprint of the Roman grid to this day.,Paragraph
Though the paradigm for the city was the,Paragraph
"castrum, or military camp, which was divided",Paragraph
"by two intersecting main streets, the cardo",Paragraph
"(north-south) and decumanus (east-west), this",Paragraph
model was used mainly in the initial phases of,Paragraph
the colonization in Europe and North Africa.,Paragraph
"In Europe, though some of the Gaulic cities",Paragraph
"remained in use, many, because they were",Paragraph
"on hilltops, were evacuated by the Romans,",Paragraph
"who preferred valleys and river towns, which",Paragraph
were easier to defend and more amenable,Paragraph
to Roman practices of camp organization.,Paragraph
"Bibracte, for example, was abandoned and",Paragraph
"the new city of Augustodunum, now known",Paragraph
"as Autun, was built in the nearby valley. The",Paragraph
"castrurm model, however, was rarely used",Paragraph
"in the East, where cities were already well",Paragraph
"established. There, the Romans simply added",Paragraph
to what they found. Regardless of whether the,Paragraph
"castrum model was used or not, the Roman",Paragraph
method of creating cities can be compared,Paragraph
with that of the Chinese. The Chinese were,Paragraph
"specialists in megacities, concentrating huge",Paragraph
populations and bringing a large spectrum,Paragraph
of activities into the confines of the city walls.,Paragraph
Chinese cities were largely composed of one-,Paragraph
or two-story houses and were thus not very,Paragraph
"dense. The Romans specialized in compact,",Paragraph
small-scale cities networked across the,Paragraph
landscape. This allowed for easy expansion,Paragraph
and was a critical element in their success.,Paragraph
The Romans became experts in water,Paragraph
"management, building extensive aqueducts,",Paragraph
many of which have lasted into the modern,Paragraph
world. The Pont du Gard in modern-day,Paragraph
southern France and the equally impressive,Title
"Acueducto de Los Milagros in Mérida, Spain,",Caption
are testamients to the boldness of these,Paragraph

capital with staple crops and luxury goods.,Paragraph
Hadrian was eager to develop this area and,Paragraph
offered free tenancy and a period of tax,Paragraph
exemption to anyone who would agree to,Paragraph
reside permanently on marginal land and put,Paragraph
it under cultivation. It was a successful policy,Paragraph
that encouraged the establishment of rural,Paragraph
"trading centers, many of which developed",Paragraph
into urban environments. In some places,Paragraph
"a new town was founded, like Timgad, a",Paragraph
gridded city roughly the size of Florence; in,Paragraph
"others, such as at Leptis Magna, an existing",Paragraph
"Phoenician city (east of Tripoli), the planners",Paragraph
adopted a flexible and additive approach.,Paragraph
Roman cities were more differentiated,Paragraph
"than Greek cities, which were usually",Paragraph
defined by a central public area and temple,Paragraph
"precincts. A Roman city had streets, squares,",Paragraph
"fountains, baths, gates, memorial columns,",Caption
and public buildings that formed a type,Paragraph
of armature around which the rest of the,Paragraph
city grew. At the core of the city was the,Paragraph
"forum, the political and economic center of",Title
the city's activities. Public ceremonies and,Paragraph
"announcements took place there, and around",Paragraph
"it were ranged temples, offices, jails, butcher",Paragraph

attempt to graft this armature onto places that,Paragraph
"had been founded at an earlier date, when",Paragraph
"they were more towns than cities. Djemila,",Paragraph
"in Algeria (96 CE), is typical; its elongated",Paragraph

The Roman Theater,Title
Almost all Roman cities had a theater used,Paragraph
for both popular and religious purposes. In,Paragraph
"the days of the republic, the Romans were",Paragraph
somewhat skeptical of theaters—which were,Paragraph
common in Greek cities—and concerned,Paragraph
about their potentially corrupting influences.,Paragraph
"One decree forbade sitting at theaters, since",Paragraph
it was deemed more manly to stand. As a,Paragraph
"result, theaters built during the republican",Paragraph
period were temporary structures built of,Paragraph
wood. The first permanent theater was,Paragraph
ordered by Pompey in 55 BCE. Its design was,Paragraph
what could be called transitional; it included,Paragraph
a temple of Venus at the top of the seating,Caption
area so that the rows of seats appeared to be,Paragraph
steps leading up to the temple. Gradually this,Paragraph
subterfuge fell away once theaters were built,Paragraph
"in the colonies, where the emphasis was on",Paragraph
the theater as a public amenity.,Paragraph
Whereas Greek theaters were carefully,Paragraph
and strategically inserted into the natural,Paragraph
"landscape and often had dramatic views, the",Paragraph
Roman theater was conceived as an urban,Paragraph
"architectural element, its magnificence and",Paragraph
splendor a token of Rome's imperial status.,Paragraph
The slope of the seating was steeper than in,Paragraph
"Greek theaters, possibly for acoustic reasons.",Paragraph
"Initially, Roman theaters were hollowed out of",Paragraph
"a hill or slope, as at the theater at Aspendos,",Paragraph
"a Roman colony in Turkey. Over time,",Paragraph
"however, Romans viewed their theaters as",Paragraph
regular urban structures. All of the theaters,Paragraph
built within the city of Rome were made,Paragraph
without the use of earthworks. Also unlike,Paragraph
"Greek theaters, the auditorium, though not",Paragraph
"roofed, was covered with awnings or velaria,",Paragraph
which could be stretched out from tall poles,Paragraph
to provide shelter from rain or sunlight. The,Paragraph
buildings were usually semicircular. The stage,Paragraph
building (scaenae frons) was usually three,Paragraph
"stories high, with the theater divided into the",Paragraph
stage (orchestra) and the seating section,Title
"(auditorium). In Rome, few theaters have",Paragraph
"survived the centuries. Arausio, the theater",Caption
"in modern-day Orange, France, is a good",Paragraph
"surviving example of a classic Roman theater,",Paragraph

The building was sited in an area north of,Paragraph
the old city center known as Campus Martius,Paragraph
"(“Field of Mars"") that, before the founding of",Paragraph
"Rome, had been used for pasturing horses",Paragraph
and military exercises. During imperial,Paragraph
"times, it became the site of Rome’s urban",Paragraph
"expansion, with baths, theaters, and temples,",Paragraph
including a large open courtyard building,Paragraph
"known as the Saepta Julia, where Romans",Paragraph
voted.,Paragraph
While the classical ce/fa had always been,Paragraph
a dark and mysterious place oriented east,Paragraph
"to the rising sun, this building rejects that",Paragraph
"tradition. Its bold, domed interior space was,",Paragraph
"for the Romans, an innovation. It derives",Paragraph
conceptually from Greek and Egyptian,Paragraph
mathematical interest in spatial geometry—,Title
"concepts familiar to Hadrian, who had lived",Paragraph
"in Alexandria, a city famous as a center of",Paragraph
"learning. It was Archimedes, a Greek, who",Paragraph
had solved the problem of measuring the,Paragraph
volume of the sphere and cylinder in relation,Title
"to each other. By way of contrast, Romans",Paragraph
contributed practically nothing to analytical,Paragraph
"geometry. In that sense, the building is, one",Paragraph
"might almost say, un-Roman.",Paragraph
Smaller domed oculus structures had,Paragraph
"been built earlier, for bathhouses, like the",Paragraph
"one that still stands at Baia, on the north",Paragraph
shore of the Bay of Naples. These places,Paragraph
might have been a good place to work out,Paragraph
"technical issues, but they were certainly not",Paragraph
models in the symbolic sense. The octagonal,Paragraph
"room in Nero’s palace brings us closer, in",Paragraph
that it ended in an oculus and descriptions,Paragraph
emphasize its syrnbolic purpose. Perhaps,Paragraph
"seventy-five years later, with Hadrian, Rornan",Paragraph
"architects had an emperor who, like Nero,",Paragraph
had a verve for architectural experimentation,Paragraph
"and an interest in the Hellenistic East, where",Paragraph
7.18 Interior of the Pantheon,Caption
sun worship first came into its own in Egypt,Paragraph
"and Syria. Here, Jupiter is here represented",Paragraph
not by a statue but by the abstraction of light,Paragraph
itself.,Paragraph
Against the vertical alignment of the,Paragraph
half-spherical dome is added the startling,Paragraph
dynamic of the sun’s rays as they move,Title
"slowly through the space like a searchlight,",Paragraph
illurninating one by one elements of the,Paragraph
"architectural interior—sometimes the floor,",Paragraph
"with its pattern of orange, red, and white",Paragraph
marbles brought in from all over the ernpire;,Paragraph
sometimes the orange marble columns;,Paragraph
sometimes the coffering of the dome itself.,Paragraph
The building probably had an astronomical,Paragraph
"dimension, but nothing about that is known",Paragraph
for certain.,Paragraph
"Unfortunately, no Roman text has yet",Paragraph
been found that explains the interior in,Paragraph
respect to the arrangement of the divine,Title
"statues, the ritual practices undertaken",Paragraph
"in the building, or even the symbolism of",Paragraph
the oculus. But it is likely that the building,Paragraph
alludes to the unity of the divine and the,Paragraph
imperial realms. Apart from sun temples that,Paragraph
were beginning to be built in Syria (where,Paragraph
"Hadrian was the governor in 117 CE), there",Paragraph
are mystery cults that emphasized light,Paragraph
"and darkness, like the Eleusinian Mysteries",Paragraph
"practiced in Greece, into which Hadrian had",Paragraph
been initiated. In that sense the building,Paragraph
can be perceived as an import of Eastern,Paragraph
religious ideas into the very heart of Rome.,Paragraph
7.19 Section elevation: Pantheon,Caption
"Originally, a flight of five steps as wide as the",Paragraph
entrance portico led to the floor level of the,Caption
interior. The monolithic shafts of the facade,Caption
are of gray Egyptian granite; the four inner,Paragraph
columns are reddish Egyptian granite; ani,Paragraph
the capitals Pentelic marble. The porch leads,Caption
"to a barrel-vaulted entranceway, flanked by",Caption
niches. Between the porch and the rotunda,Caption
are areas for stairways to reach the spaces,Paragraph
that honeycomb the cylindrical structure.,Paragraph
he threshold is defined by a huge block of,Paragraph
"Portasanta marble. The walls, carved out by",Caption
"alternating square and round niches, forrn",Caption
four axial connections through the center,Caption
space.,Paragraph
The niches of the interior are screened,Paragraph
y columns and flanked by pilasters of,Paragraph
yellow-orange marble under a continuous,Paragraph
entablature. The apse is marked by,Paragraph
"reestanding columns, which interrupt the",Paragraph
entablature running along the back of the,Caption
niche. The dome presents itself on the,Paragraph
interior as successive rings of coffering that,Paragraph
diminish in size and depth as they near,Paragraph
"the oculus. They end, however, not at the",Paragraph
"mouth of the oculus but well short of it,",Paragraph
7.20 Dome detail: Pantheon,Caption
"leaving a smooth, platelike area around the",Paragraph
opening. The concrete surface of the dome,Paragraph
visible today is not what contemporaries,Paragraph
"saw, however. The edges of the oculus, and",Paragraph
"the coffering as well, were probably gilded,",Paragraph
with rosettes filling the centers of the coffers,Paragraph
and creating a much more ephemeral and,Paragraph
less structural impression than what can be,Paragraph
observed today.,Paragraph
Though the Romans are often praised for,Paragraph
"structural innovation, they could easily make",Paragraph
structure subservient to architectural vision.,Paragraph
"The lower half of the coffering, in fact, bears",Paragraph
no relationship whatsoever to the structure,Title
"behind it. In that sense, the architects were",Paragraph
"willing to work with the illusion of structure,",Paragraph
or at least wanted to separate the visual,Paragraph
vocabulary of a dome’s “celestial” structure,Title
from the hard reality of the structural support.,Paragraph
Even the coffering was designed from an,Paragraph
optical point of view. The steps are shallower,Paragraph
on their lower edge and steeper on the higher,Paragraph
so as to appear the same height when viewed,Paragraph
from the center of the floor.,Paragraph
The lower part of the structure is brick-,Paragraph
"faced concrete, with voids serving to reduce",Paragraph
the overall weight. Massive curving vaults,Paragraph
"direct the forces to the ground. For the dome,",Paragraph
"only concrete was used. The pour, made",Paragraph
"against a temporary wooden formwork, had",Paragraph
"to be seamless, placed bottom to top without",Paragraph
pause in order to guarantee the cohesion,Paragraph
of the whole. Organizing the production of,Paragraph
"the concrete, its immediate transport to the",Paragraph
"level of the dome, and its distribution to the",Paragraph
right places by people carrying small batches,Paragraph
was quite a feat. The width of the wall at the,Paragraph
bottom is 6.15 meters. It thins to only 1.5,Paragraph
"meters at the level of the oculus, which is 8.3",Paragraph
meters across and open to air and weather.,Paragraph
Despite the powerful evocations of the,Paragraph
"building, Hadrian's experiment would not",Paragraph
be repeated. Though Roman architects,Paragraph
"continued to work with domed spaces, as in",Paragraph
"the Baths of Caracalla, the dome-and-oculus",Caption
as imperial message was never repeated.,Paragraph
The original intermediary frieze was,Paragraph
replaced in 1747 with one far less delicate in,Paragraph
"proportion. In the early 20th century, a small",Paragraph
section of the original frieze was rebuilt based,Paragraph
on Renaissance-era drawings.,Paragraph
Hadrian’s Villa,Title
Hadrian’s other major contribution to,Paragraph
"architecture was an extravagant villa complex,",Paragraph
a miniature world that he built for himself,Paragraph
(118-34 CE) at the top of a hill about 25,Caption
kilometers east of Rome. It is not a single,Paragraph
"building, but a series of interconnected",Paragraph
structures and gardens. Unlike the Palace of,Paragraph
"Domitian, with its compressed orderliness,",Paragraph
the villa returns to the more freewheeling,Paragraph
texture of Nero's palace. There are dozens of,Paragraph
distinct elements separated from each other,Title
in the landscape and yet linked in surprising,Paragraph
"ways, so that the whole design unfolds only",Paragraph
gradually. Some of the parts were meant,Paragraph
to evoke memories of distant lands from,Paragraph
Hadrian’s far-flung travels. The residential,Paragraph
parts were to the north. To the south was the,Paragraph
"stadium, followed by a series of baths ending",Paragraph
in the spectacular structure known as the,Paragraph
"canopus, which was lined with copies of the",Paragraph
caryatids of the Erechtheum in Athens.,Caption
The whole was meant to evoke the,Paragraph
international—and particularly Greek and,Title
Egyptian—flavor of Hadrian’s trips. In that,Paragraph
sense the villa was a collection of memories,Paragraph
"and allusions. The canopus, for example,",Paragraph
refers to a particularly bright star that was,Paragraph
often used in navigation by Mediterranean,Paragraph
sailors. It appears in numerous Greek,Paragraph
legends and was also the name of an,Paragraph
Egyptian port near the mouth of the Nile.,Paragraph
The canopus at Hadrian’s Villa is designed,Caption
as a long lake decorated along its edges with,Paragraph
columns supporting alternating arches and,Paragraph
lintels. The Shrine of Serapis (Serapeum) on,Caption
the southern end of the complex was built,Paragraph
"against a steeply sloping hillside, creating",Paragraph
the impression of a grotto or miniature gorge,Title
with a waterfall at the back. It was dedicated,Paragraph
"to Serapis, the syncretic Hellenistic-Egyptian",Paragraph
god who was the protector of the city of,Paragraph
Alexandria. With water fromm an aqueduct,Caption
above flowing through the gorge and around,Paragraph
a crescent-shaped masonry reclining seat,Caption
"toward the long, riverlike pool, diners on",Paragraph
the curved bench seats would have had a,Paragraph
"cool and enjoyable meal, even in the heat",Paragraph
of summer. A small sernicircular pool where,Paragraph
food could be floated back and forth further,Paragraph
added to its charm. The vault’s surfaces were,Paragraph
covered with blue and green mosaics. And,Paragraph
the walls of the exedra were decorated with,Paragraph
semicircular niches that held statues.,Paragraph

"The so-called Island Villa, surrounded by a moat and a colonnade, is",Paragraph

"curves. The apparent symmetry at the center, typical of the spatial",Paragraph
"imagination of Roman architects, feathers out toward the perimeter,",Paragraph
as if the architect had less and less control over the more marginal,Paragraph
volures—in a sense a metaphor for the Roman Empire itself. The two,Paragraph
bedroom suites were on the east side; the dining room on the south.,Paragraph
The western side was taken up by a small bathing area. At the center of,Paragraph
"the compressed peristyle court was a fountain, its sound filtering its way",Paragraph
through the roorns.,Paragraph
"The Piazza d’Oro, another element in the villa, was another tour de",Paragraph

7.26 Fornix system of the abularium,Caption
Roman Vertical Surface,Title
Since the Egyptians covered their temple,Paragraph
"walls with irnages or historical reliefs, there",Paragraph
was no opportunity for architects to think of,Paragraph
the wall as anything other than a definer of,Paragraph
"space. In Greek architecture, walls were often",Paragraph
"hidden behind columns, and even though",Paragraph
the Greeks invented the pilaster in the form,Paragraph
"of columns in antis, and sometimes even",Paragraph
"articulated walls with shallow panels, they",Paragraph
never saw the wall as anything other than,Paragraph
"a wall. But by the tire of the Colosseum,",Paragraph
Roman architects were beginning to,Paragraph
experiment with complex articulations of the,Paragraph
"vertical surface. For the first time, the wall",Paragraph
became an architectural element per se. The,Paragraph
technique of framing arches within engaged,Paragraph
"half-columns supporting an entablature,",Paragraph
called the fornix system of ornamentation,Paragraph
"(fornix meaning “vault” or “arched room""),",Paragraph
dates back to about 150 BCE. The Romans,Paragraph
"also invented the aedicule, a combination of",Paragraph
niche with flanking columns connected by,Caption
"either a pediment or arch. In addition, they",Paragraph
"developed the dado, a boxlike stone under",Paragraph
the column that allows it to be elevated.,Paragraph
"The amphitheater in Nimes, France,",Caption
"recapitulates the there, as do numerous",Paragraph
"triumphal arches, such as the Arch of Titus",Paragraph
"(81 CE) in Rome. Eventually, aediculae and",Paragraph
"niches were added to the vocabulary, as can",Paragraph
"7.27 Arch of Septimus Severus, Rome",Caption
"7.28 Arch of Trajan at Timgad, Algeria",Caption
be seen at the Arch of Trajan at Timgad (10,Caption
"CE), a path-breaking design. The central arch",Paragraph
is flanked by smaller arches surmounted by,Paragraph
aediculae flanked by their own columns. The,Paragraph
two sides are then organized by enormous,Paragraph
columns that reach to the top of the,Paragraph
"aediculae and that, with the help of imposts,",Paragraph
rise to a level where the arches can spring,Paragraph
over them. The two side elements are united,Paragraph
by an entablature that is reduced to a thin,Paragraph
"projection. It is perhaps a bit awkward, but",Paragraph
certainly kinetic.,Paragraph

the lower register of four doors framed by,Caption
round-headed and pedimented aediculae,Caption
"with unusual, abstracted capitals. The whole",Paragraph
is tied together by an unbroken entablature,Paragraph
"on which rests a row of half-columns, the",Paragraph
last ones being pilasters; above that is an,Paragraph
accordion-style entablature with the pilaster,Caption
order shadowing its way through to the,Paragraph
top. The Tomb of Sextius Florentinus is,Caption
particularly refined. Above the lower register,Caption
is a pilaster order and a second set of,Paragraph
capitals. This interpenetration of horizontals,Paragraph
and verticals shows a capacity to see in the,Paragraph
x- and y-axes simultaneously. Such a degree,Paragraph
of visual cornplexity would not recur until the,Paragraph
Italian Renaissance.,Paragraph
"During the 2nd century CE, richly",Paragraph
elaborated architectural fronts that had once,Paragraph
been associated with the prosceniums in,Paragraph
theaters sprouted forth in public spaces. This,Paragraph
is true of the facade of the Library of Celsus,Paragraph
"at Ephesus (115 Ce), which stands on the",Paragraph
western end of a marble courtyard and is,Paragraph
approached by a flight of nine steps. The,Paragraph
"three entrances, with large windows above",Caption
"them, are flanked by four niches that contain",Paragraph
"statues personifying the virtues of Celsus,",Paragraph
Roman senator and proconsul of Asia. In,Paragraph
front of the facade are four double-story pairs,Caption
of columns; the capitals of the lower story,Caption
"are Corinthian, and those of the upper story,",Paragraph
"lonic. In a further display of design skill,",Paragraph
the architect changed the pairing between,Paragraph
"top and bottom. At the top, the columns",Paragraph
are brought together with pedimental and,Paragraph
rounded arches spanning the gaps. The,Paragraph
end columns stand almost free against the,Paragraph
facade.,Caption
Such displays were more than just,Paragraph
architectural excess. They conformed to the,Paragraph
Hellenistic desire for imrnediacy and were,Paragraph
meant to express the qualities and generosity,Paragraph
of the patron.,Paragraph
"At the nymphaeum of Nimes, France,",Caption
the columnar elements form an exoskeleton,Paragraph
against which presses the mass of the walls.,Paragraph
The search for complex and imaginative,Title
formations reaches a climax at the stage,Paragraph
"for the South Theater in Gerasa, Jordan",Caption
(modern-day Jerash). Though the first floor,Paragraph
has been reconstructed without the second,Paragraph
"floor, it shows a row of paired columns on a",Paragraph
socle forming a screen in front of pedimented,Paragraph
doorways with aedicu/ae between them. A,Paragraph
similarly well-thought-out scheme prevails at,Paragraph
the court of the Temple of Zeus at Baalbek.,Paragraph
Two Corinthian columns in antis work with,Caption
two pilasters to create the semblance of a,Caption
"screen unit. The aediculae, roundheaded",Caption
at the bottom level and pedimented at the,Paragraph
"top level, are squeezed in between the",Paragraph
"pilasters, practically hiding the wall surface",Paragraph

Roman Baths,Title
Although wealthy Romans had baths in their,Paragraph
"townhouses and country villas, the heating of",Paragraph
"a series of rooms, or even an entire separate",Paragraph
"building especially for this purpose, was",Paragraph
"usually reserved for public bathhouses, which",Paragraph
were available in cities and towns throughout,Paragraph
"the empire. These baths, called fhermae,",Paragraph
were owned by the state and often covered,Paragraph
several city blocks. Entrance fees were quite,Paragraph
reasonable and within the budget of most,Paragraph
free Romans. The area in these baths that,Paragraph
was actually covered with water was relatively,Paragraph
"small, for the bulk of the structure was filled",Paragraph
"by exercise spaces, lounges, and places to",Paragraph
stroll. Since the Roman workday began at,Paragraph
"sunrise, work was usually over a little after",Paragraph
"noon. At about 2 or 3 PM, men would go",Paragraph
"to the baths, staying for several hours of",Paragraph
"sport, bathing, and conversation, after which",Paragraph
they would be ready for a relaxing dinner.,Paragraph
Republican bathhouses often had separate,Paragraph
"athing facilities for women and men, but",Paragraph
"y the time of the empire, the custom was",Paragraph
to open the baths to women during the early,Paragraph
part of the day and reserve ther for men,Paragraph
rom 2 PM until closing at sundown.,Paragraph
The baths were secular spaces not,Paragraph
associated with altars or divine patronage.,Paragraph
"Some of the thermal or mineral baths,",Paragraph
"jowever, might be associated with local",Paragraph
river nymphs or the gods of medicine. Baths,Paragraph
offered an environment that was both sensual,Paragraph
and social. Some baths had lecture halls and,Paragraph
ibraries. The origin of these institutions goes,Paragraph
back to the beginning of classical culture and,Title
the emphasis placed on physical fitness by,Paragraph
the Greeks; bathing was viewed as a part of,Paragraph
the hygienic rituals associated with sports.,Paragraph
"Gymnasiums, in which sports and education",Paragraph
"were combined, were reserved primarily for",Paragraph
the sons of citizens and as a place for military,Title
"training. Under Alexander the Great, however,",Paragraph
the baths of Greek gymnasiums became a,Paragraph
more social environment—and the Roman,Title
"bath even more so. In fact, few citizens",Paragraph
were so poor that they could not afford,Paragraph
the entrance fee. Aware of the beneficial,Paragraph
"role these institutions played in the health,",Paragraph
"education, and entertainment of the people,",Paragraph
the Roman state allocated considerable,Paragraph
resources to their maintenance. Some of,Paragraph
"these baths, like the Baths of Caracalla and",Paragraph
"the Baths of Diocletian, were enormous",Paragraph
"structures, the largest public buildings in the",Paragraph
world. Their lavish interiors were decorated,Paragraph
"with trophies, inscriptions, and sculptures",Paragraph
reflecting the reach and power of the,Paragraph
emperor.,Paragraph
The Baths of Caracalla (212-16 CE) are,Paragraph
recognized as the best developed example of,Paragraph
the Roman public bath. The main building,Caption
(200 by 114 meters) was set in an enclosure,Paragraph
"(328 by 400 meters) that contained cisterns,",Paragraph

THE PARTHIAN EMPIRE,Title
The Parthians took over the Hellenistic,Paragraph

Empire (247 BCE-224 CE) became the glue,Paragraph

there is remarkably little to show for some five,Paragraph
hundred years of Parthian rule. Remaining,Paragraph

wealth and influence. It was also a time in,Paragraph

different religious practices began to flourish,Paragraph
"simultaneously. Iranian sun, fire, and mystery",Paragraph
cults took the place of ancient Mesopotamian,Paragraph

Strong relations between the Parthians and,Paragraph

When the Chinese envoy arrived at the,Paragraph
"Parthian border, he was greeted by an escort",Paragraph

"on the whole, adopted Zoroastrianism (see",Paragraph
"400 CE), an emerging religious practice based",Paragraph
on fire worship. This they fused with certain,Paragraph
"Hellenistic practices, creating fire sanctuaries",Paragraph
"dedicated to specific divinities, saints, or",Paragraph
angels. Parthian fire altars served as regional,Paragraph
"and national pilgrimage sites. One such site,",Paragraph
"Takht-i-Suleiman, in western Iran, around",Paragraph
the rim of an extinct volcano with a lake at,Paragraph
"its core, was frequently visited by the royal",Paragraph

Anuradhapura was at the center of this effort and,Paragraph

unified and centralized China. Emperor Wudi,Caption
(141-86 BCE) established new commanderies,Paragraph

To the north of Han territories were,Paragraph
"the Xiongnu, who established an empire",Paragraph
(209 BCE-93 CE) that stretched beyond,Paragraph
the borders of modern-day Mongolia. The,Paragraph
Xiangnu were part of another nomadic,Paragraph
confederation known as Xianbei. By the 3rd,Paragraph
"century CE, these various confederations,",Paragraph
"known by the Chinese as “barbarians,” were",Paragraph
instrumental in establishing the eastern part,Paragraph
of the Silk Route. So important was this,Paragraph
to the Han worldview that they built their,Paragraph
"new capital, Chang’an, at the far western",Paragraph
edge of their traditional territorial control. To,Paragraph
"populate the city, around 200 BCE the Han",Paragraph
forcibly relocated thousands of clan families,Title
in the military aristocracy to this region. The,Paragraph
"purpose was twofold: First, it kept all potential",Paragraph
"rivals close to the new emperor; and second,",Paragraph
it allowed the emperors to focus their energy,Paragraph
on defending the capital frorn invasion by the,Paragraph
nearby Xiongnu. This astonishing break of,Paragraph
geographical ties was also the first step in the,Paragraph
creation of an artificial—one might even say,Paragraph
universal and divine—imperial culture.,Paragraph
The site was just to the south of the by,Paragraph
"then destroyed Xianyang, the old palace",Paragraph
city of the Qin. The Han even used one of,Paragraph
"the Qin palaces, the Xingle Palace, as its",Paragraph
"core, optimistically renaming it Changle",Paragraph
(Long Joy”) Palace. The shape of the new,Paragraph
"city, with its twelve gates, was irregular, this",Paragraph
having to do with its siting along the river,Paragraph
and with certain astrological imperatives.,Paragraph
About half of the city was filled in with huge,Paragraph
palaces connected by two-story passageways,Paragraph
with bridges crossing the streets. The,Paragraph
passageways that linked the palaces allowed,Paragraph
the emperor to move among the palaces,Title
"unseen. As the city grew, a suburb developed",Paragraph
"to the east. To the west of Changle Palace,",Caption
"the Weiyang Palace was constructed, with an",Paragraph
immense audience hall. (The word weiyang,Paragraph
means “maintaining the dignity of the law.”),Paragraph
"Because the emperors lived there, this",Paragraph
building had a particular prominence. Like,Paragraph
"the Qin palaces, these gigantic Han palaces",Paragraph
were built of wood around a solid earthen,Paragraph
core. The Han also constructed a major,Paragraph
palace complex west of the city at Shanglin,Caption
"Park, along with an artificial lake, the",Paragraph
"Kunming Chi. The lake, which symbolized the",Paragraph
"world's oceans, had at its center the statue",Paragraph
of a whale. Very little survives of the vast,Paragraph

funerary objects placed in royal tombs often,Paragraph
contained models of structures for use in,Paragraph
the afterlife. These models show multistory,Paragraph
timber-frame watchtowers with corner piers,Caption

Mingtang-Biyong Ritual Complex,Title
If the Qin capital was designed as a,Paragraph
"microcosm of the Chinese empire, nearby",Paragraph
Chang’an was designed to represent nothing,Paragraph
less than the heavens themselves. For the,Paragraph
"Qin, rituals tended to include disparate",Paragraph
rites from China’s far-flung geography.,Paragraph
"According to the Shiji, the sacrificial rituals,",Paragraph
"known as zhi, were meant to be performed",Paragraph
"on high grounds in forested areas, where",Paragraph
offerings were made to the four deities of the,Paragraph

"azure, yellow, and red. The Han multiplied",Paragraph
the Qin rituals and offered sacrifices to the,Paragraph
"gods of heaven and earth, mountains and",Title
"rivers, the sun and the moon, and the stars",Title
"and the planets, and they built artificial",Paragraph
replicas of natural altars in the capital itself.,Paragraph
All of this coincided with the emerging,Paragraph
"notion of imperial power. Unlike in Europe,",Paragraph
where absolute power was an extension of,Paragraph
"aristocratic privilege and military might, the",Paragraph
emerging Chinese tradition interpreted the,Paragraph
power of the emperor as dependent on the,Paragraph
will of the divine. His actions were seen as an,Paragraph
integral part of the cosmic order. It was thus,Paragraph
incumbent upon the emperor to perform a,Paragraph

TEOTIHUACAN,Title
Teotihuacan was the largest and most,Paragraph
impressive of America’s cities until modern,Title
times. Located in the highlands of central,Paragraph
"Mexico, Teotinuacan existed for a period",Paragraph
"of eight hundred years, growing from a",Paragraph
"large village of about 6,000 people into",Paragraph
"a metropolis of 150,000 to 200,000",Paragraph
"inhabitants around 600 CE, with an",Paragraph
urban core extending across 20 square,Title
kilometers. It was the center of an empire,Paragraph
that dominated the culture and politics,Paragraph
of even the furthest Mayan city-states,Paragraph
and kingdoms. Third-century inscriptions,Caption
on stelae at Tikal and Copan record that,Paragraph
Teotihuacan controlled their dynasties. They,Paragraph
may have also influenced the mound cultures,Paragraph
of the Mississippi. In spite of its size an:,Paragraph
"magnificence, little is known of Teotihuacan’s",Paragraph
multiethnic inhabitants. Evidence of a writing,Caption
"systern is only just corning to light, most of it",Paragraph
seemingly destroyed when the city fell. The,Paragraph
"city was a type of “forward capital,” insofar",Paragraph
as it was an exposed outpost on the northern,Paragraph
edge of the Mesoamerican cultural realm.,Paragraph
Beyond it to the north stretched the ari,Paragraph
wastes of the Mexican plateau. The Aztecs,Paragraph
were to eventually master that plateau with,Paragraph
their water systerns.,Paragraph
The Maya called the city Puh (“place,Paragraph
"of the reeds""), but the name Teotihuacan,",Paragraph
"“the place where men become gods,” was",Paragraph
"given to it later by the Aztecs, who built",Paragraph
"their own capital, Tenochtitlan, farther to the",Paragraph
@ Copan,Title
south a millennium later. (The original name,Paragraph
"is not known.) By the time of the Aztecs,",Paragraph
"Teotihuacan, by then abandoned, was already",Paragraph
"a place of legend and mystery. Today, there",Paragraph
are many ongoing debates about the nature,Paragraph
of the city and the purpose of its structures.,Paragraph
Though at its height Teotihuacan was roughly,Paragraph
contemporary with the early stages of the,Paragraph
"Mayan cities located to the south, there were",Paragraph
distinct differences between the cultures,Title
"and, so it seems, only minor evidence of",Paragraph
interaction.,Paragraph
Archaeologists believe that a four-chambered,Paragraph
"cave, discovered by local residents in the",Paragraph
"early years of the 1st century BCE, marks",Paragraph
the beginning of Teotihuacan’s rapid,Title
growth. Caves played an integral role in,Paragraph
the Mesoamerican religions; they were,Paragraph
considered places connected with the origin,Paragraph
"of gods and ancestors, as well as portals to",Paragraph
"the underworld, the world of demons and",Title
other potent beings. The Teotihuacan lava,Paragraph
"cave may have held particular significance,",Paragraph
as its four lobes could represent the four,Paragraph
parts of the Mesoamerican cosmos. It,Paragraph
became the center of a spiritual landscape,Paragraph
and a focal point of fire and water rituals.,Paragraph
But whether this was the beginning of clan,Paragraph
cohesion or a convenient prop for territorial,Paragraph

Andean metalworking reached its,Paragraph

Nazca Lines,Title
Though the origins of the Peruvian cultures,Title
"are far from clear, it seems that the Nazca",Paragraph
culture dates back to around 3000 BCE. It,Paragraph
was an oasis culture at the edge of a shore,Paragraph
desert. The oasis allowed a thriving culture,Paragraph
to develop. Citrus fruit and manioc were,Paragraph
grown on the plains; corn was grown at,Paragraph
high altitudes and stored in massive silos.,Paragraph
"The Nazca traded up and down the coast,",Paragraph
as indicated by the presence in gravesites,Paragraph
of a special oyster shell that came from,Paragraph
Ecuador and was used by the elites as sacred,Paragraph
ornamentation. At first the Nazca people,Paragraph
"made rock art, as was common to many",Paragraph
"cultures worldwide, but then, making use",Paragraph
"of the terrain, they began to draw figures in",Paragraph
"the desert. Though large, these images were",Paragraph
easy to make by scraping or removing the,Paragraph
dark volcanic stones from the otherwise white,Title
surface of the desert.,Paragraph
At first it was thought that the lines were,Paragraph
"astronomical in nature, but more recent",Paragraph
excavations have shown that the lines were,Paragraph
made to honor the gods as part of elaborate,Paragraph
shamianistic rituals that focused on ancestral,Paragraph
memories or weather deities. Though the,Paragraph
images can famously be seen from high,Paragraph
"altitude, scholars are convinced that they",Paragraph
were actually meant to be seen from the,Paragraph
west-facing slopes of the hills that served,Paragraph
as viewing areas for the rituals that certainly,Paragraph
spanned many days and were possibly even,Paragraph
performed with torches at night. The lines,Paragraph
"were not empty signifiers, but paths along",Paragraph
which ritual participants would walk in the,Paragraph
context of elaborate dance ceremonies.,Paragraph
The drawings were made in various,Paragraph
phases frorn about 500 BCE to about 400 CE.,Paragraph
At first the drawings showed figures with large,Paragraph
eyes; then there was a phase when animals,Paragraph
"appeared, serving as orientation points",Paragraph
"for shaman “flights.” Since the monkey,",Paragraph
"hummingbird, and spider were not local to",Paragraph
the region but creatures from the rain forest,Title
"to the east, the images may have been meant",Paragraph
to communicate with these animals in the,Paragraph
hope of bringing rain.,Paragraph

the drought seem to have gotten bigger and,Paragraph
bigger. Animal shapes gave way to huge,Paragraph

which indicates that all the Nazca people,Paragraph
"were now involved in these efforts, not just",Paragraph
"the shamans, possibly in order to add weight",Paragraph
to the ceremonies. People came to the,Paragraph
pilgrimage center of Cahuachi from far afield,Title
to participate in these elaborate rituals.,Paragraph
Cahuachi owes its significance to,Paragraph
its geographical location: because of its,Paragraph
"geological path, the Nazca River goes",Paragraph
underground midvalley and emerges at a,Paragraph
point just below Cahuachi. In a water-scarce,Paragraph
"region, the reappearance of the river would",Paragraph
have been viewed as miraculous. Cahuachi’s,Paragraph
adobe platform mounds are much smaller,Paragraph
"than those of their Moche neighbors, and",Paragraph
they cap some forty low-lying hills overlooking,Paragraph
the Nazca River. Even after the Nazca people,Paragraph
"abandoned the city in the 5th century, it",Paragraph
remained an important site for rituals and,Paragraph
burials.,Paragraph

INTRODUCTION,Title
"n Eurasia, the period between 200 and",Paragraph
400 CE was noted in particular by nomadic,Paragraph
incursions from the steppe regions of Inner,Title
Asia. What prompted this exodus is not,Paragraph
"nown, but the effects were clear. The",Paragraph
Roman Empire was soon overwhelmed by,Paragraph
"people the Romans called “barbarians,” but",Paragraph
"who were mostly agropastoralists—Saxons,",Paragraph
"Huns, Visigoths, and Franks, arnong others.",Paragraph
"n 441-442 CE, Saxons from Germany",Caption
invaded Britain. The Visigoths took a more,Paragraph
"southerly route, invading Italy under Alaric |",Paragraph
"and sacking the fabled city of Rome in 410,",Paragraph
settling down first in southern Gaul and,Paragraph
"eventually in Spain and Portugal, where they",Paragraph
founded the kingdom of the Visigoths. The,Paragraph
"Franks were moving to the west, to eventually",Paragraph
set up residence in the area of modern-day,Paragraph
"France. Meanwhile, the Huns who came to",Paragraph
"dominate central Asia, and unified under",Paragraph
"Attila, invaded the Eastern Roman Empire,",Paragraph
which was beset by internal problems such,Paragraph
"as famine, plague, and earthquakes. In",Paragraph
"451 CE, Attila’s forces entered Gaul and later",Paragraph
"northern Italy. Indeed, the modern world of",Paragraph
Europe was founded just as much on the,Paragraph
legacy of the Roman Empire as it was by,Paragraph
these various “barbarian” tribes who came,Title
to claim its land as their own. At first their,Paragraph
"contribution to architecture was minimal, as",Paragraph
these were chieftain cultures accustomed to,Paragraph
village life and village needs. Houses were of,Paragraph
wood and thatch. In some places they took,Paragraph
over an abandoned Roman villa from which,Paragraph
in fact the word village derives.,Paragraph
"To protect the empire, Emperor Constantine",Paragraph
"founded a new city, Constantinople, which",Paragraph
was built around a fusion of Christian and,Paragraph
"pagan motifs. Had that approach survived,",Paragraph
"Europe today would feel more like India,",Paragraph
with its numerous complex hybrid religious,Paragraph
practices. But upon Constantine’s death,Paragraph
"in 337 CE, Christianity became an imperial",Paragraph
"religion, as effective in stabilizing the urban",Paragraph
centers as in pacifying the encroaching tribal,Paragraph
"peoples, whom the Christians called “pagans,”",Paragraph
a derogatory term meaning something like,Paragraph
"country bumpkins, and from the Christian",Title
perspective untouched by the grace of God.,Paragraph
A series of synods were held—from the First,Paragraph
"Council of Nicaea (325 CE) to others in 381,",Paragraph
"431, 415, and 553 ce—that attempted to",Paragraph
establish the principles for a unified state,Title
"church. Policy was one thing, enforcement",Paragraph
another. The Christianization of the empire,Paragraph
would turn out to be a massive undertaking,Paragraph
that would last some seven hundred years and,Paragraph
would require not just that “heathen” altars,Paragraph
"and temples be meticulously destroyed, but",Paragraph
that competing perspectives on Christianity be,Paragraph
condemned as heresies and dealt with.,Paragraph
"8.2 Towers of Silence, Yazd, Iran",Caption
"n this world of religious intensification,",Paragraph
Christianity injected an altogether new,Title
concept: the martyr. Since many Christians,Paragraph
"ad died in Rome in the previous centuries,",Paragraph
that city became a pilgrimage site even,Paragraph
though it was by now little more than a,Paragraph
"village, located in the extensive ruins of the",Paragraph
former world capital. People came from afar,Paragraph
to visit the cemeteries where the martyrs were,Paragraph
"uried. To accommodate the influx, churches",Paragraph
"were built, often directly over the tombs.",Paragraph
One of these was St. Peter’s. In contrast to,Paragraph
"Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and Hinduism,",Paragraph
which made structures that were more or less,Paragraph
"open-air, these buildings, needing to enclose",Paragraph
"throngs of pilgrims, were large indoor spaces.",Paragraph
The prototype came from the ancient Roman,Paragraph
"basilicas, or law courts, which were usually",Paragraph
long walled and columnar buildings with,Paragraph
heavy timbered ceilings. The symbolism of a,Paragraph
building type dedicated to law was not lost on,Paragraph
the early designers of these churches. In a,Paragraph
world where security and lawfulness were at,Paragraph
"a premium, the Church could provide both,",Paragraph
and with a message of divine deliverance,Paragraph
"to boot. In Roman times, lawyers, judges,",Paragraph
and clients set up areas in the basilica’s,Paragraph
colonnades to transact business. There,Paragraph
"were no separate rooms in the building, and",Paragraph
so there was a good deal of coming and,Paragraph
going. The apse at one end was often more,Paragraph
a ritual formality than a site of worship. In,Paragraph
"the Christian basilica, the space was used",Paragraph
altogether differently. Though the space was,Paragraph
"vast, its main purpose was to enclose the",Paragraph
"devotees and focus on the apse, which was",Paragraph
now a highly charged space directly over the,Paragraph
tomb. There were not chairs or pews as there,Paragraph
"are today. Furthermore, when there was no",Paragraph
"service, the space would often be used by",Paragraph
merchants and traders.,Paragraph
St. Peter’s was at the time the largest,Paragraph
interior space in the world. Of all the,Paragraph
"churches from that era that have survived,",Paragraph
"only Santa Maria Maggiore (432-440 Ce),",Paragraph
"though restored, gives us some sense of the",Paragraph
quality of the interior. The columns lining the,Paragraph
aisle were not custom made but taken from,Paragraph
"Roman buildings, the art and technology",Title
of making such columns having been lost.,Paragraph
The church was built in honor of the Virgin,Paragraph
"Mary, who represented both the imperial",Paragraph
ideals of classical Rome and those of the new,Title
Christian Rome.,Paragraph
"In Central Asia, the story of incursions",Paragraph
"from the steppe culture is not dissimilar,",Paragraph
except that here the deserts and mountains,Paragraph
belonged to various tribes of the nomadic,Paragraph
"Huns, such as the Kidarites and Chionites,",Paragraph
who set up camp in Afghanistan and,Paragraph
Turkmenistan to control the mountain,Title
passes between Persia and China. They,Paragraph
"encroached into Chinese territory, forcing the",Paragraph
Jin dynasty to abandon its northern areas to,Paragraph
"a series of small, regional potentates. The",Paragraph
"Jin moved their capital to Jiankang, about",Paragraph
260 kilometers to the west of modern-day,Paragraph
Shanghai. The division of China into northern,Paragraph
and southern dynasties—parallel to the,Paragraph
division of the Roman Empire between east,Title
"and west—would last, in fact, until 581 and",Paragraph
"the emergence of the Sui dynasty, which",Paragraph
for a brief time reunited China. But in the,Paragraph
"meantime, during this period large nurnbers",Paragraph
of ethnic Han Chinese migrated to southern,Paragraph
China (below the Yangtze River). This,Paragraph
sinicization transformed the south from a land,Paragraph
of farming communities into an area with,Paragraph
increasingly large urban population centers.,Paragraph
"In India, the Gupta Empire (320-550",Paragraph
CE) created a buffer zone for itself by,Paragraph
subjugating the Persians to the north and,Paragraph
the Kambojas to the east. But these efforts,Paragraph
did not last long. Soon northern India was,Paragraph
to be controlled by the nomadic Hephthalite,Paragraph
"Empire (408-670 CE), which was centered",Paragraph
in Bactria in present-day Afghanistan and,Paragraph
for a while dorninated Central Asia. The,Paragraph
Guptas seemingly showed little predilection,Paragraph
"for using horse archers, despite the fact",Paragraph
these warriors were a main component in the,Paragraph
"ranks of their northern enemies. Nonetheless,",Paragraph
"in the 5th century, the Gupta Empire was",Paragraph
"the strongest urban civilization in Asia, its",Paragraph
prosperity producing a period of magnificent,Paragraph
"accomplishments in sculpture and painting,",Paragraph
as well as in science and poetry. The Gupta,Paragraph
"capital was Pataliputra, adjacent to modern-",Paragraph
day Patna; but since it was built out of wood,Paragraph
and on a river that frequently overflowed its,Paragraph
"shores, practically nothing is left, even though",Paragraph
it was one of the largest cities in the world,Paragraph
"during this time, dominating the riverine trade",Paragraph
of the Indo-Gangetic Plain.,Paragraph
Though shrines in India were then mostly,Paragraph
"made of wood, this period includes the first",Paragraph
"attempts to translate them into stone, such",Paragraph
as Temple 17 at Sanchi. Its similarities to,Paragraph
the Greek naos and porch are unmistakable.,Paragraph
Perhaps more important was that during,Paragraph
"the Gupta period, popular worship was",Paragraph
given formal sanction; temples and images,Paragraph
dedicated to the various cults began,Paragraph
"springing up everywhere, releasing a new",Paragraph
generation of architectural experimentation.,Paragraph
"The old Vedic world, which was not ternple",Paragraph
"based, was now developing into small-scale",Paragraph
shrine cults that would eventually cohere into,Paragraph
what we today call Hinduism.,Paragraph
"In Europe, the contestation between",Paragraph
"monotheism (i.e., Christianity) and the",Paragraph
ancient animism of the Romans and,Title
their steppe invaders has parallels to the,Paragraph
contestation between Buddhism and Vedism,Title
"in India, except in reverse. In India, Vedic",Paragraph
practices carne to dominate because they,Paragraph
incorporated the figure of the Buddha into,Paragraph
"their spiritual pantheon, mostly without",Paragraph
sectarian violence. This was not the case,Paragraph
"in Europe, where Christianity, though it",Paragraph
incorporated some local practices such,Paragraph
"as the Christmas tree, took an aggressive",Paragraph
posture toward the tribal religions. Unlike the,Paragraph
"newly Christianized Roman Empire, where",Paragraph
the political and religious elites sought to,Paragraph
unify the religious message by identifying,Paragraph
"and repressing heresies, Hinduism unfolded",Paragraph
"in various directions, producing a complex",Paragraph
tapestry of religious and architectural,Title
responses. Apart from Jainism and other,Paragraph
"more stand-alone religions, there is Shaivism,",Paragraph
with its many different schools reflecting,Paragraph
both regional and ternporal variations,Title
"and differences in philosophy, as well as",Paragraph
"Vaishnavism, which is often viewed as a",Paragraph
"synthesis of the worship of the gods Vishnu,",Paragraph
"Narayana, Vasudeva, and Krishna. While",Paragraph
Shaivism developed mainly in the south and,Paragraph
southeast; and Shaktism in eastern India,Title
and in some parts of southwest Malabar;,Paragraph
"Vaishnavism, with its emphasis on Krishna,",Paragraph
flourished mostly in the northern and central,Paragraph
parts of India.,Paragraph
This period includes the first efforts,Paragraph
to commemorate the pilgrimage site,Title
dedicated to the life of the great Buddha.,Paragraph
"The Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya was,",Paragraph
"however, no stupa. Though the current",Paragraph
"building is a 19th-century reconstruction, the",Paragraph
"basic idea of the building seems clear, even",Paragraph
though its form may confuse an uninitiated,Paragraph
"observer. Unlike the stupa at Sanchi, which",Paragraph
"is a large hemispherical solid, this building",Paragraph
"looks like a Hindu temple. It has a tall tower,",Paragraph
"a shikhara, which would normally represent",Paragraph
the geometrical model of Vishnu’s mountain,Title
residence. The enclosed fence-shrine around,Paragraph
"the pipal tree, located just to the west of the",Paragraph
"east-facing temple, has similarities to the",Paragraph
numerous sacred trees that are associated,Paragraph
with Hindu temples. The same goes for,Paragraph
"the lotus pond, which is similar to the all-",Paragraph
important water elernent in Hindu temples,Paragraph
that represent the sacred ocean. Just as,Paragraph
Hinduism was adopting the Buddha as an,Paragraph
"important deity on par with Vishnu and Shiva,",Paragraph
Buddhist architecture here represents a type,Paragraph
"of syncretism of its own, combining different,",Paragraph
often seemingly contradictory beliefs into a,Paragraph
"8.3 Giant Buddha, Leshan, China",Caption
new whole. The uniquely Buddhist elernent of,Paragraph
the Mahabochi Temple is the requirement for,Paragraph
"circumambulation around the temple, which",Paragraph
is not a Hindu practice.,Paragraph
During this time we see the expansion of,Paragraph
Mahayana Buddhism along the trade routes,Title
between India and China. As Buddhism,Paragraph
traversed the Kushan Empire (ca. 30-375 CE),Paragraph
"and the Hephthalite Empire (408-670 CE),",Paragraph
it came into contact with Hellenism and,Paragraph
its legacy in figural sculpture. The Buddha,Paragraph
began to take on human form and was,Paragraph
"represented in various ways as standing,",Paragraph
"seated, or even lying down. A grand example",Paragraph
"is the standing Buddhas at Bamiyan,",Paragraph
"Afghanistan, located at the intersection of",Paragraph
"the Eurasian trade routes. There, colossal",Paragraph
rock-cut Buddha figures were carved out of,Paragraph
the cliff face and then dressed and painted,Paragraph
to give therm a lifelike appearance. Other,Paragraph
"examples can be found at Unjusa, Korea",Caption
(a Buddha in a supine position); and at,Paragraph
"Leshan, China, built during the Tang dynasty",Paragraph
"(618-907 CE), a seated Buddha 71 meters",Paragraph
high. The largest Buddha statue in the world,Paragraph
is the Spring Temple Buddha in Lushan,Paragraph
"County, Henan, China. The statue, finished",Caption
"in 2002, stands 128 meters high. Hinduism",Paragraph
"also occasionally adopted the colossal form,",Paragraph
"as in, for example, the large reclining figure",Paragraph
"of Narayana, the Vedic supreme deity, at the",Paragraph
"Udaygiri Caves, quite likely carved in the 5th",Paragraph
century CE in the Gupta period.,Paragraph
"At Dunhuang (Mogao Caves), located",Paragraph
at the western end of the Great Wall—,Paragraph
where the Silk Route splits into its northern,Paragraph
"and southern arms, winding around the",Paragraph
Taklamakan Desert—Buddhist monks built,Title
one of the largest cave cornplexes in the,Paragraph
world. It represents part of the movernent of,Paragraph
rock-cut technology from India into China.,Paragraph
"Hundreds of caves, carved out of the sheer",Paragraph
"cliff face, show Buddha, usually seated, but",Paragraph
sometimes lying down. The caves initially,Paragraph
served as a place of meditation for hermit,Paragraph
"monks, but soon the priests who lived here",Paragraph
"came to function as a publishing house,",Paragraph
copying sutras from India for distribution,Title
throughout China. By the 8th century CE the,Paragraph
caves had become a place of pilgrimage in,Paragraph
their own right. One could compare Mogao,Paragraph
Caves with the martyrium churches in Rome.,Paragraph
Pilgrimage had been one way in which,Paragraph
"humans accessed the divine, perhaps since",Paragraph
ancient times when shamans would go to,Paragraph
mountains to speak to the ancestors. But,Paragraph
"with modern religions, pilgrimages became",Paragraph
increasingly focused around specific sites,Paragraph
and were increasingly part of the popular,Paragraph
imagination. Places like Mogao and St.,Paragraph
Peter's focused on the lives of holy men and,Paragraph
the messages they embodied. The fact that,Paragraph
one person died a natural death and another,Title
did not produced different types of ethical,Paragraph
and moral stances.,Paragraph
The other major religion of the period,Paragraph
"was Zoroastrianism, the state religion of",Paragraph
"the Sassanians (ca. 230-650 CE), who",Paragraph
dominated the Persian heartland and,Paragraph
"ruled from Ctesiphon, of which little of its",Paragraph
ancient splendor is left apart from the vast,Paragraph
central vault of a palace most likely built,Caption
around 540 CE. It is known that artisans,Paragraph
of the Roman provinces and masons frorn,Title
Byzantium helped in the building. Marble was,Paragraph
"brought in from Syria. Zoroastrianism, with",Paragraph
connections to both the Hindu and Christian,Title
"worldviews, stretched from West Asia to",Paragraph
western China. The architectural legacy,Title
of Zoroastrianism is less secure since the,Paragraph
religion was later repressed by both Islam and,Paragraph
"Christianity. Furthermore, most Zoroastrian",Paragraph
"buildings, like the Sassanian palaces, were",Paragraph
built of sun-baked mud bricks that today are,Paragraph
little more than dried-out wall stubs. Their,Paragraph
surface decoration and painting have long,Paragraph
"since vanished. Nonetheless, across the",Paragraph
"deserts of Inner Asia, one can still find the",Paragraph
occasional ruins of fire temples and dakhmas,Title
"(“towers of silence”), where the dead are",Paragraph
left exposed to be consumed by vultures.,Paragraph
Zoroastrian tradition considers a dead body to,Paragraph
"be unclean, with the corpse demon rushing",Paragraph
into the body and contaminating everything,Title
that comes into contact with it. To preclude,Paragraph
"this potential pollution, the bodies of the",Paragraph
"dead are placed atop a dakhma, exposing",Paragraph
them to the sun and to scavenging birds. The,Paragraph
towers are usually circular and have a flat,Paragraph
unroofed surface with raised walls all about.,Paragraph
he surface is divided into three concentric,Paragraph
rings: the bodies of men are arranged around,Paragraph
"the outer ring, women in the second circle,",Caption
and children in the innermost ring. Once,Paragraph
the bones have been bleached by the sun,Paragraph
"and wind, which can take as long as a year,",Paragraph
they are collected in a pit at the center of,Paragraph
"the tower, where—assisted by lime—they",Paragraph
gradually disintegrate. This ritual precinct,Paragraph
may be entered only by a special class of,Paragraph
pallbearers. Of the various dakhmas that,Paragraph
"still exist, the now abandoned ones in Yazd,",Paragraph
"lran, are the grandest. The large circular",Paragraph
enclosures at the top of the hill are visible,Paragraph
"for miles, as were the circling vultures that",Paragraph
perched on top of the walls.,Paragraph
"Japan, during this time, had its first",Paragraph
"encounter with centralized government,",Paragraph
following the ascent of the Yarnato clan. In,Paragraph
"this period, in terms of sheer scale, nothing",Paragraph
competes with the Kofun in Japan. These are,Paragraph
tomb mounds honoring elite personages that,Paragraph
"are clustered in a vast, sacred landscape. In",Paragraph
"plan, they have different shapes—keyhole,",Paragraph
"square-keyhole, round, and square—though",Paragraph
the reason for the differences is not known.,Paragraph
There are over 220 of these tornbs built,Paragraph
first in the Nara Basin and later in the,Paragraph
Osaka Plain. The extraordinary quantities of,Paragraph
weapons and armor discovered at Nonaka,Caption
Kofun clearly indicates the relationship of,Paragraph
"the elites to military power, which makes",Paragraph
sense given the uneasy tines in China. In,Paragraph
"total, these structures constitute the most",Paragraph
"extensive mortuary landscape in the world,",Paragraph
rivaled perhaps only by the Ming dynasty,Paragraph
imperial tombs of the 15th and 16th,Title
centuries. Unlike the tombs of the martyrs,Paragraph
"in Rome, these tombs were embedded in",Paragraph
the ancient shamanistic worldview. Perhaps,Paragraph
it might be valuable to cornpare these with,Paragraph
"other earthwork mortuary constructions, like",Paragraph
"the Egyptian pyramids, the great tumuli of",Paragraph
the Europeans (from the Sth millennium BCE,Title
"to the time of the Romans), the kurgans of",Paragraph

a way to cement and demonstrate their,Paragraph

"Unlike his predecessors, Ardashir had a",Paragraph

about three-quarters of a kilometer from,Paragraph
the western shore of the Euphrates near a,Paragraph

and was to remain an important typological,Paragraph
element in Persian architecture. Only parts,Paragraph
of the impressive vault remain. Spanning 28,Caption
"meters, it was probably the largest vault in",Paragraph
ancient history. It is thought that the arch,Paragraph
was built without wooden supports during its,Paragraph

the arch is a pointed ovoid peculiar to,Paragraph

Visitors to the hall during the reign of,Paragraph
Khusrau | (r. 531-79 CE) tell that the vast,Paragraph
floor was covered with a splendid “winter,Paragraph
carpet” of heavy woven silk adorned with,Paragraph
gold and jewels. Its pattern was supposed,Paragraph
to represent a pleasure garden with running,Paragraph
brooks and interlaced paths. Though never,Paragraph
"equaled, it became the model for garden",Paragraph
carpets. The carpet was confiscated by,Paragraph
Arab conquerors when they took Ctesiphon,Title
in 638 CE. Scornful of the display of royal,Paragraph
"luxury, they cut it up and divided it among",Paragraph
their warriors. But the idea of a carpeted floor,Paragraph
was soon to become a permanent fixture of,Paragraph
Islamic mosques. The desolate area of these,Paragraph
ruins gives little indication of the once lush,Paragraph
orchards and rose gardens that surrounded,Paragraph
the building.,Paragraph
"Ardashir's capital was Firuzabad, located",Paragraph
in an easily defensible valley. At the front of,Paragraph
"Ardashir’s palace was another open iwan,",Paragraph
flanked by side chambers. To the rear were,Paragraph
"three domed rooms, and behind them, a",Paragraph
courtyard and garden. The palace lay to the,Paragraph
"south of Ardashir’s planned circular city, over",Paragraph
"2 kilometers in diameter, at the center of",Paragraph

their past splendor.,Paragraph
Zoroastrian Fire Temples,Title
It is presumed that Zoroaster (Zarathustra),Paragraph
"lived around 600 BCE, but no one knows",Paragraph
exactly when or where he lived or died; there,Paragraph
remain only traditions. And there is just,Paragraph
as much ambiguity about the fire ternples,Paragraph
that were built for the faith he developed.,Paragraph
"Fire was ranked according to its uses, from",Paragraph
"the lesser fires of potters and goldsmiths,",Paragraph
"through cooking fires and hearth fires, up",Paragraph
to the three great symbolically perceived,Title
"eternal fires of the farmers, warriors, and",Paragraph
priests. Zoroastrianism was opposed to the,Paragraph
"use of images, and during the Sassanian",Paragraph
"period, cult statues were removed, although",Paragraph
anthropomorphized divinities remained.,Paragraph
"Further, Zoroastrianism does not prescribe",Paragraph
"worshipping in a temple. Traditionally,",Paragraph
"Zoroastrians worship individually at home, or",Paragraph
"in the open, facing a source of light. When",Paragraph
"they wished to worship as a community,",Paragraph
they did so in open-air gathering areas,Paragraph
around a podium where a fire was lit. These,Paragraph
gathering areas were usually on hillsides,Paragraph
or hilltops. But as the rituals and practices,Paragraph
"became canonized, the corresponding",Paragraph
"religious architecture was standardized, and",Paragraph
a complex network of temples resulted. The,Paragraph
role of the fire in the religious services was,Paragraph
mainly symbolic and served the purpose of,Paragraph
"consecration, much as the cross does in a",Paragraph
Christian context. Each king in the Sassanian,Paragraph
world had his own royal fire. There was a,Paragraph
prescribed ritual for reigniting the home fire,Title

HINDU RENAISSANCE,Title
As Buddhism was gaining new converts,Paragraph
"across East Asia, India saw it gradually",Paragraph
waning. This transition took place during,Paragraph
"the Gupta Empire, when Buddhist practices",Paragraph
began to fuse with the surviving Vedic,Paragraph
"practices of pre-Buddhist times, creating",Paragraph
a new and well-organized religion that we,Paragraph
now call Hinduism. The Gupta revival of a,Paragraph
transformed Vedic Hinduism was a skillful,Paragraph
exercise in adaptation and invention. It,Paragraph
was not a simple revival of pre-Budchist,Paragraph
"Vedic practices. Rather, Vedic institutions",Paragraph
were reinvented to serve the purposes of,Paragraph
their new champions. Old fire sacrifices,Paragraph
were transformed into courtly ritual; oral,Paragraph
Vedic literatures were rewritten to integrate,Paragraph
contemporary social and cultural norms; and,Paragraph
"Vedic gods were supplanted by new, more",Paragraph
agential and personal gods—particularly,Paragraph
Shiva and Vishnu. Sanskrit became the,Paragraph
language of the court and the medium of an,Title
official high culture that revolved around the,Paragraph
reinvented institution of the temple.,Paragraph
Though the new Hinduism challenged,Title
"Buddhism theologically, the latter’s",Paragraph
institutions and practices were assimilated,Paragraph
into the Hindu temple. Unlike the Mauryas,Paragraph
"and the Han Chinese, the Gupta maintained",Paragraph
subject kings as vassals and did not,Paragraph
consolidate every kingdom into a single,Title
administrative unit. This enabled them,Paragraph
not only to maintain and profit from the,Paragraph
trade routes that were still controlled by,Paragraph
the Buddhists but also to exploit Buddhist,Paragraph
institutions for Hindu purposes. Buddhist,Paragraph
"practices were not prohibited—in fact,",Paragraph
their institutions continued to thrive. The,Paragraph
interblending of Buddhist and Vedic cultures,Title
"was described by Fa Hein, the famous",Paragraph
Chinese pilgrim to the Gupta state from,Title
399 to 414 CE. He talks of a magnificent,Paragraph
procession of about twenty wheeled stupas,Title
with figures of seated Buddhas attended by,Caption
standing bodhisattvas coming to the Gupta,Title
"capital of Pataliputra, where it was received",Paragraph
by the Hindu Brahmins and ushered into,Paragraph
"the city with great cerernony. By this time,",Paragraph
the Buddhists were themselves routinely,Paragraph
making stone images of the Buddha. In some,Paragraph
"instances, a Buddhist caitya hall would be",Paragraph
reused for Hindu gods. And in a stroke of,Paragraph
"genius, the Buddha himself was deified as",Paragraph
another manifestation of Vishnu from the,Paragraph
Hindu pantheon.,Paragraph
The basic configuration of the Hindu,Title
temple can be seen at the so-called Temple,Paragraph
17 at Sanchi and the Kankali Devi at,Caption
"Tigawa, both from the early 5th century CE.",Paragraph
Both consist of a flat-roofed garbha-griha,Paragraph
"and mandapa, linked by a simple stepped",Paragraph
stylobate and architrave. The garbha-griha,Caption
(literally “womb chamber”) is usually square,Paragraph
and unadorned. The mandapa is essentially a,Paragraph
place for the worshipper.,Paragraph
"8.31 Section and plan: Temple 17, Sanchi",Caption
"In Hindu worship, the antarala (doorway or",Paragraph
threshold) between the garbha-griha and a,Paragraph
mandapa marks the all-important moment,Paragraph
of transition at which the worshipper and,Paragraph
the deity come into direct visual contact,Paragraph
and enact the critical transaction called,Paragraph
"darsana (""beholding of an auspicious deity”).",Paragraph
"Indeed, the whole temple can be considered",Paragraph
a two-way portal between the worlds of the,Paragraph
"worshipper and the deity. In essence, the",Paragraph
deity descends into the lingam or statue,Paragraph
while the worshipper ascends to the sacred,Paragraph
threshold. The deity is considered to be,Paragraph
a guest in the world of the worshipper. In,Paragraph
"a ritual called puja, the worshipper offers",Paragraph
"the deity food (and, at times, such gifts",Paragraph
as clothing and ornaments) on a tray. The,Paragraph
"pandit, or priest, who stands at the threshold",Paragraph
and mediates the ritual takes the food fram,Paragraph
the tray and touches it to the mouth of the,Paragraph
"deity. He keeps a portion for the ternple,",Paragraph
"returning the rest, with some additional",Paragraph
"special food from the temple, called prasada,",Paragraph
for the worshipper.,Paragraph
Another example of an early Gupta period,Paragraph
Hindu temple is the brick and mud-mortar,Paragraph
temple at Bhitargaon (400-50 ce). Here,Caption
the garbha-griha is surmounted by a large,Paragraph
"tapering superstructure, called the shikhara.",Paragraph

the Buddha supposedly sat. In accordance,Paragraph
with the nonrepresentational requirernents,Paragraph
"of Hinayana Buddhism, Asoka had no other",Paragraph
representation or temple built at the site.,Paragraph
The pipal tree itself is said to have been cut,Paragraph
"down by zealots, first in the 4th century BCE",Paragraph
and then again in the 7th century CE. But,Paragraph
"a sapling from the original tree, taken to Sri",Paragraph
Lanka by Asoka’s daughter in the 4th century,Paragraph

Mahabodhi Ternple (late 5th or 6th century,Title

temple has been renovated repeatedly over,Paragraph
"time, and it is difficult to be absolutely certain",Paragraph
what part of it is original to the Gupta period.,Paragraph
"Nonetheless, its contours today are not that",Paragraph
different from its description by Hsuan Tsang,Paragraph
(Xuanzang) in 637 Ce.,Paragraph
Hsuan Tsang recorded that the Bodhi Tree,Paragraph
"was enclosed by a strong, high brick wall",Paragraph
(originally built by Asoka) 500 paces in,Paragraph
"circumference. Rare trees offered shade,",Paragraph
"while fine grasses, flowers, and strange plants",Paragraph
covered the ground. The main gate opened,Paragraph
"east toward the Niranjana River, while the",Paragraph
"south gate connected to a large lotus tank,",Paragraph
the sacred tank where it is believed that,Paragraph
the Buddha spent a week. The north gate,Paragraph
opened into the grounds of a large monastery.,Paragraph
Inside there were innumerable stupas and,Paragraph
"shrines, built as memorials by sovereigns",Paragraph
and high officials. In the center of the Bodhi,Caption
Tree enclosure—defined by a stone vedika or,Paragraph
fence (like the one around the Great Stupa,Paragraph
"at Sanchi)—-was the Vajrasana, sandwiched",Paragraph
"between the Bodhi Tree to its west and, to its",Paragraph
"east, the Mahabodhi Temple, 48 meters high",Caption
and 20 paces wide.,Paragraph
The temple was made of bricks coated,Paragraph
with lime. It had tiers of niches with gold,Paragraph
"images, its four walls were adorned with",Paragraph
"exquisite carvings of pearls, and at its top",Paragraph
was a gilt-copper stupa. Hsuan Tsang also,Paragraph
recorded separately that south of the Bodhi,Paragraph
Tree was an Asokan pillar more than 30,Paragraph
meters high. The Mahabodhi Temple is,Paragraph
today clearly similar to this description. It is,Paragraph
surrounded by four subsidiary shrines at its,Paragraph
corners that were added in the 19th century.,Paragraph
The central chamber houses the image of the,Paragraph
enthroned Buddha of the temple. The brick,Caption
shikhara contains another cella at the upper,Paragraph

When Constantine officially recognized,Title

"monotheism, with its stress on ethical values,",Paragraph
imparted an authenticity to religious practice,Paragraph
that previously had been equaled only,Paragraph
"by Judaism, of which it was an offspring.",Paragraph
"Initially, Christianity might have appeared to",Paragraph
be just another of the numerous Hellenistic,Paragraph
"religions and cults, such as the cults of Isis",Paragraph
"and Dionysus, Mithraism, the Gymnosophists",Paragraph
"of Upper Egypt, and the Theraputae of",Paragraph
Alexandria. Few could have predicted the,Paragraph
way Christian beliefs would sweep across the,Paragraph
Western world as it spread in the footsteps,Title
of Roman occupation and took hold in Rome,Paragraph
"itself. Constantine, prodded by a dream,",Paragraph
"converted on his deathbed. From then on,",Paragraph
the Roman title Pontifex Maximus signified,Paragraph
that the Roman emperor was simultaneously,Paragraph
the head of the Church and the vicar of,Paragraph
"Christ. As for the Church’s competitors,",Paragraph
they were folded bit by bit into the Christian,Paragraph
world—or condemned as heresies. The,Paragraph
religious pluralism that flourished in the 5th,Title
"century CE, and out of which Christianity",Paragraph
"itself had emerged, ended by the end of the",Paragraph
6th century CE. Judaism alone was given,Paragraph
"some leeway, but it, too, was under pressure.",Paragraph
"Christians were forbidden to marry Jews, and",Paragraph

Debates raged about the nature of Christ,Title
"and his cosubstantiality with God, about the",Paragraph
"Trinity, about Mary, about the wording and",Paragraph
"the nature of the Eucharist, and about many",Paragraph
other issues.,Paragraph
The choice of architectural style must,Paragraph
also have caused considerable discussion.,Paragraph
One thing was clear: it was impossible for,Paragraph
the new religious architecture to follow in,Paragraph
the footsteps of temple architecture. The,Paragraph
wide variety of building types from the early,Paragraph
days of Christianity are a result of the search,Paragraph
for a proper fit between architecture and,Paragraph
"liturgy. In an earlier age, a tomb could not",Paragraph
possibly have been mistaken for a basilica or,Paragraph
a bathing establishment. Roman architecture,Paragraph
created clearly defined architectural,Paragraph
environments for the various urban functions.,Paragraph
"But by the 3rd century CE, distinctions were",Paragraph
"rapidly disappearing and being reformulated,",Paragraph
"as with Maxentius’s “basilica,” which was",Paragraph
modeled on an imperial bath building. In,Paragraph
"early Christian architecture, when house-",Paragraph
"churches were no longer needed, this trend",Paragraph
accelerated as various forms were studied,Paragraph
and reevaluated for their compatibility with,Paragraph
developing liturgical needs.,Paragraph
The impact of Christianity on Roman,Title
"buildings was, of course, a negative one.",Paragraph
"The imperial forums were abandoned, and",Paragraph
"more often than not, stones from Roman",Paragraph
buildings were fired in large kilns to make,Paragraph
"lime for mortar. As late as 1606, Pope Paul V",Paragraph
demolished the Temple of Minerva in the,Caption
Forum of Nerva to obtain building material,Title
for the construction of a fountain. Christian,Caption
"fanatics went to Baalbek to destroy idols, but",Paragraph
they were initially beaten back; pagan rituals,Paragraph
continued there until about 380 CE. But bit,Paragraph
"by bit, the Christian emperors tightened their",Paragraph
grip. The sanctuary at Baalbek was eventually,Paragraph
destroyed and its remnants redesigned as a,Paragraph
relatively humble church. The liquidation of,Paragraph
sculptures was so complete that not a single,Paragraph
example has survived. So devastating was the,Paragraph
destruction of the pagan world that it took a,Paragraph
"thousand years, until the 15th century, before",Paragraph
interest in its existence was anything more,Paragraph
than fleeting.,Paragraph
"To add to the complexity of the times,",Paragraph
when Constantine left Rome in 326 CE and,Paragraph
formally dedicated Constantinople as the,Paragraph
"“new Rome” in 330 CE, the city of Rome",Paragraph
became a backwater almost overnight.,Paragraph
Constantine founded his new city not so,Paragraph
"much as a Christian one, but rather as a",Paragraph
place where Christianity and paganism could,Paragraph
"coexist. This was not possible in Rome,",Paragraph
where Christians demanded complete,Title
allegiance from their sovereign. Seen from,Paragraph
"the perspective of Rome, the construction",Title
of Constantinople was a disaster. But seen,Paragraph
"from the perspective of the eastern provinces,",Paragraph
it was a natural re-ascendancy. Unlike the,Paragraph
"European parts of the empire, which were",Paragraph
spread out and had many different tribes,Paragraph
"laying claim to various regions, the east was",Paragraph
naturally cohesive. The division of the empire,Paragraph
"had other consequences as well, for suddenly",Paragraph
"there was not one capital, or even four, but",Paragraph
"actually six: along with Constantinople, there",Paragraph
"was Antioch, Nicomedia, Milan, Trier, and",Paragraph
"Cologne, all of which were now refurbished",Paragraph
as imperial residences. Milan was an imperial,Paragraph
residence from 353 CE onward and suddenly,Paragraph
became a major architectural center. Five,Paragraph
new churches were built; three of them stand,Paragraph
"to this day, at nearly their full height.",Paragraph
"In 380 CE, however, Ernperor Gratian",Paragraph
"made Trier his residence, bringing the flow",Paragraph
of money to the north. Emperor Honorius,Caption
favored Ravenna and transferred the Imperial,Paragraph
See there in the early 5th century CE; it,Paragraph

master of Italy. Theodoric eagerly imported,Paragraph
the most skilled masons and mosaic artists,Title
"from the east, while adopting the conservative",Paragraph
Roman basilica-style plan for his churches.,Caption
But this did little to calm anxieties in,Paragraph

sent an army to bring Italy and North Africa,Paragraph
"into his sphere of control. In 536 CE, even",Paragraph
"Rome was taken, but in 568 CE, the Visigoths",Paragraph

Rome’s population dropped from about a,Paragraph
million at the time of the Roman Empire to,Paragraph
as low as thirty thousand by the 6th century,Paragraph
CE. The large parts of Rome that were now,Paragraph
abandoned or used as farms came to be,Paragraph
"called the disabitato ( “uninhabited areas"").",Paragraph
It has long been held that early Christian,Paragraph
"architecture evolved out of the atrium, or",Paragraph
"tablinium, of the Roman houses where early",Paragraph
"Christians met. Admittedly, until the 4th",Paragraph
"century CE, Christian architecture as such",Paragraph
"did not exist, as services were held in houses",Paragraph

the illusion of a linear evolution of form that,Paragraph
the physical evidence does not support. The,Paragraph
basilica that imposed a pattern on church,Paragraph
buildings by Constantine was the Church,Title
"of St. John Lateran, transformed from an",Paragraph
imperial palace in Rome in 314 CE. For this,Paragraph
"church, the basilica was a logical choice.",Paragraph
"Though little of the original building is left,",Paragraph
its form is well established. It consisted of,Paragraph

be several centuries before the idea of a,Paragraph
"representative facade, which had previously",Paragraph
"been nurtured by the Romans, would return",Paragraph
as an important design element in Western,Paragraph
churches.,Paragraph
Though the exterior of the building might,Paragraph
"seem primitive, the interior was opulent. The",Paragraph
"roof beams shimmered in gold foil, and the",Paragraph
walls were ornamented with mosaics high,Paragraph
"above the red, green, and yellow marble",Caption
columns of the nave. Seven golden altars,Caption
"and offering tables stood in the sanctuary,",Paragraph
which was lit by chandeliers of gold and,Paragraph
"silver. A hundred years later, Rome saw",Paragraph
"the construction of St. Sabina (425-32 CE),",Paragraph
a mature and stately replica of St. John,Paragraph

Martyria,Title
Though the city of Rome was no longer a,Paragraph
"political or economic power, it became an",Paragraph
important religious and pilgrimage center,Title
"much like Jerusalem, for it had the burial",Paragraph

martyrs. In making their tombs an important,Paragraph
"part of veneration, the notion of a dark and",Paragraph
"uneventful Hades, and the idea of death",Title
"as a privileged realm of pharaonic afterlife,",Paragraph
were obliterated. Tombs were perceived,Paragraph
as a site of reawakening on the day of the,Paragraph
"Last Judgment, when all of humanity was to",Paragraph
be judged. Visiting a tornb was in a sense,Paragraph
an anticipation of this event. The cult was,Paragraph
to become such a strong part of Christian,Paragraph
religious folk practice that a church's,Paragraph
possession of even a piece of a saint's or,Paragraph
"martyr's body, such as a finger, displayed in",Paragraph
"a reliquary, bestowed an aura of sanctity to",Paragraph
the edifice. This went so far that body parts,Paragraph
"and even entire bodies were snatched away,",Paragraph
"such as that of St. Mark of Venice, which was",Paragraph
taken from Alexandria.,Paragraph
The precedent for this type of veneration,Paragraph
"can be found in Buddhism, which, around",Paragraph
"the lst century BCE, had already begun",Paragraph
reliquary practices—certainly an innovation,Paragraph
"in the history of religion. This folk practice,",Paragraph
"which apparently arose spontaneously, was",Paragraph
soon recognized as a boon by the Church,Paragraph
"establishment, as it attracted the pious,",Paragraph
and as such was a public demonstration of,Paragraph
"Christianity’s validity. Indeed, the new notion",Paragraph
of history made by simple people doing,Title
heroic things—far different from history,Title
as mythology or history as royal lineage—,Paragraph
would have a profound impact on later,Paragraph
developments.,Paragraph
St. Peter’s in Rome,Caption
Since many of the graves in Rome were,Paragraph
at the outskirts of the city or in cemeteries,Paragraph
"outside the walls, the Christianization of",Paragraph
Rome created an entirely new geographical,Paragraph
profile previously unheard of in the history,Paragraph
of Western urbanization. The city and its,Paragraph
"image were no longer dominated by a forum,",Paragraph
"agora, or palace, but rather by the dozens",Paragraph
"of monasteries, baptisteries, and churches",Title
scattered in clusters in the farthest reaches of,Paragraph
the city and its environs. Whereas the Church,Paragraph
St. John Lateran in Rome is a basilica that,Paragraph

Constantine founded the original church over,Paragraph
the tomb of St. Peter around 320 CE. Though,Paragraph
"a basilica, St. Peter's had a slightly different",Paragraph
"shape than St. John Lateran, reflecting its",Paragraph
status as a martyrium. A broad flight of stairs,Caption
"led to the atrium, built on a vast platform over",Paragraph
the sloping ground. The platform itself was,Paragraph
"constructed over a Roman necropolis, with",Paragraph
the tops of the various tomb structures cut,Paragraph
off and the interrnediate spaces filled in. The,Paragraph
"church itself, because of its use, was 112",Paragraph
meters in length—considerably longer than,Paragraph
St. John Lateran. The nave can be described,Caption
as a covered street with colonnades on both,Paragraph
sides. The columns were not built for the,Paragraph
church but were taken from pre-Christian,Paragraph
Roman buildings. The nave became a place,Paragraph
where those who could afford the cost could,Paragraph

the valley had an estimated twenty-five,Paragraph
"thousand residents, making it one of the",Paragraph

was supported by several types of irrigation,Paragraph
"projects, including artificially terraced hillsides",Paragraph
watered by canals fed from permanent,Paragraph
springs. The ubiquitous forest of today is far,Paragraph
different from the tended former landscape of,Paragraph
the Zapotecs.,Paragraph
The Zapotecs believed that the universe,Paragraph

"associated with a color—red, black, yellow,",Paragraph
"or white. The center was blue-green, which",Paragraph
they considered a single color. The east-,Paragraph

the Zapotecs distinguished living things from,Paragraph

platforms in the southeastern corner of the,Caption
site. It is decorated by a series of “dancing”,Paragraph

by a partial wall and columns. Later Zapotec,Caption
"temples had two chambers: an outer, less",Paragraph
sacred chamber to which worshippers could,Paragraph

where the priests performed their rites. Those,Paragraph
rites included burning incense and both,Paragraph

"in scope. India and China were prospering,",Paragraph
"however, and Southeast Asia, Korea, and",Paragraph
Japan were emerging as economic forces.,Paragraph
That narrow part of the world produced,Paragraph
perhaps 90 percent of the architectural,Paragraph
innovations of the time. Europe was in a state,Paragraph
of disarray as its lands were being carved,Paragraph
"up by various tribes—the Visigoths, Franks,",Paragraph
"Lombards, Saxons, Avars, and Danes, among",Paragraph
others. Most of these were agropastoral,Paragraph
village societies that produced small fortified,Paragraph
settlements of wooden construction. This,Paragraph
left the eastern part of the former Roman,Paragraph
"Empire, Byzantium, as a relatively isolated",Paragraph
"hotspot of cosmopolitan, urban life.",Paragraph
Byzantium had a leader of extraordinary,Paragraph
"charisma, Justinian (482-565), who violently",Paragraph
suppressed dissent while pursuing a policy,Title
of Mediterranean conquest. During his rule,Paragraph
a host of astonishing buildings appeared:,Paragraph
"the Church of the Holy Apostles (534), SS.",Caption
"Sergius and Bacchus (ca. 535), the Church",Paragraph
"of Hagia Irene (ca. 530s), and a 140-meter-",Paragraph
long cistern. But nothing compared to the,Paragraph
"Hagia Sophia, which was begun around 532.",Paragraph
"This remarkable building, its inner finish",Paragraph
"considerably diminished today, was the",Paragraph
greatest engineering marvel of the age. The,Paragraph
"dome, the first to rival that of the Pantheon,",Paragraph
"was completely of brick, concrete having",Paragraph
by now become a lost art. But its structural,Paragraph
sophistications were designed to be invisible,Paragraph
"to observers, who marveled at its gilded inner",Paragraph
surfaces shimmering in the mottled light from,Paragraph
distant windows and suspended candelabras.,Caption
"9.2 Interior of St. Hripsime Temple, Echmiadzin, Armenia",Caption
"The Byzantine Empire, however, was not on",Paragraph
"sure footing. A “black death,” the Plague",Paragraph
"of Justinian (541-542 ce), killed perhaps",Paragraph
40 percent of Byzantium’s inhabitants,Title
and caused the deaths of up to a quarter,Paragraph
of the human population of the eastern,Title
Mediterranean. Vast stretches of territory,Paragraph
were left uninhabited. The long-term effects,Paragraph
were enormous. Justinian’s death in 578 CE,Paragraph
added to the problems of an empire that was,Paragraph
in more or less continuous battle with the,Paragraph
Persians and then the Arabs. The withdrawal,Paragraph
of large numbers of troops from the Balkans,Paragraph
to defend the southern borders opened the,Paragraph
door even more for the southward expansion,Title
of Slavic peoples into the Mediterranean,Title
zone. In 568 CE the Lombards invaded Italy,Paragraph
"with little opposition from Byzantium, and",Paragraph
thus began the fragmentation of Italy. By,Paragraph
650 CE Byzantium had lost all of its southern,Paragraph
provinces and could from then on only bask,Paragraph
in its former glory.,Paragraph
"Throughout this period, the Armenians,",Paragraph
"remote from the pestilence of the ports,",Paragraph
were pushing ahead with an amazing,Paragraph
building campaign. They alone in the world,Paragraph
were still building high-end stone masonry,Paragraph
buildings with techniques from the Greeks.,Paragraph
These buildings include the Church of Saint,Paragraph
"Gayane and the Cathedral of Mren, both",Paragraph
from the 630s and both three-nave domed,Caption
basilicas with an octagonal drum resting on,Paragraph
four internal pillars. But the greatest of these,Paragraph
Armenian buildings was Zvartnots Cathedral,Paragraph
"(643-652 CE), located at the edge of the city",Paragraph
of Echmiadzin. It had an extraordinary plan.,Paragraph
he core consisted of four lobes emanating,Paragraph
rom triangular-shaped piers. The whole was,Paragraph
"surrounded by a thirty-two-sided polygon,",Paragraph
which appears circular from a distance. Its,Paragraph
"elevation is not known, but it is surmised to",Paragraph
"ave risen three stories. Apart frorn copper,",Paragraph
"the Armenians had little to offer economically,",Paragraph
so most of their wealth came from overland,Paragraph
"trade. They were an important, stable lin",Paragraph
tween East and West. One could compare,Paragraph
them with the Srivijayan Empire in Southeast,Paragraph
"Asia, which served as the link between India",Paragraph
and China.,Paragraph
"Meanwhile, the Persian Sassanians in the",Paragraph
lranian heartland were no longer in a position,Paragraph
to contribute to the building arts. Their land,Paragraph
was in disarray largely because of rigid social,Paragraph
"stratification, the increasing power of the",Paragraph
"provincial landholders, and a rapid turnover",Paragraph
"of rulers, all of which allowed the restive Arab",Paragraph
"tribes to seek greater autonomy. By 640 CE,",Paragraph
"the Arabs, newly united by Islam, began",Paragraph
to assert themselves and make impressive,Paragraph
"territorial claims. By 651 CE, the Sassanian",Paragraph
Empire had collapsed and was replace by the,Paragraph
"Rashidun Islamic caliphate (632-661 CE),",Paragraph
which soon stretched cross a vast territory,Paragraph
"from Afghanistan to Morocco, and which was",Paragraph
succeeded by the even more wealthy and,Paragraph
powerful Umayyad caliphate (661-750 CE).,Paragraph
"In India, the situation was altogether less",Paragraph
volatile. Despite the decline of the Gupta,Paragraph
"dynasty in the 6th century CE, the newly",Paragraph
emerging small kingdoms all tried to assert,Paragraph
"their regional control, leading to a period",Paragraph
of prolific temple building. One of these,Paragraph
kingdoms was the Pallavas in the south.,Paragraph
The Pallava’s wealth was generated from,Paragraph
trade to the east through their port city of,Paragraph
"Mamallapuram, a sacred city and pilgrimage",Title
site. Mamallapuram came to host an amazing,Paragraph
sequence of rock-cut temples carved along,Caption
"the slope of a nearby hill, connected to an",Paragraph
artificial (though now largely dry) channel that,Paragraph
represents the Ganges River. It was designed,Paragraph
as a model of the Hindu sacred landscape,Paragraph
and so was just as much a religious as an,Paragraph
"economic destination, as was typical in the",Paragraph
Hindu world.,Paragraph
"In 700 CE in Mamallapuram, one of",Paragraph
"the first stone-built buildings in India, the",Paragraph
"Shore Temple, was constructed. It is a",Paragraph
"type of elaboration of Dharmaraja Ratha,",Paragraph
"located about 5 kilometers away, which was",Paragraph
not stone-built but one of several rock-cut,Paragraph
experimental temples known cumulatively,Title
as Pancha Rathas (ca. 650 CE). These were,Paragraph
"carved, one next to the other, to study, so it",Paragraph
"seems, different potential ternple forms. The",Paragraph
Pancha Rathas experiment is unique in the,Paragraph
history of architecture. But what prompted,Paragraph
the change from rock-cut to built-up? Was,Paragraph
"there some connection to the Armenians,",Paragraph
who were the best stonemasons in the world,Paragraph
"at the time, and who in these times of trouble",Paragraph
were certainly leaving their homeland looking,Paragraph
for work? Or was it a more homegrown,Paragraph
transformation?,Title
"9.3 Shore Temple, Mahabalipuram, India",Caption
"During this time, the process known as",Paragraph
Indianization was expanding India’s economic,Paragraph
"reach into Southeast Asia, which was slowly",Paragraph
being transformed into a series of regional,Paragraph
rice-producing centers. Indianization,Paragraph
"describes a process where monks, engineers,",Paragraph
and officials created temple/city communities,Title
that slowly drew converts from among the,Paragraph
"locals, who eventually created nascent",Paragraph
states. In Myanmar (Burma) along the,Paragraph
"Irrawaddy River, we see, for example, the",Paragraph
"rise of the Sri Ksetra kingdom, which was",Paragraph
"settled by adherents of Theravada Buddhism,",Paragraph
"indicating a close connection to Sri Lanka,",Paragraph
one of the earliest centers of rice paddy,Paragraph
irrigation in the world. The lucrative trade,Paragraph
"also led to the creation, around 500 CE,",Paragraph
of the Srivijayan Empire near present-day,Paragraph
"Palembang, Sumatra, in Indonesia. The",Paragraph
"Srivijayan controlled the Straits of Malacca,",Paragraph
through which all ships traveling between,Paragraph
India and China had to pass. Along with,Paragraph
"the Srivijayan, other states emerged, such",Paragraph
as Dvaravanti (more or less in modern-,Paragraph
"day Thailand), the Chenla (more or less in",Paragraph
"modern-day Cambodia), and the Champa",Paragraph
"(more or less in modern-day Vietnam),",Paragraph
each of which was beginning to develop an,Paragraph
extensive rice-producing export economy and,Paragraph
an architecture of sacred landscapes to go,Title
along with it.,Paragraph
Based on the regional strength of this,Paragraph
"economy, T’ang dynasty China built one of",Paragraph
"the greatest cities of the time, Daxing. The",Paragraph
first cities of China were what one might call,Paragraph
palace cities linked to a court culture and the,Paragraph
needs of the court. The development of the,Paragraph
centralized imperial government in the Han,Title
dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) and later in the,Paragraph
T'ang dynasty (618-906 CE) gave rise to large,Paragraph
"capital cities that were metropolitan in nature,",Paragraph
with population concentrations of one million,Paragraph
or more people. These megacities have to,Paragraph
be seen somewhat differently from cities in,Paragraph
other places of the world. The concentration,Paragraph
of large populations into a city was a way,Paragraph
to keep power under imperial control. This,Paragraph
"is true for many large cities, but unlike the",Paragraph
ancient city of Rome—which expanded over,Paragraph
time into a dense urban labyrinth with almost,Paragraph
"no planning, despite what one might assume",Paragraph
about the Romans—the Chinese capitals,Title
were designed from the outset as a spatial,Paragraph
imprint of imperial rule. They were low in,Paragraph
"density, composed mainly of mud-brick and",Paragraph
"thatch structures with gardens, pigsties, and",Paragraph
animal pens. In many parts the city would,Paragraph
have appeared as a compressed village.,Paragraph
"For this reason, when there was a change",Paragraph
"of imperial control, capitals were usually",Paragraph
destroyed and depopulated. Hundreds of,Paragraph
thousands of people were displaced and,Paragraph
resettled in new capitals. This created huge,Paragraph
temporal disruptions in Chinese history.,Paragraph
With the collapse of a single unifying,Paragraph
"power, as during the Three Kingdom period",Paragraph
220-265 CE between the Han and T'ang,Title
"dynasties, three new capital cities were built.",Paragraph
This gave the Chinese a lot of experience,Paragraph
in designing cities at a great scale. The,Paragraph
"history of the Daxing site is complex, for",Paragraph
Daxing is actually the third capital city on,Paragraph
"that site. The first city, Xianyang, to the",Paragraph
"north of the Wei River, was founded by the",Paragraph
Qin dynasty (221-206 BCE). Because the,Paragraph
city lay south of the Jiuzong Mountains and,Paragraph
north of the Wei River—both sunlight-rich,Paragraph
"(yang) orientations—it was named Xianyang,",Paragraph
meaning “fully yang” or “the side that is full,Paragraph
of sun.” When the city was destroyed in a,Paragraph
"flood in 202 BCE, the new capital, Chang'an",Paragraph
"(“Perpetual Peace”), was built to the south of",Paragraph
the river by the Han dynasty. It was destroyed,Paragraph
in 24 BCE. Subsequent dynasties moved the,Paragraph
"capital to Chengdu, Pingcheng, and Luoyang.",Paragraph
"During the T’ang dynasty (618-907 CE),",Paragraph
"Chang'an was made the capital again, this",Paragraph
time at a scale that was grand even for the,Paragraph
Chinese. It was not sited over the ruins of the,Paragraph
"old city, but just to its south. Its name was",Paragraph
"Daxing (“Great Prosperity"") (680-904 CE).",Paragraph
"Colloquially, it was called Chang’an, leading",Paragraph
"to some confusion, but it was built ex nihilo.",Paragraph
Very little is left of Daxing except for a few,Paragraph
pagodas. It is a sad fate for one of the great,Paragraph
cities of history. Today the sprawling modern,Paragraph
city of Xi'an lies over the ancient capital.,Paragraph
One of the few remnants of Daxing is the,Paragraph
Giant Wild Goose Pagoda (649-683 CE) that,Paragraph
was originally built at a height of 54 meters,Paragraph
"9.4 Sacred Grove at Futarasan Shrine, Nikko, Japan",Caption
and had a rammed earth core with a stone,Paragraph
"exterior facade. After it collapsed, it was",Paragraph
"rebuilt in brick (704), although an earthquake",Paragraph
in 1556 reduced its height frorn ten stories,Paragraph
to seven stories. One of the pagoda’s many,Paragraph
unctions was to hold sutras and figurines,Paragraph
of the Buddha that were brought to China,Paragraph
rom India by the Buddhist translator and,Title
traveler Hsuan Tsang (Xuanzang). To feed,Paragraph
"the population, the Chinese built canals that",Paragraph
inked in the north-south direction its various,Paragraph
east-west flowing rivers. The Sui dynasty,Paragraph
(581-618 CE) made major contributions,Paragraph
to that effort. It was not just rice that was,Paragraph
"rought in from the south, but also vast",Paragraph
amounts of bricks and lumber.,Paragraph
The arrival of Buddhism in Korea in the,Paragraph
4th century and in Japan in the 6th century,Title
rought with it the arrival of the monumental,Paragraph
architectural forms that had been developed,Paragraph
"in China. Monks, architects, engineers, and",Paragraph
even bureaucrats arrived hand in hand. One,Paragraph
of the earliest Buddhist structures in Japan,Paragraph
"is Yakushi-ji (Healing Buddha Temple), built",Paragraph
"in Fujiwara-kyo, Japan's capital in the Asuka",Paragraph
"period (538-710 CE), when Japan was ruled",Paragraph
by great clans and their extended families.,Paragraph
But whereas the story often focuses,Paragraph
"on Buddhism, since that left a relatively",Paragraph
"permanent architectural record, the",Paragraph
emergence of Japan must be viewed in,Paragraph
larger geopolitical terms. It paralleled the,Paragraph
emergence of Southeast Asia as a rice,Title
"producing/exporting area. In both cases,",Paragraph
"rice was elevated into the status of a deity,",Paragraph
and in both cases powerful leaders emerged,Paragraph
who mastered the politics necessary to,Paragraph
"control the intermixed realities of devotion,",Paragraph
"production, storage, and trade, while at the",Paragraph
same time living at the behest and blessing,Paragraph
of deities whom they served. But whereas,Paragraph
by the 9th century the Khmer in Cambodia,Paragraph
would force the forest to yield to the needs,Paragraph
"of a Hindu-based agricultural worldview, in",Paragraph
Japan an assimilation occurred between the,Paragraph
still-new rice-centric culture and the ancient,Title
local traditions associated with Shintoism.,Paragraph
Shintoisrn was not replaced; it simply,Paragraph
expanded to include a new and powerful,Paragraph
"deity known as Inari, the rice god. Rice",Paragraph
"granaries, elevated on platforms, became a",Paragraph
"form of sacred architecture, and with the rise",Paragraph
of imperial clans the granary rose to the level,Paragraph
"of state symbol, with no building representing",Paragraph
this better than the Ise Shrine.,Paragraph
"The word Shinto, which can be translated",Paragraph
"as “the way of the gods,” was coined in the",Paragraph
19th century to identify it as a religion distinct,Paragraph
from Buddhism. Prior to then Shintoism was,Paragraph
so fundamental to Japanese life and culture,Title
that it had no name apart from the names for,Paragraph
"the various cultic procedures, ceremonies,",Paragraph
and shamanistic rituals. It was a belief system,Paragraph
that stretched back to early humanity and,Paragraph
was characterized by the worship in Japan of,Paragraph
"kami, which can be defined as the “spirits”",Paragraph
"of mountains, rivers, lightning, wind, waves,",Paragraph
"trees, and even rocks. Kami and humans",Paragraph
"exist in a shared continuum. Nonetheless, the",Paragraph
"kami, as innate supernatural forces residing",Paragraph
"in all things, are above the actions of man.",Paragraph
"Certain localities, such as sacred groves,",Paragraph
or special stones are viewed as particularly,Paragraph
propitious for the meeting of humans with,Paragraph
the spirit of kami and are therefore held to,Paragraph
be sacred. There are several such groves still,Paragraph
"existing in Japan, such as the 20-hectare",Paragraph
wooded area Atsuta-ku in the city of Nagoya.,Paragraph
Unlike modern monotheistic religious,Paragraph
"practices, Shintoism does not require those",Paragraph
respecting its premises to be believers or,Paragraph
"practitioners. There are no sacred writings,",Paragraph
nor is there an organized theory of death.,Paragraph
"The spirits of the dead go to the mountains,",Paragraph
"above the sky, below the earth, or beyond the",Paragraph
horizon. Living beings from this world may,Paragraph
visit those from the other worlds in border,Title
"areas such as cliffs, caves, and coastlines.",Paragraph
The deceased generally do not become,Paragraph
kami unless there are special circumstances,Paragraph
associated with their death.,Paragraph
Shinto's earliest formation has left no,Paragraph
architectural expression at all. But this,Paragraph
changed in the 7th century with the arrival,Paragraph
of Buddhists and their highly developed,Title
architectural culture of temples and shrines.,Paragraph
Shinto devotion learned the lesson and so,Paragraph
was born the transformation of the village,Paragraph
"granary, already sacred, to imperial symbol.",Paragraph
Most famous of all is the Ise Shrine. Located,Paragraph
"in a sacred forest, it was seen as integral to",Paragraph
the imperial cult and serves in that capacity,Paragraph
even today. It is not one building but several,Paragraph
related structures all connected to a complex,Paragraph
set of calendric rituals. Only the ernperor and,Paragraph
the priests were allowed entry. The buildings,Paragraph
were unique in that they were required,Paragraph
to be rebuilt every twenty years using the,Paragraph
sacred trees from the holy mountain at,Title
the base of which the shrine sits. For that,Paragraph
"reason, we have a clear indication of ancient",Paragraph
architectural practices. Since this is the only,Paragraph
building in the world of such prominence,Title
"that is repeatedly rebuilt in this way, it poses",Paragraph
a question about the nature of time and,Paragraph
architecture. In a sense the buildings are,Paragraph
"permanent, not in terms of their material but",Paragraph
because of the ritual rebuilding requirements.,Paragraph

AGE OF JUSTINIAN,Title
The time period between Constantine,Title
the Great (272-337 CE) and Justinian,Title
(483-565 CE) was one of consolidation. For,Paragraph
"Justinian, the Romanum Imperium was to",Paragraph
be identified with the Christian ofkourmene,Paragraph
"(the known inhabited areas of the world),",Paragraph
and the triumph of Christianity was as,Paragraph
sacred a mission as the restoration of Roman,Title
"supremacy. To this end, he reintroduced",Paragraph
"Roman law, but with the dogmatic primacy",Paragraph
peculiar to the Christian religion. All other,Paragraph
religions were denied legal protection. Pagan,Paragraph
temples were torn down and strict laws,Paragraph
passed to consolidate and unify the Christian,Paragraph
"domination of the empire. In 529 CE,",Paragraph
"Justinian closed the Academy in Athens,",Paragraph
largely to stem the multiplication of ideas and,Paragraph
theories in theological debates and to enforce,Title
a unified doctrine. Many of its scholars had,Paragraph
"to seek refuge in Persia, taking with them the",Paragraph
fruits of Greek learning.,Paragraph
Justinian was able to recover Italy and,Paragraph
"Africa. Bridges, fortifications, aqueducts,",Caption
"churches, markets, and whole cities sprang",Title
up in the wake of his conquests. But the,Paragraph
situation was tenuous. Eastern Europe was,Paragraph
"still in turmoil, with the Avars and Bulgars",Paragraph
moving into Greece and the Lombards,Title
into northern Italy. The newly Christianized,Paragraph
Byzantine Empire,Title
x,Title
Persians,Title
620 ce,Title
Umayyad caliphate,Title
"Frankish kingdom, along with Italy, formed",Paragraph
only a thin civilizational wedge into a still,Paragraph
"barbaric Europe. Newly developing, however,",Paragraph
were trade links up the Volga River into the,Paragraph
"Russian steppe, facilitating trade that had",Paragraph
become disrupted by the advances of the,Paragraph
Islamic armies.,Paragraph
An excellent example of Justinian’s,Paragraph
architecture can be seen in Constantinople,Paragraph
in the church dedicated to Sergius and,Caption
"Bacchus, two soldiers in the Roman",Title
army who were martyred in the early 4th,Title
century CE and became the official patrons of,Paragraph
the Byzantine armies. Certain changes to its,Paragraph
"environs should, however, be kept in mind.",Paragraph
"The building, now a freestanding structure,",Paragraph
was originally part of a larger complex that,Paragraph
included Justinian’s private residence and,Paragraph
"palace. Furthermore, the slightly thicker walls",Paragraph
to the south belonged to another church,Paragraph
"dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul, begun in",Caption
"518 CE and built by Justinian’s uncle, Justin",Paragraph
"|. When Justinian became Caesar in 525 CE,",Paragraph
he appended the new construction onto that,Paragraph
one.,Paragraph
The two churches were connected at,Paragraph
ground level by means of three large arched,Caption
openings that later changed into windows,Paragraph
when the Church of SS. Peter and Paul,Paragraph
was removed. (Such church composites,Paragraph
"were not uncommon in the East, though",Paragraph
they were rare in the West.) The narthex on,Paragraph
"the west extended across both churches,",Paragraph
which shared a common atrium in front.,Paragraph
"To the north was a monumental entrance,",Paragraph
"presumably from the former palace, creating",Paragraph
a cross-axis from north to south linking,Paragraph
"the two buildings. For reasons unknown,",Paragraph
the Church of SS. Peter and Paul fell into,Paragraph
disrepair and was demolished; by the 16th,Paragraph
"century, it was gone, as were most of the",Paragraph
remnants of Justinian’s palace.,Paragraph
SS. Sergius and Bacchus's original context,Paragraph
"is important, as it explains sorne of the",Paragraph
curious—and also sometimes overlooked—,Paragraph
aspects of its design. To provide an entrance,Paragraph
for the priests from the southwest into the,Paragraph
"apse at the back of the church, the eastern",Caption
"facade was tilted a bit, with the space left for",Paragraph
a porch perhaps still visible in the setback,Caption
of the facade at that corner. The resultant tilt,Paragraph
impacted the orientation of the apse and thus,Paragraph
"of the central nave. To the west, the tilt was",Paragraph
not implernented because the narthex had to,Paragraph
align with the Church of SS. Peter and Paul.,Paragraph
The plan is distinguished by its extraordinary,Paragraph
"openness. Unlike Western churches, whic!",Paragraph
channel the churchgoer into the nave from,Paragraph
"the west, here is a system that permits more",Paragraph
fluid pathways into and through the church.,Paragraph
Another remarkable feature of the plan that,Paragraph
applies to both SS. Sergius and Bacchus and,Paragraph
the Hagia Sophia is that there are no separate,Paragraph
rooms to the right or left of the altar—rooms,Caption
for the preparation of the sacred meal and,Paragraph
where the bishop cons his garb. Such,Paragraph
"spaces, the prothesis and the diaconicon,",Paragraph
"respectively, are typical in later Byzantine",Paragraph
"churches, but they are not present in early",Paragraph
Justinian ones. The result in both buildings,Paragraph
is that the central structure holding the dome,Paragraph
is freed from the surrounding architecture in,Paragraph
a way that is uncharacteristic of Byzantine,Paragraph
design.,Paragraph
It would be a mistake to project current,Paragraph
medieval liturgical uses in Greek Orthodox,Title
"churches onto these spaces, even though",Paragraph
there are clearly numerous similarities. In,Paragraph
"Justinian’s day, the populace gathered closely",Paragraph
"around the ambo in the nave. In addition, the",Paragraph
preparatory rites of the prothesis (in a room,Caption
for the preparation of the sacred meal) for,Paragraph
the First Entrance that are common today,Paragraph
were not practiced; the entrance ritual was,Paragraph

"the entrance and had himself entered, he",Paragraph
"was followed by the deacon, who carried a",Paragraph

which stood for Christ himself—accompanied,Paragraph

followed. The First Entrance had numerous,Paragraph

the order is reversed: the priests enter,Paragraph
first and await the arrival of the bishop. In,Paragraph

9.7 Plan: SS. Sergius and Bacchus,Caption
"a gift of gold at the altar, he would proceed",Paragraph
"to the south aisle, where his throne was",Paragraph
located. The interaction between emperor,Paragraph
and priesthood was an essential and defining,Paragraph
moment in the integrity of the ernpire and,Paragraph
"the Church, with their meeting and common",Paragraph
participation in the ceremony a sign of the,Paragraph
unity of the earthly and divine realms. At SS.,Paragraph
"Sergius and Bacchus, the emperor’s spot was",Paragraph
"in the northeast of the gallery, from where he",Caption
could overlook the proceedings.,Paragraph
"Today, a table or niche on the north",Caption
"side serves as the prothesis, but there is",Paragraph
no evidence that this custom existed in,Paragraph
Byzantine times. It seems that the act of,Paragraph
bringing offerings of bread and wine by the,Paragraph
"congregation started outside the church,",Paragraph
in a special room of a building called the,Paragraph
skeuophylakion that was used to hold,Paragraph
the sacred vessels in which the food was,Paragraph
"transported. In other words, during the",Paragraph
"service, the wine and bread brought by the",Paragraph
"congregation was prepared out of sight and,",Paragraph
"in the process, “became” the flesh and",Paragraph
"blood of Christ, and was then carried into",Paragraph
the church. The bishop made his entrance,Paragraph
already vested—thus the absence of the,Paragraph
"diaconicon, a room where the bishop dons",Paragraph
"his garb, which came only later. The atrium",Paragraph
served as a place for people to gather. The,Paragraph

narthex was a more formal space used to,Paragraph

"various entrances, in a manner of popular",Paragraph
commotion.,Paragraph

wine were brought in through a side door.,Paragraph

There are two types of capitals used at the,Paragraph

combines the Corinthian with the lonic.,Paragraph
Composite capitals line the principal space of,Paragraph

"in the side spaces, in a minor position relative",Paragraph
to the Corinthian or composite orders (as was,Paragraph
"their fate well into the 19th century, when",Paragraph

Post-Renaissance classicism in Europe,Title
dismissed these efforts as radically outside,Paragraph
the norm of the “classical” tradition. But,Paragraph
the classical tradition was more open to,Paragraph
experimentation than one might at first think.,Paragraph
"Furthermore, after the fall of the Roman",Paragraph
"Empire, in which standardized models were",Paragraph
"often used, local craftsmen were invited",Paragraph
to test their skills. That many of these,Paragraph
craftsmen were using northern motives or,Paragraph
were themselves Christianized Visigoths is,Paragraph
more than obvious. The Visigoths invaded,Paragraph
"Byzantine territories in the 5th century, with",Paragraph
many of them staying on to be conscripted,Paragraph
into the Byzantine army. They tended to use,Paragraph

The history of Armenia’s Christian,Title
"architecture begins in 301 CE, when",Paragraph
Dertad III (the king of Armenia under Roman,Title
suzerainty) was converted to Christianity,Paragraph
"by St. Gregory the Illurninator, a native",Caption
Armenian who made Christianity the state,Title
"religion. In general, the Armenian liturgy",Paragraph
"resembles that of the Eastern Church, except",Paragraph
that its language is classical Armenian,Paragraph
rather than Greek. The distinctive look of,Paragraph
Armenian architecture developed quite,Paragraph
rapidly. Buildings tended to have forms,Paragraph
that were simple and solid-looking. From,Paragraph
"the earliest date, they were volumetric and",Paragraph
"planimetric masterpieces. Furthermore, the",Paragraph
carving and placement of the stones was,Paragraph
"excellent; indeed, at the time, these buildings",Paragraph
would have been far superior to other stone,Paragraph
buildings in Europe and Asia. Though,Paragraph
Byzantine architecture introduced the dome,Paragraph
as an important potential element in Christian,Paragraph
"architecture, the Byzantine dome was not",Paragraph
"visible externally. Armenian architecture, by",Caption
"way of contrast, pushed the dome up over",Paragraph
the mass of the building. Though the dome,Paragraph
itself was covered with a light wooden conical,Paragraph
"roof, the silhouette achieved would have a",Paragraph
profound impact on future church design.,Paragraph
"he Armenian word gmbet, usually",Paragraph
"translated as “dome,” means more precisely",Paragraph
“the vault of heaven.” The vision of Gregory,Paragraph
"the Illuminator (b. 239 CE), the patron",Paragraph
"saint of Armenia, also played a part in the",Paragraph
acceptance of the domme. He wrote that he,Paragraph
saw a figure of light descending from heaven,Paragraph
associated with a magnificent building that,Paragraph
had the form of a dome on four columns.,Paragraph
"9.19 St. Hripsime, Echmiadzin, Armenia",Caption
St. Hripsime,Title
One of the most refined examples of,Paragraph
Armenian architecture can be found in,Paragraph
Echmiadzin. St. Hripsime was the second,Paragraph
church built by St. Gregory the Illuminator,Caption
during the first quarter of the 4th century. It,Paragraph
was replaced in 395 CE by a small chapel.,Paragraph
The present edifice was built in 618 CE. The,Paragraph
"building is constructed of dark, ash-colored",Paragraph
tufa bonded on the interior with concrete-like,Paragraph
"mortar. The whole rests, like a Greek ternple,",Paragraph
on a stepped stylobate. The small windows,Caption
emphasize the mass and solidity of the,Paragraph
structure.,Paragraph
The interior is organized on a quatrefoil,Paragraph
"plan, with niches in the cardinal directions.",Paragraph
"In addition to these, there are niches on",Paragraph
"the diagonal corners, creating a fluid and",Paragraph
"dynamic interior space. The diagonal niches,",Paragraph
"having the form of three-quarter cylinders,",Paragraph
may also have been intended to strengthen,Paragraph
the abutment of the dome. They give access,Paragraph
to four subsidiary chambers that flank,Paragraph
the eastern and western niches. Though,Paragraph
"the building is biaxially symmetrical, the",Paragraph
eastern apse is emphasized by the raised,Paragraph
altar section that protrudes into the central,Paragraph
space. Barrel vaults intervene between the,Paragraph
axial niches and the central square. These,Paragraph
"vaults, which are wider along the main axis,",Paragraph
accentuate the east-west direction. The,Paragraph
whole composition is bound together to form,Paragraph
9.20 Plan: St. Hripsime,Caption
a well-proportioned rectangle with large,Paragraph
triangular recesses on the exterior that impart,Paragraph
a rhythmic impression of the composition.,Paragraph
The dome rests on a sixteen-sided windowed,Paragraph
drum that has twelve windows at its base.,Paragraph
Four of the windows are now obscured by,Caption
small cylindrical towers that were added,Caption
later as buttresses. The entrance porch on,Caption
the west is also a later addition. The beauty,Paragraph
of the St. Hripsime edifice derives from the,Paragraph
simplicity and harmony of its different parts.,Paragraph

Zvartnots Cathedral,Title
Among the many inventive designs of,Paragraph
"Armenian churches during this period,",Paragraph
one stands out particularly: the Church,Paragraph
of Zvartnots near Echmiadzin. Begun in,Caption
643 CE after Armenia's recovery from an,Paragraph
"Arab invasion in 640, it served for a time as",Paragraph
the seat of the Armenian church. Though,Paragraph
"only the foundations and colurmns remain,",Paragraph
it can be reconstructed with reasonable,Paragraph
accuracy. From the outside it consisted of,Paragraph
"three telescoped cylinders, 37 meters across",Caption
at ground level. The external walls were,Paragraph
enlivened by blind arcades. The cylindrical,Paragraph
exterior disguised a remarkable interior.,Paragraph
Four wedge-shaped piers framed four large,Caption
"exedrae, three of them composed of six",Paragraph
columns and the fourth closed off to form,Paragraph
the apse. The piers rose to form arches,Caption
that supported a dome on squinches. At,Paragraph
"the ground floor, the space between the",Paragraph
"exterior and interior served as an ambulatory,",Paragraph
in essence producing a building within a,Paragraph
"building. As with all Armenian churches, the",Paragraph
windows were small but well integrated into,Paragraph
"the composition. Here, however, the interior",Paragraph
"was proportionally quite tall, unlike most",Paragraph
"Armenian churches, which seem to strive",Paragraph
for a balance between the horizontal and,Paragraph
vertical. The church was recognized in its day,Paragraph
as a marvel. There are clear similarities to the,Paragraph
church of SS. Sergius and Bacchus (527-,Caption
"36 CE) in Constantinople. But that building,",Paragraph
"a brick structure, apart from the columns,",Paragraph
was squat and was integrated into a palace,Paragraph
"compound. Zvartnots, by contrast, was not",Paragraph
"only larger in footprint and built of stone,",Paragraph
but designed to be clearly visible against the,Paragraph
"landscape. Furthermore, the carving of the",Paragraph
capitals and detailing of the arches was of the,Paragraph
highest order.,Paragraph

in a somewhat unusual move perhaps,Paragraph
"reflective of Chinese notions of kingship,",Paragraph
a valley known as My Son (69 kilometers,Paragraph

worshipped by the Champa.,Paragraph
"The earliest temples, built from wood,",Paragraph
have not survived. Brick masonry was,Paragraph
introduced toward the end of the 7th century.,Paragraph
The temples all followed a similar Indian,Paragraph
model: a square ground plan with a platform,Paragraph

The external surface was often plastered,Paragraph

Many of the roofs were originally covered,Paragraph

less than 5 percent of the entire city. Just,Paragraph
south of it was the Imperial City (offices of,Paragraph

"halls). The Imperial City, which was the",Paragraph
"administrative heart of the empire, was also",Paragraph
where the emperor conducted his ritual,Paragraph
sacrifices at the imperial ancestral temple,Title
and at the imperial heavenly altar.,Paragraph
The rest of the city was divided up on a,Paragraph
grid pattern. Enclosing an area some 8.65,Paragraph
"kilometers by 9.72 kilometers in size, the",Paragraph
city’s outer walls were punctured by three,Paragraph
"gates, one each on the western, southern,",Paragraph
"and eastern walls. The southern gate,",Paragraph
"Mingde, was the main entrance and opened",Paragraph
"onto a monumental street 220 meters wide,",Paragraph
while the streets leading from the other gates,Paragraph
measured about 140 meters wide.,Paragraph
Water played an important part in the,Paragraph
"design, with several streams running through",Paragraph
the city. One went through the west market,Paragraph
and another through the east market.,Paragraph
There were five transport and sanitation,Title
canals running throughout the city—which,Paragraph
had several different water sources—that,Paragraph
"delivered water to city parks, the gardens",Paragraph
"of the rich, and the grounds of the imperial",Paragraph
palaces. The canals were also used to,Paragraph
transport crucial goods throughout the city.,Paragraph
The residential part of the city was divided,Paragraph
by east-west and north-south avenues into,Paragraph
108 neighborhood blocks called fangs.,Paragraph
The roads were lined with water drainage,Paragraph
"channels on both sides, and shaded by rows",Paragraph
of trees. The residential areas were further,Paragraph
"accessed by alleys. In spite of its population,",Paragraph
the colossal spread of the city ensured that,Paragraph
"the density of the fangs was not very high,",Paragraph
especially compared to that of Teotihuacan,Paragraph
and Rome at their heights. The fangs,Paragraph
"contained temples, commercial buildings,",Paragraph
"public parks, and housing. Each fang was",Paragraph
a mini-city with its own inner transportation,Paragraph
"network, walls, gates, and corner towers.",Paragraph
There were two major cornmercial areas in,Paragraph
"the outer city, referred to as the west and",Paragraph
"east markets, each occupying two fangs.",Paragraph
These markets were the subject of many,Paragraph
"literary descriptions, often devoted to the",Paragraph
global range of goods available there. The,Paragraph
areas around Quijan Lake and the Xingging,Paragraph
fang were famous scenic districts. In the,Paragraph
southeastern part of the city was a ward,Paragraph
that was home to a large monastery with,Paragraph
ten courtyards and the Wild Goose Pagoda,Title
(652 CE). This same city ward also had a,Paragraph
"large bathhouse, an entertainment courtyard,",Paragraph
"and an additional monastery, as well as a",Paragraph

The elaborate ritual process of rebuilding the,Paragraph

The reconstruction alternates between two,Paragraph
"adjacent sites. While one site is in use, the",Paragraph

When the floor of the previous Shoden is,Paragraph
"relocated, a small wooden pillar, known",Paragraph
"as the shin-no-mihashira, or “heart pillar,”",Paragraph
"is left buried in the old shrine compound,",Paragraph
"and a small shed, the o/-ya, is built over it",Paragraph
to protect it from the elements. The lumber,Paragraph
consists of hundreds of trees that are taken,Paragraph
from a sacred grove in the mountains and,Paragraph
transported to the site with much fanfare and,Paragraph
"reverence. The old lumber, still sacred, is",Paragraph
disseminated to be used in the repair of other,Paragraph
Shinto shrines around Japan.,Paragraph
The idea of renewal might also be tied,Paragraph

the desire to show reverence to the Great,Paragraph

The golden hall and the pagoda were,Paragraph

INTRODUCTION,Title
The period between 800 and 1000 CE saw,Paragraph
dramatic transformations across the African/,Title
Eurasian world. Most significant among,Paragraph
these were the expansion of Islam across,Paragraph
northern Africa and the further development,Title
of Indianization in Southeast Asia. Just,Paragraph
as Indianization tightened the maritime,Paragraph
economic connection between China and,Title
"India, Islamization unified the land-based",Paragraph
connections from Baghdad in Iraq to Cordoba,Title
in Spain. The water highway and the desert,Title
highway redefined the very paradigm of,Paragraph
African and Eurasian civilization. To this must,Paragraph
"be added another sweeping change, the",Paragraph
"Buddhafication of northern China, Korea, and",Paragraph
"Japan. Normally, these transformations are",Paragraph
viewed as separate and are treated as such.,Paragraph
"From a global perspective, however, they",Paragraph
"are interlocked, and together they set the",Paragraph
foundations for the modern world.,Paragraph
"To put all this in architectural terms, the",Paragraph
Mosque of Cordoba in Spain (begun in 784),Caption
is contemporaneous with Borodudur (ca.,Paragraph
800) in Indonesia and Todai-ji (ca. 730),Paragraph
"in Japan, each the result of the respective",Paragraph
"processes of Islamization, Indianization, and",Title
"Buddhafication. In other words, the new",Paragraph
"emirate of Cardoba, the Sailendra dynasty",Title
"in Java, and the Nara in Japan were similar",Paragraph
in that they were important new links in,Paragraph
the transcontinental economic system. For,Paragraph
"the first time in history, the furthest points",Paragraph
east were connected to the furthest points,Paragraph
west. Contemporaneous also was an array of,Paragraph
"new, large, planned cities: Baghdad in Iraq,",Paragraph
"Hariharalaya (“City of Shiva and Vishnu"") in",Paragraph
"Cambodia, Samye in Tibet, and Heijo-kyo in",Paragraph
"Japan, all of which would soon rival more",Paragraph
established urban centers like Chang’an,Paragraph
and Constantinople. In this crosscurrent of,Paragraph
"cultural exchange and tension, architecture",Title
was not simply copied and exported but,Paragraph
underwent a wide range of innovations.,Paragraph
As far as the development of Islam,Title
"was concerned, nothing like it had ever",Paragraph
"been seen in human history. Christianity,",Paragraph
"by comparison, despite repressions during",Paragraph
"the Roman Empire, eventually in the 4th",Paragraph
"century became an imperial religion, and it",Paragraph
spread in jumps and starts. The nomadic,Paragraph
groups that had swept into Europe settled,Paragraph
"and converted, often en masse. In 863, for",Paragraph
"example, the Bulgars (who settled in modern-",Paragraph
"day Bulgaria) converted by the thousands,",Paragraph
allowing Byzantium to develop trade relations,Paragraph
with its northern neighbor without conquest.,Paragraph
"Buddhism spread differently, namely along",Paragraph
"trade routes, and was almost totally peaceful.",Paragraph
"But Islam, with its fervor and expanding",Paragraph
"military strength, worked its way to North",Paragraph
"Africa and beyond with astonishing rapidity,",Paragraph
reaching southern Spain in 711.,Paragraph
"10.2 Borobudur, Java, Indonesia",Caption
It was not just the excitement of religion that,Paragraph
drove this powerful force. Islam's expansion,Paragraph
was funded by the extraordinary wealth,Paragraph
coming from India and Southeast Asia.,Paragraph
With the deterioration of the northern Silk,Paragraph
Route across Inner Asia because of regional,Paragraph
infighting and a warming period that dried up,Paragraph
"springs and wells in the Taklamakan Desert,",Paragraph
ndia had become the 9th-century global,Paragraph
powerhouse. India was unique in the world,Paragraph
in that it had a dual capacity to unify trade in,Paragraph
"ulk items, such as lurnber and grain, with",Paragraph
"trade in luxury goods, such as gold, silver,",Paragraph
"diamonds, and gems. The Silk Route may",Paragraph
ave been named for a commodity that came,Paragraph
"rom China, but just as important now—if",Paragraph
not more so—was what was coming out of,Paragraph
"ndia and Sri Lanka, namely gemstones like",Paragraph
"rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and diamonds.",Paragraph
"Hsuan Tsang (Xuanzang) (602-64 CE, a",Paragraph
"Chinese Buddhist monk and scholar, traveled",Title
to Sri Lanka and reported seeing a ruby on,Paragraph
the spire of the temple at Anuradhapura,Caption
whose magnificence illuminated the sky.,Paragraph
Ratnapura—literally “Gem City”—is the,Paragraph
capital of Sabaragamuwa province and even,Paragraph
today is a hub for gem traders. India also,Paragraph
"exported sugar, cotton, and ivory. This vast",Paragraph
diversity of exports differentiated India's,Title
"economy from that of China, which tended",Paragraph
"to focus only on silk, bronze, and porcelain",Paragraph
"as export commodities, and produced a",Paragraph
"complex, interwoven import-export ecology",Title
that was unique in the world. There is no,Paragraph
doubt that India was the richest and most,Paragraph
"politically stable area at the time, and that",Paragraph
this area with its various kingdoms served as,Paragraph
the motor to the Eurasian economic system.,Paragraph
"Across India and Sri Lanka, hundreds",Paragraph
of sacred sites were being established.,Paragraph
"Hinduism, or some variant of it, was now",Paragraph
"adopted by almost all of the regional powers,",Paragraph
with rock-cut architecture reaching new,Paragraph
heights. Though the Elephanta Caves rank,Paragraph
"high arnong these accomplishments, the",Paragraph
most impressive of all was Kailasa Temple,Paragraph
"in Ellora, India, which was built by the",Paragraph
Rashtrakuta dynasty. Carved inside and,Caption
"out in a rock-cut manner, Kailasa is without",Paragraph
doubt one of the greatest examples of that,Paragraph
technique in the history of architecture.,Paragraph
Designed to recall Mount Kailash in the,Paragraph
"Himalayas, it was dedicated to the god Shiva.",Paragraph
But rock-architecture with its eight-hundred-,Paragraph
year history in India was soon to be a thing of,Paragraph
the past. The 9th century saw the transition,Paragraph
to stone masonry temples.,Paragraph
Though Indian influence through,Title
Buddhism had worked its way north into the,Paragraph
"mountains, its more important orientation",Paragraph
was eastward in the process known as,Paragraph
"Indianization, which had begun some four",Paragraph
"centuries before. Merchants, bringing with",Paragraph
them Buddhist and later Hindu monks and,Paragraph
"priests, had actively set out to transform",Paragraph
Southeast Asia from a village economy to,Title
"an economy driven by state bureaucracies,",Paragraph
"trade, and rice production. The Indianization",Paragraph
of Southeast Asia was not met by a,Paragraph
Sinicization from the other direction. Chinese,Paragraph
cities were massive enterprises designed,Paragraph
as a means to consolidate power. It was,Paragraph
a model that was impossible to replicate,Paragraph
without complete control of the surrounding,Paragraph
"land. In India, however, cities were often",Paragraph
built around temples and their economies,Title
and bureaucracies. It was a model that,Paragraph
could be easily replicated since it was,Paragraph
designed to grow from village-scale to city-,Paragraph
"scale. And indeed, this economic/social/",Paragraph
religious package was eminently successful,Paragraph
in transforming the region into one of the,Paragraph
world's major economic hotspots. Pyu (in,Paragraph
"modern-day Myanmar), along the Irrawaddy",Paragraph
"River, had already developed as a rice-",Paragraph
exporting Buddhist state in the 5th century,Paragraph
"and, based on precedents from the Gupta in",Paragraph
"India, was beginning to develop its unique",Paragraph
form of Buddhist stupas. To the south on,Paragraph
"the island of Java, the Srivijayan Empire was",Paragraph
"rising to become an important regional force,",Paragraph
but of a new sort that did not need huge,Paragraph
armies or expensive flotillas. Trade and tolls,Paragraph
generated from the ships going back and,Paragraph
forth from China and India were the source of,Paragraph
"its wealth. Its rulers, eager to accommodate",Paragraph
"both Buddhists and Hindus, built huge",Paragraph
sanctuaries for the devotees of both,Title
religions. Of these Borobudur was the most,Paragraph
"spectacular, and certainly ranks as the most",Paragraph
impressive architectural accomplishment of,Paragraph
its age. It was innovative in many ways. Built,Paragraph
"entirely of stone, it fused the Hindu idea of",Paragraph
a sacred mountain with the Buddhist idea,Title
"of a sacred mandala, becoming nothing less",Paragraph
than a three-dimensional mountain/mandala,Paragraph
that epitomized the tight relationship between,Paragraph
Buddhist metaphysics and mathematics. In,Paragraph
"850, the Srivijayan built a parallel building,",Paragraph
ut dedicated to the Hindu deity Shiva.,Paragraph
"nown as Prambanan, it was unlike any",Paragraph
"temple in India, rising from the misty valley",Paragraph
"loor like a steeply cliffed, craggy mountain.",Paragraph
"In Cambodia, at the eastern front of the",Paragraph
"ndianization process, there was an even",Paragraph
more startling transformation as the forests,Title
were clear-cut for vast rice paddies fed not,Paragraph
y monsoon floods but by water from large,Paragraph
barays—kilometer-long artificial lakes that,Paragraph
were designed to hold water for the dry,Paragraph
season—water that could then be tapped to,Paragraph
"create a second growing season. The Khmer,",Paragraph
"who were largely Hindu, had perfected this",Paragraph
technique and were now the veritable kings of,Paragraph
"rice, becoming the bulk supplier of the grain",Paragraph
to both China and India. They had little to,Paragraph
"offer in terms of luxury items, apart from rare",Paragraph
feathers and lumber. Everything else they had,Paragraph
"to import, including bronze, cooking vessels,",Paragraph
and gold and silver for their buildings. All,Paragraph
this depended on mastering the landscape.,Paragraph
"Hariharalaya (“City of Shiva and Vishnu”), a",Paragraph
perfectly square city some 2 kilometers on a,Paragraph
"side, with its own vast baray, was a testament",Paragraph
"to this new, extreme economy. It was without",Paragraph
doubt one of the greatest urban experiments,Paragraph
of the age. Located deep in what had been,Paragraph
"forest, it was designed as a brand-new,",Paragraph
sacred Hindu landscape with a great temple,Title
dedicated to Shiva. At its geometrical center,Paragraph
"was a step temple, Bakong, which was not",Paragraph
just a temple on earth but a new spiritual,Title
center of the world. This great experiment,Paragraph
in hydrology and religion was to develop into,Paragraph
"what is now colloquially known as Angkor, a",Paragraph
"vast sprawling city of temples, palaces, and",Paragraph
"canals, the size of modern-day Boston. The",Paragraph
vast deforestation of the surrounding area,Title
"would eventually have negative effects, but",Paragraph
"for the time being, the wealth of the Knmer—",Paragraph
rooted precariously around a single export,Paragraph
product—made it into a regional powerhouse.,Paragraph
"It was, one might say, new wealth.",Paragraph
The rise of Southeast Asia occurred at,Paragraph
the same time as the T’ang dynasty’s loss,Paragraph
of Chinese control over the northern trade,Title
"routes, and indeed Southeast Asia benefited",Paragraph
greatly from this disruption. The great,Paragraph
"metropolis Chang'an, the nominal capital of",Paragraph
"the T'ang, was in decline and the empire was",Paragraph
increasingly ruled by local military governors,Paragraph
and warlords. The problems in the north,Paragraph
meant that large numbers of people were,Paragraph
leaving there for the more stable south. In the,Paragraph
"7th century, northern China held 75 percent",Paragraph
of the country’s overall population; by the,Paragraph
9th century that number was reduced to 50,Paragraph
"percent. There was also, in this turbulent",Paragraph
"time, an atternpt to turn the clock back to",Paragraph
"ancient, pre-Buddhist religions. In 845,",Paragraph
"the emperor shut down 4,600 Buddhist",Paragraph
"monasteries along with 40,000 temples and",Paragraph
"shrines, forcing 260,000 Buddhist monks",Paragraph
and nuns to return to secular life. Not even,Paragraph
the Roman repression of the Christians,Title
was on this scale. The repression was so,Paragraph
vast that few buildings from this era have,Paragraph
"survived into modern times, apart from the",Paragraph
Nanchan Temple (782 CE) and the Foguang,Paragraph
"Temple. The issue was not religion as such,",Paragraph
but the attempt by the government to keep,Paragraph
Buddhist monasteries from becoming a type,Title
"of alternative government, with their own",Paragraph
power structure and fundraising capacities.,Paragraph
"As is often the case, what may have seerned",Paragraph
like a good idea on paper had terrible,Paragraph
"10.3 Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem",Caption
"consequences, in this case the destruction",Paragraph
"of the social network, which only further",Paragraph
weakened the T’ang and led to their ultimate,Paragraph
demise. There can be no doubt that the,Paragraph
spectacular rise of the Khmer to the south,Title
"and of Japan to the east, both rice suppliers,",Paragraph
had much to do with the weakening of the,Paragraph
"Chinese economy, which forced the Chinese",Paragraph
to become rice importers.,Paragraph
The irony was that Buddhism was gaining,Paragraph
"strength in—and transforming—Mongolia,",Paragraph
"Korea, and Japan, precisely because of",Paragraph
"its capacity, like most modern religions, to",Paragraph
organize society around a set of common,Paragraph
"ideals. In Tibet, the new city of Samye (775)",Paragraph
"was laid out as a circular, mandala city with",Paragraph
a square ternple complex at the center. But,Paragraph
"in Tibet, and elsewhere as it moved north,",Paragraph
Buddhism encountered resistance—not from,Paragraph
"the government elites but from below, from",Paragraph
"the deep-seated attachment to shamanism,",Paragraph
which had roots in ancient social norms. In,Paragraph
"Tibet, a ruler named Lang Darma (r. 838-",Paragraph
"842) persecuted Buddhists, and after his",Paragraph
death Buddhism declined. And when it was,Paragraph
"revived in Tibet in the late 10th century, it was",Paragraph
"a different Buddhism, one that had adopted",Paragraph
"shamanic and folk elements. In many cases,",Paragraph
Tibetan Buddhist religious functionaries took,Title
over the roles normally held by the shaman.,Paragraph
Buddhism won support by converting the,Paragraph
spirits of wind and earth into various types,Title
of protector figures. In Japan also there was,Paragraph
a type of rapprochement with shamanistic,Paragraph
worldviews as Buddhism and Shintoism,Title
"developed hybrid forms. In all of this,",Paragraph
Buddhist architecture went through a critical,Paragraph
"period of experimentation. As to the stupa,",Paragraph
what in India had been just a roundish,Paragraph
mound was now taking on a wide variety of,Paragraph
"shapes, to eventually become a tower.",Paragraph
Japan during this century was now,Paragraph
emerging as a geopolitical force with the,Paragraph
"founding in 708 of Heijo-kyo, its first",Paragraph
permanent capital. That it was modeled,Paragraph
"after Chang’an was no accident, for it was",Paragraph
designed as the ambitious eastern terminus,Paragraph
"of the Silk Route, and indeed, it hosted",Paragraph
merchants from as far off as India. The,Paragraph
"political times were, however, unsettled, with",Paragraph
Japan suffering from a series of disasters and,Paragraph
"epidemics. In the context of these problems,",Paragraph
"Emperor Shomu, doing the opposite of the",Paragraph
"Chinese, who were suppressing Buddhism,",Paragraph
issued an edict in 741 to promote the,Paragraph
construction of provincial Buddhist ternples,Title
"throughout the nation. Of these, Todai-ji",Paragraph
served as the central administrative temple,Paragraph
for the other provincial temples. Todai-ji,Caption
contains the largest bronze Buddha statue,Caption
"in the world, a testament not just to the skill",Paragraph
of the artisans but to the wealth and indeed,Paragraph
bravura of a new generation of Japanese,Title
rulers.,Paragraph
This cross-regional economic zone from,Paragraph
Japan and China through Southeast Asia to,Title
India produced a huge outlay of trade and,Paragraph
wealth. The emerging Islamic caliphates,Paragraph
extended the reach of this wealth westward.,Paragraph
An early mosque was Umayyad Mosque of,Paragraph
Damascus in Syria (715); it was built on the,Paragraph
site of a former Roman temple complex that,Paragraph
had been previously converted to a Christian,Paragraph
church. The design is conditioned by these,Paragraph
earlier realities; the Corinthian columns on,Paragraph
"the interior, for example, were taken from",Paragraph
the ruins of the Roman temple. A mosque,Caption
is designed for congregational worship. At,Paragraph
some moments it is filled and at others quite,Paragraph
empty. Borobudur was designed to facilitate,Paragraph
the search for nirvana. Apart from sutras that,Paragraph
"individuals know by heart, there is no sacred",Paragraph
text that guides a devotee. A mosque is,Paragraph
designed to orient the believer to Mecca and,Paragraph
is a place where the imam can hold forth on,Paragraph
the Qur'an.,Paragraph
"In Jerusalern, the Umayyad built a",Paragraph
"particularly innovative structure, the Dome",Paragraph
of the Rock (691). Though one of the holiest,Paragraph
"sites in Islam, it is not technically a mosque.",Paragraph
"It was built around the rocky apex of a hill,",Paragraph
from whence Mohammed is said to have left,Paragraph
the earth to commune with the divine during,Paragraph
one of his dreams. It was probably built,Paragraph
"by Byzantine masons, and its architecture",Paragraph
and mosaics were clearly patterned after,Paragraph
"Byzantine churches, though its great dome,",Paragraph
"now gilded, was of wood and not heavy brick.",Paragraph
This building is unusual in that one can enter,Paragraph
"its perimeter, but not set foot in the interior",Paragraph
"space, the floor of which is the exposed rock",Paragraph
itself. It is unique in the world in this respect.,Paragraph
"One can compare it with Borobudur, another",Paragraph
uilding designed as a sacred destination.,Paragraph
"That building, once one reaches its apex, has",Paragraph
"at the top a massive stupa that is, of course,",Paragraph
inaccessible except to the mind’s eye. At the,Paragraph
"Dome of the Rock, the central space is also",Paragraph
"inaccessible, though it is defined not by a",Paragraph
"solid mass but by a soaring, domed space.",Paragraph
"After the fall of the Umayyads, who ruled",Paragraph
"rom Damascus, the next Muslim dynasty,",Paragraph
"the Abbasid, built a new capital, Baghdad",Paragraph
"(founded 762), located just north of the",Paragraph
former Sassanian capital of Ctesiphon.,Paragraph
"Like Hariharalaya and Samye, this city too",Paragraph
was an example of theocentric urbanism.,Paragraph
f Hariharalaya was the city of Shiva and,Paragraph
"Vishnu, and Samye was the Buddhist",Paragraph
"mandala of enlightenment, Baghdad was a",Paragraph
deliberate reminder of an expression in the,Paragraph
Qur'an referring to paradise. Baghdad was,Paragraph
soon to become one of the great cities in,Paragraph
"central Asia; by the 10th century, the city’s",Paragraph
population was over a million.,Paragraph
"The Abbasids, despite their wealth, were",Paragraph
"not able to control the vast Islamic regions,",Paragraph
and thenceforth the history of Islam became,Paragraph
"a history of regional powers, often with",Paragraph
conflicting theological perspectives. One of,Paragraph
"these new powers was the Tulunids, who",Paragraph
became the first independent dynasty to,Paragraph
rule the newly Islamic Egypt. The Tulunids,Paragraph
built the impressive and well-proportioned,Paragraph
Mosque of Ibn Tulun (879). It was intended,Paragraph
"as the focal point of Ibn Tulun’s capital, and",Paragraph
in fact was built next to Ibn Tulun’s palace,Paragraph
(no longer extant). Its design featured a large,Paragraph
courtyard with one covered hall on each of,Paragraph
"the four sides, the largest being on the side of",Paragraph
"the qibla, the direction to Mecca.",Paragraph
Europeans were not a particularly,Paragraph
significant part of this global economy.,Paragraph
"Admittedly, the feudal system had stabilized",Paragraph
"things following several centuries of turmoil,",Paragraph
but it was built around the principle of,Paragraph
"economic regionalism, as opposed to cross-",Paragraph
continental economic interdependence. A,Paragraph
strengthening monastic culture enhanced,Title
"stability, but whereas in India the Hindu",Paragraph
"temple was an economic unit, often",Paragraph
associated with a city and with the ideals of,Paragraph
"wealth, the European Christian monastery",Title
was by definition anti-urban and committed,Paragraph
to the ideals—if not the practice—of poverty.,Paragraph
St. Augustine and other theologians saw the,Paragraph
"city of Rome as decadent, which explains",Paragraph
to some degree the need for remoteness,Paragraph
and isolation. There are similarities with,Paragraph
"Buddhism, but Buddhism emphasizes the",Paragraph
"personal attainment of nirvana, whereas in",Paragraph
"Christian monasteries, attainment of a state of",Paragraph
blessedness was a distinctly cormmunal effort,Paragraph
enforced by a set of complex regulations,Paragraph
handed down from higher authorities. We,Paragraph
are fortunate to have a surviving plan of a,Paragraph
monastic compound at St. Gall in Switzerland,Caption
that serves as a plan/diagram of the inner,Paragraph
workings of the monastery. The plan lays out,Paragraph
a complex spatial organization delineating,Paragraph
secular and religious zones as well as the,Paragraph
different activities that define the monk’s daily,Paragraph
life.,Paragraph
The status of Europe was soon to change,Paragraph
with the rise to power of Charlemagne as,Paragraph
"head of the Franks, who had just converted",Paragraph
en masse to Christianity. Building for,Paragraph
himself the Palace of Aachen in what is now,Paragraph
"Germany, Charlemagne was able to unify",Paragraph
the Franks and bring his rule in alignment,Paragraph
"with papal ambitions, creating a new entity",Paragraph
"called, on paper at least, the Holy Roman",Paragraph
"Empire. Since the Franks were largely simple,",Paragraph
"agropastoral villagers, it stands to reason",Paragraph
that the sumptuous palace at Aachen was,Paragraph
"designed by imported architects, most likely",Paragraph
"from Armenia and Constantinople, since they",Paragraph
were the most skilled stonernasons in the,Paragraph
world at the time.,Paragraph
But Europe was in no position to benefit,Paragraph
from any of the transcontinental wealth,Title
that was flowing to its south along the,Paragraph
Mediterranean. Large-scale Viking attacks,Paragraph
devastated the northern territories and,Paragraph
extended along the coast of France. Even,Paragraph
Rome was sacked by the Saracens in 846.,Paragraph
"As a whole, Europe was, therefore, a rather",Paragraph
"backward place architecturally, as most of",Paragraph
"10.4 Church of San Salvador de Valdediés, Spain",Caption
its buildings were made of wood or stone,Paragraph
"rubble, compared to the advanced stonework",Paragraph
of Borobudur or the Hindu temples of India.,Paragraph
One need only look at the churches of San,Paragraph
Salvador de Valdediés and San Julian de,Title
"los Prados, both in Spain, to recognize the",Paragraph
difference. These are hardly world-class,Paragraph
structures. Windows are small and unevenly,Paragraph
spaced. Most of the building is made from,Paragraph

proportions and meticulous stonework of the,Paragraph
"Armenian church of Saint Hripsime, or to the",Paragraph
"Shore Temple in Mamallapuram, India, or the",Paragraph
"Bhringesvara Shiva Termple in Bhubaneshwar,",Paragraph
"India, both of which demonstrate meticulous",Paragraph
stonework and complex curving surfaces.,Paragraph
"That said, one has to remark again on a",Paragraph
fundamental issue. Borobudur is a building,Paragraph
"that is experienced outdoors, meaning",Paragraph
there is no inner space. It is a custom-built,Paragraph
mountain; the same can be said of the Shore,Paragraph
Temple in Mamallapuram. There is an inner,Paragraph
"sanctum, but it is not a public space. Neither",Paragraph
of these buildings center on a congregational,Paragraph
ethos. The Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo,Caption
"certainly does, but it too is in essence an",Paragraph
outdoor building. Though there is a roof over,Paragraph
"part of the structure, apart from the perimeter",Paragraph
wall there are no inner enclosures. Christians,Paragraph
alone—with an architecture that draws on its,Paragraph
sources in the Roman basilica—had by now,Paragraph
developed the idea of a completely enclosed,Paragraph
"indoor space, with structures built of wood",Paragraph
"and stone. These early churches were not,",Paragraph
"however, for the people. Most Christians, if",Paragraph
"they did worship regularly, did so in more",Paragraph
modest buildings. The early stone-built,Paragraph
"churches were for the elites and the nobility,",Paragraph
for whom Christianity brought a special,Paragraph
standing in the community.,Paragraph
Think of the 9th century this way: The,Paragraph
wealth-generating horizon of rice and high-,Paragraph
end luxury goods was restricted to a narrow,Paragraph
east-west belt that curved frorn southern,Paragraph
China through Southeast Asia and India to,Title
"Baghdad and Cairo, with heavy emphasis",Paragraph
on India. Adding dirnensionality to this,Paragraph
was a radical intensification of architecture,Paragraph
and engineering around the production of,Paragraph
"rice in Indonesia, Cambodia, Korea, and",Paragraph
Japan. The combined energy of this trade,Paragraph
produced inextricable changes at the various,Paragraph
"peripheries, where the first states, Japan to",Paragraph
"the east and Tibet to the north, arise. Soon",Paragraph
"arrows would be pointing even further afield,",Paragraph
to Scandinavia and southward across the,Title
great Sahara Desert. Within two hundred,Paragraph
years these “peripherals” would be firmly,Paragraph
connected to the larger transcontinental world,Title
of economic wealth.,Paragraph
"n all of this, one must not forget that",Paragraph
"northern and Inner Asia, separated from the",Paragraph
"south by vast stretches of trackless deserts,",Paragraph
"forest, and tundra, were still inhabited",Paragraph
by First Society cultures. But even here,Paragraph
things were by no means static. In northern,Paragraph
Canada the Dorset hunting culture was being,Paragraph
"replaced by a highly skilled, oceangoing,",Paragraph
seal-hunting culture known as the Thule,Paragraph
and later as the Inuit. They would develop,Paragraph
a unique architectural form known as the,Paragraph
igloo. An even more significant transformation,Paragraph
was taking place in the southwest of,Paragraph
"the United States, where corn had been",Paragraph
introduced around 100 BCE. Beginning in,Paragraph
"the 7th century, the Hohokam began to",Paragraph
build extensive irrigation networks along the,Paragraph
lower Salt and middle Gila Rivers. They were,Paragraph
the only American culture to use irrigation,Paragraph
north of Mexico. They also integrated corn,Paragraph
with the development of native plant species,Paragraph
like mesquite to develop an extensive and,Paragraph
complex agro-spiritual landscape that would,Paragraph
culminate in the construction of sacred ritual,Paragraph
cities in Chaco Canyon between 803 and,Paragraph
"1130. By this time, corn was also starting to",Paragraph
make its appearance in the eastern part of,Paragraph
"North America, with dramatic implications to",Paragraph
come in the subsequent centuries.,Paragraph
"In Mexico, after the collapse of",Paragraph
"Teotihuacan around 600 CE, competition",Caption
ensued among several important political,Paragraph
"centers in central Mexico, leading to the",Paragraph
emergence of the Toltecs (ca. 800-1000).,Paragraph

RISE OF ISLAM,Title
"Arabia, on account of its extreme climactic",Paragraph

periphery of the great cultural centers of the,Paragraph
age. It was mainly inhabited by nomadic,Paragraph
Bedouin Arabs who served as traders or,Paragraph
lived off the land’s meager resources. The,Paragraph
"center of Arabian religion, which focused on",Paragraph
"nature and heavenly bodies, was in Mecca.",Paragraph
Mohammed (ca. 570-632 CE) began a bitter,Paragraph
and prolonged struggle with Arab tribes and,Title
"their polytheism, advocating instead a brand",Paragraph
of monotheism based on universalist and,Paragraph
egalitarian sociopolitical ideas that conflicted,Title
with traditional tribal politics.,Paragraph
"Born in Mecca, Mohammed was an",Paragraph
orphan raised by his uncle. When he was,Paragraph
"forty years old, he retreated into a cave",Paragraph
"near Ramadan, where he received his first",Paragraph
"illumination. After further revelations, he",Paragraph
began preaching monotheism. Successful in,Paragraph
"attracting followers, he eventually conquered",Paragraph
Mecca and transformed it into Islam's holiest,Paragraph
"city, which all adult Muslims are required to",Paragraph
visit at least once in their lives. He died in,Paragraph
632 CE after having converted most of Arabia,Paragraph
"to the new creed. Beyond being a prophet,",Paragraph
"Mohammed was also a farsighted statesman,",Paragraph
"a political arbitrator, and a gifted military",Paragraph
"commander, setting the stage for a fusion of",Paragraph

Muslim Arab armies were attacking northern,Paragraph
India to the east as well as North Africa to,Title
"the west, and by the end of the 9th century,",Paragraph
Islam had grown into the largest political,Paragraph
entity west of China.,Paragraph
Since Mohammed made no arrangements,Title
"for a successor, dissension arose after his",Paragraph
"leath as to how to govern this vast territory,",Paragraph
and the conflict between the Abbasids,Title
and Umayyads created a divide in Islam,Paragraph
"that persists to this day. The Abbasids,",Paragraph
"lescendants of Mohammed's uncle,",Paragraph
"al-Abbas, based their claim to the caliphate",Paragraph
on the theological aspects of their rulership.,Paragraph
he Shiites joined with the Abbasids in,Paragraph
"the 8th century, as they, too, believed that",Paragraph
the caliphs ruled by divine designation,Title
and thus possessed spiritual authority. The,Paragraph
Umayyads also saw themselves as heirs to,Paragraph
the Islamic state but interpreted the caliphate,Paragraph
as a constitutional necessity working for,Paragraph
the temporal welfare and protection of,Title
the community. The conflict between the,Paragraph
theological and political interpretation of,Title
rulership continues to be contested. It was,Paragraph
"initially the Umayyads who were dominant,",Paragraph
governing from their capital in Damascus.,Paragraph
"Able administrators, they ruled for a brief but",Paragraph
important period over the whole of the Islamic,Paragraph
realm—the only tirne that it was so unified.,Paragraph
"Muslims do not require a building, or",Paragraph
"even a consecrated space, to worship;",Paragraph
"rather, Islam is based on five “pillars,” the",Paragraph
most important being the five daily prayers,Paragraph
performed while facing Mecca. The month,Paragraph
of Ramadan is also important; during that,Paragraph
"time, Muslims commune with themselves,",Paragraph
"give thanks to God through fasting, and",Paragraph
"make donations to the needy, fulfilling the",Paragraph
commandments of the third pillar.,Paragraph
The typical mosque has a courtyard,Paragraph
through which one enters and that contains,Paragraph
a well or fountain for washing the hands and,Paragraph

The Umayyad Mosque in Damascus,Title
"(709-15 CE), another monumental work of",Paragraph

The garbha-griha has no inner parikrama;,Paragraph
"it is instead on the outside, defined by five",Paragraph
subsidiary shrines. Bridges connect the main,Paragraph
shrine with the Nandi chamber and the,Paragraph
entrance gopuram as well. The shikhara—or,Paragraph
tower—of the main shrine has a four-tiered,Caption
pyramidal shape resolving into an octagonal,Paragraph

"axis with the mandapa, there is another",Paragraph
"rock-cut ternple, Lankesvara, complete with a",Caption

meters into the rock.,Paragraph
Most discussions of Kailasnath’s,Title
construction process assume that gigantic,Paragraph
trenches were dug into the rock to clear out,Paragraph
the main mass of the temple; this would have,Paragraph
been followed by a process of excavating,Paragraph
and sculpting. A counterintuitive possibility,Paragraph
is suggested by the subsidiary shrines—in,Paragraph
particular the one to the north—which are,Paragraph
excavated so deep into the rock; the same,Paragraph
process might have been employed for the,Paragraph
main shrine. Since Kailasnath is derived from,Paragraph
"rock-cut cave ternple precedents, excavating",Caption
"the sacred cave and then, in an act of",Paragraph
superseding the infinity of the mountain,Paragraph
"around the traditional caves, “uncovering”",Paragraph
"the exterior in the form of a complete temple,",Paragraph
makes sense conceptually as well. There,Paragraph
"would have been no room for error, since",Paragraph
rock cannot be replaced. Making the temple,Paragraph
had to have been an act of skilled and,Paragraph
deliberate craftsmanship. The Rashtrakutas,Paragraph
"would, of course, also have been very",Paragraph
familiar with the constructed temples of,Paragraph
"the Chalukyas, their predecessors, and the",Paragraph
"Pallavas and Pandyas, their contemporaries",Paragraph
to the south. The reason for their decision to,Paragraph
dedicate the full extent of their resources to,Paragraph
the creation of a gigantic rock-cut structure,Paragraph
"is unknown, but it must have had to do with",Paragraph
reasserting the value of the traditional way,Paragraph
of making a monumental ritual structure in,Paragraph
the face of the imminent modernity of the,Paragraph
structural stone temple.,Paragraph

"earlier experiments, Borobudur is unique in",Paragraph
its formal organization and articulation. It is,Paragraph
approximately square in plan (122 meters,Paragraph
"north to south and 116 meters east to west),",Paragraph
and it is roughly aligned to the cardinal,Paragraph
directions. The plan follows a typical Buddhist,Paragraph

stupa disappears and seems to retract into,Paragraph

a pilgrim in sixty conceptual steps.,Paragraph
The journey begins by circumambulating the,Paragraph
"four lower galleries, which have two rows of",Paragraph
"sculpted panels on each side, recounting",Caption
sequentially stories from the life of the,Title
Buddha. These narrow galleries are staggered,Paragraph
"to block all lines of sight, in order to focus the",Paragraph
pilgrim's attention on the panels. Only after,Paragraph
having cleared these four levels can pilgrims,Paragraph
"ascend to the round upper levels, where",Paragraph
"there are no enclosing walls. Instead, they",Paragraph
"encounter the bell-shaped hollow stupas,",Paragraph
each one of which contains a different,Paragraph
sculpture of the seated Buddha displaying,Caption
"one of the mudras, the characteristic",Paragraph
symbolic gestures of Buddhism. The,Paragraph
openings on the lower stupas are diamond-,Paragraph
"shaped and large, while those on the ones",Paragraph
"above are square, smaller, and fewer in",Paragraph
number. While each side of the candi,Paragraph
"(“temple”) in the lower level is one step, each",Paragraph
bell-shaped stupa takes a whole step toward,Paragraph
"the end. At the final stage, pilgrims arrive",Paragraph
"at the stupa, whose solidity symbolizes the",Paragraph
"shunyata, or “nonpresence,” aspired to by",Paragraph
the Buddhist pilgrim who seeks nirvana. The,Paragraph
"lowest terrace of Borobudur, probably added",Caption
"to stabilize the structure, was constructed at",Paragraph
a later date; it hides a row of friezes behind,Paragraph
it. One of the unresolved controversies,Paragraph
surrounding Borobudur is whether it was,Paragraph
originally planned with a large stupa in the,Paragraph
middle that would have dorninated the whole,Paragraph
edifice.,Paragraph

TIKAL,Title
"Tikal’s recorded history begins in 292 CE,",Paragraph
when Balam Ajaw (“Decorated Jaguar”),Title
"came to power. At its peak around 700 CE,",Paragraph
Tikal was home to about eighty thousand,Paragraph
people. Surrounded by cornfields cultivated,Paragraph
"with intense labor, the houses of its residents",Paragraph
were spread evenly over a 16-square-,Paragraph
kilometer area. They were clustered into,Paragraph
"groups of about four to seven, all raised",Paragraph
on high platforms and organized around a,Paragraph
courtyard. A high level of civic organization,Paragraph
and hydraulic engineering was critical to,Paragraph
Tikal’s survival. The swampy land had to be,Paragraph
sectored by raised causeways that provided,Paragraph
access to the cultivable land and also allowed,Paragraph
"for travel and transport. For dwellings, more",Paragraph
"permanent stone platforms had to be built,",Paragraph
"and for fresh water, stone-lined cisterns were",Paragraph
"constructed. Tikal was built on a set of hills,",Paragraph
located on the watershed between the Gulf of,Paragraph
Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. Perched at,Paragraph
"the high point of the region, therefore, Tikal’s",Paragraph
temples enjoyed a commanding view of their,Paragraph
surroundings.,Paragraph
Though the central buildings of the Mayas,Paragraph
were used for ceremonial and religious,Paragraph
"functions and also sometimes as markets,",Paragraph
the city itself was spread out in the form of,Paragraph
an urban settlement. The Mayan cities were,Paragraph
Guif of Honduras,Title
"organized around neighborhoods, each with",Paragraph
its own residences for the elite. Whereas,Paragraph
the priestly class and ruling elite lived in the,Paragraph
"palaces associated with the shrines, the rest",Paragraph
of the Mayas visited the centers sporadically,Paragraph
for distinct ritual purposes. Though temples,Paragraph
were constructed with specific orientations,Paragraph
"and functions in mind, ceremonial centers",Paragraph
as a whole were not expanded according,Paragraph
"to preplanned rules or geometries, giving",Paragraph
them a somewhat ad hoc appearance. There,Paragraph
"may, of course, have been reasons for the",Paragraph
slightly disjointed and angular arrangement,Paragraph
"of buildings and open plazas, but these have",Paragraph
been lost to time.,Paragraph
"The North Acropolis, Tikal’s oldest",Paragraph
"complex, was “reskinned” many times. When",Paragraph
"a ruler of some significance died, he was",Paragraph
"buried in the acropolis, and a new stone layer",Paragraph
was added to it. The new mass was carefully,Paragraph
set to ensure that the addition did not,Paragraph
damage the older structure. Small vaults were,Paragraph
"built for the burials, each with its own shrine.",Paragraph
Stairs provided access to these chambers for,Paragraph
"ancestral rites, which had to be performed by",Paragraph
"later rulers. A section through the acropolis,",Paragraph

which passes through the city; water from it,Paragraph
"was diverted to the Palenque’s central palace,",Paragraph
"the city's most remarkable building, via a",Paragraph

architects set corbeled vaults parallel to,Paragraph
"one another, which not only created greater",Paragraph
"interior spaces, unlike the solid masses of",Paragraph
"most Mayan buildings, but also stabilized",Paragraph
the whole structure. This is one reason,Paragraph
Palenque’s buildings have aged so well. Their,Paragraph
rooftop ornamental superstructure was also,Paragraph
"made as a roofcomb, which further reduced",Paragraph
the structure's overall weight.,Paragraph
Palenque’s palace sits on a broad platform,Paragraph
that is centrally located to visually command,Paragraph
"the site. On one side, the palace dominates",Paragraph
"the edge of the Otulum River; on the other,",Paragraph

Copan,Title
Located in a mountain valley of the Copan,Paragraph

"about 600 meters above sea level, above",Paragraph
the jungles and rain forests of the lowland,Title
Mayas. Although occupied for about two,Paragraph
"thousand years, the main visible buildings",Paragraph
were built in the period between 600 and,Paragraph
900 CE. The excavated ruins cover about 16,Caption

"Inhabited from roughly 1000 BCE to 500 CE,",Paragraph
it was not only the capital of a network,Paragraph
of cities but also the regional ceremonial,Paragraph
"center, maintaining its preeminent position",Paragraph
until about 1000 CE. It was not so much,Paragraph
"the city that was important but the lake,",Paragraph
which was seen as the place of origin from,Paragraph
whence the primeval couple were sent out to,Paragraph
"call mankind forth from the springs, rivers,",Paragraph
"rocks, and trees. Lake Titicaca was known",Paragraph
"as a taypi, a zone of convergence between",Paragraph
"the principles of urco (the west, high, dry,",Paragraph
"pastoral, celestial, male) and uma (the east,",Paragraph
"low, agricultural, underworld, female). If",Paragraph
Tiwanaku was the central representation,Paragraph
"of the taypi, the elite who lived there were",Paragraph
viewed as the guardians and representatives,Paragraph
of this sacred order.,Paragraph
The ceremonial center was surrounded by,Paragraph
an immense artificial moat filled with water,Paragraph
"diverted from the Tiwanaku River, which",Paragraph
evoked the image of the city’s core as an,Paragraph
Lake Titicaca,Title

island. The level of the lake itself would have,Paragraph
been higher. Now the ruins are 10 kilometers,Paragraph
"from the shore, but the shore would have",Paragraph
been closer to or possibly at the very foot,Paragraph
"of the site, which featured several temples,",Paragraph
"gateways of monumental scale, platforms,",Paragraph
and sunken courts. The two most important,Paragraph
structures are the Akapana (ca. 700 CE) and,Paragraph
"the Puma Punku, which was built somewhat",Paragraph
later.,Paragraph
The Akapana was a low-terraced platform,Paragraph
mound with a base 200 meters square,Paragraph
and a height of 17 meters. It is an earthen,Paragraph
"mound, faced with a mixture of large and",Paragraph
"small stone blocks. Vertically placed stones,",Paragraph
approximately 3.5 meters on center and,Paragraph
"joined with characteristic Andean precision,",Paragraph
mark the edges of the six terraces that work,Paragraph
their way up to the summit. The topmost,Paragraph
terrace was covered by a thin layer of,Paragraph
"bluish-green gravel, brought in from the",Paragraph
Quimsachata mountain range just south of,Paragraph
Tiwanaku. On the summit was a sunken,Paragraph
court with a complexly engineered drainage,Paragraph
system connecting it to the Tiwanaku River,Paragraph
and ultimately to Lake Titicaca. Associated,Paragraph
with the Akapana are four temples—the,Paragraph
"semi-subterranean, the Kalasasaya, the",Paragraph
"Putuni, and the Kheri Kala. Like the other",Paragraph
"platform mounds within Tiwanaku, it has",Paragraph
a central sunken court. The Akapana is,Paragraph
"axially linked to the Kalasasaya—a large,",Paragraph
terraced platform (measuring 120 by 130,Caption
meters) with a megalithic staircase on the,Paragraph
"south centered on the Portal of the Sun,",Paragraph
"and a monumental stone sculpture, the",Paragraph
so-called Ponce Monolith. The Kalasasaya,Paragraph
had its own central sunken court. On the,Paragraph
"morning of the spring equinox, a sunbeam",Caption
bisects the semi-subterranean temple and,Paragraph
appears in the center of the Kalasasaya’s,Paragraph
staircase. But how exactly these buildings,Paragraph
functioned as astronomical observatories is,Paragraph
unknown. In front of the northwest corner of,Caption
the Kalasasaya is a small structure known,Paragraph
"as Chunchukala, which has a hole in one",Paragraph
of its walls similar to the shape of a human,Paragraph
"ear, which permits one to hear sounds that",Paragraph
are made far away. This “sound amplifier”,Paragraph
must have something to do with the oracular,Paragraph
nature of the ceremonies performed here.,Paragraph
"10.79 Megalithic entrance to the Kalasasaya Mound, near La Paz, Bolivia",Caption
Even more spectacular is Puma Punku,Paragraph
"(“Puma Door,” ca. 536-600 CE), which - a ~",Paragraph
was built to the southeast. It is an earthen,Paragraph
platform mound with three levels of stone-,Paragraph
lined terraces and retaining walls. Its walls,Paragraph
are thought to have been adorned with,Paragraph
"polished metal plaques, brightly colored",Caption
"ceramics, and fabric ornamentation. One",Paragraph
ascends to the top terrace through a series of,Paragraph

a sunken courtyard with a ternple overlooking,Caption
"it, though its final form is not fully known.",Paragraph
The stonework is some of the best in the,Paragraph

One stone slab measures 7.81 meters in,Caption
length and weighs 131 metric tons. There are,Paragraph
many such slabs with precisely cut niches,Paragraph
and revetments.,Paragraph
This great city and its temples were,Paragraph

goods along the northern route was a riskier,Paragraph
operation. Vast stretches went through,Paragraph
unclaimed or lawless territories. Foods could,Paragraph
perish in the heat; delicate porcelain objects,Paragraph
could shatter when repeatedly loaded and,Paragraph
"unloaded. Furthermore, as goods moved,",Paragraph
their price increased incrementally but,Paragraph
steadily as they passed from hand to hand.,Paragraph
"Inner Asia, apart from some mined resources,",Paragraph

"southern route, with its cargos of lumber,",Paragraph
"rice, Sugar, pepper, and cinnamon, had",Paragraph
"begun to take precedent over the traditional,",Paragraph
land-based route. The world was also,Paragraph
undergoing a perceptible warming period. In,Paragraph
"some areas this meant long growing seasons,",Paragraph
but in Inner Asia it meant the drying out of,Paragraph
"wells and streams, making cross-continental",Paragraph
travel difficult. The consequences were,Paragraph
"visible at Chang'an. In 904, the T’ang dynasty",Paragraph
abandoned the once-great city and forced its,Paragraph
"million or so residents to move to Luoyang,",Paragraph
the new capital on the east coast. The T'ang,Paragraph
dynasty itself would come to an end in 907.,Paragraph
The steppe region between the 6th and,Paragraph
Oth centuries was in continual flux as one,Paragraph
nomadic culture after another tried to assert,Paragraph
control over the fabled Silk Route. In the,Paragraph
"Oth century, the area saw the arrival of",Paragraph
"various Turkish tribes from Inner Asia, the",Paragraph
irst of which created the Ghaznavid dynasty,Paragraph
"(977-1186), which was ruled by a clan of",Paragraph
urkish Sunni Islamic generals who wrested,Title
"11.2 Step well, India",Caption
control of the region from the Zoroastrian,Title
Sassanians. With their cousins now ruling in,Paragraph
"Persia, the Turks to the north began to move",Paragraph
south into the region in several waves over,Paragraph
"the next century, building up to the moment",Paragraph
when Seljuk converted to Islam around 985,Paragraph
and headed south to defeat the Ghaznavids,Paragraph
"and take over Persia, adopting its cultural",Paragraph
perspectives. The newly formed Seljuk,Paragraph
Empire soon controlled a vast area stretching,Paragraph
from the Hindu Kush to eastern Anatolia and,Paragraph
"from Central Asia to Persian Gulf. All told,",Paragraph
the impact of the various Turkish tribes was,Paragraph
"profound, for they had accomplished a rather",Paragraph
"important geopolitical mission, relinking the",Paragraph
economy of the Indianized world with the,Paragraph
"economy of the Islamic world. In doing this,",Paragraph
they added security to the northern routes,Paragraph
across the steppe. Once this great economic,Paragraph
"continuum had been established, it would",Paragraph
remain Africa's and Eurasia’s prime economic,Title
engine until the age of colonialism made it,Paragraph
obsolete.,Paragraph
"More quickly than one could imagine, areas",Paragraph
peripheral to this continuum were pulled,Paragraph
into its orbit. Tibet was now an independent,Paragraph
region linking India and China. The Vikings,Paragraph
"set up camp on the Caspian Sea, linking",Paragraph
the east-west trade with their networks to,Paragraph
"Russia, Scandinavia, and other parts of",Title
"Europe, making the Normans the envy of all",Paragraph
the Europeans. The port of Pisa was bustling,Paragraph
with trade from Cairo. For the Europeans it,Paragraph
was indeed a breakthrough moment. And,Paragraph
"in Africa, trade routes manned by new",Paragraph
formations of camel-centric cultures were,Paragraph
forged across the desert to Ghana for its salt,Paragraph
and gold.,Paragraph
The Seljuks were in a way the right,Paragraph
"people at the right time with Isfahan, almost",Paragraph
at the geographical center of this expanding,Paragraph
"universe, rising to be one of the great",Paragraph
entrepot cities of all time. They founded the,Paragraph
"Great Mosque of Isfahan, rebuilding an earlier",Caption
"mosque and creating, in fact, a new typology,",Paragraph
"the four-iwan mosque, so called because its",Paragraph
vast central courtyard was faced on all sides,Paragraph
"on axis by a large open space, the iwan,",Paragraph
roofed by elaborate muqarna vaults with their,Paragraph
complex geometric faceting. The building's,Paragraph
"columns, vaults, and walls are made almost",Paragraph
entirely of brick. When the Seljuks arrived in,Paragraph
"Anatolia, however, they began to use stone,",Paragraph
following the local tradition of advanced,Paragraph
"stonework. With Konya as their new capital,",Paragraph
the Seljuks built hundreds of caravanserai to,Paragraph
"facilitate trade. Sultan Han, not too far from",Paragraph
"Konya, was particularly elaborate. With a",Paragraph
"single, richly ornamented entrance, it was a",Paragraph
"place where caravans could be refurbished,",Paragraph
"animals rested, and drivers afforded a good",Paragraph
rest and haircut. From the 11th to the 13th,Paragraph
"centuries, hundreds of caravanserai were",Paragraph
"built or refurbished, significantly improving",Paragraph
the flow of trade.,Paragraph
"India in this period, prospering as it had",Paragraph
for centuries because of its trade to the,Paragraph
"east, saw the rise of numerous religious",Paragraph
"temple institutions, the intensification of",Paragraph
"agriculture, and the expansion of commercial",Title
activities and networks. The Rajputs rose,Paragraph
to prominence in the northern part of the,Paragraph
"subcontinent, and the Cholas in the south.",Paragraph
The Cholas became the first and really,Paragraph
the only Indian empire with a strong naval,Paragraph
"presence, sending ships to Malaysia and",Paragraph
Indonesia to assert their regional dorninance.,Paragraph
"They began to build a new capital city,",Paragraph
"Gangaikonda Cholapuram, of which little",Paragraph
remains today apart from an impressively,Paragraph
"scaled Shiva temple. As for the Rajputs,",Paragraph
their sumptuous palaces were often graced,Paragraph
"y elaborate step wells, where the ladies of",Paragraph
the court could gather in the cool shade.,Paragraph
One of the most impressive was Rani-ni-,Paragraph
Vav (ca. 1050) at Anhilwara (modern-day,Paragraph
"Patan), Gujarat, India. It was a vast, sunken,",Paragraph
"paradisal retreat. To the south, the Chandela",Paragraph
Rajputs produced a remarkable set of,Paragraph
temples dedicated to the Tantric school of,Paragraph
Hinduism. The Tantric practitioner seeks,Paragraph
to use prana (energy flowing through the,Paragraph
"universe, including one’s body) to attain goals",Paragraph
"that may be spiritual, material, or both. This",Paragraph
rand of Hinduism had developed around,Paragraph
300 CE. Of the over eighty-five ternples that,Paragraph
"were built by the Chandelas, only about",Paragraph
twenty-five now stand in a reasonable state,Title
"of preservation, scattered over an area of",Paragraph
about 20 square kilorneters. The Lakshmana,Caption
Temple and the nearby Kandariya Mahadeva,Title
Temple (1050) are the most refined. They,Paragraph
rest on a high terrace and are accessed by,Paragraph
an axial staircase that leads to an elevated,Paragraph
interior floor with balconies. Their external,Paragraph
"surfaces portray tantric practice, including",Paragraph
the sex acts that were seen as a natural way,Paragraph
to access the supra-mundane through the,Paragraph
mundane.,Paragraph
Jainisrn was another important subsect,Paragraph
"of Hinduism, its origins dating back to about",Paragraph
the 5th century BCE. It prescribes a path,Paragraph
of nonviolence toward all living beings and,Paragraph
emphasizes spiritual independence and,Paragraph
equality between all forms of life. Jains make,Paragraph
considerable efforts in everyday life not to,Paragraph
injure plants any more than necessary. Of,Paragraph
"their numerous temples, the Vimal Vasahi",Paragraph
"Ternple (1031) on Mt. Abu is a masterpiece,",Paragraph
made completely out of white marble. The,Paragraph
ceilings feature engraved designs of lotus,Caption
"buds, petals, flowers, and scenes from Jain",Title
and Hindu mythology. In the sacred city of,Paragraph
"Bhubaneswar, the rulers built a similarly",Paragraph
"refined temple, the Lingaraj. Lingaraj means",Paragraph
"“King of Lingam,” a being worshipped by",Paragraph
devotees of both Shiva and Vishnu. In Sri,Paragraph
"Lanka, King Vijayabahu I, who defeated the",Paragraph
Chola invaders in 1070 and reunited the,Paragraph
"country, declared Polonnaruwa the capital",Paragraph
city and began a major reworking of it. By,Paragraph
the 12th century trade and agriculture were,Paragraph
"flourishing, with advanced irrigation systerns",Paragraph
being developed to provide water during the,Paragraph
dry season.,Paragraph
Farther east along the trade routes is the,Paragraph
land of the Khmer. Hariharalaya (known now,Paragraph
more colloquially as Angkor) had by this time,Paragraph
become nothing less than a boomtown—a,Paragraph
religious rice-growing industrial complex—,Title
"with new city districts being built, along",Paragraph
"with bold new temples, to accommodate",Paragraph
a population approaching a million. The,Paragraph
temples at the core of all this include Phnom,Paragraph
"Bakheng (900), Pre Rup (960), Banteay",Paragraph
"Srei (967), and Phirmeanakas (980). Each",Paragraph
represented an economic unit unto itself. The,Paragraph
Angkorites fully understood their geopolitical,Paragraph
situation. They expanded their power,Paragraph
northward to connect to China and to better,Paragraph
control access to the overland trade routes.,Paragraph
"In China, given the restless expansion",Paragraph
"of the northern steppe cultures, the T’ang",Paragraph
"gave way to the Song dynasty (960-1279),",Paragraph
who retreated south of the Yangtze River to,Paragraph
establish a capital at Lin’an (now Hangzhou).,Paragraph
"Soon, Hangzhou rose from a middling city",Paragraph
of only regional importance to become one,Paragraph
of the world’s largest and most populous,Paragraph
"cities. Arab, Persian, and Korean merchants",Paragraph
lived there. The Chinese also underwent,Paragraph
"a population boom, with the population",Paragraph
doubling during the 10th and 11th centuries.,Paragraph
This growth came through expanded rice,Paragraph
"cultivation in central and southern China,",Paragraph
which was developed to offset imported,Paragraph
rice from Southeast Asia. With Buddhism,Paragraph
"repressed, imperially sanctioned temples",Paragraph
"reemerged, drawing on ancient animistic",Paragraph
belief systems; one of these was the Sage,Paragraph
"Mother Hall (ca. 980-1100), built around",Paragraph
a sacred spring. Buddhist pagoda towers,Caption
"continued to be built, but in the countryside",Paragraph
"rather than within a city’s walls, largely to",Paragraph
avoid competition with the attempt by the,Paragraph
imperial authorities to impose their cosmic-,Paragraph
derived ideology on the city.,Paragraph
"To the north, the new Mongolian-based",Paragraph
overlords did not lack architectural ambition.,Paragraph
"On the contrary, the Liao dynasty (907-1125)",Paragraph
employed captured carpenters to build the,Paragraph
"impressive Yingxian Timber Pagoda (1056),",Caption
"also known as Mu-Ta, meaning “Timber",Paragraph
Pagoda.” Since timber buildings are so,Paragraph
"vulnerable to the vicissitudes of time, this",Paragraph
"building, one of the oldest surviving in China,",Paragraph
gives us valuable insight into a structure built,Paragraph
completely without nails.,Paragraph
The Mongolianization of northern,Title
China secured Buddhism in this area and,Paragraph
"strengthened its position in Korea and Japan,",Paragraph
where Buddhism underwent yet another of,Paragraph
its numerous transformations. Less a religion,Paragraph
"than a path to religion, Buddhism tolerates",Paragraph
and even welcomes different experiments,Paragraph
in making that path possible. One of these,Paragraph
is known as Pure Land and is based on the,Paragraph
premise that the way to let go of the worries,Paragraph
of daily life is to imagine a land of beauty that,Paragraph
surpasses all other realms. Since a devotee,Paragraph
"did not need to live in meditative isolation,",Paragraph
Pure Land appealed to a more general,Paragraph
"public. In China, Pure Land practices never",Paragraph
"became a stand-alone sect, but in Japan,",Paragraph
Pure Land came to exist independently as,Paragraph
one of several sects. The earliest surviving,Paragraph
example of a temple dedicated to this new,Caption
sect is the Phoenix Hall (Byodo-in) in Kyoto.,Paragraph
"Unlike a Christian church, where images",Paragraph
"of paradise might be painted on the walls,",Paragraph
"or an Islamic garden, where paradise was",Paragraph
"imagined through poetic inscriptions, here",Paragraph
"paradise was presented in situ, with the",Paragraph
"building itself, reflected in a pond, being the",Paragraph
focus of meditation. The Phoenix Hall can be,Paragraph
compared with Kandariya Mahadeva Temple:,Paragraph
Both reach out to people who are not priests,Paragraph
or ritual experts. Both are buildings that bring,Paragraph
the supplicant past the everyday into a higher,Paragraph
realm through meditation and ritual practices.,Paragraph
"For both, the building serves not just as a site",Paragraph
of ritual but as a visualization for meditation.,Paragraph
"Meanwhile, Constantinople had become",Paragraph
"the largest city in Europe, with a population",Paragraph
"of about a half a million. To its north, the",Paragraph
"conversion of the Bulgarians, Serbs, and",Title
Rus to Orthodox Christianity brought some,Paragraph
"stabilization to the restless area, even",Paragraph
though it did not stop a major Rus attack on,Paragraph
"Constantinople in 941, probably over trading",Paragraph
rights; the Rus used a navy of ten thousand,Paragraph
"11.3 Sage Mother Hall, Jinci Temple, Taiyuan, China",Caption
vessels to devastate the Asiatic shore of the,Paragraph
Bosporus. But Islamic armies controlled,Paragraph
"the Byzantine’s eastern border, and Islamic",Paragraph
navies controlled much of the Mediterranean.,Paragraph
Adding to the increased isolation of the,Paragraph
Byzantines was the final separation of the,Paragraph
eastern and western churches in 1054.,Paragraph
"From then on, the Christian church had",Paragraph
"two distinctly different rules of authority,",Paragraph
one emanating from Rome and the other,Paragraph
rom Constantinople. One of the few major,Paragraph
architectural commissions of the time was,Paragraph
the church of Christ Pantokrator (“Ruler of,Paragraph
"All,"" ca. 1120, now the Zeyrek Mosque) that",Paragraph
was commissioned by a Byzantine empress.,Paragraph
"It had a library and a sixty-bed hospital, and",Paragraph
was home to over eighty monks. But if the,Paragraph
destiny of the Byzantines was on a downward,Paragraph
"slope, the Russians to the north were in",Paragraph
expansion mode. Now almost completely,Paragraph
"Christianized, they linked the Silk Route",Paragraph
with northern Europe and Scandinavia.,Paragraph
Kievan Rus had by now established itself as,Paragraph
an important regional powerhouse. Several,Paragraph
"churches were built, such as the Cathedral",Paragraph
"of St. Sophia, the Holy Wisdom of God in",Paragraph
"Novgorod, and the Church of the Tithes or",Paragraph
Church of the Dormition of the Virgin (ca.,Caption
990) in Kiev.,Paragraph
"Farther south, in the Islamic world,",Paragraph
"were the Fatimids, who belonged to the",Paragraph
Ismaili branch of Shi'ism and claimed to be,Paragraph
"descended from Fatima bint Muhammed,",Paragraph
the daughter of the prophet Mohammed. In,Paragraph
"909, the Fatimids established the Tunisian",Paragraph
"city of Mahdia as their capital, and when they",Paragraph
conquered Egypt in 969 they established,Paragraph
Cairo as the capital. They were known for,Paragraph
their exquisite arts; there are many surviving,Paragraph
"traces of Fatimid architecture, the defining",Paragraph
example being the Al-Azhar Mosque (972),Paragraph
and its associated university. It was the first,Paragraph
university in the East and perhaps the oldest,Paragraph
in history. The Fatirnids used it for official,Paragraph
pronouncements and court sessions. Initially,Paragraph
built as a prayer hall with five aisles and a,Paragraph
"modest central courtyard, the mosque has",Paragraph
been expanded multiple times. Though,Paragraph
none of the original minarets or domes has,Paragraph
"survived, the plan, despite the later additions,",Paragraph
is unmistakable. It was a rectangular box,Paragraph
with a doorway in each of the walls other,Paragraph
than the quibla wall. The columns were taken,Paragraph
from various Roman or Byzantine-era ruins.,Paragraph
The plan features an axial hallway that cuts,Paragraph
"through the grid in front of the quib/a, thus",Paragraph
giving it special prominence in the plan.,Paragraph
"To the east, along the Mediterranean, the",Paragraph
"Almoravids, a Berber Sunni dynasty frorn",Paragraph
"Morocco, formed an empire in the 11th",Paragraph
"century, founding their capital at Marrakech",Paragraph
in 1062. The Almoravids were crucial in,Paragraph
maintaining Islamic control over southern,Title
Spain when they defeated a coalition of the,Paragraph
"Christian, Castilian, and Aragonese armies",Title
at the Battle of Sagrajas. This enabled them,Paragraph
"11.4 Speyer Cathedral, Speyer, Germany",Caption
"to control an empire that stretched 2,000",Paragraph
kilometers north to south. Their rule was,Paragraph
relatively short-lived. They failed to quell,Paragraph
the Masmuda-led rebellion initiated by lbn,Paragraph
Tumart that led to the rise of the Almohads.,Paragraph
The Almohads—who were also Sunni—came,Paragraph
"from Tin Mal, a village that became the",Paragraph
spiritual capital and the artistic center of the,Paragraph
Almohad Empire.,Paragraph
For the first time since the fall of the,Paragraph
"Roman Empire, Europe was being connected",Paragraph
to global horizons. The region was the,Paragraph
equivalent of what today would be called a,Paragraph
developing area. The Saracens had been,Paragraph
driven beyond the Pyrenees; the Slavs had,Paragraph
been forced back to the Oder River; the,Paragraph
Magyars had been expelled from Germany,Title
and Italy; Danes had become Christians. With,Paragraph
"the relative relief, regional lords surfaced who",Paragraph
established themselves and claimed their,Paragraph
"own sovereignty. Abbeys, usually in rernote",Paragraph
"locations, were still important political sites,",Paragraph
"such as the Abbey of Sant’Antimo, begun",Paragraph
before 1118 just south of Siena. More than,Paragraph
"just an abbey, it was an institution that had",Paragraph
"authority over thirty-eight churches, from Pisa",Paragraph
"to Grosseto, and controlled about a thousand",Paragraph
farm estates throughout Tuscany. Built of,Paragraph
"white stone, it was sited in a field purposefully",Paragraph
"planted with tarragon, an herb that is rare in",Paragraph
"Italy but frequently used in French cuisine,",Paragraph
and as such an indicator of the building's,Paragraph
connections to Charlemagne. But the,Paragraph
architecture of Sant’Antimo was increasingly,Paragraph
a thing of the past. Boxy churches with,Paragraph
"small windows, primitive stonemasonry, and",Caption
wooden-beamed ceilings were giving way,Paragraph
to more ambitious designs. The transition,Paragraph
began with the Ottonians in Germany. They,Paragraph
sought to define themselves as extending,Paragraph
the imperial lineage of Constantine and,Title
Justinian. They even brought in artisans,Paragraph
"from Constantinople, and the results show",Paragraph
themselves at the Church of St. Michael,Paragraph
"(ca. 1010) in Hildesheim, made of cleanly",Paragraph
dressed stone. The building was up the hill of,Paragraph
the nearby market town and was indicative of,Paragraph
a closer relationship between the Church and,Paragraph
"daily life. The style of building, with its clearly",Paragraph
"legible geometries and volumes, including",Paragraph
"tube-like towers, is known as Romanesque,",Paragraph
largely because it derives consciously from,Paragraph
"the Roman basilica with naves, side aisles,",Paragraph
and wood roofs.,Paragraph
"In Italy, the Tuscan region, profiting",Paragraph
from the flow of goods brought to the,Paragraph
"Mediterranean by Islamic traders, was at",Paragraph
"the start of a building boom, with the port",Paragraph
city of Pisa leading the way. Pisa built a,Paragraph
"cathedral (1063-1180), a large baptistery",Paragraph
"(1152-1363) and a tower, the famous",Paragraph
"Leaning Tower of Pisa (1173-1372), all of",Paragraph
which was rounded off with the addition of,Paragraph
"the Campo Santo, also known as Camposanto",Paragraph
"Monumentale (“monumental cemetery”),",Paragraph
"an expansive, rectangular cloister (begun in",Paragraph
1278) that is said to have been built on a,Paragraph
"shipload of sacred soil taken from Golgotha,",Paragraph
"Israel, and brought back to Pisa from the",Paragraph
Fourth Crusade. The ensemble was one,Paragraph
of the great religious sites in Europe at the,Paragraph
time. The building was paid for by the spoils,Paragraph
"taken from Mahdia, a Tunisian city that was",Paragraph
the capital of a regional Islamic power. It,Paragraph
was attacked by Pisa and its allies and then,Paragraph
forced to pay a high ransom—a sign of the,Paragraph
growing dominance of Christian powers in the,Paragraph
Mediterranean.,Paragraph
One can compare Pisa with St Mark’s,Paragraph
Basilica in Venice that was consecrated,Title
in 1084. The latter is clearly Byzantine in,Paragraph
"conception, with its great billowing vaults",Paragraph
covered with golden mosaics. The Cathedral,Caption
"of Pisa is “Latin” in conception, essentially",Paragraph
copying the basilica model that came out,Paragraph
Rome with columns running down the,Paragraph
aisles. Whereas St. Mark’s was a brick,Paragraph
"building and more interior than exterior, the",Paragraph
buildings at Pisa were surfaced all around,Paragraph
with shimmering white marble ornamented,Paragraph
with thin horizontal bands of black stone.,Paragraph
Such revetment has a tradition that goes,Paragraph
"back to Raman times, and indeed, some of",Paragraph
the stones were scavenged from Roman-,Paragraph
era ruins. It is clear that the patrons wanted,Paragraph
a building that in its extravagant exterior,Paragraph
11.5 Pueblo Bonito,Caption
finish would herald itself as a freestanding,Paragraph
monument of their success.,Paragraph
The Romanesque style of St. Michael,Paragraph
"and the Cathedral of Pisa was, however,",Paragraph
being creatively transformed in Germany,Title
"and France, as is already visible at Speyer",Paragraph
Cathedral (consecrated in 1061). There,Paragraph
we see a building that is not only taller,Paragraph
but has a whole new interior organization.,Paragraph
Instead of the nave being a wall held up as,Paragraph
"a variation of columns or arches, here the",Paragraph
piers have partially melded into the wall.,Paragraph
"On the surface of the pier, two columns are",Paragraph
"placed on top of each other, almost as if",Paragraph
they were a single very tall column. The top,Paragraph
of the column connects directly to a rib of,Paragraph
the vaulted ceiling that then connects to a,Paragraph
vertical pier on the other side of the nave.,Caption
The eye could move up across and down in,Paragraph
a single sweep. The ancient and venerable,Paragraph
prototype of post and beam has now been,Paragraph
replaced by an aesthetic of a completely,Paragraph
different order. The idea of a column as,Paragraph
an independent architectural entity would,Paragraph
only make its return in Europe only with the,Paragraph
Renaissance. The Normans in England made,Paragraph
particularly important contributions. They had,Paragraph
left northern France to conquer England and,Paragraph
then sailed around Spain to conquer southern,Paragraph
"Italy and Sicily. There, they encountered",Paragraph
Arab architects and Byzantine artisans. The,Paragraph
impact is clearly evident in the difference,Paragraph
between the cathedral at Cefalu (1131),Caption
and the later cathedral at Monreale. The,Paragraph
former is a veritable fortress with a dark and,Paragraph
gloomy interior. The Cathedral of Monreale,Caption
"(1174-85), commissioned by Henry II",Caption
"(r. 1154-89), has an interior with golden",Caption
mosaics that completely cover the walls of the,Paragraph
"nave, aisles, transept, and apse. The mosaic",Caption
cycle is second only to the Hagia Sophia in,Paragraph
"size, and much better preserved. In the apse,",Paragraph
a magnificent portrait of Christ Pantocrator,Caption
(Ruler of All”) gestures in blessing and,Paragraph
gazes serenely off to one side. The Normans,Paragraph
brought their Arab craftsmen back to,Paragraph
"England, and quickly their architecture began",Paragraph
"to transform, as can be seen in Durham and",Paragraph
"Canterbury Cathedrals. At the piers, what",Paragraph
had been two columns placed one on top of,Paragraph
"the other at Speyer now becomes a single,",Paragraph
tube-like column rising from the floor to the,Paragraph
base of the vault. The result was a revolution,Paragraph
of sensibilities that was to contribute to the,Paragraph
emergence of the Gothic style.,Paragraph
In the Yucatan Peninsula the Mayan,Paragraph
civilization was at its height. In the valley,Paragraph
of Oaxaca the Zapotecs continued to build,Paragraph
"new cities, moving their political center from",Paragraph
Monte Alban (ca. 700 BCE-700 Ce) to Mitla,Paragraph
"(ca. 700-1400 CE), transforming the fortified",Paragraph
village into a major religious and economic,Paragraph
hub. The city was still being expanded when,Paragraph
the Spaniards arrived and destroyed it in,Paragraph
"the 16th century. To the north, the Toltecs",Paragraph
were in the process of building a powerful,Paragraph
new dynasty destined to define the form,Title
and shape of the cultures that the Spanish,Title
conquistadors encountered five hundred,Title
years later. But this was not happening in,Paragraph
isolation. Trade with the Southwest Puebloans,Title
"was now well established, in particular",Paragraph
because of the turquoise mines in their,Paragraph
"territory. Turquoise, not readily available",Paragraph
"in Mexico, was a prized commodity, as",Paragraph
it was used for sacred masks and other,Paragraph
"ritual objects. The Puebloans, in the arid",Paragraph
"landscapes of the Southwest, had developed",Paragraph
"a thriving agricultural communal lifestyle, with",Paragraph
people living in dwellings made of stone and,Paragraph
mortar that allowed for two-story construction.,Paragraph
"Settlements had round, belowground kivas",Paragraph
that were used for ceremonial purposes.,Paragraph
Some kivas were as large as 17 meters in,Paragraph
diameter. The Puebloans were not centralized,Paragraph
"into kingships as the Mayans were, but",Paragraph
constituted an association of clans unified,Paragraph
around powerful cornmunal and seasonal,Paragraph
"activities, at the core of which was Chaco",Paragraph
"Canyon. Roughly 9 kilometers long, it",Paragraph
"contained several ceremonial sites, though",Paragraph
how they functioned individually and as a,Paragraph
group is not known. The complex contained,Paragraph
the largest buildings in North America until,Paragraph
"the 19th century. Meanwhile, Peruvians were",Paragraph
undergoing transition; the kingdoms of Wari,Title
"and Tiwanaku had died out, to be replaced",Paragraph
"by dozens of smaller regional powers, among",Paragraph
"which were the Chimu, with their capital at",Paragraph
"the city of Chan Chan, a large adobe city in",Paragraph
the Moche Valley. The culture arose around,Paragraph
900 CE in roughly the same territory where,Paragraph
the Mochica had existed centuries before.,Paragraph
The city is composed of nine independently,Paragraph
walled citadels that housed the elite and their,Paragraph
"ceremonial rooms, burial chambers, temples,",Caption
and reservoirs. Most of the city’s population—,Paragraph
artisans and farmers—lived outside the,Paragraph
quadrangles in modest quarters of less,Paragraph
durable construction. As with most Peruvian,Paragraph
"cities, it was at the center of a vast network of",Paragraph
canals that irrigated the surrounding land.,Paragraph

RISE OF THE RAJPUT KINGDOMS,Title

"passed, was the prized possession. The three",Paragraph
"contenders, by turn, had all managed to",Paragraph

weakened all three to such a degree that,Paragraph
they all eventually collapsed. The resultant,Paragraph
power vacuum in northern India led to a,Paragraph
"series of new kingdoms. Some of these, like",Paragraph
"the Chalukyas, were former vassal states",Paragraph
that now declared independence. More,Paragraph
"significantly, a large number of semitribal and",Paragraph
tribal communities that had previously been,Title
subjugated emerged as kingdoms in their,Paragraph
own right. These are known collectively as,Paragraph
the Rajput kingdoms because of their shared,Paragraph
caste identity (raj-put means “royal son”).,Paragraph
"Among these, the Solankis (western and",Paragraph
"central India), the Chandellas (north-central",Paragraph
"India}, and the Orissans (east and central",Paragraph
India) were eminent temple builders. The,Paragraph
"capital of the Solankis, Patan, was the largest",Paragraph
city in India and the tenth-largest city in the,Paragraph
world.,Paragraph
Most of the tribal communities were of,Paragraph
"the lowest caste, so their new kings had",Paragraph
"to acquire the Kshatriya, or warrior caste.",Paragraph
"To accomplish this, the kings laid claim to",Paragraph
"a mythical lineage and, more importantly,",Paragraph
began to build and support temples as a way,Paragraph
to legitimate their rule. The result was one,Paragraph
of the largest temple-building campaigns in,Paragraph
"India, with new forms coming into being.",Paragraph
Regional deities and gods were accepted into,Paragraph
"the expanding Hindu pantheon, and worship",Paragraph
was conducted in regional languages. Other,Paragraph
"than the introduction of Islam, which was yet",Paragraph
"to come, the patchwork of regional identities",Paragraph
that is modern India was established at this,Paragraph
time. Contemporary India still has twenty-two,Paragraph
official languages (and over five hundred,Title
ialects) with clear geographical divisions.,Paragraph
It is therefore useful to think of India as one,Paragraph
joes of Europe: as an interrelated network,Title
of distinct regional areas. While the various,Paragraph
"regions share certain cultural aspects,",Paragraph
their identities are as diverse as those of,Paragraph
European countries. The sare applies to,Paragraph
their architecture. To think of a unified Indian,Paragraph
architecture is as useful and as useless as,Paragraph
thinking of “European architecture.”,Paragraph
Rani-ni-Vav at Patan,Title
Access to and distribution of fresh water,Title
"played a critical role in all of Indian society,",Paragraph
where water had both an economic and a,Paragraph
symbolic value. But Solanki wells were no,Paragraph
simple affairs. The step well called the Rani-,Paragraph
"ni-Vay, or “Queen's Step Well,” was built",Paragraph
"at Anhilwara (Patan) in the 11th century,",Paragraph
in memory of Bhimdev | (1022-63) by his,Paragraph
"widowed queen, Udaymati. It consists of a",Paragraph
long stairway leading down to the water table.,Paragraph

tiered colonnaded “facade” supported by,Caption
elaborately carved stone colurnns and beams.,Caption
"It was partially roofed, with light filtering even",Paragraph
into the deepest parts 28 meters below the,Paragraph
surface. The reason for such splendor was,Paragraph
that the Rani-ni-Vav (rani means “queen”;,Paragraph
"vav, “well”) served as a supplementary",Paragraph
palace for the queen and her attendants. The,Paragraph
"natural temperature of the earth, combined",Title
with the evaporative effects of the wind,Paragraph
"passing over the water, turned the step well",Paragraph
into a subterranean world of cool repose,Title
during the blistering summer months. Since,Paragraph
"the well went so far down, its walls had to",Paragraph
be buttressed against implosion. This was,Paragraph
achieved by building heavy stone buttresses,Paragraph
at the well’s mouth and bracing its interior.,Paragraph
"In a more symbolic sense, the step well was",Paragraph
also another version of the ghats of Varanasi,Paragraph
or the water tank of the Sun Ternple at,Paragraph
"Modhera, except that the step well was fully",Paragraph
inhabitable. Much of Solanki architecture,Paragraph
was eventually destroyed by invading Islamic,Paragraph
armies. The Rani-ni-Vav survived intact,Paragraph
because it was intentionally filled in with earth,Paragraph
by the retreating Solankis.,Paragraph

is the delicate richness with which all the,Paragraph

is that the mandapa is no longer just a flat,Paragraph

its own pyramidical roof that competes with,Paragraph
the shikhara of the main shrine. From this,Paragraph
"time on, one of the main characteristics of",Paragraph

technical manuals was published under,Paragraph
such titles as Vastu Shastra (“Construction,Paragraph

codified language of termple design and,Paragraph
construction. From these texts we know that,Paragraph
a temple's overall design was handled by a,Paragraph
"chief Brahmin, known as a sutradhar. He",Paragraph
based his work on an astrological diagram,Paragraph
"called a mandala, a graph that mapped",Paragraph
"the positions of stars, planets, deities, and",Paragraph
the sun with respect to a particular site.,Paragraph
Its design is based on the overlay of a,Paragraph
square and a circle. The sutradhar chose,Paragraph
"from hundreds of mandalas, depending on",Paragraph
the deity of the temple and the religious,Title
persuasion of the community. The temple's,Paragraph
actual form was derived through a series of,Paragraph
geometrical maneuvers designed to express,Title
the potency of the various planets and,Paragraph
deities occupying the grid of the mandala.,Paragraph
"Radiating lines, the weight given to the",Paragraph
"primary directions, and special triangles all",Paragraph
determined the location of the building's,Paragraph
"various parts. A complex system of faceting,",Paragraph
"known as rathas, determined the detailed",Paragraph
articulation of the temple's surface. The,Paragraph
purpose of the rathas was to enable multiple,Paragraph
deities to share a single surface—in the,Paragraph
vertical and horizontal plane—by suggesting,Paragraph
superimposed layers. The final form was,Paragraph
inevitably a heavily faceted pyrarnid. Once,Paragraph
"the design had been determined, it was",Paragraph
"relayed to the master builder, whose craft",Paragraph
was handed down through oral tradition.,Paragraph
Sculpture and paintings were then finished,Paragraph
by independent shrenis (“artisans”).,Paragraph
The cosmic order expressed by a temple,Paragraph

Many of the ministers employed in the,Paragraph
Rajput courts were neither Hindus nor,Paragraph
"Buddhists but Jains, who were often",Paragraph

available—an unintended consequence,Paragraph

"teaching of Mahavira, a conternporary of",Paragraph
the Buddha from the 6th century BCE. (Jain,Paragraph
"is a corruption of the Sanskrit word jina,",Paragraph
"meaning “conqueror,” the title given to",Paragraph
"Mahavira in Jain texts.) Like the Buddha,",Paragraph
Mahavira preached a doctrine of asceticism,Paragraph
"and meditation, but Mahavira insisted that all",Paragraph
forms of life were equivalent and that respect,Paragraph
for life was essential for the purification of,Paragraph
"the human soul. Strictly ascetic Jains, known",Paragraph

thus expected not only to be vegetarians,Paragraph
but also to eat only a fruit or vegetable that,Paragraph
had broken off its plant of its own accord.,Paragraph
Root vegetables like potatoes and beets,Title
that entailed killing the whole plant were,Paragraph
"also prohibited. Nor could Jains be farmers,",Paragraph
since working the land inevitably harrned,Paragraph
"insects and worms. As a consequence, they",Paragraph
"turned to professions such as jewelry making,",Paragraph
"trading, and banking and were thus highly",Paragraph
sought after by the courts. They also often,Paragraph
became great librarians and patrons of the,Paragraph
arts.,Paragraph
Like the Mahayana Buddhists of Central and,Paragraph
"East Asia, the Jains built colossal monolithic",Paragraph
"statues of their Tirthankars (literally, “ford",Paragraph

SONG DYNASTY CHINA,Title
The Song dynasty (960-1279) reunited most,Paragraph
of China proper. The Song period divides into,Paragraph
"two phases: Northern Song (960-1127), and",Paragraph
Southern Song (1127-1279). The division,Paragraph
was caused by the forced abandonment,Paragraph
"of north China in 1127 by the Song court,",Paragraph
which could not push back Jin invaders. As,Paragraph
"to Chang’an, the Uyghurs helped recapture",Paragraph
"the fabled capital from rebels, but they",Paragraph
refused to leave until the emperor paid them,Paragraph
an enormous sum of tribute in silk. The,Paragraph
abandonment of northern China was caused,Paragraph
in part to floods in 858 along the Grand Canal,Paragraph
that inundated vast tracts of land and terrain,Paragraph
of the North China Plain; in 873 a disastrous,Paragraph
harvest shook the foundations of the empire,Title
and made it all the more dependent on,Paragraph
imported rice from Southeast Asia. Whereas,Paragraph
the Northern Song capital was moved to,Paragraph
Dongjing (now Kaifeng); the southern capital,Paragraph
was established at Lin’an (now Hangzhou).,Paragraph
"Though much weakened, the economy",Paragraph
"was still powerful, and the use of a new",Paragraph

Chinese building conventions to develop their,Paragraph

"in many respects different, if not superior, to",Paragraph
those of the Song. Whereas the Song aspired,Paragraph

in the complexity of brackets and joinery,Paragraph
that made their buildings more durable,Paragraph

innovations was to remove central colurnns in,Paragraph

a monastic enclosure with a monumental,Paragraph

feature of Liao buildings but at the time were,Paragraph
not used in Song architecture.,Paragraph
The lowermost story of the building,Caption
consists of three independent rings of,Paragraph
wooden pillars. The smallest pillars in the,Paragraph
outermost ring support the lowest eaves. The,Paragraph

"levels, each being a temple unto itself and",Paragraph
each with a Buddha statue.,Paragraph
"A skyscraper of sorts in its day, the Mu-ta",Paragraph
was one of the most advanced structural,Paragraph
achievements of its tire. Like the Guanyin-ge,Paragraph
"of Dulesi Monastery, each story of the Mu-ta",Paragraph
is a separate structural entity (none of the,Paragraph
pillars rises more than a story) tied together,Paragraph
by fifty-four different types of bracket sets.,Paragraph
"On the exterior, each story of the Mu-ta is",Paragraph
"represented by eaves, held up by a neat",Paragraph
arrangement of structural dou-gong. In,Paragraph
"the interior, however, the structure is held",Paragraph
together by a complex mesh of posts and,Paragraph
"beams, radial dou-gong, and cross-bracing",Paragraph
that ultimately fashions a thick nest in the,Paragraph
form of a torus between the external skin and,Paragraph
the central space. It is this mesh of cross-,Paragraph

four-rafter beams and four two-rafter beams,Title

THE NORMANS,Title
"In 911 CE, Charles the Simple validated the",Paragraph
"Norman possessions around Rouen, France,",Paragraph
which the Normans had begun to occupy in,Paragraph
"the 9th century. The Normans, with amazing",Paragraph
"adaptive energy, renounced paganism and",Paragraph
absorbed local customs and language.,Paragraph
They also furthered the development of the,Paragraph
"Romanesque style, of which the Cathedral",Paragraph
"of Caen is the prime example. In 1001,",Paragraph
"Richard Il, duke of Normandy, invited",Title
the Italian abbot William of Volpiano—,Title
"accompanied by a colony of Benedictines,",Paragraph
with their well-established traditions of design,Paragraph
and masonry construction—to restore the,Paragraph
Abbey of Fécamp. Soon a uniquely Norman,Paragraph
style developed that incorporated Norse,Paragraph
decorative motifs while drawing on the,Paragraph
Islamic influences brought to England and,Paragraph
France from the Norman holdings in Sicily.,Paragraph
A warrior people from the northern French,Title
"coast, the Normans overran England and",Paragraph
"southern Italy and settled in Scotland, Wales,",Paragraph
"the Byzantine Empire, and (after the First",Paragraph
Crusade) the Levant. Norman power was,Paragraph
extended by strategic marriage alliances. In,Paragraph
"a series of waves, the Normans conquered",Paragraph
"parts of southern Italy and Sicily (1061), and",Paragraph
"then England, following the Battle of Hastings",Paragraph
(1066). The new rulers transformed the entire,Paragraph
"religious, mercantile, and political geography",Title
of England. But their holdings were far-,Paragraph
"flung, from England and northern France",Title
to southern Italy and Sicily; the Normans,Title
consequently became a clearinghouse of,Paragraph
different stylistic and cultural trends that,Paragraph
bridged many classic divides.,Paragraph

Most importantly they transformed the,Paragraph
village- and agrarian-based geography of,Paragraph
the Saxons into one based on towns in the,Paragraph
"middle of large farming districts or boroughs,",Paragraph
with castles at their centers to serve as the,Paragraph
basic instrument of government. Unlike in,Paragraph
"Germany, where castles were generally on",Paragraph
"defensible ridges or mountains, in England,",Paragraph
where mountains are not a prominent,Paragraph
"geographical feature, they were built at the",Paragraph
core of the urban layout. Town markets,Paragraph
"were created and an aristocracy took shape,",Paragraph
promoting an international luxury trade in,Paragraph
commodities such as fine cloth and wine. It,Paragraph
has been estimated that about four to five,Paragraph
hundred new towns were laid out in this,Paragraph
"manner, creating a pattern of urban centers",Paragraph
that was to survive virtually unchanged until,Paragraph
"the Industrial Revolution and, in parts of",Paragraph
"England, survives even today.",Paragraph
The Normans introduced not only a,Paragraph
strong mercantile society but also a change,Title
"in the notion of kingship. Roger the Great,",Paragraph
"in the chronicles of the time, is represented",Paragraph
as the royal deputy of Christ. The small,Paragraph
Saxon churches that dotted the English,Title
landscape could no longer measure up to,Paragraph
"such grand claims. Most were torn down,",Paragraph
and in their stead the Normans designed a,Paragraph
religious landscape around powerful state-,Paragraph
"supported bishoprics, each of which needed a",Paragraph

with irrigation and large-scale sheep farming.,Paragraph
"By the end of the 12th century, six hundred",Paragraph
new monastic institutions of varying practices,Title

Durham Cathedral,Title
Durham Cathedral is important for its,Paragraph
"architectural features, specifically its rib",Paragraph
"vaulting (the first of its kind in England),",Paragraph
"its pointed arches, and its high standard of",Paragraph
masonry. Durham shows the specific Anglo-,Paragraph
Norman style as a blend of the English,Paragraph
decorative tradition with Norman architectural,Title
"skills, and it marks the transition from a more",Paragraph
"monumental and simple scheme, as is seen",Paragraph
in Gloucester Cathedral (begun 1089). The,Paragraph
choir and the nave of the three-aisled church,Caption
"were built between 1093 and 1133, but the",Paragraph
west towers were not completed until 1220.,Paragraph
"In comparison with the nave of Gloucester,",Paragraph
which also has heavy round columns carrying,Paragraph
"the arcades, Durham, in the manner of",Caption
"Speyer, introduces the idea of attached half-",Paragraph
columns that guide the eye to the ceiling.,Paragraph
The loftiness of these churches had always,Paragraph
been a feature of Romanesque architecture;,Paragraph
what is novel here is the structural openness,Paragraph
of the walls. A basic principle of Norman,Paragraph
building was the reduction of solid walls to,Paragraph
a thick but open skeleton of arches. The,Paragraph
arches were not just interruptions in the wall;,Paragraph
"they were defined in a regularized way, with",Paragraph
surrounds framed by attached half-columns,Caption
and horizontal string courses. The openings,Paragraph
"do not deny the weight and mass of the wall,",Paragraph
"as would become the tendency later, but",Paragraph
"rather, illuminated fromm behind, they seem",Paragraph
to release their load gradually as the wall,Paragraph
ascends.,Paragraph
The columns are decorated with zigzag,Paragraph
and chevron motifs and make extensive use,Paragraph
"of color, specifically black and red, which was",Paragraph
an influence from Islamic architecture that,Paragraph
came to the country through the Crusades,Paragraph
and the Norman-Arab connections in Sicily,Title
and northern Africa. Geometric patterns and,Paragraph
other features of the inner decoration can,Paragraph
later be found in other cathedrals in northern,Paragraph
"England, suggesting that the same masons",Paragraph
moved on to work in Scotland.,Paragraph
ia,Title
Durham Cathedral is considered a forerunner,Paragraph
"of what is now called the Gothic style, largely",Paragraph
because of the fusion of the ribbed vault,Paragraph
"and the pointed arch, which are considered",Paragraph
essentially Gothic features. The building,Paragraph
does not have buttresses and so appears,Paragraph
"from the outside quite boxy, unlike later",Paragraph
Norman cathedrals such as Canterbury,Title
"Cathedral, where buttresses contribute to",Paragraph
a vertical articulation. The so-called Galilee,Paragraph
Chapel (1153-95) in front of the west,Caption
"facade is unique, with its five parallel halls",Paragraph
and longitudinal arcaded walls without any,Paragraph
subdivision into bays. This layout resembles,Paragraph
one encountered in Islamic mosques and,Paragraph
once again shows the cross-fertilization of,Paragraph
ideas introduced from the Mediterranean.,Paragraph

Santa Maria Nuova at Monreale (from the,Caption

"of Palermo on the slopes of Monte Caputo,",Paragraph
that was started only a hundred years after,Paragraph
CefalU. Islamic influences are apparent,Paragraph
"in the outside decoration of the apse,",Caption
with its intertwined arches and terra-cotta,Paragraph
ornamentation. The Great Mosque of Cordoba,Caption
(10th century) and the Bab Mardum Mosque,Caption
in Toledo (around 1000 Ce) show similar,Paragraph
interlocking arches. The cathedral also shows,Paragraph
"Byzantine influences, such as the exquisite",Paragraph
mosaics that cover the interior walls of the,Paragraph
cathedral and are second in quality only to,Paragraph
those in the Hagia Sofia in Istanbul.,Paragraph
This stylistic synthesis is also evident in,Paragraph
the areas of western Italy that the Normans,Paragraph
controlled. Amalfi became a seafaring,Paragraph
"republic, rivaling Genoa, Venice, and Pisa,",Paragraph
from the 9th to the 11th centuries. At,Paragraph

The 11th and 12th centuries saw a growth,Paragraph

usually to sites where miracles were believed,Paragraph
to have occurred. Pilgrims sought out these,Paragraph
"churches mainly for the relics they housed,",Paragraph

"a foot, or even a head of a saint—became",Paragraph
"central to a particular church's identity, and",Paragraph
churches vied with each to collect as many,Paragraph
such relics as possible. Major ones were the,Paragraph
"tomb of St. Peter in Rome, the tomb of St.",Caption
"James at Santiago de Compostela, and the",Paragraph
Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem.,Caption
"Most pilgrims traveled of their own volition,",Paragraph
but some pilgrimages were acts of penance,Paragraph

Other accounts give us some of the earliest,Paragraph

The most venerated pilgrimage site,Title
was the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. The,Paragraph
"original church, constructed by Constantine,",Caption
was consecrated in 335 CE to protect a,Paragraph
tomb thought to have been that of Christ.,Paragraph

maintain their hegemony over urban society.,Paragraph
"Cities now began to vie with each other,",Paragraph
"however, in the construction of cathedrals",Paragraph

"Modena (begun 1099), Cremona (begun",Paragraph
"1118), Verona (begun 1139), and Siena",Paragraph
(begun 1196).,Paragraph
The architect of the Modena Cathedral was,Paragraph
"Lanfranco, called mirabilis artifex, mirificus",Paragraph
"aedificator (""marvelous creator, wonderful",Paragraph
"builder”), about whom, however, little is known",Paragraph
"except that he came from Como, where a",Paragraph
school of builders had been established.,Paragraph
Compared to other Romanesque buildings,Paragraph
"of the time, Modena Cathedral is lighter and",Paragraph
the lines stripped to their essentials. The,Paragraph
building was clad in white Istrian stone and,Paragraph
articulated by blind arcades. The central,Caption
division is emphasized by a rose window,Paragraph
and a baldachino-style central portal. The,Caption
rose window on the facade was added in the,Caption
13th century. The work is ornamented with,Caption
sculptures by the stonernason Wiligelmo; it,Paragraph
"depicts, among other things, Adam and Eve",Paragraph
working the land to gain redemption. The,Paragraph
portals also portray biblical and mythological,Paragraph
"events, including monsters and centaurs that",Paragraph
warn not only of the diabolic threats awaiting,Paragraph
man outside the city of God but also the,Paragraph
threats that corne from outside the Christian,Title
"world, a reminder that Sicily had already fallen,",Paragraph
"first to Islamic troops, then to Arab colonizers.",Paragraph
The archbishop's palace and administrative,Title
center was connected to the cathedral by,Paragraph
means of a private passage. The building was,Paragraph
commissioned by Queen Matilda di Canossa,Caption
(1046-1115). One of the most powerful,Paragraph
"women of the Middle Ages, she had a fortress",Paragraph
in the heart of the Emilian Apennines and was,Paragraph

"The cathedral was consecrated in 1118,",Paragraph
but it was completed only after considerable,Paragraph
alterations in the 14th century. Stylistically it,Paragraph
is a variation of the Mediterranean basilica,Paragraph

The building does not follow the trend,Paragraph

more than anyone else. They consolidated,Paragraph
power in Cambodia to control overland,Title
"access to the independent kingdorn of Dali,",Paragraph
which functioned as a type of inland port into,Paragraph
southern China. The Khmer built vast barays,Paragraph
"(large, man-made lakes) fed by kilometer-long",Paragraph
canal systems to accelerate the production,Title
"of rice, their prime export commodity. The",Paragraph
barays were linked to gigantic religious,Paragraph
"complexes, the most elaborate of which was",Paragraph
called Vara Vishnuloka (now more commonly,Paragraph
"known as Angkor Wat), one of the grandest",Paragraph
of the many Khmer temples and on par in,Paragraph
"detail, engineering, symbolism, and sheer",Title
bravura of scale with Borobudur.,Paragraph
But squeezing more and more rice from the,Paragraph
sandy soil of central Cambodia was a risky,Paragraph
enterprise dependent as much on managing,Title
the intricate canal systerns as on the weather.,Paragraph
"Ultimately, deforestation would exact its price.",Paragraph
A series of devastating floods would bring,Paragraph
"the civilization to its knees, and by the 15th",Paragraph
century the city of Angkor had all but been,Paragraph
abandoned to the forest; but in the year 1200,Paragraph
this was not foreseen.,Paragraph
"In India, two of the leading entrepét",Paragraph
cities were Kalinganagar (modern-day,Paragraph
"Srimukhalingam), the capital of the Eastern",Paragraph
"Ganga dynasty, located on the eastern coast;",Paragraph
"and Nabadwip of the Sena Empire, located",Paragraph
north of modern-day Kolkata on the west,Paragraph
bank of the Bhagirathi River. The economy,Paragraph
was booming and construction of large-scale,Paragraph
temples was a regular occurrence. These,Paragraph
include the Hoysala Empire’s Ishvara Temple,Paragraph
(1220) in Arasikere and the enormous,Caption
Konark Sun Temple of the Eastern Ganga,Title
dynasty. The latter was built in the form of the,Paragraph
"chariot of the Sun God, Surya, and supported",Paragraph
by twelve pairs of elaborately carved stone,Caption
"wheels, some of which are 3 meters wide,",Paragraph
that are “pulled” by seven pairs of stone-,Paragraph
carved horses. At the nearby sacred city of,Caption
"Puri, elaborately decorated, three-story-high",Caption
chariots of wood dedicated to Lord Jagannath,Caption
(“Lord of the World”) are pulled each year,Paragraph
down a sacred road between two sets of,Paragraph
"temples, a ritual that probably began in the",Paragraph
"9th century CE. Konark temple, by contrast,",Caption
"does not move, but stands as a type of mega-",Paragraph
model of the divine solar chariot. Visible for,Caption
miles around (though the main tower has,Paragraph
"since collapsed), it asks the question at what",Paragraph
"scale a building exists. Most buildings, even",Paragraph
"if large, are built to a scale comprehensible",Paragraph
"to the human, but this one was designed at",Paragraph
something that might plausibly approximate,Paragraph
"the scale of the divine. Angkor Wat, by",Caption
"comparison, is also huge, yet despite its",Paragraph
"size, it seems to have been designed as a",Paragraph
scaled-down model of a divine mountain.,Paragraph
These structures recall the Egyptian hypostyle,Paragraph
hall and the columns modeled on papyrus,Title
"bundles, scaled at the dimension of the",Paragraph
divine.,Paragraph
To the northwest of India was the Turkish-,Paragraph
based Khwarazmian dynasty in present-day,Paragraph
"lran, which ruled from Urgench, Uzbekistan.",Paragraph
"The Syrian geographer Yaqut, who lived",Paragraph
"in the city in 1219, considered it to be the",Paragraph
most extensive and the richest of all the,Paragraph
cities he had seen. Khwarazmian architects,Paragraph
developed a double-domed cupola that,Paragraph
featured extensive use of patterned brickwork,Paragraph
"and carved terra-cotta. Sadly, not much is left",Paragraph
"of this once impressive city, as most houses",Paragraph
were of mud brick.,Paragraph
One of the Ghaznavid generals established,Paragraph
"a sultanate in northern India, setting up",Paragraph
"his capital in what is now Delhi. There, his",Paragraph
descendants built the mosque known as,Paragraph
Quwwat-ul-Islarn (Glory of Islam) on the site,Caption
of a former Hindu temple. The architects,Paragraph
"used colurnns from the temple, but not as",Paragraph
a sign of respect. Quwwat-ul-Islam is best,Paragraph
"known for its tower of victory, Qutb Minar",Paragraph
"(begun 1192), celebrating the Muslim",Paragraph
"conquest of India. Henceforth, Islam would",Paragraph
be an integral part of the northern Indian,Paragraph
subcontinent.,Paragraph
"It was not just South Asia, from India to",Paragraph
"southern China, that was boorning; Africa",Paragraph
was opening up to international trade. Since,Paragraph
"around 6000 BCE, the Sahara Desert had",Paragraph
been an unbreachable barrier between the,Paragraph
Mediterranean and lower Africa. But the,Paragraph
camel was introduced by the Arabs in the,Paragraph
8th century CE and camel-based cultures,Title
arose that moved east-west and north-,Paragraph
south. Driving this trade was the discovery,Paragraph
of vast salt deposits in Niger that are still,Paragraph
being mined today. More important was the,Paragraph
"discovery of gold in Ivory Coast, in the upper",Paragraph
reaches of the rivers that flowed down to the,Paragraph
Atlantic. The rise of the empire of Ghana,Title
in modern-day Mali was a consequence.,Paragraph
"In 1252, the Florentines almost certainly",Paragraph
used gold from Ghana when they struck,Paragraph
"their first gold coin—the florin, a coin that",Paragraph
was to dominate large-scale transactions in,Paragraph
Europe for several centuries. The trade routes,Paragraph
"went through Timbuktu and Djenné, the",Paragraph
"southern reach of Islam. Mosques were built,",Paragraph
"monumental in nature, out of mud and with a",Paragraph
sense of form and proportion unlike anything,Title
seen before. The Djenné mosque is set up on,Paragraph
a vast platform next to the city’s market. Its,Paragraph
"tall, sparsely fenestrated walls are stabilized",Paragraph
y rippling buttresses set between towerlike,Caption
"forms. From Mali, trade routes pointed to the",Paragraph
"Atlantic Ocean, leading to the rise in modern-",Paragraph
day Nigeria of the Yoruba kingdoms of Ifé and,Title
"Oyo. Though little remains of its architecture,",Paragraph
"fé is known for its naturalistic bronze, stone,",Paragraph
"and terra-cotta busts, which reached the",Paragraph
peak of artistic expression between 1200 and,Paragraph

The great mediators of the Sahara,Title
"Desert were the Tuareg, who were nominally",Paragraph
"slamic, and who developed a unique type of",Paragraph
residence that could be disassembled and,Paragraph
placed on a camel's back. Their houses can,Paragraph
e corpared to the gers (sometimes also,Paragraph
"called yurts) of the Mongolians sore 9,000",Paragraph

in Inner Asia connected to both the Viking,Paragraph
"boats leading northward to Scandinavia,",Paragraph
and past Cairo to the Tuareg people of the,Paragraph
"Sahara Desert leading to Ghana, creating a",Paragraph
new system of overland trade networks that,Paragraph
connected north and south and east and west,Title
over vast stretches of inhospitable territory,Paragraph
for the first time in history. The Vikings and,Paragraph
the Tuareg were the avant-garde of the,Paragraph
great expansion of trade into the north and,Paragraph
"south, respectively. The stave churches in",Paragraph
"Scandinavia, built when the Vikings converted",Paragraph
"to Christianity, can be discussed together",Paragraph
with the great mud mosques at Timbuktu,Caption
and Djenné. Trade ships of Indian and Arab,Paragraph
merchants were common sights off the coast,Paragraph
of East Africa. The Arab traders established,Paragraph
"Islam early on, the result being a new and",Paragraph
unique culture in East Africa known as,Paragraph
"Swahili. From the 13th to 17th centuries, the",Paragraph
"town of Gedi, for example, on Kenya’s coast,",Paragraph
"was a thriving Swahili cormmunity, with its",Paragraph
inhabitants trading with people from all over,Paragraph
the world. Findings from archaeological digs,Title
"include beads from Venice, a Ming vase from",Caption
"China, an iron lamp from India, and scissors",Title
from Spain. The new affluence explains the,Paragraph
"emergence of several East African kingdoms,",Paragraph
"in particular in Ethiopia, when King Lalibela",Paragraph
built a city with an astonishing set of,Paragraph
"“SS 12.2 Lalibela, Ethiopia",Caption
"churches, some of the last great examples of",Paragraph
"rock-cut architecture in history. Lalibela, as",Paragraph
"the city came to be called, was designed as a",Paragraph
"religious destination, attracting pilgrims who",Paragraph
still flock to the city today. One can compare,Paragraph
"the site to Kailasa Temple, Ellora, built some",Paragraph
"four hundred years earlier, and indeed it is",Paragraph
possible that Indian rock-cut specialists were,Paragraph
directing the work at Lalibela. Both sites are,Paragraph
models of sacred landscapes. Kailasa Temple,Caption
models Mt. Meru and the Ganges River;,Paragraph
Lalibela models Jerusalem and the River,Title
"Jordan, a river that does not run through",Paragraph
Jerusalem.,Paragraph
"Further south is Zimbabwe, another",Paragraph
source of gold. The Zimbabweans were,Paragraph
Bantu agropastoralists who had pushed,Paragraph
southward from their ancient homelands in,Paragraph
Cameroon to colonize the great savannas of,Paragraph
"Africa, pushing the aboriginals into the forests",Paragraph
and deserts. They set up large chiefdoms that,Paragraph
"traded ivory, gold, animal pelts, and tortoise",Paragraph
shells.,Paragraph
The Mediterranean world was an,Paragraph
"economic engine unto itself. In Egypt, the",Paragraph
Turkish Mamluk sultanate served as a,Paragraph
"hinge between two continents, and to the",Paragraph
"west, Cordoba, Spain, flourished like never",Paragraph
before. The Mamluks built some of the,Paragraph
most astonishing mosques to dot the Cairo,Paragraph
"12.3 Tomb of Sultan Qalawun, Cairo, Egypt",Caption
"cityscape. They are not the usual rectangle,",Paragraph
but take the shape of the urban block and,Paragraph
were designed to capture views along the,Paragraph
streets. The domes are masterpieces of,Paragraph
"ornament and geometry, rising majestically",Paragraph
over the tombs of the dynasty rulers. The,Paragraph
"Tornb of Sultan Qalawun, one of the great",Paragraph
artistic and architectural achievements of the,Title
"age, is one of several tombs, schools, and",Paragraph
mosques lined up along one of the principal,Paragraph
"roads in the city, producing an architectural",Paragraph
ensemble unique in its time.,Paragraph
The Islamic rulers in Spain were not to,Paragraph
be outdone. Though being pushed out by,Paragraph
"the Christians, they constructed one of the",Paragraph
"world's most beautiful palaces, the Alhambra.",Paragraph
"With its slender columns, terraced gardens,",Paragraph
"water fountains, and elaborate vaults",Paragraph
"inscribed with poetic references to paradise,",Paragraph
there was nothing else like it.,Paragraph
"The rest of Europe, long a global",Paragraph
"ackwater, was now beginning to prosper",Paragraph
as well. Infrastructure was being improved,Paragraph
"for the first time in centuries. For example,",Paragraph
"ridges were being constructed, such as",Paragraph
Pont Saint-Bénézet at Avignon to connect,Caption
the city to the trade routes north—routes that,Paragraph
"led deeper into into France, where various",Paragraph
towns were given special prerogative to hold,Paragraph
"fairs. These included Provins, together with",Paragraph
"royes, Lagny, and Bar-sur-Aube. Merchants",Paragraph
converged here from all over Europe and,Paragraph
the East to sell their wares. The towns also,Paragraph
came important centers of banking; the,Paragraph
"Provins denier, for example, was one of the",Paragraph
few currencies accepted widely throughout,Paragraph
Europe.,Paragraph
Christian monasteries established in the 13th,Title
"century number close to one hundred, and",Paragraph
indeed the 13th century saw an extensive,Paragraph
"uilding boom in churches, monasteries,",Paragraph
"and cathedrals that yielded the Gothic style,",Paragraph
"which featured tall proportions, external",Paragraph
"uttressing, thin stone vaults, and elaborate",Paragraph
decorative work. Examples include the,Paragraph
cathedrals at Amiens and Cologne. In,Paragraph
"England, the new style can be seen at the",Paragraph
"cathedrals at Oxford, Wells, Salisbury, and",Paragraph
Lincoln. This architecture separated structure,Paragraph
"rom space, putting the former on the outside",Paragraph
"of the building, so that the interior could take",Paragraph
"a unified form. Without doubt, these were the",Paragraph
most spectacular interior spaces the world,Title
jad ever seen.,Paragraph
The 13th century saw dramatic changes,Paragraph
"in the Christian worldview, with the image of",Paragraph
oth Christ and Mary changing considerably.,Paragraph
The figure of Christ nailed to the cross,Title
ad usually been portrayed as stiff and,Paragraph
remote. Now his body softens and droops;,Paragraph
is suffering becomes more realistic. A,Paragraph
"similar change took place with Mary, who",Paragraph
emerged at the center of a cult featuring,Paragraph
"er and the baby Jesus. For the first time,",Paragraph
"Christianity opened itself up to women, and",Paragraph
indeed the church began to canonize an,Paragraph
increasing number of wornen. The cult of,Paragraph
the Virgin Mary was inspired by the writings,Paragraph
of theologians such as Saint Bernard of,Paragraph
"Clairvaux (1090-1153), who identified her",Paragraph
as the bride of the Song of Songs in the Old,Title
Testament. The Virgin was worshipped as,Paragraph
"Queen of Heaven, and as the intercessor for",Paragraph
the salvation of humankind. This movement,Paragraph
found its grandest expression in the French,Paragraph
"cathedrals, many of which are dedicated",Paragraph
"to “Our Lady.” Entire cities, such as Siena,",Paragraph
placed themselves under her protection.,Paragraph
Chartres Cathedral is an example of the pull,Paragraph
of this form of worship. Even though its host,Paragraph
"city had a population of only about 7,000",Paragraph
and was not well located with respect to trade,Paragraph
"routes, it was the center of a miracle cult",Paragraph
associated with the Virgin. People flocked,Paragraph
there from far away.,Paragraph
The consequences of the Virgin Cult,Title
"were profound, for most of the religions",Paragraph
of the day were still largely controlled by,Paragraph
"men, with male saints. Even Buddhism still",Paragraph
had a resolutely male-centric perspective.,Paragraph
But while the cult of the Virgin Mary put,Paragraph
"a fernale in the upper reaches of sanctity,",Paragraph
the 12th century also saw the emergence,Paragraph
of courtly love as expressed in songs and,Paragraph
poems. Castles may still have been designed,Paragraph
"around functional requirements, but they",Paragraph
were now host to elaborate courtly activities.,Paragraph
"One of the main problems, however, was",Paragraph
"that with the Viking threat now over, soldiers",Paragraph
roamed the landscape looking for “work.”,Paragraph
The Church sought to intervene in the,Paragraph
resultant conflicts by emphasizing the value,Paragraph
of peaceful activities as sanctioned by the,Paragraph
"martyrs, whose spirits abided in the form of",Paragraph
"relics. Thus, saintly relics became an integral",Paragraph
"part of devotional practice, and the attendant",Paragraph
populism produced a whole new religious,Paragraph
architecture based around pilgrimages to,Title
visit relics. The wealth that these pilgrims,Paragraph
generated was enough to finance numerous,Paragraph
cathedrals whose prime purpose was to serve,Paragraph
as stations on the way to the Cathedral at,Paragraph
"Santiago de Compostela, Spain, built over the",Caption
site where the remains of St. Jarnes were said,Paragraph
to have been found in the 9th century. These,Paragraph
"churches include Vézelay, Le Puy, Arles,",Paragraph
"and Saint-Gilles. In the northern countries,",Paragraph
the Hanseatic League was created as a,Paragraph
commercial and defensive confederation of,Title
merchant guilds and their market towns that,Paragraph
dominated trade along the coast of northern,Paragraph
Europe. It stretched along the Baltic Sea from,Paragraph
"Novgorod to London, with its primary focus",Paragraph
"being Ltlbeck and Hamburg, both of which",Paragraph
were to become important economic hubs in,Paragraph
the next centuries.,Paragraph
As a response to the new excess in,Paragraph
"wealth and power, there arose a monastic",Paragraph
"movement, the Cistercians, that aimed to",Paragraph
restore the principles of poverty. Cistercian,Paragraph
monks purposefully sought out unwanted,Title
areas and reinstated the principles of,Paragraph
"work and devotion. Soon the Cistercians,",Paragraph
"spreading all over Europe, became a political",Paragraph
force to be reckoned with by the emperors,Paragraph
and bishops. The Cistercians rejected,Paragraph
"the airy Gothic spires, stained glass, and",Paragraph
sculptural elaborations for an architecture,Title
that was intentionally simple. For the first,Paragraph
"time in history, we see an anti-architecture",Paragraph
"architecture, the best surviving example",Paragraph
"being the Abbey at Fontenay (1118), France.",Paragraph
"(The Shinto Shrine, by way of comparison,",Paragraph
was designed as a building with an archaic,Paragraph
quality that was to be preserved through,Paragraph
its periodic rebuilding.) Fontenay Abbey,Paragraph
was meant to evoke simpler times and to,Paragraph
serve as an accusation against architectural,Paragraph
extravagance.,Paragraph
"In Italy, during this period there are the",Paragraph
first stirrings of a political transformation,Title
that would have huge consequences as the,Paragraph
"centuries progressed. The cities of Verona,",Paragraph
"Padua, Vicenza, and the Republic of Venice",Title
created the Lombard League (1164) in,Paragraph
an atternpt to assert their independence,Paragraph
from imperial German control. Their efforts,Paragraph
"succeeded to the extent that, in 1183,",Paragraph
the German Empire signed the Peace of,Paragraph
Constance with the Italians. The treaty,Paragraph
gave the cities local jurisdiction over their,Paragraph
territories and the freedom to elect their own,Title
councils and to enact their own legislation.,Paragraph
The cumulative result was that a new and,Paragraph
remarkable society emerged with a mix,Paragraph
of aristocrats and urban merchants. Most,Paragraph
"important of all, a new designation arose",Paragraph
"known as the popoio (""people""). For the first",Paragraph
"time since the days of ancient Rome, Italy",Title
"had a political class, which was to play an",Paragraph
"increasingly large role, even conceptually,",Paragraph
in modern history. The architectural,Paragraph
consequences were immediate. Cities,Paragraph
"built town halls, the first such structures in",Paragraph
modern history. They also built a new type,Paragraph
"of public space called a piazza, while at the",Paragraph
same time competing to build large urban,Paragraph
cathedrals. The wealthy built increasingly,Paragraph
large private palaces. Some of the cities,Paragraph
"became great military powers, particularly",Paragraph
"Venice and Genoa, which built up vast naval",Paragraph
empires in the Mediterranean and Black,Title
Seas. Padua was one of these cities as well.,Paragraph
"After a devastating fire in 1174, it rose to",Paragraph
particular prominence. An impressive town,Paragraph
"hall, called Palazzo della Ragione (“Palace",Paragraph
"of Justice”), was built at the center of town",Paragraph
"with a huge assembly hall, some 81 meters",Paragraph
long and 27 meters wide. Vaulted in wood,Paragraph
"like an upside-down ship's nave, it was at the",Paragraph
"time the largest interior space in Europe, and",Paragraph
possibly in the world. Its long side faced the,Paragraph
"town square and was lined by a two-tiered,",Paragraph
arched loggia. A university was also founded,Paragraph
"(1222) in Padua, and it was to become",Paragraph
one of the leading academic institutions in,Paragraph
"Europe, especially in law. Town halls were",Paragraph
built in various cities across northern Italy:,Paragraph
"Palazzo della Ragione in Bergamo (ca. 1190),",Caption
"Broletto in Como (ca. 1215), Palazzo del",Caption
"Popolo in Todi (ca. 1220), Palazzo Vecchio in",Caption
"Florence (ca. 1300), and Palazzo dei Consoli",Paragraph
"in Gubbio (ca. 1340). In Siena, an enormous",Paragraph
"town hall, the Palazzo Pubblico (begun",Caption
"1297), was built in front of a magnificent",Paragraph
semicircular piazza. Siena is one of the best-,Paragraph
"preserved Italian cities from this era, frozen in",Paragraph
time because of the Black Death that coursed,Paragraph
"through Italy in the 14th century, killing off a",Paragraph
large proportion of its population.,Paragraph
If the northern Italians were slowly getting,Paragraph
"out from under the feudal system, in Japan",Paragraph
feudalism was just getting started. The,Paragraph
Kamakura period (1185-1333) marks the,Paragraph
"governance of the Karmakura shogunate,",Paragraph
"whose first shogun, Minamoto no Yoritomo,",Paragraph
established its headquarters in Kamakura.,Paragraph
"Lords required the loyal services of vassals,",Paragraph
"12.4 Town Hall, Padua, Italy",Caption
who were rewarded with fiefs of their own.,Paragraph
The fief holders exercised local military,Paragraph
rule. But their rule was not spread over,Paragraph
"all of Japan: to the north, during the 12th",Title
"century, the Northern Fujiwara, who ruled",Paragraph
"over the Tohoku region, created a capital city,",Paragraph
"Hiraizumi, to rival Kyoto to the south. Despite",Paragraph
"its lack of high-quality rice-growing areas,",Paragraph
the Fujiwara derived their wealth from gold,Paragraph
"mining and horse trading, and as middlemen",Paragraph
in the trade in luxury items from continental,Title
Asian states. The Northern Fujiwara also,Paragraph
developed an ambitious Buddhist temple-,Paragraph
"building program on Mount Kanzan, not far",Caption
"from Hiraizurni, which consisted of temples,",Paragraph
"pagodas, repositories, and gardens. Known",Caption
"as Chuson-ji, it featured a large pagoda at",Paragraph
the top of the mountain with small reliquaries,Caption
"every 100 meters along Osho Kaido, one of",Paragraph
the main roads that connected the northern,Paragraph
provinces with Edo (modern-day Tokyo),Title
to the south. Jodo-shu (“The Pure Land,Paragraph
School”). Though its teachings first became,Paragraph
"prominent in China in the 5th century CE,",Paragraph
it was brought to Japan by a monk called,Paragraph
"Honen, who gathered disciples from all walks",Paragraph
"of life, developing a large following, notably",Paragraph
"women, who had been excluded from serious",Paragraph
Buddhist practice up to this point. One of,Paragraph
"12.5 Sanju-sangen-do, Kyoto, Japan",Caption
the buildings that has survived and that,Paragraph
best represents the Pure Land School is the,Paragraph
temple Sanju-sangen-do (“Hall of 33 Bays”),Caption
in Kyoto (1164). A linear building a whole city,Paragraph
"block long, its numerous doors could open",Paragraph
onto a large courtyard to allow devotees to,Paragraph
admire the thousand life-size statues of the,Paragraph
deity Kannon that stand on both the right and,Paragraph
"left sides of the main statue, a bodhisattva of",Caption
compassion. The emergence in Buddhism of,Paragraph
a feminine deity related to compassion and,Paragraph
motherhood also has many parallels with the,Paragraph
emergence in Europe of the cult of the Virgin,Paragraph
Mary.,Paragraph
It was in this extraordinary context that,Paragraph
Asia saw perhaps the most remarkable,Paragraph
"event of all, the invasion of the Mongolians.",Paragraph
"In the previous century, it was the Turks",Paragraph
who had mastered Central Asia; now it,Paragraph
was their comparatively poor cousins of,Paragraph
"the steppe to the east. In 1220, the unified",Paragraph
Mongolian army crossed the Syr Darya,Title
"River, beginning their invasion of Central",Paragraph
Asia. The Mongolians defeated the Song,Paragraph
"dynasty in 1279, allowing Kublai Khan to",Paragraph
"establish his own Yuan dynasty. By 1280,",Paragraph
the Mongolians had created the largest,Paragraph
empire ever seen in history. Masters of,Paragraph
"rapid equestrian attacks, the Mongolians",Title
were at first eager to confiscate goods,Paragraph
"and haul them, along with thousands of",Paragraph
"captive artisans, back to their camps in",Paragraph
Mongolia. But because the history of their,Paragraph
invasion was almost completely written,Title
by the conquered—there are no surviving,Paragraph
accounts from a Mongolian perspective—we,Paragraph
have to take a more balanced view. The,Paragraph
Mongolians were consummate traders and,Paragraph
basically continued what the Seljuks and,Paragraph
Turks had already begun. They also put,Paragraph
their unique stamp on the cross-continental,Paragraph
"trade, not only developing Sarnarkand",Paragraph
but also purposely demoting the southern,Paragraph
route. The heady days of the Khmer and,Paragraph
"Pagan were over, and indeed the entire",Paragraph
region went into steep decline. Angkor Wat,Paragraph
was soon abandoned and given over to the,Paragraph
"forest, to be rediscovered only at the end",Paragraph
"of the 19th century. In India, the loss of the",Paragraph
southern route to China had the effect of,Paragraph
"creating infighting, with a noticeable drop",Paragraph
in architectural production in the early 14th,Paragraph
century.,Paragraph
The first Mongolian capital was,Paragraph
"Karakorum, a vast city of yurts in western",Paragraph
"Mongolia, but Karakorum was too far from",Paragraph
"the center of political gravity in China,",Paragraph
so the khan commissioned the building,Paragraph
"of a new capital city, Shangdu (meaning",Paragraph
"“Supreme Capital” and also called Kaipingfu),",Paragraph
"some 1,200 kilometers to the southeast",Paragraph
of Karakorum. It was designed by the,Paragraph
Chinese architect Liu Bingzhong (1252),Caption
"in a profoundly Chinese manner, with an",Paragraph
"outer city and an inner city, and a roughly",Paragraph
"square layout. In 1264, Kublai Khan gave Liu",Paragraph
Bingzhong the task of designing yet another,Paragraph
capital city that today is more commonly,Paragraph
"known as Beijing. It was broad in scale, strict",Paragraph
"in planning and execution, and named Dadu.",Paragraph
It had large areas that mimicked the open,Paragraph
steppe where the Mongolians could ride their,Paragraph
horses and live in their yurts.,Paragraph
"Consider all the areas just discussed, and",Paragraph
then take everything that is not included:,Paragraph
the rain forests and deserts of central and,Title
southern Africa; northern Asia and Siberia;,Title
and Australia. These regions would remain,Paragraph
more or less independent from this economic,Title
continuum until the arrival of the colonial,Paragraph
"age or even later, but now that Europe and",Paragraph
the northern and eastern parts of Africa were,Paragraph
"part of the global economic continuum, the",Paragraph
"map began to stabilize. Within this area, the",Paragraph
"historical narratives are still of war, conflict,",Paragraph
"and disruption, but they are just as much",Paragraph
"about power, personalities, and religion",Title
"as about the need to control trade routes,",Paragraph

southern China's Yunnan Province. From,Paragraph
"900 CE until 1253, when it was conquered",Paragraph
by the Mongolians and brought back into,Paragraph
"the fold of the Chinese empire, it was an",Paragraph
autonomous Buddhist state and served as,Paragraph
part of an overland route to southern China.,Paragraph
"Its primary city, Kunming, had long been the",Paragraph
main stopping point along the route to India,Paragraph
by way of Burma. The disruptions of the Silk,Paragraph
Route that were the result of the Mongolian,Paragraph
expansion into Asia made this alternative,Paragraph
route especially important. In the 9th,Paragraph
"century CE, Dali, a nearby city, took control",Paragraph
"of Kunming, unified the area, and built new",Paragraph
temples and palaces.,Paragraph
A more distant development was the,Paragraph
integration of the East African coast into the,Title
"circuits of Arab and Indian traders, which",Paragraph
created a continuous fabric of ocean ports,Paragraph
from Africa to China. These regional and,Paragraph
global events were highly advantageous to,Paragraph

is much that is still unknown about the,Paragraph
temple—archaeological work on the,Title
Khmer civilization is still in its infancy. The,Paragraph
building’s astrological notations (such as,Paragraph
"the columns on its balustrade, which are",Paragraph
equal in number to the years in a Hindu,Paragraph
"age), as well as its esoteric astronomical",Paragraph
"measurements, are still being decoded.",Paragraph
It is therefore generally assumed that the,Paragraph
building is a map of cosmological space,Paragraph
and time as understood by the Khmer.,Paragraph
The outer surface of the shrine did not,Paragraph
look as it does today. Along with its four,Paragraph
"corner towers, it is presumed to have been",Paragraph
"gilded and would have shone brightly,",Paragraph
especially when illuminated by the western,Paragraph
sun. The stone would have been covered,Paragraph
with a thin layer of stucco and painted.,Paragraph
A causeway in the form of a raised path,Paragraph

compound. The causeway terminates at,Paragraph
the bottom of an elevated cruciform altar,Caption
in front of the entrance to the temple. This,Paragraph
was as far as commoners could go. Both,Paragraph
the causeway and the altar are edged by,Paragraph
"a balustrade designed as long serpents,",Paragraph
"a reference to Shesha Naga, the celestial",Paragraph
serpent with seven heads. A critical role,Paragraph
in the story of the cosmic ocean is played,Paragraph
"by Shesha, for it is on the coiled body of",Paragraph
Shesha that the sleeping Vishnu dreams,Title

lotus on a stalk emerged from Vishnu’s,Paragraph

originally accessible from all directions. There,Paragraph
was also a 23-meter-deep well at its center,Paragraph

"found in most Khmer temples, are not only",Paragraph
a connection to the water-based authority of,Paragraph
the Khmer rulers but also an inverted mirror,Paragraph

Yasodharapura—3 kilometers square instead,Title

kings. Among the other astonishing buildings,Paragraph

It was called the “new” Yingzhao Fashi,Paragraph
"because the previous one, dating to the",Paragraph
"T'ang, had become outdated. The manual",Paragraph
"was not, however, intended as an aesthetic",Paragraph
"or philosophical document, but rather to help",Paragraph
"the imperial administrators regulate, and",Paragraph
"reign in, the construction industry.",Paragraph
"Aesthetically, architecture under the Song",Paragraph
and the Jin (and later under the Yuan) had,Paragraph
become very ornamental and complicated.,Paragraph
The size of the dou-gong decreased with,Paragraph
"respect to the overall column heights, but it",Paragraph
increased in complexity and showmanship.,Paragraph
The placement of columns was even,Paragraph
occasionally disrupted to accommodate,Paragraph
more ambitious spatial arrangements. While,Paragraph
all these transformations made for a much,Paragraph
"richer and more expressive architecture,",Paragraph
it also resulted in a great deal of waste,Paragraph
and corruption. Because construction was,Paragraph
controlled by powerful guilds that carefully,Paragraph
"guarded their knowledge, passing it on only",Paragraph
"in oral verse, buildings routinely ran over",Paragraph
budget. The imperial court found that it could,Paragraph
not reasonably predict the cost to complete,Paragraph
"buildings. Furthermore, the high demand",Paragraph
for timber was causing rapid deforestation,Paragraph
"in the Song territories, and with the northern",Paragraph
"forests in the control of “barbarians,” the",Paragraph
court feared that it would soon run out of,Paragraph
timber. The New Yingzhao Fashi aimed,Paragraph
to solve both these problems. Li Jie was,Paragraph
"an intellectual, a painter, and an author of",Paragraph
"books on geography, history, and philology.",Paragraph
"In addition, as a superintendent for state",Paragraph
buildings in the Ministry of Works (Gong,Title
"Bu), he had carried out several building",Paragraph
"projects, which made him an ideal person for",Paragraph
the job. For three years Li Jie systematically,Paragraph
"interviewed leaders of the construction guilds,",Paragraph
documented their building principles and,Paragraph
"processes, and added his own rationalizations",Paragraph
and explanations. He finally presented his,Paragraph
findings in 1105 in the form of regulations,Paragraph
that the government administrators could,Paragraph
use to monitor construction expenditures. Li,Paragraph
Jie’s Yingzhao Fashi consists of thirty-four,Paragraph
chapters organized into five parts: basic,Title
"data, regulations, labor work, materials,",Title
and drawings. Each part is subdivided into,Paragraph
the following fourteen sections: moats and,Paragraph
fortifications; stonework; structural carpentry;,Paragraph
"nonstructural carpentry and joinery (doors,",Paragraph
"windows, partitions, screens, ceilings,",Caption
"staircases, etc.); wood carving; turning and",Paragraph
"drilling; sawing; bamboo work; plastering,",Paragraph
"painting, and decoration; brickwork; brick",Title

The Yingzhao Fashi described eight types,Paragraph
of buildings but was concerned primarily with,Paragraph
"imperial and governmental buildings, and not",Paragraph
"with buildings for commoners, since only the",Paragraph
former would be paid for by the administrator.,Paragraph
Most of the drawings are plans (determining,Paragraph

(instrumental in determining costs). All these,Paragraph
"were regulated by a proportioning system,",Paragraph

But most of the information that has been,Paragraph
handed down about the Mongolians was,Paragraph
written by the people who were conquered,Paragraph
and who were not inclined toward more,Paragraph
neutral assessments. One of the reasons for,Paragraph
the Mongolians’ success was their military,Paragraph
style. Most armies fought with slow masses,Paragraph
of soldiers. Many soldiers were farmhands,Paragraph
with minimal skills and training. Mongolian,Paragraph
"soldiers, all excellent horsemen, had not",Paragraph
only mastered a dynamic mode of attack but,Paragraph
were also seasoned to cope with the brutal,Paragraph
conditions of the steppe. A diet of meat,Paragraph

lowest for the southern Chinese from the,Paragraph
former Song regions. Outsiders enjoyed the,Paragraph

know from descriptions that the city was,Paragraph
"square, with gates in the cardinal directions,",Paragraph

Nestorian church. When Kublai Khan claimed,Paragraph
"the throne of the Mongol Empire in 1260,",Paragraph
he relocated his capital first to Chengdu and,Paragraph
later to Dadu (present-day Beijing). While the,Paragraph

regaining control over the holy cities of Mecca,Title
"and Medina. Under the previous Ayyubids,",Paragraph
"the center of power had been in Damascus,",Paragraph
"but under the Mamluks, Cairo’s importance",Paragraph

"perspective, Cairo was the prime link between",Paragraph
"India and Europe. Though a military elite,",Paragraph
"the Mamluks were savvy traders, establishing",Paragraph
ties with Venice and Genoa as well as,Paragraph
with Constantinople. Mamluk bureaucracy,Paragraph
consisted mostly of Coptic Christians and,Paragraph
"Jews, who had filled such administrative roles",Paragraph
for centuries.,Paragraph
During the 13th and 14th centuries,Title
at least five major madrasas were built in,Paragraph
Cairo along a street close to the sultan’s,Paragraph
palace. Each of these was associated with,Paragraph
"a mausoleum. Normally, tombs, even for",Paragraph
"the rich, would be located outside of the",Paragraph
"city, but if the sultan gave an endowment",Paragraph
to a madrasa he was granted an exception.,Paragraph
Each madrasa is thus associated with,Paragraph
"a sultan’s tornb. The buildings, sitting",Paragraph
"shoulder to shoulder, constitute one of the",Paragraph
more important street environments of the,Paragraph
"age. As madrasas had to face Mecca, all",Paragraph
the structures abut the street at about a,Paragraph
10-degree angle. The architects showed great,Paragraph
adeptness at integrating the program into,Paragraph
the complex and cramped urban site. Most,Paragraph
impressive is the Tornb of Sultan Qalawun,Paragraph
(1284-85). Though the life of a sultan was,Paragraph
continually beset by the possibility of internal,Paragraph
"rebellions testing his authority, he proved to",Paragraph
be a capable ruler open to trade even with,Paragraph
the Christians with whom he was fighting.,Paragraph
He made trade alliances with the Byzantine,Paragraph
"Empire, Genoa, and the Kingdom of Sicily.",Paragraph
The plan echoes the octagonal plan of,Paragraph
the Dore of the Rock. The wall of the,Paragraph
mausoleum is divided into a series of pointed,Paragraph
"arched recesses, the hoods supported on",Paragraph
"marble columns. The portal, a remarkable",Caption

"abbeys in Europe, forming a powerful",Paragraph
monastic network. Though Cistercians had,Paragraph
a large number of recruits from the feudal,Paragraph
"nobility, one of the reasons for their success",Paragraph
was that they conceived of manual labor,Paragraph
"as a form of prayer, and therefore opened",Paragraph
their doors to artisans and peasants. The,Paragraph
workmanship in their buildings—even in,Paragraph
"places that are normally not visible, like",Paragraph
certain roof sections—was therefore executed,Paragraph
with attention to the minutest detail. Such,Paragraph

"12.59 Monastery, Fontenay Abbey",Caption
"built on rigorous geometrical principles,",Paragraph
sometimes by the monks themselves. They,Paragraph
had simple vaulted naves; lighting was dim,Paragraph
and limited by rule to only five candles. Wall,Caption
surfaces were clean and simple. Sculptural,Paragraph
embellishments were forbidden. The capitals,Paragraph

possible. Bold proportions and architectural,Paragraph
bravura were not tolerated; even ornamental,Paragraph
pavements were frowned upon. The plans,Paragraph
had square east ends in defiance of the,Paragraph

Even though they were slow to explore its,Paragraph

the ribbed vault around 1150 was an act of,Paragraph

EUROPE: THE HIGH MIDDLE AGES,Title
"During the 13th century, the skyline of",Paragraph
European cities underwent a profound,Paragraph
change as the spires and towers of,Paragraph
some six hundred major churches and,Paragraph
cathedrals marked the location of cities,Paragraph
in the landscape. This energetic building,Paragraph
activity was driven by a combination of,Paragraph
religious fervor and increasing wealth.,Paragraph
Income from the selling of indulgences by,Paragraph
the Roman Church was an important source,Paragraph
of financing. It was a dubious practice that,Paragraph
in the 16th century was to awaken the ire,Paragraph
of Martin Luther and eventually lead to the,Paragraph
Reformation. Another source of income,Paragraph
was sending relics on tours. The bishops of,Paragraph
"Chartres, for example, sent the cathedral’s",Paragraph
relics as far away as England to solicit,Paragraph
contributions.,Paragraph
The shift in focus dates to the Synod of,Paragraph
"Arras (1025), during which it was decided",Paragraph
that sculptural programs could serve to help,Paragraph
the illiterate visualize what they could not,Paragraph
"understand through the written word. Statues,",Paragraph
"once used only sparingly, and usually in",Paragraph
"relation to aristocratic worship practices, now",Paragraph
stood row upon row along church facades.,Caption
Compared with the Norman facade of St.,Paragraph
"Etienne (1067-87) in Caen, France, with its",Paragraph
"small windows and imposing, solid-looking",Paragraph
"wall of stone, the Basilica of St. Denis, with its",Paragraph
"broad and decorated portals, seems to almost",Paragraph
float above the ground. The church was,Paragraph
begun by the Normans but was transformed,Paragraph
by Abbot Suger (1081-1155). Actively,Paragraph
"engaged in France's political life, Suger",Paragraph
played a leading role in running the kingdom,Paragraph
while King Louis VI was away on a Crusade.,Paragraph
He wanted cathedrals to accommodate large,Paragraph
crowds that could then move easily past the,Paragraph
relics. He thus created for St. Denis a space,Paragraph
behind the high altar known as a chevet,Caption
"(French for “headpiece”), where the church’s",Paragraph
more precious relics could be displayed.,Paragraph
It served not only to display the relics but,Paragraph
also to reinforce the spatial significance of,Paragraph
the high altar. Suger also redesigned the,Paragraph
"cathedral’s facade, introducing a triple portal",Paragraph
that served as a symbol of the Trinity. The,Paragraph
Trinity had become important to theological,Paragraph
speculation in the second quarter of the,Paragraph
"12th century, and its reinstatement signified",Paragraph
support for an orthodox interpretation of the,Paragraph
Bible and for papal authority. The tyrnpanum,Caption
over the central door of St. Denis was the,Paragraph
"most important element of the facade, as",Paragraph
it portrays Christ sitting in judgrnent. The,Paragraph
sculptures were once again a concession,Paragraph
"to the unlettered, for few in the general",Paragraph
population at the time could read and write.,Paragraph
"In this, St. Denis reflects a change in religious",Paragraph
attitudes. Whereas Romanesque cathedrals,Paragraph
"were designed primarily for the elite, St.",Paragraph
Denis and later cathedrals were buildings,Paragraph
meant to appeal to the popular imagination.,Paragraph
"On a more elevated plane, Abbot Suger held",Paragraph
that the religious experience was one of,Paragraph
"transcendence, symbolized by disembodied",Paragraph
light. The rose window in the center of the,Caption
"facade, for exarnple, was one of the first of",Paragraph
its kind—a grand wheel of light and color.,Paragraph
"The function of the facade, so Suger held,",Paragraph
was to foretell the program of the interior.,Paragraph
"For Suger, the use of precious materials",Paragraph
in the furnishings of the church was also,Paragraph
"important, as it served as a presentiment of",Paragraph
the splendors of heaven.,Paragraph
"For all these reasons, St. Denis broke new",Paragraph
ground and is thus heralded as initiating the,Paragraph
"Gothic style. For the first time, features such",Paragraph
as cross-rib vaulting and flying buttresses,Paragraph
(although present in prior churches),Paragraph

Cathedral Design,Title
"In the 13th century, cathedral building was",Paragraph
by far the largest construction enterprise ever,Paragraph
"attempted in Europe. Chartres Cathedral, for",Caption
"example, was able to hold more than eight",Paragraph
thousand people. Technologically complex,Paragraph
"and often dangerous, construction frequently",Paragraph
took many decades and sometimes hundreds,Paragraph
"of years. Unlike Carolingian churches, with",Paragraph
"their imposing westworks, and Ottonian",Paragraph
"monastic churches, which were associated",Paragraph
with market towns and might not have had,Paragraph
"a facade at all, the facades on this new",Paragraph
generation of cathedrals served as sacred,Paragraph
thresholds to a mystic interior.,Paragraph
Among the various aspects of church,Paragraph
design that changed during this period was,Paragraph
the emergence of the interior elevation of,Paragraph
the nave as an architectural unit in its own,Paragraph
"right, with architects seeking to balance the",Paragraph
interplay of horizontal and vertical elements.,Paragraph
"At Notre-Dame in Paris (1163-1250),",Paragraph
there are four discrete horizontal levels: the,Paragraph
"ground-level arcade, over which run two",Caption
galleries—the tribune and the triforium—,Title
"above which runs an upper, windowed",Paragraph
story or clerestory. The windows of these,Paragraph
cathedrals were not transparent but filled,Paragraph
"with stained glass, bringing into the interior",Caption
"a muted, shimmering light. To obtain the",Paragraph
soaring height that the Gothic age aspired,Paragraph
"to, flying buttresses made their appearance.",Paragraph
While they achieve the desired result on the,Paragraph
"inside, they tended to pose a problem on the",Paragraph
exterior. At first the flying buttresses were,Paragraph
"purely structural supplements, as at St.-",Paragraph
"Germain-des-Prés, where they were added as",Paragraph
"reinforcements around 1180, but thereafter",Paragraph
they were integrated into the plan from the,Paragraph
start. Flying buttresses consist of a tower that,Paragraph
supplies the necessary counterweight and,Paragraph
an arch that transfers the lateral loads to the,Paragraph
"tower. Because of the flying buttresses, a",Paragraph
"church interior could become a spatial unit,",Paragraph
although this occurred at the expense of the,Paragraph
exterior’s legibility.,Paragraph
The epitome of the new style was Chartres,Paragraph
"Cathedral (1194-1220), where on the outside",Paragraph
the nave is almost completely obscured,Paragraph
behind an intimate tangle of buttresses.,Paragraph
"The interior, on the other hand, is almost",Paragraph
canyonlike. The nave elevation has only three,Paragraph
"levels, permitting a strong vertical extension",Paragraph
of the bays. To compensate for the added,Paragraph
"height, two flying buttresses, one over the",Caption
"other, bring the load to the tower. The vaults,",Paragraph
"another important Gothic element, were",Paragraph
composed of stone ribs with thin brick vaults,Paragraph
"in between, stretched like taut skin. The east",Paragraph
"end, with its rounded ambulatory, is modeled",Paragraph
"on St. Denis but goes further, adding five",Paragraph
semicircular chapels. The piers were also,Caption
innovative. Earlier piers often were composed,Paragraph
of a cylindrical core at the level of the arcade,Caption
and thin colonettes above. Here a continual,Paragraph
line from the vault to the ground reduces,Paragraph
the visibility of the column at the arcade,Caption
level. Proportion and geometry were used,Paragraph
"throughout to organize all of the elements,",Paragraph
from the small to the large. The length of the,Paragraph
"church, for example, is related to the transept",Paragraph
in a ratio of 2:3; the length and width of the,Paragraph
transept is 1:2.,Caption
"The town of Chartres was, at the time,",Paragraph
"quite small, but among the wealthiest in",Paragraph
"Europe, with an important trade in textiles",Paragraph
"and metalsmithing. However, financing for",Paragraph
thé cathedral came not only from the local,Paragraph
"region but from nearly all sectors of France,",Paragraph
as St. Marie of Chartres had almost attained,Paragraph
the status of a national deity.,Paragraph

The development of the Gothic style was far from,Paragraph
"linear. The Cathedral at Bourges (1195-1214), begun",Caption
"only one year after the one at Chartres, follows a",Paragraph
"slightly different model. Unlike Chartres, with its clutter",Paragraph
"of buttresses, the slope of the buttresses at Bourges",Caption
"corresponds to the steep slope of the roof, a rather",Paragraph
"ingenious solution that, along with the absence of a",Paragraph
"transept, allows the nave to be read on the outside as",Paragraph
a unified form. The chevet at the end rises in three,Paragraph
"stages, with small high-peaked chapels seemingly",Paragraph
"suspended between the buttresses’ piers. The interior,",Caption
"with its tall arches, is not as canyonlike as Chartres",Paragraph
because the tall arches create the illusion that the wall,Paragraph
of the side aisle is the actual side of the nave.,Paragraph
At Amiens Cathedral (1220-35) the architects,Caption
"were more conservative than at Bourges, following",Paragraph
"the model of Chartres, with its calmer interior and",Paragraph
soaring verticality. Amiens’s impression of verticality,Paragraph
is further enhanced by the integration of the crossing,Paragraph
piers into the overall design of the nave'’s facade.,Paragraph
The division of the upper window into four segments,Caption
rather than the usual two increases the impression,Paragraph
of verticality. Its tall nave arches and high clerestory,Paragraph
windows combine elernents of Chartres and Bourges,Paragraph
while to some extent preserving the unity of the nave.,Paragraph
The calm effect of the interior combines well with the,Paragraph
luminosity of the chevet. A comparison of the sections,Paragraph
of Amiens and Bourges shows that the interior of,Paragraph
"Amiens creates a greater vertical effect, which is due",Paragraph
to the lower arches along its nave and the absence,Paragraph
"of a second aisle, and is aided by better illurnination.",Paragraph
The consequence is that the buttresses of Amiens,Paragraph
"needed to be much higher to offset the weight, which",Paragraph
annihilates the corporeal presence of the building that,Paragraph
is still legible at Bourges.,Paragraph

Exeter Cathedral,Title
The transition from the Romanesque to,Title
the early Gothic lies to some degree in,Paragraph
the systematization of the nave elevation,Title
and in the integration of the nave with rib,Paragraph
"vaulting. By 1300, architects, increasingly",Paragraph
"confident, began to explore the decorative",Paragraph
"qualities inherent in structure, creating",Paragraph
styles that historians variously call,Paragraph
"Decorated, Perpendicular, or Flamboyant",Paragraph
Gothic. Scholars have long wondered if the,Paragraph
emergence of this new stylistic direction,Title
coincided with increased contacts with the,Paragraph
"East. It is known, for example, that England's",Paragraph
Edward | (r. 1272-1307) sent an emissary,Paragraph
"to Persia. At any rate, Exeter Cathedral",Paragraph
(1280-1300) shows a decorative unity and a,Paragraph
ullness that earlier cathedrals did not have.,Paragraph
he lower facade has become a veritable,Paragraph
curtain displaying the figures of the saints.,Caption
(The innumerable saints often have a special,Paragraph
"day allocated to them, and a child born on a",Paragraph
specific saint’s day would often receive that,Paragraph
"saint’s name.) The gallery of saints at Exeter,",Caption
"with its abstract crenellations, stands as an",Paragraph
almost independent screen in front of the,Paragraph
"building. On the inside, the crisply folded",Paragraph
geometries of early 13th-century vaults have,Paragraph
been replaced by the rippling shapes of fan,Paragraph
"vaulting, the origin of which is not known.",Paragraph
"12.78 Tierceron vaulting, Exeter Cathedral",Caption
Buildings in this style do not represent,Paragraph
"a deterioration of the Gothic style, as is",Paragraph
"sometimes held; rather, they demonstrate a",Paragraph
desire to integrate decoration and structure.,Paragraph
One factor that contributed to the change was,Paragraph
the fashion for more luminous interiors and,Paragraph
"more frequent use of white or clear glass,",Paragraph
which enhanced the subtleties of a building's,Paragraph
"surface treatment. Furthermore, in England",Paragraph
"at least, cathedral builders did not aspire to",Paragraph
the great heights that were typical of French,Paragraph
"churches, preferring instead wider windows,",Paragraph
"lower buildings, and taller steeples. Early",Paragraph
14th-century English cathedrals therefore,Paragraph
tended to have more coherent and yet more,Paragraph
dynamic silhouettes. This can be seen at the,Paragraph
presbytery of Gloucester Cathedral (ca. 1350).,Caption
Unlike those parts of the building that were,Paragraph
"already finished, the new extension, actually",Paragraph
"a structure unto itself, has huge windows",Paragraph
that are clearly visible on the outside. The,Paragraph
buttresses are kept tight to the body of the,Paragraph
"church. On the interior, facing the apse, the",Caption
lightness and paperiness of the architecture,Title
has been so deraterialized that nothing is,Paragraph
left except a thin filigree grid of supports.,Paragraph

manifestation at the Cathedral of Milan,Caption
"(begun 1387), a wide building with a vast",Paragraph
orchestration of vertical elements in white,Caption
"marble, reaching a crescendo in an octagonal",Paragraph

Italian Town Halls,Title
"In Italy, in the wake of faltering imperial",Paragraph
"control, a population explosion, and an",Paragraph
"expansion of markets, the artisans, guild",Title
"members, and merchants known collectively",Paragraph
as the popofo banded together with men of,Paragraph
rank and property to dominate the political,Title
system. The rise of the popofo was rapid. In,Paragraph
"Milan, in 1190, the popofo, the main source",Paragraph
"of communal revenues, were entitled to",Paragraph
only one-fifth of government positions. By,Paragraph
"1198, they were the dominant political force",Paragraph
in the city. Often the first acts of the popofo,Paragraph
"were to pass tax reform, systematize the law",Paragraph
"courts, and set up controls on public monies.",Paragraph
"Beginning with Pisa in the 1080s, Bologna in",Paragraph
"1123, and Florence in 1138, these fledgling",Paragraph
city governments laid the groundwork for an,Paragraph
urban consciousness that was to becorne the,Paragraph
hallmark of Italian politics for the next two,Title
centuries. The formal acceptance of this new,Paragraph
arrangement came in the form of the Peace,Paragraph
"of Constance (1183), a much overlooked",Paragraph
treaty that paved the way for the modern,Paragraph
notion of civic governance. With the German,Paragraph
emperors no longer in a position to assert,Title
"their power, they gave the northern Italian",Paragraph
"cities the right to elect their own consuls, to",Paragraph
"govern their own lands, and most importantly,",Paragraph
to make their own laws.,Paragraph
Central to the new notion of governance,Title
was a town hall in front of a public piazza,Paragraph
(campo) where people could assemble. There,Paragraph
was often also a special building for the head,Paragraph
of the militia and police. For the first time,Paragraph
in centuries—perhaps since the days of the,Paragraph
"12.81 Town Hall, Gubbio",Caption
Romans—buildings were conceived and,Paragraph
constructed as an ensemble with a public,Paragraph
space. The earliest town halls date to the,Paragraph
"end of the 12th century and are at Brescia,",Paragraph
"Verona, Modena, Pavia, and Bergamo. These",Paragraph
were followed in the 13th century by town,Paragraph
"halls at Volterra, Todi, Como, Ferrara, Siena,",Caption
"and Gubbio, among others. Most of these",Paragraph
halls followed a simple prototype: a large,Paragraph
"meeting hall on the upper floor, with large",Caption
windows facing the piazza and a balcony,Caption
from which proclamations could be read.,Paragraph
The ground floor was often open or had a,Paragraph
"loggia where silversmiths, gold traders, or",Paragraph
other highly skilled craftsmen and merchants,Title
could work under the direct protection and,Paragraph
supervision of the city. In the urban complex,Paragraph
"of Gubbio, the town hall and palace face",Caption
each other across a piazza that is raised on,Paragraph
a high undercroft looking out over the valley,Paragraph
below. The new town halls were coordinated,Paragraph
urbanistically with the cathedral buildings that,Paragraph
"were begun first at Pisa in 1063, followed by",Paragraph
"Modena in 1099, Verona in 1139, and Siena",Paragraph
"in 1196. The situation was, however, rarely",Paragraph
"peaceful. Milan, Brescia, and Piacenza were",Paragraph
"often at war with each other, as were Pisa,",Paragraph
"Genoa, and Lucca.",Paragraph
Siena,Title
"In the 13th century, Siena, one of the",Paragraph
"most important cities in Italy, controlled",Paragraph
the southern Tuscan wool industry and,Title
dominated the trade routes between France,Paragraph
and Rome. It was also home to Italy’s richest,Paragraph
banks. Siena’s power reached a zenith with,Paragraph
the defeat of a much superior Florentine,Title
army at the battle of Montaperti in 1260.,Paragraph
The city then embarked on unrivaled urban,Paragraph
"redevelopment, building a cathedral, a",Paragraph
"campo, and the town hall. The campo was",Paragraph
constructed more or less at the center of the,Paragraph
"city, on unclaimed land that sloped steeply",Paragraph
into a ravine. A large terrace was built over,Paragraph
the ravine to form the campo. At the steep,Paragraph
"end, a town hall was constructed—the",Paragraph
Palazzo Pubblico (1297-1310)—with four,Caption
stories facing the campo and elegantly,Paragraph
"proportioned reception and councilor rooms,",Caption
many decorated with frescoes recounting,Paragraph
important events in the city’s history. The,Paragraph
curve of the piazza is lined with a continuous,Paragraph
"row of palace fronts, most dating from the",Caption
14th century. Opposite the town hall is,Caption
"the Loggia della Mercanzia (1417), for the",Caption
merchants. The Duomo (1196-1215) a few,Paragraph
blocks away dominates the town’s silhouette.,Paragraph
"As was common in Italy, areas of towns were",Paragraph
organized around mendicant churches.,Paragraph
In this case the principal ones are San,Paragraph
"Domenico (1226), Sant'Agostino (1258), and",Paragraph
San Francesco (1326-1475).,Paragraph

Mendicant Orders,Title
"At the beginning of the 13th century,",Paragraph
the Roman Church saw its theological,Paragraph
interpretation and hierarchical structure,Title
"threatened by a series of so-called heresies,",Paragraph
several of which revolved around an,Paragraph
interpretation of the Gospels that held that,Paragraph
access to the divine was through personal,Paragraph
emulation of the deeds of Christ rather than,Paragraph
through the complex liturgical demands of,Paragraph
the church. Small wonder that this reading,Paragraph
of the Gospels displeased the church,Title
"fathers, who initially felt threatened by it. St.",Paragraph
Francis of Assisi was on the verge of being,Paragraph
branded just such a heretic in 1206 when he,Paragraph
"abandoned his privileged worldly life, became",Paragraph
"an ascetic, and preached the gospel of",Paragraph
"poverty. But Pope Innocent Ill, eager to bring",Paragraph
"the poverty sects under his control, allowed",Paragraph
St. Francis to preach and informally approved,Paragraph
his efforts in 1209 (and then officially in,Paragraph
"1223), hoping to avoid a possible schism.",Paragraph
Thus was born one of several mendicant,Paragraph
orders that radically transformed church,Title
"history and was to lead, some centuries",Paragraph
"later, to the Reformation triggered by the",Paragraph
preachings of the German monk Martin,Title
Luther.,Paragraph
"In the early Middle Ages, reclusive",Paragraph
monastics preferred their monasteries in,Paragraph
the quiet isolation of the countryside as,Paragraph
a counterweight to what they saw as the,Paragraph
"decadence of Roman cities. As a result,",Paragraph
inhabitants of cities and villages often had,Paragraph
to walk long distances to go to a church,Paragraph
and were thus remote from the cosmic,Paragraph
principles that united thern as members of,Paragraph
the Christian faith. The mendicant orders,Paragraph
responded by setting up their monasteries,Paragraph
in the hearts of cities or just outside their,Paragraph
gates to make themselves humbly serviceable,Paragraph
"and approachable; in many places,",Paragraph
religious services were both physically and,Paragraph
conceptually within reach of the majority,Paragraph
of Christians for the first time. Mendicant,Paragraph
monasteries were not sites of calm reflection,Paragraph
"as Cistercian monasteries were, but served",Paragraph
"more as dormitories for the monks, who",Paragraph
would leave in the morning to perform various,Paragraph
duties. The Franciscans became specialists,Paragraph
"in architecture and construction, helping to",Paragraph
build fortification walls and infrastructure. The,Paragraph
"Dominicans, another mendicant order, were",Paragraph
"known as doctors, lawyers, and teachers,",Paragraph
and many became well-known philosophers.,Paragraph
They were also closely associated with the,Paragraph
development of Scholasticism during the,Title
13th century and were prominent at the,Paragraph
"great universities of Europe. In a sense, the",Paragraph
13th century can be seen as the second,Paragraph
Christianization of Europe. If the first was,Paragraph
fought in the name of (often forcible),Paragraph
conversion and was largely dynastic in,Paragraph
"structure, the second was based on broad",Paragraph
outreach and popular appeal.,Paragraph
Because mendicants had sworn an oath,Paragraph
"to poverty and consequently had no money,",Paragraph
their churches were usually built for them by,Paragraph
citizens. At first many were simple structures,Paragraph
"or converted barns. By 1250, there were",Paragraph
12.86 Plan: St. Croce,Caption
Franciscan communities in alrnost every city,Title
"in France, Germany, and Italy. Mendicant",Paragraph
churches were by definition simple and,Paragraph

Ashlar stones were used at the gates and,Paragraph
to reinforce the corners of the walls. The,Paragraph

The architectural ideas of Tula were,Paragraph

in the 12th century. Because the city is,Paragraph

of discussion. The sudden efflorescence,Paragraph
of Toltec architecture in Chichén Itza has,Paragraph
led some to speculate that the exiled Toltec,Paragraph
"ruler, Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl, ray have settled",Paragraph
there. Although sacrifice and a militaristic,Paragraph

ceremonial complex was much more about,Paragraph

water-filled sinkholes that the Itza associated,Paragraph

INTRODUCTION,Title
The year 1400 more or less marks the end,Paragraph
of the great migratory conquests from the,Title
Russian steppes into Europe. The arrows,Paragraph
"on the maps showing the Gauls, the Huns,",Paragraph
"the Turks, the Mongolians, and other tribes",Title
from the steppes are no longer there;,Paragraph
the Eurasian world for the first time in a,Paragraph
thousand years was not beset by migratory,Paragraph
invaders. Civilizations responded by building,Paragraph
"walls, from the Long Wall in China to the",Paragraph
"Roman Wall at Limez. Then, as now, the",Paragraph
impact of these walls was more symbolic,Paragraph
than functional—they defined limits and,Paragraph
"joundaries, rather than successfully keeping",Paragraph
the “barbarians” at bay. The impact of the,Paragraph
invaders had not been all negative; within,Paragraph
"a short time period, the respective tribes",Paragraph
ad adapted and started to make their own,Paragraph
"contributions, from the Huns in eastern",Paragraph
"Europe, who converted to Christianity; to the",Paragraph
"Yuan in China, who merged their Buddhist-",Paragraph
shamanistic ways with Confucian thoughts,Title
and manners; to the Khanates in West Asia,Title
who adopted and transformed the new ways,Title
of Islam. The steppes invaders also cleaned,Paragraph
up and linked the short- and long-distance,Title
"land-based trade routes, particularly along",Paragraph
"the Silk Route, so that within a brief span",Paragraph
"of time, renewed civilizational and aesthetic",Paragraph
imperatives were underway.,Paragraph
It is perhaps a great irony of history,Paragraph
that the famous European oceangoing,Paragraph
explorations and migratory conquests,Title
"also began in this century, beginning with",Paragraph
Columbus’s unexpected encounter with,Title
the Americas. The colonial age ultimately,Paragraph
decimated the commercial viability of the,Paragraph
"Silk Route, but remember that the initiative",Paragraph
to search for an alternative ocean route to,Paragraph
India and the East was not initiated as a,Paragraph
"great voyage of “discovery.” Rather, it was",Paragraph
the Spanish crown’s desperate effort to find,Title
an alternative to the high prices charged by,Paragraph
"the new gatekeepers of the Silk Route, the",Paragraph
Ottomans. Spices from the trade route were,Paragraph
"necessary not for occasional exotic fare, but",Paragraph
"to preserve meat. Ferdinand and Isabella,",Paragraph
bankrupt from their long wars against the,Paragraph
"Moors, financed Christopher Columbus, an",Paragraph
"Italian, to counter the forces of the Ottoman",Paragraph
"Empire that, in collaboration with the northern",Paragraph
"Italians, had a stranglehold on Silk Route",Paragraph
"trade. The Ottomans, upset over the loss of",Paragraph
"Andalusia, were particularly hostile to the",Paragraph
Spanish. The northern Italian city-states and,Paragraph
"universities, in correspondence with those of",Paragraph
"the Islamic world, had long known that the",Paragraph
world was round and thus that a sea route to,Paragraph
India from the West was a near certainty. The,Paragraph
only remaining doubt was about its distance.,Paragraph
Geometry suggested that no 15th-century,Paragraph
European ship was robust enough to,Paragraph
undertake that journey. It was only an error in,Paragraph
translation that convinced Columbus that he,Paragraph
could reach India in about the half the time,Paragraph
that it would have actually taken. While his,Paragraph
"Italian compatriots, who profited significantly",Paragraph
"by the Silk Route spice trade, were not",Paragraph
"interested financing his missions, Columbus",Paragraph
"found his backers in the Spanish, who were",Paragraph
willing to take an unlikely gamble.,Paragraph
Some scholars date from 1492 the,Paragraph
"Anthropocene age, the present geological",Title
period in which human activity has come to,Paragraph
"lecisively affect climate, the biosphere, and",Paragraph
geology. One marker of its onset is the titanic,Paragraph
"encounter, engineered by humans, between",Paragraph
the microbes of Eurasia and the Americas,Title
that occurs at this moment. While 95 percent,Paragraph
of the 20 million or so inhabitants of the,Paragraph
Americas died from exposure to Eurasian,Title
"iseases, particularly smallpox, a negligible",Paragraph
number of Europeans died from American,Title
"iseases, mostly syphilis. It seems that the",Paragraph
long commerce between the distinctive,Title
"communities of Eurasia and Africa, and",Paragraph
the even longer tradition of close living with,Paragraph
"animals, had made Eurasians much more",Paragraph
resilient to disease than their American,Paragraph
"counterparts. The Black Plague, for instance,",Paragraph
"had just ravaged its way across Eurasia,",Paragraph
killing almost 10 percent of the population,Paragraph
"from China to Europe, which of course",Paragraph
countered the effects of global trade—but it,Paragraph
also ultimately improved the immune systems,Paragraph
of the survivors.,Paragraph
"This microbial imbalance, aided",Paragraph
of course by Spanish and Portuguese,Title
"determination to exploit, perrnanently negated",Paragraph
any counterfactual possibility of a grand,Paragraph
"merger of civilizations, producing instead",Paragraph
an essentially unilateral history of conquest,Title
and colonization. This was a significant loss,Paragraph
"because the American civilizations, at that",Paragraph
"time, were booming. By the middle of the",Paragraph
"13th century, most of North America was",Paragraph
inhabited by dozens of tribes whose villages,Paragraph
"dotted the landscape. Meanwhile, in Central",Paragraph
"America, the Toltecs had been displaced by a",Paragraph
"new migrant group from the north, known as",Paragraph
the Mexica (from whom comes the modern,Paragraph
"name Mexico), who settled into the central",Paragraph
"valley of Mexico, establishing new cities.",Paragraph
"After two centuries of conflict, the city of",Paragraph
enochea concluded a military alliance with,Paragraph
the Acolhua of Texcoco and the Tepanecs,Title
"of Tlacopan, forming a powerful bloc linking",Paragraph
most of central Mexico. Their capital was,Paragraph
"enochtitlan, the site of contemporary",Title
"Mexico City, a dramatic city on an island",Title
"within a lake, connected to the mainland",Paragraph
by causeways. Cortés’s descriptions of,Paragraph
"enochtitlan, even as it was being decimated",Paragraph
"by disease, were depicted in one of the most",Paragraph
circulated woodcuts of the time in Europe.,Paragraph
"Farther south, the Chimu kingdom",Title
controlled the territories of coastal South,Paragraph
America in the 13th and 14th centuries. Here,Paragraph
they had exploited the arid climate to build,Paragraph
"the largest city ever made purely from adobe,",Paragraph
an ancient type of sundried brick made of,Paragraph
"clay, sand, and water with some straw mixed",Paragraph
"in. In the middle of the 15th century, the",Paragraph
Chimus were displaced by upstart rulers,Paragraph
"from the highlands of Peru, the Inca, with",Paragraph
their capital in Qosqo (Cuzco). In their short,Paragraph
"life before they fell to the Spanish, the Inca",Paragraph
dominated the trade routes of coastal South,Paragraph
"America, constructed long rope bridges, and",Paragraph
built roads and cities with some of the most,Paragraph
intricate and precise random rubble masonry,Paragraph
ever to be seen in history. The Incas did not,Paragraph
"use the wheel, and the llama was their only",Paragraph
"real beast of burden, and it seems a not very",Paragraph
hardy one at that. But their techniques of,Paragraph
"weaving, which were also complex systems of",Paragraph
"accounting and timekeeping, and their grasp",Title
of the interrelated mechanics of land and,Paragraph
water—what today might be called ecology—,Paragraph
enabled them to build cities that were not just,Paragraph
spectacularly sited but also integrated into,Paragraph
their natural context in ways that we are only,Paragraph
beginning to fully understand. Their concepts,Paragraph
"of terracing, water management, and mass-",Title
based building evidence an epistemic,Paragraph
universe that is still beyond our grasp.,Paragraph
"The Italian world of the 15th century,",Paragraph
"retrospectively dubbed the Renaissance,",Paragraph
was transformed by the Ottoman capture,Paragraph
"of Constantinople in 1453, led by Mehrned",Paragraph
Il. Propped up mostly by the Venetians,Paragraph
who benefited significantly by funneling,Paragraph
"their trade through the strait of Bosphorus,",Paragraph
old Byzantium ultimately fell to the ever-,Paragraph
expanding reach of the Ottomans. After,Paragraph
dominating Silk Route trade into Europe,Title
"for centuries, the loss of Constantinople",Paragraph
precipitated the decline of Venice. But that,Paragraph
also opened up opportunity for the other,Paragraph
"cities of northern Italy, such as Florence",Paragraph
"and Siena, which now began to actively flex",Paragraph
their economic muscle and to contemplate,Paragraph
independence and self-determination. The,Paragraph
Medici family came to dominate the banking,Paragraph
systems of Europe and controlled a major,Title
share of the Silk Route trade into Europe.,Paragraph
Numerous scholars and artisans fleeing,Title
Constantinople found new employment and,Paragraph
audiences in the houses of northern Italy.,Paragraph
With them came the old knowledge of the,Paragraph
classical world that had long been preserved,Paragraph
"in the Islamic world, and which found,",Paragraph
"alongside the castigation of the Church,",Paragraph
a receptive audience in the city-states of,Paragraph
northern Italy.,Paragraph
Reacquaintance with classical,Title
knowledge imported from the Islarnic world,Title
ignited the search for more—which was,Paragraph
"found in the old lost libraries of Europe,",Paragraph
"particularly Switzerland. These, then,",Paragraph
were the circumstances that led to the,Paragraph
intellectual expansion and reimagining of,Title
human possibilities that we now call the,Paragraph
Renaissance. This is the milieu in which,Paragraph
"Brunelleschi, Alberti, Leonardo da Vinci,",Caption
and their ilk emerged as scholars and,Paragraph
original thinkers. As they reread old Greek,Paragraph
"and Roman texts, they faced the standard",Paragraph
"problem that all modernities face—that is,",Paragraph
how to reinvest in the past in a way that,Paragraph
"suits the needs, purposes, and imaginaries",Paragraph
of the present. Theirs was a Christian,Paragraph
"world that no longer knew concrete, and",Paragraph
it was perhaps fortunate for them that the,Paragraph
Italianate orthodoxy prohibited adoption of,Paragraph
the styles and structural achievements of,Title
"the Gothic cathedral, so they found space",Paragraph
to test ways of adopting pagan Greek and,Paragraph
"Roman intellectual, artistic, and building",Title
"design concepts for new, “modern” Christian",Title
projects. Thus we get the proliferation of,Paragraph
"urban cathedrals in new formal typologies,",Paragraph
some with new structural inventions to meet,Paragraph
"grand ambitions, such as the gigantic dorne",Paragraph
of the Duomo in Florence. The Italians also,Paragraph
"began investing in their cities, building not",Paragraph
"only grand palazzi but also urban amenities,",Paragraph
"such as the Foundling Hospital in Florence,",Paragraph
to counter old Christian biases against cities,Paragraph
as dens of disease.,Paragraph
"Meanwhile, the bounty of gold and",Paragraph
silver extracted from the Americas enabled,Title
the Spanish crown to not only consolidate,Paragraph
its hold at home but also to curry favor in,Paragraph
Rome. In competition with the northern,Paragraph
"city-states, the papacy undertook a vigorous",Paragraph
new reconstruction of the Vatican building,Title
in an attempt to bridge the gap between,Paragraph
their ancient world order and the newfangled,Title
knowledge of the time. This is when artists,Paragraph
such as Bramante and Michelangelo received,Paragraph
their grand papal commissions and built their,Paragraph
formidable aesthetic reputations.,Paragraph
"Competing with the authority of Rome,",Paragraph
"as usual, was France, whose King Francis",Paragraph
| quickly seized the opportunity to build,Paragraph
a strategic alliance with the Ottomans to,Paragraph
create a new gateway to the Silk Route for,Paragraph
Europe. He also patronized the northern,Paragraph
"Italian cognoscenti to populate his own court,",Paragraph
famously having Leonardo da Vinci move,Paragraph
to France to spend the last years of his life,Paragraph
there. Fear of disease prompted the French,Paragraph
"court, unlike nobles in the Italian walled",Paragraph
"cities, to live a largely rural life, building",Paragraph
country chateaux where they sought to,Paragraph
control their lands and armies via vast and,Paragraph
"busy networks of communication. Later, these",Paragraph
networks and protocols of communication,Title
and governance would also prove useful in,Paragraph
organizing French colonies in the New World.,Paragraph
The Mongol invasions transferred the,Paragraph
center of the Islamic world from its original,Title
"base in West Asia further to the east, in the",Paragraph
new post-Mongol kingdoms of the Ottomans,Title
"in West Asia, the Safavids in Persia, and the",Paragraph
Timurids in Uzbekistan and Afghanistan.,Paragraph
The outlines of what we recognize today as,Paragraph
the complex forces at play in the West Asian,Paragraph
geopolitical sphere—from Afghanistan to,Title
Egypt—were established at this tirne.,Paragraph
The Ottomans were tribesmen who,Paragraph
negotiated the border between the Christian,Paragraph
world of Byzantium and the pre-Mongol,Title
Islamic states and who took advantage of,Paragraph
the post-Mongol chaos to unite various tribes,Paragraph
and establish a new state. “Ottoman” is the,Paragraph
"anglicization of the House of Osman, which",Paragraph
is known in modern Turkish as the Osmanli,Paragraph
Empire. Osman Gazi ben Ertugrul (1258-,Caption
"1326), the founder of the Ottoman Empire,",Paragraph
was yet another of the central Asian migrants,Paragraph
who came from Turkmenistan in the middle,Title
of the 14th century to fight in local Anatolian,Paragraph
battles. Osman’s descendants captured,Paragraph
"Balkan territories, united local tribesmen, and",Paragraph
put a decisive end to the Crusades.,Paragraph
Although Mehmed II firmly instituted,Paragraph
Sunni Islam in Constantinople after capturing,Title
"itin 1453, he also aggressively adopted",Paragraph
"Byzantine courtly life, administrative policies,",Title
and aesthetics across his empire. There was,Paragraph
broad tolerance of non-Sunnis and even,Paragraph
"non-Muslims, and by the 17th century the",Paragraph
Ottomans controlled most of the Arabic Islamic,Paragraph
world along with the Balkan regions and,Paragraph
Greece. Istanbul became the largest city in,Paragraph
"the world outside China. With this power, the",Paragraph
Ottomans engaged in a vigorous process of,Paragraph
building mosques along the trade routes; the,Paragraph
"mosques were Byzantine by formal reference,",Paragraph
with a focus on domes and minarets.,Paragraph
To their east the Ottomans were in,Paragraph
"competition with the Safavids of Persia,",Paragraph
who were also taking over from Mongol,Paragraph
regents. The Safavids established descent,Paragraph
"from Safi al-Din, who was actually a mystic",Paragraph
Sufi. But the Safavids aggressively adopted,Paragraph
"Shi'ite policies, including zero tolerance of",Paragraph
nonbelievers. The Safavids governed their,Paragraph
"territories directly, and as a consequence,",Paragraph
"unlike the Ottomans, they were unable to",Paragraph
"expand their territories, but they maintained",Paragraph
a firm grip on those they did control.,Paragraph
"Within their realms, the Safavids undertook",Paragraph
construction of mosques and palaces of,Paragraph
exceptional beauty.,Paragraph
To establish a counterclaim to the,Paragraph
"Ottomans as the locus of the Islamic world,",Paragraph
"Timur, who claimed direct descent from",Paragraph
"Genghis Khan, not only launched a major",Paragraph
invasion of West Asia but also embarked on,Paragraph
"a major building campaign in his capital,",Paragraph
"Samarkand. With new bazaars, caravanserais,",Paragraph
"and mosques, Samarkand’s location at the",Paragraph
usual crossroads of the Eurasian traffic,Title
"between China, India, and West Asia made",Paragraph
it into one of the most cosmopolitan cities,Paragraph
of the time. Samarkand’s mosque achieved,Paragraph
a distinctive style by marrying the dome,Paragraph
"(lifted on a high drum) with the jwan, while",Paragraph
adorning every surface with blue tile patterns,Paragraph
that reflected the sun and helped keep the,Paragraph
buildings cool.,Paragraph
The competition for influence between,Title
Samarkand and the Ottoman caliphs was,Paragraph
"mirrored in the geopolitics of South Asia,",Paragraph
with the Southern “Deccan” Islamic kings,Title
working hard to establish their fidelity to the,Paragraph
distant Ottornan sultans (which is why they,Paragraph
"are known as the Deccan sultanates), while",Paragraph
those further north in the Indo-Gangetic,Paragraph
Plains leaned toward Timur (who invaded,Paragraph
"in 1398) and the khans. The northerners,",Paragraph
"however, had to compete heavily with Hindu",Paragraph
kings and repeatedly suffered reversals,Title
"in fortune, so that their architectural",Paragraph
"accomplishments, though spectacular, were",Paragraph
"few and far between. The Deccan sultanates,",Paragraph
"on the other hand, enjoyed relatively steady",Paragraph
"reigns, which, in competition with each other,",Paragraph
generated a fascinating plethora of diverse,Paragraph
"architectural achievements, all of which",Paragraph
happily married imported Ottoman styles with,Paragraph
local building techniques and styles in the,Title
service of new Islamic courtly and liturgical,Title
functions. Although the Portuguese found,Paragraph
a sea route to India around South Africa in,Paragraph
"1496, just four years after Columbus's fateful",Paragraph
"discovery, new European presence in India",Title
was restricted to trading and building coastal,Paragraph
seaports.,Paragraph
"Meanwhile, in Southeast Asia, the Khmers",Paragraph
"had gone into decline, and while their grand",Paragraph
"sites were largely abandoned, the idea of",Paragraph
great ernpires was now firmly established in,Paragraph
the Southeast Asia peninsula. The Majapahit,Paragraph
and the Thai established new kingdoms that,Paragraph
continued the Khmer rereading of Hindu and,Paragraph
"Buddhist institutions and temples, in dialogue",Title
with those of Sri Lanka and eastern India.,Paragraph
"At the eastern end of the Silk Route, the",Paragraph
Chinese were undertaking a revival of their,Paragraph
own. After three centuries of “foreign” rule,Paragraph
by the Mongolian Yuan dynasty established,Paragraph
"by Genghis Khan, the Han Chinese Ming",Caption
came into power in 1368. Although at first,Paragraph
"the Ming sought to consolidate a rural base,",Paragraph
they quickly converted back to controlling,Paragraph
the empire from their capitals with the help,Paragraph
of their bureaucracy. The Ming actively,Paragraph
projected the Yuan as foreigner-barbarians,Paragraph
and worked hard to revive old Confucian,Paragraph
"practices. And yet, as we see time and",Paragraph
"again in history, the Ming did not hesitate to",Paragraph
“modernize” the past and adopt practices of,Paragraph
"the Yuan that they found expedient. Thus,",Paragraph
"for instance, initially the Ming built a brand-",Paragraph
"new capital at Nanjing as per tradition,",Paragraph
proclaiming the establishment of a new,Title
"order. But then the third Ming emperor,",Paragraph
"Zhu Di (r. 1403-24), moved the main",Paragraph
"capital back to Dadu, the old Yuan capital,",Paragraph
"which was still flourishing, now renaming",Paragraph
it Beijing (meaning “Northern Peace”).,Paragraph
Here the Ming built the Forbidden City as,Paragraph
"we know it today, incorporating a complex",Paragraph
"taxonomy of sight, visibility barriers, and",Paragraph
"access mediated through gates, courtyards,",Paragraph
"axial pavilions, and supporting quarters.",Caption
"Outside the Forbidden City, the Ming built",Paragraph
the twin Ternples of Agriculture and the,Title
"Temple of Heaven Complex, which connected",Paragraph
the terrestrial realm to the celestial one.,Paragraph
While they criticized the Mongols for living,Paragraph
"in “tents” in the imperial cities, the Ming",Paragraph
sought to revitalize their own old building,Paragraph
"techniques, emphasizing the development of",Paragraph
the bracketing system along with techniques,Title
of glazing in construction and lacquering in,Paragraph
furniture.,Paragraph
"By the middle of the 15th century, the",Paragraph
Ming had built up a stable government,Paragraph
"based on renewed cultivation and trade,",Paragraph
with a population estimated at between 120,Paragraph
and 200 million people. They cultivated the,Paragraph
supportive Joseon dynasty in Korea and,Title
invested heavily in undertaking global sea,Paragraph
voyages to explore first Southeast and South,Title
"Asia, and then the ports of East Africa and",Paragraph
West Asia. These seem to have been voyages,Paragraph
"of arbassadorship rather than of conquest,",Paragraph
so the sense of the usual threat from,Paragraph
across the Long Wall quickly occupied the,Paragraph
government's attention at the cost of further,Paragraph
"naval exploration. Later, the Ming empire was",Paragraph
to significantly benefit from the discovery of,Paragraph
"the Americas, as vast quantities of gold and",Paragraph
silver were used to purchase Chinese goods,Paragraph
to be shipped back to Europe. Peppers were,Paragraph
"added to Sichuan cuisine, and the mass",Paragraph
cultivation of potatoes and corn enabled large,Paragraph
populations to be fed.,Paragraph
With the development of water-powered,Paragraph
"pounding mills, China had captured the",Paragraph
energy of water by the Ist or 2nd century CE.,Paragraph
"This, together with the later invention of a",Paragraph
"water-turned wheel for irrigation, gave China",Paragraph
"an economic lead, beginning in roughly",Paragraph
1000 CE and continuing over the next 500,Title
"years. During these centuries, the Chinese",Paragraph
economy achieved levels of productivity that,Paragraph
Europe only started to attain in the 1500s. It,Paragraph
was therefore not surprising that when trade,Paragraph
"began between China and Europe, fueled",Paragraph
by American silver brought to China by the,Paragraph
"Europeans, the Chinese economy was more",Paragraph
productive than those of Europe.,Paragraph
But colonial contact proved to be a,Paragraph
double-edged sword; as the Chinese,Paragraph
economy became more dependent on,Paragraph
"overseas currency, it also became susceptible",Paragraph
"to it, and the Spanish (and Japanese) used",Paragraph
silver control policies to squeeze the Ming.,Paragraph
Considering the kind of trade taking place,Paragraph
across the world in the 1600s and 1700s,Title
and the fact that Chinese finished goods,Title
"were going to Europe in return for silver, this",Paragraph
"shouldn't be too great a surprise, especially",Paragraph
since the first real urban commercial,Title
dynamism within Eurasia had taken place,Paragraph
"in China several centuries prior, in the Song",Paragraph
dynasty.,Paragraph
"Across the East China Sea, the Japanese",Title
also sought a revival of older world orders,Paragraph
and older ties. Another unsuccessful attempt,Paragraph
by the monarchy to regain control in 1333,Paragraph
prompted the new shogun (military dictator),Paragraph
"Takauji, as a gesture of reconciliation, to",Paragraph
reinstate Kyoto as the imperial capital and,Paragraph
to reestablish connection with the Chinese,Paragraph
"Song dynasty, which had been severed",Paragraph
since Kublai Khan's unsuccessful invasions,Title
of Japan in 1274 and 1281. Out of this,Paragraph
reconnection emerged the signature Zen,Paragraph
"school of imperial Buddhist practice, which",Paragraph
"invented the miniaturized, abstract meditation",Paragraph
gardens born from the necessity of building,Title
“nature” out of confined urban lots. Thus,Paragraph
came into being the singular beauty of sites,Paragraph
like Ginkakuji and Kinkakuji—the Golden and,Paragraph
the Silver Pavilions—built for retiring shoguns,Paragraph
in their search for the extraordinary.,Paragraph

he Americas in the 15th century were,Paragraph

"disease. In the 15th century, from eastern",Paragraph

"into the western United States, eastward to",Paragraph
"Mississippi and Georgia, and north to what",Paragraph
"is now New England, there was what the first",Paragraph
Europeans sailing down the coast of New,Title

fabric of habitation. There were major cities,Paragraph
"that served as capitals of empires, like Qosqo",Paragraph
in Peru and Tenochtitlan in Mexico; there,Paragraph
were secondary cities that served as regional,Paragraph
"centers, like Chan Chan in Peru; Oraibi, a",Paragraph
Hopi city in the United States; and other,Paragraph
"large cities in Georgia. In between, there were",Paragraph
thousands of smaller villages. The spread,Paragraph
of diseases was so rapid that some cultures,Paragraph
disappeared even before they themselves,Paragraph
encountered the Europeans. There is,Paragraph
considerable debate about the specifics of,Paragraph
"this terrible loss of life and culture, but the",Paragraph
basic parameters of the tragedy are not in,Paragraph
dispute.,Paragraph

two square fabhanes (temporary lodgings),Caption

four corner rooms opening onto iwans off a,Caption
central court. This plan is distantly related,Paragraph
to concepts from Central Asia. The minarets,Paragraph
are set in the angle corners of the tabhanes,Paragraph

is generally thought that these spaces served,Paragraph
as temporary lodgings for members of the,Paragraph

"Almost immediately, work was begun on",Paragraph
the construction of mosques and other,Title

(begun 1459) that served as the main royal,Paragraph
residence and seat of the imperial Ottoman,Title
administration from the second half of the,Title
15th to the mid-19th century. The palace,Caption
was in the middle of a roughly triangular,Paragraph
shaped site that was surrounded mostly by,Paragraph
"water on the north and east, while to the west",Paragraph
a high wall separated it from the rest of the,Paragraph
city. Its plan could be seen as a haphazard,Paragraph
aggregation of buildings. But this would not,Paragraph
"be accurate, since it was planned according",Paragraph

He was seen as being beyond any relation,Paragraph

"clearly delineated boundaries, was designed to",Paragraph
instill a sense of sanctity and respect as much,Paragraph

The main entrance of the palace was just,Paragraph
"behind the Hagia Sophia, now converted",Caption
"to a mosque. The Imperial Gate, the first of",Paragraph
"three main ceremonial double gates, led to",Paragraph
"the first court, which contained workshops,",Paragraph
"storage areas, dormitories, kitchens, a bakery,",Paragraph
and baths. It also contained a mint and,Paragraph
various offices of the government. This court,Paragraph
served as a waiting area for dignitaries as,Paragraph

special ceremonies. Visiting ambassadors,Title
had to walk past the thousands of richly clad,Paragraph
soldiers and courtiers standing in mandatory,Title
"silence, an intimidating backdrop for",Paragraph

The Third Gate (The Gate of Felicity) was,Paragraph

ITALIAN RENAISSANCE,Title
The term Renaissance (from the French,Paragraph
"renaissance, “rebirth”) was coined in the",Paragraph
19th century to describe the cultural and,Paragraph
intellectual changes that took place in Italy,Title
during the 15th century. Inspired in part by,Paragraph
"the arrival of scholars fleeing Constantinople,",Paragraph
who had preserved old classical knowledge,Paragraph
"in contact with the Islamic world, the Italians",Paragraph
began to uncover and study Roman and,Paragraph
Greek texts and buildings to relearn what had,Paragraph
"been lost to Europe in the Middle Ages, and",Paragraph
then to find ways of applying this learning to,Paragraph
their own times. One of the most influential,Paragraph
"discoveries of this process, for instance, was",Paragraph
"the discovery of perspective, the appearance",Title
of which had been approximated by painters,Paragraph
"like Giotto di Bondone (1267-1337), but",Paragraph
which was first described mathematically by,Paragraph
Leon Battista Alberti (1404-72) in 1435. With,Paragraph
perspective began the process of locating the,Paragraph
"human eye, both literally and conceptually,",Paragraph
at the center of our epistemic universe.,Paragraph
"Ultimately, one can argue, this led to the",Paragraph
European Enlightenment of the 18th century.,Paragraph
Although the Renaissance is linked to,Paragraph
"what is called, also retrospectively, the Age",Paragraph
"of Discovery, we must remember that the",Paragraph
initial voyages of discovery by the likes of,Paragraph
"Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, and",Title
Amerigo Vespucci were sponsored not by the,Paragraph
"Italians, or the Ottomans, or the French—the",Paragraph
new centers of the Mediterranean world—but,Paragraph
"by the Spanish and the Portuguese, who",Paragraph
were at the edges of the intellectual revolution,Paragraph
that was the Renaissance. For the Spanish,Paragraph
"and the Portuguese, the voyages were at",Paragraph
the outset motivated singularly by economic,Paragraph
imperatives: to find cheaper routes to the,Title
"spice trade with Asia, or “the Indies.”",Paragraph
Whereas in painting there is a clear,Paragraph
progression that demarcates the Renaissance,Paragraph
"from the Middle Ages, the difference in",Paragraph
architecture is less obvious. Medieval,Paragraph
practices continued to intermingle with,Paragraph
classically inspired ideas for a century.,Paragraph
"Nonetheless, the interior of the Pazzi Chapel,",Paragraph
begun by Brunelleschi in 1429 but finished,Paragraph
"by other architects, set the tone for a type",Paragraph
of architecture that emphasized the use,Paragraph
"of columns, pilasters, and entablatures,",Paragraph
all unified by a proportional system,Title
"that governed the heights, widths, and",Paragraph
intercolumniations of the pilasters. Though,Paragraph
the detailing of the columns and bases was,Paragraph
"inspired by Roman buildings, Brunelleschi",Paragraph
was still not using the orders in their,Paragraph
"distinctive categories of Doric, lonic, and",Paragraph
Corinthian. That ernerged only somewhat later,Paragraph
and was first insisted upon by Leon Battista,Paragraph
Alberti in his treatise De re aedificatoria,Title
"(1452), now known as the fen Books on",Paragraph
Architecture. Renaissance architecture is,Paragraph
thus just as much about changes in practice,Paragraph
as about the emerging theories of the,Paragraph
discipline. Key was the discovery (ca. 1415),Paragraph
of a copy of a manuscript of Vitruvius’s 7en,Caption
Books on Architecture in the library of St.,Caption
Gallen in Switzerland. Alberti studied the,Paragraph
manuscript and used it as an inspiration,Paragraph
for his own work. Covering a wide range of,Paragraph
"subjects, from choice of materials to the",Paragraph
history of architecture and from different,Title
types of buildings to the philosophy of,Paragraph
"beauty, Alberti’s treatise was written not",Paragraph
only for architects but also for patrons eager,Paragraph
to understand the logic of representation,Title
through buildings.,Paragraph
"13.35 Plan and section: Pazzi Chapel, Florence, Italy",Caption
13.36 Interior of the Pazzi Chapel,Caption
There are other phenomena that are,Paragraph
part of what is understood by the words,Paragraph
“Renaissance architecture.” The difference,Paragraph
between the architect and the craftsman was,Paragraph
"now accepted, and architectural drawings",Paragraph
were now more common. Sebastiano Serlio,Paragraph
"(1475-1554) wrote a treatise, of which",Paragraph
"five books were finished, that was more",Paragraph
"visual than Alberti’s treatise, which had",Paragraph
no illustrations. Serlio's book had dozens,Paragraph
"of drawings, showing a variety of built and",Paragraph
unbuilt projects. It was enormously popular,Paragraph
among the many patrons and architects,Paragraph
eager to emulate the splendors of antiquity.,Paragraph
Questions about the nature of ancient,Title
Roman architecture and about the,Title
proportional systems that the Romans used,Title
were not easy to resolve and led to a wide,Paragraph
"range of interpretations. Some architects, like",Paragraph
"Brunelleschi, were less Roman than others,",Paragraph
"and, in fact, it was only with Neoclassicism",Paragraph
in the 18th and 19th centuries that rigorous,Paragraph
adherence to antique models was seen as,Paragraph
"a virtue. Nonetheless, the Renaissance did",Paragraph
"require a rigorous attention to proportion,",Paragraph
"and as a result, facades become flatter",Paragraph
and volumes more regularized. The vertical,Paragraph
dimension began to be articulated by,Paragraph
"horizontal layers of columns, entablatures, and",Paragraph
cornices. Niches and aediculae now entered,Caption
the architect's vocabulary as secondary,Title
elements to be placed between pilasters.,Paragraph

13.38 Plan and section: Cathedral of Florence,Caption
"scaffolding. To deflect the lateral thrusts,",Paragraph
Brunelleschi made a curving rib-lattice,Paragraph
structure of brick laid in herringbone fashion,Caption
to ensure cohesion; a large metal chain,Paragraph
laid at the base of the dome protected,Paragraph
against outward expansion. This solution,Paragraph
did not require a support structure during,Paragraph
the initial construction phase because each,Paragraph
vertical extension of the dome as it was,Paragraph
"being built, and as it spiraled closer to the",Paragraph
"center, would cohere with what was below.",Paragraph
A centering platform was constructed only,Paragraph
"in the last phase, but it was suspended from",Paragraph
the partially completed dome. The dome,Paragraph
terminated with an oculus about 7 meters,Paragraph
"in diameter, surmounted by a heavier than",Paragraph
normal lantern (built in 1446) whose weight,Paragraph
guaranteed that the ribs were in compression.,Paragraph
The ingenious design rested not only on the,Paragraph
manner in which the dome was built but on,Paragraph
"the combination of the double dome, which",Paragraph
"reduced the weight; the lantern, which added",Paragraph
compression to the dome helping coherence;,Paragraph
"and the chain at the base, which protected",Paragraph
against lateral forces.,Paragraph
Double-shelled dome construction of,Paragraph
course had a long history in the Islarnic,Paragraph
"world, as for instance in the mausoleum of",Paragraph
"Oljaytu (1302-12) in the city of Soltaniyeh,",Paragraph
lran. Although such examples may not have,Paragraph
"provided direct precedent, it is clear that",Paragraph
the concept was in circulation in Eurasia at,Paragraph
that time. Double-shelled domes dominate,Paragraph
subsequent architecture in innumerable,Title
"variations, such as those of the Mughal",Paragraph
tombs in India.,Paragraph
Florentine Loggias,Title
The narrow streets of Italian cities consisted,Paragraph
"of hard materials, stone and brick,",Paragraph
and because many of these cities were,Paragraph
"confined by city walls, open spaces were",Paragraph
at a premium. Parks and gardens did not,Paragraph
"exist. Loggias, roofed over open outdoor",Caption
"spaces, were highly valued and served both",Paragraph
functional and symbolic purposes. Unlike,Paragraph
"an arcade, which covers pedestrian traffic,",Paragraph
a loggia is a place to assernble rather than,Paragraph
to traverse. The Loggia dei Priori (now called,Paragraph
Loggia dei Lanzi; 1376-82) was to serve,Paragraph
"visiting dignitaries and ambassadors, and",Paragraph
even permit the celebration of coronations,Paragraph
and marriages of distant kings. It was,Paragraph
constructed perpendicular to the entrance of,Caption
"the Palazzo della Signoria, or the town hall,",Paragraph
and consisted of three lofty arches rising from,Paragraph
"a stepped platform. The columns, sitting on",Paragraph
"a short, ornamented plinth, are composed",Paragraph
of pilasters bound together into one massive,Paragraph
"shaft 10 meters in height, terminating in a",Paragraph
rich and beautiful capital of the Corinthian,Title
order. This was probably the first attempt to,Paragraph
re-create the Corinthian order since the time,Paragraph
of the Romans.,Paragraph
Another type of loggia was for public,Paragraph
"services, like the one next to the Baptistery,",Paragraph
which was used by the clergy to give out,Paragraph
alms. But the most spectacular loggia was,Paragraph
the one at the Foundling Hospital (Ospedale,Caption
"degli Innocenti; 1419-24; finished 1445),",Paragraph
"built by the Silk Guild, one of the most",Paragraph
important guilds in Florence. Ever since,Paragraph
1294 the guild had committed itself to the,Paragraph
care of infants (innocenti). Though it had,Paragraph
"set up wards and hospitals, this building",Paragraph
was specifically for abandoned children. A,Paragraph
special door was built in the facade with,Paragraph
a rotating panel so that a child could be,Paragraph
"deposited anonymously. By the year 1640,",Paragraph
"more than 1,600 infants and children lived",Paragraph
"there, along with 40 priests, nurses, and",Paragraph
administrators. The loggia that constitutes,Paragraph
the building's facade was designed by,Paragraph
"Brunelleschi, and even though its prototype",Paragraph
"was medieval, its style was markedly new.",Paragraph
"The columns, modeled carefully on classical",Paragraph
"precedent, are the earliest examples of",Paragraph
archaeologically correct Corinthian capitals in,Caption
"the 15th century. However, had Brunelleschi",Paragraph
"wanted to be more truly Roman, he would",Paragraph
not have set the columns on thin plinths only,Paragraph

5 centimeters high. The facade consists of a,Caption
long unbroken entablature. The arches are,Paragraph
"semicircular rather than pointed. Rondels,",Caption
"depicting babies in swaddling clothes,",Paragraph
decorate the spaces between the arches. The,Paragraph
"vaults, also spherical, were originally covered",Paragraph
with a sloping wooden roof. The attic level,Caption
was added later.,Paragraph

stark contrast between the pietra serena,Paragraph
"(dark stone) and the whitewashed walls,",Paragraph
creating the impression of a structural system,Paragraph
in which the pilasters are meant to be read,Paragraph
"as load-bearing, though in reality they are",Paragraph
not. Unlike French and English Gothic,Paragraph
"architecture, where the load-bearing function",Paragraph
of architectural elements disappeared in,Paragraph
"column clusters, here the difference is clearly",Paragraph
spelled out between what carries the load—or,Paragraph
at least seems to carry it—and what does not.,Paragraph
"Even so, this is not a pure Roman-inspired",Paragraph
"building, for the prototype for the colonnaded",Caption
nave is found in the early Christian basilica.,Paragraph
The restraint and orderliness of the nave was,Paragraph
also akin to Franciscan churches of the late,Paragraph

"13.41 Plan and section: San Lorenzo, Florence, Italy",Caption

"Cistercians. In that sense, one can see this as",Paragraph
"a complex fusion of early Christian, Cistercian,",Paragraph
"and Franciscan motifs, but built according to",Paragraph
classicizing rules. Working within the constraints,Paragraph
of that classical systern forced Brunelleschi to,Paragraph
"confront the problem of “turning the corner,” one",Paragraph
of the persistent issues in classical architecture.,Paragraph
"On inside corners, only a few leaves of a pilaster",Paragraph
"are visible, implying the presence of a structural",Paragraph
"support hidden in the wall. Furtherrnore, the",Paragraph
"giant-order pilasters, in turning the corner",Caption
"between the transept and the nave, are partially",Paragraph
obscured by the lower-order ones. Yet another,Paragraph
problem is that the pilasters along the wall stand,Paragraph
"higher than the colurnns, because the floor of",Paragraph
the chapel is three steps up from the floor of,Paragraph
the nave. This means that they should have,Paragraph
"been thinner, but that would have looked odd.",Paragraph
To solve the problem without raising the nave,Paragraph
"columns on bases, Brunelleschi had the pilasters",Paragraph
reach directly to the entablature; but on the,Paragraph
"columns in the nave, he added a dosseret above",Caption
each capital to equalize the distance. They,Paragraph
are decorated with patterns that reduce their,Paragraph
structural appearance.,Paragraph
"Nonetheless, the idea of freestanding",Paragraph
"columns, arches, spherical vaults, and the use of",Paragraph

was quite revolutionary for the time.,Paragraph

At Sant'Andrea at Mantua (designed ca.,Caption

long tradition of side-aisled churches for a,Paragraph

"Such a broad, open space could be easily",Paragraph
justified for a church that was to hold large,Paragraph
crowds of pilgrims during the annual showing,Paragraph

"facade, one of the first true church facades",Caption
"of the Renaissance, faces onto a small piazza",Paragraph
and is based on the theme of a Roman,Paragraph
triumphal arch. The theme of triumph is,Paragraph
carried into the interior elevations of the nave.,Caption
Alberti’s use of the giant order was novel,Paragraph
for the Renaissance. The problem was how,Paragraph
to coordinate the facade with the height of,Paragraph
the barrel vault of the nave behind it. Alberti,Caption
made no attempt to compromise the two,Paragraph
"disparate elements in the front, so he created",Paragraph
an arched opening that shields the upper-,Paragraph
level window. The barrel vault on the interior,Caption
was another Albertian novelty. Since there,Paragraph

Though urban palaces were the norm for,Paragraph
"the elite, the Medici were among the first",Paragraph
to create a villa that was not just a fortified,Paragraph
stronghold. As ubiquitous as this building,Paragraph
"type became over time, in the 15th century",Paragraph
it was quite unusual. One of the important,Paragraph
"aspects of villas are the gardens, and their",Paragraph
inclusion into the design was something of,Paragraph
"a novelty. During the Middle Ages, gardens",Paragraph
as places of pleasure were rare; in the tight,Paragraph
maze of medieval cities space was restricted,Title
"by city walls, leaving little room for pleasure",Paragraph
"gardens. Furthermore, because of their",Paragraph
"association with pleasure, gardens were",Paragraph
"frowned upon. No doubt, visitors telling of",Paragraph
the great gardens at the Alhambra in Spain,Caption
played a part in establishing their legitimacy.,Paragraph
"At any rate, by the middle of the 15th",Paragraph
"century, the idea of having a place outside of",Paragraph
"town, perhaps in the hills where it was cooler",Paragraph
in the summer and where the family could,Paragraph
"gather, became the norm for the elite. The",Paragraph
word villa to describe these places came into,Paragraph
"use only in the late 16th century, when the",Paragraph
villas themselves became more elaborate.,Paragraph
"In the 15th century, they were still—at least",Paragraph
partially—working farms that supplied the,Paragraph
"family, but that were also outfitted with a",Paragraph
manor house and garden.,Paragraph
Impacting this development was the revival,Paragraph
of the old Rornan notion of the bucolic,Paragraph
country retreat as a place where one could,Paragraph
"enjoy music, poetry, and good company",Title
and play the gentleman farmer away from,Paragraph
the mercantile world of the cities. A treatise,Paragraph
that Alberti wrote entitled Villa helped define,Paragraph
the parameters of this lifestyle. For the new,Paragraph
"elite, the villa served more practical goals as",Paragraph
"well: the artworks, sculptures, gardens, and",Paragraph
buildings were all very much part of a system,Paragraph
of wealth and prestige.,Paragraph
One of the several villas used by the,Paragraph
"Medici family, the Villa Medici at Poggio a",Title
Caiano was among the most important of,Paragraph
that period. Standing on the top of a small,Paragraph
"hill a few kilometers west of Florence, it had",Paragraph
a wide view over the plain between Florence,Caption
"and Pistoia. Originally a fortress, it was",Paragraph
"rebuilt, beginning around 1485, into a villa",Paragraph
by Giuliano da Sangallo. It also seers to be,Paragraph
the earliest attempt to re-create a classical,Paragraph
vila suburbana as described in texts by,Paragraph
Pliny and Vitruvius. The villa rests on a large,Paragraph
vaulted platform containing the service rooms,Caption
and spaces needed for the farm. It is a two-,Paragraph
"story building with an H-shaped plan, set",Caption
"sideways to the axis. The whole, including its",Paragraph
"gardens, was frarned by an enclosing wall.",Paragraph
The curved double staircase replaced the,Paragraph
"13.52 Villa Medici, Poggio a Caiano, Italy",Caption

leading to the top of the entrance platform.,Caption
"Functionally, the main rooms are aligned",Paragraph
"along the central axis with a large, barrel-",Paragraph
"vaulted room at the center, straddling the two",Paragraph

with antechambers and bedrooms located at,Paragraph
"each corner. The loggia, with its temple-front",Paragraph
"design at the entrance, was built for Giovanni",Caption
"de’ Medici (son of Lorenzo, 1475-1521), who",Paragraph
became Pope Leo X. The building was often,Paragraph
used as a summer residence by the Medici,Caption
family and increasingly for official receptions,Title
"and the welcoming of important personalities,",Paragraph
"such as Charles V, who stayed there in 1536.",Paragraph

crucified. It is missing a circular courtyard,Paragraph
that was meant to have been built around it.,Paragraph
The dome is such a ubiquitous element of,Paragraph
the classical European tradition that it is easy,Paragraph
to forget that it was initially a revolutionary,Paragraph
innovation. Its history as a symbolic form,Paragraph
"begins with churches in Armenia, where",Paragraph
domes signified the heavens. Armenian,Paragraph
churches had tall dome structures visible,Paragraph
"from outside the building, but the dome itself",Paragraph
was rarely expressed as such and instead,Paragraph
was usually hidden underneath a conical,Paragraph
"external form. Similarly, the dome of the",Paragraph
"Pantheon was impressive from the inside,",Paragraph
but had no exterior legibility. The dornes,Paragraph
of Islamic mosques and tombs were often,Paragraph
hidden behind frontispieces.,Paragraph
"By contrast, the dorne of San Pietro in",Paragraph
Montorio is not only the culmination of the,Paragraph
"composition, it was also designed to be seen",Paragraph
and comprehended from both the outside,Paragraph
"and the inside. Later domes, like the one",Paragraph
over St. Peter's Basilica in Rorne designed,Caption
"by Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564),",Caption
"were derivatives of this idea, even though for",Paragraph
"structural—and aesthetic—reasons, the outer",Paragraph

only nobility were permitted to engage in.,Paragraph
"Between 1527 and 1547, Francis | built no",Paragraph
fewer than seven chateaux near Paris. Some,Paragraph
were hunting lodges; others were places of,Paragraph
residence. Chambord (1519-47) was the,Paragraph
largest and most elaborate chateau of its age;,Paragraph
it was so huge that it was uncomfortable to,Paragraph
"live in, and Francis himself inhabited it for",Paragraph
only a few weeks. It is believed that Leonardo,Paragraph
"da Vinci had a hand in its design, but since",Paragraph
"Leonardo died in 1519, in the year it was",Paragraph

MAMLUK SULTANATE,Title
The Mamluks of Egypt (to be distinguished,Paragraph

turbulent rule from Cairo—battling the,Title

"a ready supply of well-trained masons,",Paragraph
the Mamluks extended and enhanced the,Paragraph
"tradition of Fatimid palace architecture,",Paragraph
establishing a series of important religious,Paragraph
institutions along the main road leading to,Paragraph
the citadel of Cairo. The greatest example,Paragraph
"is the Complex of Sultan Hassan, a colossal",Paragraph

cruciform congregational mosque with four,Caption
madrasas and a mausoleum of an imperial,Title

It was meant to house some four hundred,Paragraph
students. The religious spaces are organized,Paragraph
"symmetrically to fit into the awkward site,",Paragraph
which is defined by two major streets. The,Paragraph
"portal of the complex, rising 37 meters high,",Paragraph
is crowned by a mugarnas cornice. The,Paragraph
decorations include such Chinese motifs as,Paragraph
chrysanthemums and lotus flowers. The open,Paragraph
central court was paved and has a fountain,Paragraph
at the center. The four madrasas are located,Paragraph
in the corners between the arms of the,Caption

TIMURID DYNASTY,Title
The occupation of Persia by the Mongolians,Title

a period of disarray and confusion. One of,Paragraph
the earliest post-Mongolian states to ernerge,Paragraph
was created by the Turkish-speaking Timur,Paragraph
"(1336-1405), who proudly claimed descent",Paragraph
from Genghis Khan. An ambitious and,Paragraph

"Mamluks of Egypt, the early Ottomans, and",Paragraph
the Delhi sultanates to create an empire that,Paragraph
"unified Persia, lraq, Transoxiana, and parts of",Paragraph

"respect to the Shi'ite figure of Ali, the",Paragraph
"prophet Mohammed's son-in-law, whom they",Paragraph
considered the founder of their civilization’s,Paragraph
"mystic brotherhoods. Furthermore, with a",Paragraph
"generosity unthinkable in later generations,",Paragraph
Empress Gohar Shad built her Shi'ite subjects,Paragraph
"a splendid shrine in the city of Mashhad, still",Paragraph
now a major pilgrimage center in modern,Paragraph
"lran. Timur set up Samarkand, already a",Paragraph
"major metropolis along the Silk Route, as his",Paragraph
capital. It soon possessed large suburbs with,Paragraph
"fountains and canals. In the factories, the",Paragraph
"citizens wove silk and cotton, worked leather,",Paragraph
and decorated copper; Chinese craftsmen,Title
produced here the first paper outside of,Paragraph
China itself. The 13th-century population,Paragraph
exceeded half a million.,Paragraph
Consistent with Timur’s passion for grand,Paragraph
"structures, imposing appearances became",Paragraph
"the main priority of his architectural program,",Paragraph
with the facade developing into a virtual,Paragraph
freestanding architectural form. High drums,Caption
and external domes stabilized by brick ribs,Caption
were often placed over the structural inner,Paragraph
domes. The combination of portal and dome,Paragraph
"produced buildings of great spatial drama,",Paragraph
"such as Samarkand’s biggest mosque, known",Paragraph
as Bibi Khanum Friday Mosque (1339-1404),Caption
which was entered through a high portal with,Paragraph

covered lecture halls with four axial niches.,Caption
Slender round minarets mark the corners. The,Paragraph
square courtyard has four jwans and a large,Paragraph
"mosque at the rear, with additional lecture halls",Caption
to the right and left. The building became the,Paragraph
prototype of many later madrasas. The domed,Paragraph
"corner rooms served as classrooms, while the",Paragraph
court was enclosed by two stories of individual,Paragraph
"cells. The four colonnaded fwan porches,",Caption
"axially disposed and deeply recessed, served as",Paragraph
meeting and discussion areas. The walls were,Paragraph
decorated with marble panels and blue and,Paragraph
purple bricks.,Paragraph
The Timurids developed a new type of,Paragraph
dome support. Instead of the square hall and,Caption
"octagonal squinch, which had been developed in",Paragraph

the dome was set on two pairs of overlapping,Paragraph
arches. The dome was thus smaller than in,Paragraph

and Buddhist festivals to help calm civil,Title

"thoroughfares, which are slightly curved.",Paragraph
"According to feng shui, a building should",Paragraph
face southward and should have mountains,Paragraph

Changdeokgung was thus situated in the,Paragraph

"of Paekak Mountain, facing south to the",Paragraph
northern mountain peak called Nam,Title
Mountain. The deity on Paekak Mountain was,Paragraph
"female, whereas the deity on Nam Mountain",Paragraph
"was male. Paekak, which symbolized royal",Paragraph
authority and was the most highly valued,Paragraph
"in terms of feng shui, was closed to the",Paragraph
common people and protected from any,Title
"private use. Nam Mountain, however, was",Paragraph
open to the common people. Because,Paragraph
there was no natural mountain to the east,Paragraph

to compensate for the shortcoming in,Paragraph
"topography. In its original form, the palace",Paragraph
had about five hundred buildings. They were,Paragraph
burned during the Japanese invasions of,Paragraph

mysterious footprints and invite the visitor to,Paragraph
follow them. The final step up into the Old,Paragraph
Shoin is another uncut stone dramatically set,Paragraph
against the straight lines of the wooden steps,Paragraph
of the entrance porch. Another of Katsura’s,Caption
signature themes is the elaboration of the villa,Paragraph
as a simple hut. Every entrance into the villa,Paragraph
"is from large uncut stones, and every exterior",Paragraph
post on the garden side sits directly on a,Paragraph
stone foundation. All the wooden posts and,Paragraph
"beams were left unpolished, sorne with their",Paragraph
bark intact.,Paragraph
J. Bee.,Paragraph
The geometry that governs the plan of the,Paragraph
three shoins is derived from the dimensions,Paragraph
of the tatami and the sliding shoji screens,Title
covered with translucent rice paper. The,Paragraph
spaces are orchestrated as a series of,Paragraph
"interconnected rooms, with all the important",Paragraph
rooms facing east onto the garden. The,Paragraph
supporting rooms are to the west and are,Paragraph
connected to secondary structures. The,Paragraph
Middle and New Shoins are connected by,Paragraph
an intermediate section called the Music,Title
Room. An external veranda runs along the,Caption
"eastern edge of the villa, edged by sliding",Paragraph
screen doors that can be opened and shut to,Paragraph
modulate the light and to connect the exterior,Paragraph
and the interior.,Paragraph
The spatial and visual focus of the Old,Paragraph
Shoin is an east-west cross-axis formed by,Paragraph
"the pantry, the Spear Room, and its main",Paragraph
space (the “second room”) with an external,Paragraph
bamboo deck called the Moon-Viewing,Paragraph
Platform. (The Katsura River was known as a,Paragraph
scenic place for moon viewing in August.) A,Paragraph
miniature stone pagoda in a clearing on the,Caption
southern edge of the Island of Immortals is,Paragraph
the view’s stable point amid a dense arboreal,Paragraph
landscape. Its focus is the still water of the,Paragraph
"pond, which at night reflects the rising moon",Paragraph
"in the east, and by day, the trees along its",Paragraph
irregular edges. In autumn the trees are,Paragraph
"ablaze with color, and in winter, white with",Paragraph
snow.,Paragraph

So efficient was the Ming bureaucracy that,Paragraph
the fact that the reportedly indolent and,Paragraph
"pleasure-seeking seventh Ming emperor,",Title
"Wanli (1573-1620), seems not to have",Paragraph
affected the prosperity of his empire. Official,Paragraph
ceremonies and presentations were simply,Paragraph
made to an empty throne in his stead. A,Paragraph
"large proportion of Wanli’s time, along with",Paragraph
"an estimated eight million fae/s of silver, was",Paragraph
spent in the design and construction of his,Paragraph
"tomb, which began in 1585, when he was",Paragraph
only twenty-two years old. Much more than,Paragraph
personalized egocentric attempts to guarantee,Title
"an afterlife, tombs, and in particular royal",Paragraph
"tombs, were an integral part of the Chinese",Paragraph
cosmology. Spirits of dead ancestors of even,Paragraph
the common people had to be fed and cared,Paragraph
"for, or else they were liable to visit misfortune",Paragraph
upon future generations. The emperor's,Paragraph
"death, however, was particularly special, as he",Paragraph
"became part of heaven itself, and his tomb’s",Paragraph
architecture represented that transition. Many,Paragraph
"of China’s royal tombs, going back to that of",Paragraph
"the First Emperor, Shi Huangdi, have still not",Paragraph
been excavated.,Paragraph
"The thirteen Ming tombs, of which only",Paragraph

are clustered in the valley of the Tianshou,Paragraph

The first Ming tomb built here was that of,Paragraph

"predecessors, the Song, the Ming did not",Paragraph
build a separate Spirit Path for each tomb;,Paragraph
"instead, they clustered all their tornbs in a",Paragraph
single valley off one Spirit Path with a single,Paragraph
approach. The Ming also did away with,Paragraph
the practice of sacrificing for the emperor's,Paragraph
“accompanying” concubines and servants,Title
and therefore did not need a separate,Paragraph
chamber for them.,Paragraph

was defined by a perimeter wall that,Paragraph

"and his retinue of about 1,000 attendants",Paragraph
rested and changed into the appropriate,Paragraph
"robes. From there, the emperor began his",Paragraph
long walk down the Spirit Path.,Paragraph
"As in earlier tombs, the main feature",Paragraph
of the Spirit Path is its array of statues,Paragraph
of mythical and real beasts and eminent,Title

Twelve pairs of animals and six pairs of men,Title
"symbolize an eternal guard, arrayed in the",Paragraph
same manner in which the honor guard was,Paragraph

and gold inscriptions. Except for the qibla,Paragraph
"wall, the rest of the rosque is made of red",Paragraph

"The Ottoman sultan Suleyman | (r. 1520-66),",Paragraph

not only expanded the reach of the Islamic,Paragraph

"benefit of an extraordinarily gifted architect,",Paragraph
"Mimar Sinan (1491-1588), a contemporary",Paragraph
"of both Michelangelo and Andrea Palladio,",Paragraph
with whom he is often compared. Sinan,Paragraph
constructed nearly two hundred buildings,Paragraph
"in Constantinople alone, changing the face",Paragraph
of the city and thereby creating its unique,Paragraph
silhouette of mighty domes and slender,Paragraph
minarets. As an officer in the military and,Paragraph
"a trained engineer, Sinan assisted in the",Paragraph
"building of defense works and bridges, and",Paragraph
converted churches into mosques. With the,Paragraph
"capture of Cairo, he was promoted to chief",Paragraph
architect and assigned the task of putting an,Paragraph
Ottoman stamp on that city.,Paragraph
Though Sinan was consumed by the,Paragraph
ambition to create a domed building modeled,Paragraph

"the West on matters of church doctrine,",Paragraph
van Ill sent an envoy to Italy in 1475,Paragraph

The most important Italian architect to,Paragraph

The cathedral was designed as an open,Paragraph
nine-square grid added to the front of the,Caption

gridded system. Pilasters thicken the walls to,Paragraph
give the volume a typical Italian flavor. The,Paragraph
strict lines of the cornices darnpen the profile,Caption

groin vaults support tall drums and gilded,Caption
domes. The typically Russian pentacupolar,Paragraph
silhouette brings the Italian and Russian,Title
elements together. Fioravanti’s technical,Paragraph
expertise allowed him to provide better-,Paragraph
finished limestone walls and better bricks and,Paragraph
"mortar, yielding a thinner but more durable",Paragraph
structure.,Paragraph
One of the final churches begun by,Paragraph
Ivan Ill was the Cathedral of the Archangel,Paragraph

Alberti and Sebastiano Serlio had been,Paragraph

was to show how the classical systern could,Paragraph

"Palladio, who emphasized the systematization",Paragraph
of the ground plan and its relationship to the,Title
section and elevation of a building. Whereas,Paragraph
Serlio’s treatise allowed the patron a wide,Paragraph

much more circumscribed. Yet what made,Paragraph
Palladio’s architecture so influential was that,Paragraph
despite its rigor it never produced uniform,Paragraph

BAROQUE ITALY,Title
The Baroque style emerged in Rome,Paragraph
essentially as a counterstatement to the,Paragraph
Reformation; the architects who had,Paragraph
contributed most to bring it to its ripe,Paragraph
and full-fledged characteristics were,Paragraph
Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini (1598-1680) and,Paragraph
Francesco Castelli Borromini (1599-1667).,Paragraph
t is important here to differentiate Roman,Paragraph
Baroque from European Baroque. Baroque,Paragraph
Rome waned after 1648 under Pope,Paragraph
Alexander VII. From that time forward the,Paragraph
papacy was no longer a major power in,Paragraph
European politics. With the ascendancy of,Paragraph
"France and Austria, the Baroque style began",Paragraph
"to change, assuming a more urban form and,",Paragraph
insofar as it was now also applied to chateaux,Paragraph
"and princes’ castles, acquiring elements",Paragraph
such as public parks and waterworks.,Paragraph
Approaches often extended far into the,Paragraph
landscape with elongated perspectives.,Paragraph
In France it is exernplified by the Place,Paragraph
Venddme in Paris and the Chateau de Vaux-,Paragraph
le-Vicomte (1656-61) by André Le Nétre; in,Caption
"Austria, by the castle of Schénbrunn Palace",Caption
(1695). Eventually the Baroque became,Paragraph
an architecture of the late 17th-century,Title
"European capitals—Rome, Paris, London,",Caption
and Vienna—giving to these cities a profile,Title
that remains very much part of their identities,Paragraph
"today. On the negative side, many venerable",Paragraph
old buildings of the Middle Ages were,Paragraph
"given new Baroque facades or makeovers,",Paragraph
their interiors upgraded to conform to the,Paragraph
“modernizing” trend of the Baroque.,Paragraph
The decade of the 1620s was a,Paragraph
particularly promising moment in church,Paragraph
politics. The heroes of the Counter-,Title
Reformation (many of them Spanish) were,Paragraph
canonized—Charles Borromeo in 1610;,Paragraph
"ignatius de Loyola, Francis Xavier, Filippo",Title
"eri, and Teresa of Avila, all in 1622; and",Paragraph
"Gaetano da Thiene in 1629. This, in itself,",Paragraph
was a signal for new churches and chapels to,Paragraph
"e built, in honor of the new saints.",Paragraph
"In church architecture, the Greek",Paragraph
"cross, which was sometimes favored in the",Paragraph
"Renaissance because of its syrnmetry, was",Paragraph
rejected for the conventions of the Latin,Paragraph
"cross, which was liturgically more satisfying",Paragraph
"for Counter-Reformation purposes, as it",Paragraph
allowed for a clear separation between clergy,Paragraph
"14.99 Palace of the Senators, Campidoglio, Rome",Caption
"and laity, this being one of the distinctions",Paragraph
between Catholic and Protestant churches,Title
"of the time. The preference, as established",Paragraph
"at Il Gesu, was for a longitudinal nave",Paragraph
unencumbered as much as possible by,Paragraph
side aisles. Transepts were minimized or,Caption
"nonexistent, allowing the use of rectangles",Paragraph
"and ovals, which also helped to create a",Paragraph
sense of community that these churches,Title
were to inculcate. Baroque architects,Paragraph
"preferred curves to straight lines, deploying",Paragraph
"niches, walls, pilasters, and attached",Caption
columns in a seamless way that made,Paragraph
architecture seem pliant and rubbery—not,Paragraph
framing the liturgical but part of it. They also,Paragraph
had an appreciation of rhythmic movement,Paragraph
"through space, and intensified visual",Paragraph
dynamics with the use of painting as well,Paragraph
"as sculptural putti (winged babies), which",Paragraph
"often inhabit the higher reaches of the space,",Paragraph
sitting on ledges and entablatures. While in,Paragraph
medieval cathedrals stained glass modulated,Title
"the light, Baroque churches had plain glass",Paragraph
devoid of tracery and the windows were often,Paragraph
"unseen, designed to create a mysterious",Paragraph
and diffuse light. One often finds a Baroque,Paragraph
church quite luminous upon entering—,Paragraph
without first noticing any windows at all.,Paragraph
Campidoglio,Title
The European 16th century was marked in,Paragraph
the main by the Reformation and Counter-,Title
Reformation triggered by a recalcitrant,Title
monk in Germany. When Martin Luther,Paragraph
(1483-1546) nailed his Ninety-Five Theses,Paragraph
"to the church door in Wittenberg in 1517,",Caption
he only wanted to reform corruption in the,Paragraph
Catholic Church. He had no idea that he was,Paragraph
about to change the course of history. The,Paragraph
rebellion against the church spread and soon,Paragraph
embroiled Europe in terrible wars for most,Paragraph
of the next two centuries. Additional reform,Paragraph
"movements emerged—such as the Calvinists,",Paragraph
who believed in a form of predestination—but,Paragraph
the various versions of counter-movements,Title
are for the most part surmmed up as,Paragraph
"“Protestant,” a word derived from “protest.”",Paragraph
The response of the Catholic Church was,Paragraph
"called the Counter-Reformation, in which",Paragraph
"architecture played an important role, with",Paragraph
great emphasis put on representation.,Paragraph
Following the embarrassing sack of Rome,Title
by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V's,Caption
"troops in 1527, Pope Paul III (Alessandro",Paragraph
Farnese; r. 1534-49) initiated a series of,Paragraph
bold building campaigns to restore a sense of,Paragraph
"prestige, chief among them the construction",Paragraph
"14.100 Facade, Capitoline Museum, Rome",Caption
"of a piazza on Capitoline Hill, the nominal site",Paragraph
of the Roman Senate. Though the area was,Paragraph
of no particular importance to the political,Paragraph

depended significantly on the beneficence of,Paragraph
"the Holy Roman Emperor, who had recently",Paragraph
redoubled his wealth with riches looted from,Paragraph
the Americas.,Paragraph
Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564),Caption
was put in charge of the transformation,Paragraph
(begun 1538). He transfigured the disorderly,Paragraph
complex into a symmetrical composition,Title
with a trapezoidal piazza and three palace,Caption
"ronts. The Via Sacra crossed the piazza,",Caption
then descended a broad gentle stairway also,Paragraph
designed by Michelangelo. In the name of,Paragraph
"symmetry, Michelangelo added a building,",Paragraph
"nown as the Palazzo Nuovo (1646-50),",Paragraph
with no programmatic requirements. This,Paragraph
"uilding, serving only as a framing device",Paragraph
"for the piazza, was erected by Carlo Rainaldi",Paragraph
according to Michelangelo's designs.,Paragraph
"Although it looked like a habitable palazzo,",Paragraph
it was in reality little more than a facade.,Paragraph
For the first time Michelangelo used the,Paragraph
giant order for the pilasters supporting an,Caption
"unbroken entablature, with a balustrade",Caption
above the cornice to lend monumentality to,Paragraph
the facade.,Paragraph
14.102 Location map: Piazza del Campidoglio,Caption
"14.101 Plan: Piazza del Campidoglio, Rome",Caption
"14.103 Aerial view: Piazza del Campidoglio, Rome",Caption
The trapezoidal shape of the piazza was,Paragraph
"unusual, and even though it was predicated",Paragraph
"to some degree by the existing context, it",Paragraph
introduced a new and more dynamic notion,Paragraph
of public space than had been common in,Paragraph
"the Renaissance, which tended to favor more",Paragraph
static rectilinear schemes. At the center of,Paragraph
"the piazza is a shallow oval indentation, out",Paragraph
"of which rises a slight swelling of the ground,",Paragraph

of the piazza was brought to the fore by,Paragraph
the sculptural program. A sculpture of the,Paragraph

"twins Romulus and Remus, was placed",Paragraph
over the entrance of the Palace of the,Caption
"Conservators. The most prominent sculpture,",Paragraph

Bramante (who worked on the project from,Paragraph
"1505 to 1514) made a series of plans, some",Paragraph
"of which still survive, allowing a close look",Paragraph
at his design progress. The buildings he,Paragraph
proposed were suitably ambitious; his first,Paragraph
plan (ca. 1505) shows a four-sided building,Caption
sitting in a large courtyard open on all four,Paragraph
sides. Each arm of the Greek cross ended,Paragraph
with an apse projecting outward from the,Paragraph
surface of the building. Four large towers,Caption
were to rise from the corners. Bramante’s,Paragraph
"building had remarkably little wall surface,",Paragraph
with the architectural structure being a,Paragraph

residue between the spaces. The center was Og.,Paragraph
defined by a semispherical dome resting Paeae] i by A,Paragraph
"on columns. The building had no front, but %",Paragraph
was meant to be approached from all sides.,Paragraph
The Greek cross format exerted a strong,Paragraph
fascination for Renaissance architects both,Title
"as an icon, as it was for the Eastern Church,",Paragraph
and as a materialization of the mathematical,Paragraph
leals. One of the important champions,Paragraph
of the centralized church was Leonardo,Paragraph

Buonarroti. By then the decision had been,Paragraph
made to transform the building into a,Paragraph

"had been erected, and Michelangelo had",Paragraph

with four apsidal ends to the Greek cross.,Caption
A longitudinal orientation was created by,Paragraph
the addition of a colonnaded portico across,Caption

alternating rhythm of dilation and contraction.,Paragraph

Bernini solved this by incorporating the,Paragraph

"in 1548. By 1650, Potosi was the largest",Paragraph
"city in the Americas, with a population of",Paragraph
"160,000. Soon Spain became the world’s",Paragraph
leading silver producer (the Spanish crown,Title
received one-fifth of the silver) and ultimately,Paragraph
"produced 50,000 tons of silver, a quantity",Paragraph
that doubled the previously existing stock,Paragraph
of silver in Europe. The result was that the,Paragraph
"entire economic structure of Europe, and",Paragraph
"indeed the world, had to bend to this new",Paragraph
reality. Vast quantities of silver were used to,Paragraph
"buy goods from China, where silver was the",Paragraph
official currency. And it was not only silver,Paragraph
that contributed to Spain’s newfound wealth;,Paragraph
the salt flats in Portugal and in the Caribbean,Title
"belonged to the Spanish crown as well, and",Paragraph
they delivered most of the maritime salt,Paragraph
consumied in the West.,Paragraph
The money from these enterprises filtered,Title
"its way through the European markets, even",Paragraph
though Europe's commercialization and,Paragraph
industrialization based on the New World,Title
were still a while away. Along with the wealth,Paragraph
"came food; tomatoes, potatoes, peanuts,",Paragraph
"cocoa, maize, pineapple, chile peppers,",Paragraph
"vanilla, and tobacco were all American foods",Paragraph
that were introduced into the European and,Paragraph
eventually the global diet by colonization.,Paragraph
For a long time before the potato and tomato,Title
"became a staple of European cuisines, they",Paragraph
"were thought to be poisonous. Inversely,",Paragraph
"wheat, rye, oats, coffee, lemons, oranges,",Paragraph
"millet, yarns, cotton, indigo, tea, rice,",Paragraph
"bananas, some beans, and other products of",Paragraph
the Eurasian and African worlds were brought,Paragraph
"to the Americas, along with horses, sheep,",Paragraph
"pigs, goats, chickens, donkeys, rats, rabbits,",Title
"cats, dogs, and guinea hens, most of which",Paragraph
were introduced as part of the transplantation,Paragraph
of farming and animal husbandry systems. A,Paragraph
few American animal species were introduced,Paragraph
"to Europe as well, particularly the llama and",Paragraph
the turkey—the latter eventually making it,Paragraph
"back to the Americas, at least in name. But",Paragraph
it was arguably the “gift” of the European,Paragraph
"diseases—particularly smallpox, influenza,",Paragraph
"typhus, chicken pox, cholera, and measles—",Title
that truly tipped the scales in favor of the,Paragraph
"Europeans, as these diseases wiped out the",Paragraph
native populations and yielded the American,Title
continents to relatively easy and inexpensive,Title
colonization. The native Americans seerned,Paragraph
not to have had any diseases that impacted,Paragraph
the Old World.,Paragraph
Spain ruthlessly exploited its new,Paragraph
"American colony, an effort that went",Paragraph
hand in hand with the forced introduction,Title
of Christianity. At the center of Spain's,Paragraph
"colonial system was a form of feudalism,",Paragraph
in which Spanish settlers (encomiendos),Paragraph
"were entrusted with large tracts of land,",Paragraph
"the encomienda, along with a population",Paragraph
of not more than three hundred Indians.,Paragraph
"The natives retained possession of the land,",Paragraph
"which, however, officially belonged to the",Paragraph
crown of Castile. The encomiendos were,Paragraph
given the right of taxation and were allowed to,Paragraph
demand labor services from the population.,Paragraph
"According to a papal bull of 1493, the",Paragraph
Spanish encomiendos were supposed to keep,Paragraph
order and convert the Indians under their,Title
"care to Catholicism. This, at least, was the",Paragraph
"theory; in practice, the system soon became",Paragraph
corrupt and a tool for oppression and slavery.,Paragraph
The encomiendos introduced European,Paragraph
"beasts of burden, farming techniques,",Title
"and manufacturing processes, along with",Paragraph
extensive mining facilitated by an unlimited,Paragraph
supply of forced labor. New towns were,Paragraph
created to support the encomienda economy,Paragraph
and to connect it to the ports. A Spanish,Paragraph
colonial town was laid out on a regular,Paragraph
grid with a plaza in the center. Church and,Paragraph
administrative buildings usually faced onto,Paragraph
the plaza.,Paragraph
Hard on the heels of the conquistadores,Title
"were Catholic friars—Franciscans,",Paragraph
"Dominicans, and Augustinians—with the",Paragraph
assignment to claim the natives for Christ.,Paragraph
"They built churches, and in an effort to",Paragraph
facilitate the task of converting the indigenous,Paragraph
"people, often intermixed the conventions",Paragraph
of church liturgy with local pre-Columbian,Title
practices. The friars were also the first to,Paragraph
actually defend the rights of the natives,Paragraph
as children of God. Central to that effort,Paragraph
"was Bartolomé de Las Casas, a former",Paragraph
encomienda turned Dominican friar who,Paragraph
vehemently protested the encomiendos’,Paragraph
cruel and harsh treatment of the natives to,Paragraph
"the Spanish crown. “Are they not human,",Paragraph
"children of God, deserving of our protection?”",Paragraph
"demanded de Las Casas. In response, the",Paragraph
Spanish crown enacted a series of laws,Paragraph
that prohibited the enslavement of the,Paragraph
"native peoples. But soon after, the viceroy",Paragraph
"was assassinated, and the new laws were",Paragraph
withdrawn. The Spanish referred to their work,Paragraph
"as “conquest,” but from the perspective of",Paragraph
"the natives of pre-Columbian America, it was,",Paragraph
"of course, an invasion.",Paragraph
Atrios,Title
The Spanish-American churches built by the,Paragraph
friars emphasized simplicity and directness.,Paragraph
"Straighforward boxes with thick walls, often",Paragraph
"buttressed on the exterior, provided a sturdy",Paragraph
frame for the Franciscan house of God.,Caption
Windows were few and usually very high. The,Paragraph
"walls were unsegmented and left bare, or",Paragraph
were at best painted with simple illustrations,Paragraph
in a style not unlike that of the pre-Columbian,Paragraph
"platform mounds. A simple stone table,",Paragraph
"raised up by a few steps, served as an",Paragraph
"altar, behind which might be a reredos—an",Paragraph
ornamental screen—often painted with,Paragraph
pictures illustrating Christ’s trials.,Caption
The real innovations were on the,Paragraph
exterior. To accommodate large groups of,Paragraph
"worshippers, the friars developed the concept",Paragraph
"of the atrio, a large open court, walled along",Paragraph
"the edges, that used the facade of the",Paragraph
church as a backdrop; there was an outdoor,Paragraph
chapel to conduct Mass at the west end.,Caption
"In its entirety, the atrio was reminiscent of",Paragraph
the plazas that fronted the pre-Columbian,Paragraph
pyramids which were familiar to the native,Paragraph
"population. Within, the friars devised",Paragraph
"processions, complete with stopping places",Paragraph
for the Stations of the Cross that began at the,Paragraph
church and rotated counterclockwise around,Paragraph
the atrio. The so-called stations were altars,Paragraph
that represented the events that occurred,Paragraph
as Jesus was brought to his crucifixion in,Paragraph
"Jerusalem. Worshipers would stop at each,",Paragraph
thereby reenacting the way stations of,Paragraph
Jesus's suffering in a form of spatial prayer,Paragraph
that had also become common in Europe,Paragraph
uring this time. Hundreds of such atrio,Paragraph
churches were built by the Franciscans in,Paragraph

"however, became very uncomfortable with",Paragraph
"some of the lenient practices of the friars,",Paragraph
which they held to be unorthodox. The atrio,Paragraph
churches contravened the basic principle of,Paragraph
the house of God as a building with a roof.,Paragraph
The friars also favored processional activities,Paragraph
that often incorporated certain pre-Columbian,Paragraph
songs and dances. Catholic icons often,Paragraph
resembled older native images. All this made,Paragraph
"the Church in Rome nervous, opposed as",Paragraph
"it was to such hybridizations. In 1574, the",Paragraph
"monk’s sacercotal privileges were revoked,",Paragraph
"the building of monasteries was stopped,",Paragraph

services. The minister gave his sermons,Paragraph

more or less in the midst of the congregation.,Paragraph
Music and especially communal singing,Title
were important parts of the liturgy. There,Paragraph

When Henry IV came into power in France,Title
"in 1589, Paris was hardly the city that it",Paragraph
is today. Despite the nominal authority of,Paragraph
"the crown, France essentially functioned",Paragraph
as a highly decentralized confederacy of,Paragraph
autonomous provinces. Paris had suffered,Paragraph
"several setbacks, such as the absence of",Paragraph
"the kings, who preferred to live in their",Paragraph
"countryside chateaux, and the general",Title
downturn of the economy in the 16th century.,Paragraph
"In Paris, there was not even a royal palace.",Paragraph
With an estimated population of 20 million in,Paragraph
"the 1600s, France was, however, the most",Paragraph
populous country in Europe and the third,Title
most populous country in the world—only,Paragraph
China and India had greater populations.,Paragraph
Despite a massive increase in urban,Paragraph
"population, France remained a profoundly",Paragraph
"rural country. Economically, the glut of gold",Paragraph
and silver from the Americas had led to,Paragraph
inflation and a vast underclass that would,Paragraph
haunt French politics for another century.,Paragraph
In deciding to make Paris a capital city,Paragraph
and the seat of a newly forming centralized,Title
"nation-state, Henry IV initiated a series of",Paragraph
urban projects that were also intended to,Paragraph
boost the city's economic condition. One,Paragraph
such project was the triangular-shaped Place,Paragraph
"Dauphine (1609-14), designed to provide",Paragraph
accommodations for bankers and merchants.,Paragraph
"To make its importance highly visible, it",Paragraph
was located at the westernmost tip of the,Paragraph
"lle de la Cité; its narrow entrance formed,",Paragraph
"however, a tranquil and enclosed precinct",Paragraph

and mercantile enhancement was the Place,Paragraph
"Royale (today the Place des Vosges), begun",Paragraph
around 1605 on open land at the edge of the,Paragraph
city. It was originally planned with three sides,Paragraph
for shops and apartments and the fourth for,Paragraph
a range of workshops for the manufacture of,Paragraph
silk. Though some silk was still imported from,Paragraph
"China, much of it now came from Vigevano,",Paragraph
"Italy, where silk production was mastered in",Paragraph
the late 15th century. Henry IV was eager,Paragraph
to reduce France's dependence on foreign,Paragraph
"production, but French silk production",Paragraph
"never succeeded because of the climate,",Paragraph
and eventually the whole square became a,Paragraph
residential address attracting the cream of,Paragraph
Parisian society. Presiding over the square at,Paragraph
both ends were special pavilions for the king,Paragraph
"and queen, as the square was intended as a",Paragraph
setting for royal pageants. It was inaugurated,Paragraph
in 1611 when a masque and a tournament,Paragraph

of Louis XIII to Anne of Austria. As a setting,Paragraph
it was well suited to the nobility and the rich,Paragraph

garden as a practical necessity. Earlier,Paragraph
Japanese garden design had been based on,Paragraph
"Song Chinese examples, which were built on",Paragraph
large estates with long stroll paths that had,Paragraph
views created from the natural landscape,Title
"and constructed ponds, islands, mountains,",Paragraph
"and even rivers, complete with waterfalls.",Paragraph
While the miniaturization of natural elements,Paragraph
"was a part of the design strategy, these",Paragraph
gardens relied on size for their effect. In the,Paragraph
"15th century, however, when the shoguns",Paragraph
began to reduce plot sizes to accommodate,Paragraph
"larger populations in their cities, such",Paragraph
full-fledged gardens were impossible. The,Paragraph
"newer generation of gardens, made by Zen",Paragraph
"masters, were designed around the principle",Paragraph
"of carefully staged views. In the process, they",Paragraph
"created dry gardens, so called because they",Paragraph
employed abstract means of representation—,Paragraph
"using, for example, white pebbles and moss",Paragraph
to signify large bodies of water. The Zen,Paragraph
monks particularly enjoyed creating visual,Paragraph
"koans, or quizzical conundrums, that could",Paragraph
be meditated upon.,Paragraph

"Ryoanji, the Temple of the Peaceful Dragon,",Title
contains the most famous of Japan’s dry,Paragraph
"gardens, created around 1480 by an",Paragraph
unknown designer on the estate of Hosokawa,Caption
"Masamoto, located in the northwestern",Paragraph
foothills of Kyoto. The southern half of the,Paragraph
estate contains a pond with an island and a,Paragraph
"circumambulatory stroll path, to which was",Paragraph
added a rectangular dry garden with a bed of,Paragraph
"white gravel, carefully raked to form east-west",Caption
running bands. Within it were placed fifteen,Paragraph
"natural stones, clustered in five groups. The",Paragraph
gravel around therm is raked in the manner,Paragraph
of ripples in a pond. The precise meaning,Paragraph
of this koan is left open to interpretation.,Paragraph
Perhaps the white field is an ocean and the,Paragraph
rocks islands. The rocks could also stand,Paragraph
for a tigress leading her cubs across a river.,Paragraph
"Ultimately, the garden is not meant to convey",Paragraph
a singular interpretation but to serve as an aid,Paragraph
"to meditation, with the empty space between",Paragraph
the stones just as important as the stones,Paragraph
themselves—perhaps even more so.,Paragraph

INTRODUCTION,Title
"By the early 18th century, cities like",Paragraph
"Samarkand, Bukhara, Aleppo, Istanbul,",Caption
"Venice, and Florence, once at the heart of",Paragraph
"Eurasian trade, were becoming increasingly",Paragraph
marginal to the new world economy centered,Title
on the maritime ports established by the,Paragraph
European colonial powers. This phenomenon,Paragraph
"was global, spawning major new metropolises",Paragraph
"such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore,",Paragraph
"Bombay (now Mumbai), Calcutta (now",Paragraph
"Kolkata), Madras (now Chennai), Cape",Paragraph
"Town, St.-Louis (Senegal), Rio de Janeiro,",Caption
"Buenos Aires, Boston, and New York. It is",Paragraph
"not surprising, then, that the architectural",Paragraph
survey of this time shows a world in which,Paragraph
some areas were rapidly transforming under,Paragraph
"the modernizing sway of colonization, while",Paragraph
"others, in spite of the colonial frenzy, still",Paragraph
clung to the old ways as long as possible.,Paragraph
This tumult of transformation centered on,Paragraph
the Americas. Two hundred years after their,Paragraph
"conquest by the Europeans, the indigenous",Paragraph
civilizations of the American continents,Title
had been almost completely destroyed. In,Paragraph
"their stead, a brand-new and revolutionary",Paragraph
system of wealth generation was invented—,Paragraph
"the hacienda, or plantation, where vast",Paragraph
tracts of land were used to grow a single,Paragraph
or a few crops that could be shipped back,Paragraph
to Europe for profit. Plantation culture not,Paragraph
only transformed America; it also drastically,Paragraph
"impacted Africa, where an infrastructure was",Paragraph
built to support the slave trade—including the,Paragraph
development of internal exploitative cultures,Title
to facilitate the capture of slaves. Slavery,Paragraph
put in place the hard divisions of racism in,Paragraph
"America, particularly after it was legalized into",Paragraph
"a race-based, hereditary institution in the late",Paragraph
17th century.,Paragraph
The plantation economies had the most,Paragraph
"transformative effect on Europe, where the",Paragraph
massive influx of colonial wealth and goods,Title
radically remade urban culture. As colonial,Paragraph
"merchants plied European streets with coffee,",Paragraph
"sugar, tobacco, and tea, they created new",Paragraph
"urban institutions, such as coffeehouses,",Paragraph
"along with new building types, such as",Paragraph
"bourgeois apartments (or Adte/s), parks, and",Paragraph
"theaters. This urban culture, which in so",Paragraph
"many ways still exists today, was instrumental",Paragraph
in the rise of the bourgeoisie and preliminary,Title
to the discourses and ferment that led to,Paragraph
the European Enlightenment in the late 18th,Title
century. If today the coffeehouse is essentially,Paragraph
a place of recreation and quiet study—,Title
perhaps the new library of our times—it is,Paragraph
interesting to look back and see that it started,Paragraph
"as a site of novelty and exploration, a place to",Paragraph
experience the new products of the colonial,Title
world.,Paragraph
The massive size of the colonial,Paragraph
"plantations, and the correspondingly",Paragraph
massive volume of products that were,Paragraph
"grown, processed, shipped, distributed, and",Paragraph
consumed—along with all the economic side,Paragraph
eddies that this system generated—created,Paragraph
an economic engine of unprecedented scale,Paragraph
for Europe. It required a reimagining of,Paragraph
governance and management that resulted,Title
in a new administrative culture focused on,Paragraph
rationalization and efficiency. Although the,Paragraph
"Spanish were first in this reorganization, the",Paragraph
French soon took the lead. Jean Baptiste,Paragraph
"Colbert, a renowned workaholic who served",Paragraph
as the minister of finances from 1665 to,Paragraph
"1683 under Louis XIV, took upon himself",Paragraph
the task of overhauling and rationalizing the,Paragraph
French government and bureaucracy. His,Paragraph
"administrative machinery gave the French,",Paragraph
"and subsequently the Dutch and English,",Paragraph
"who followed suit, a decisive advantage over",Paragraph
the Spanish and Portuguese in the colonial,Title
competition.,Paragraph
"Rationalization and efficiency, as the new",Paragraph
"administrative mantras of the times, also",Paragraph
"affected the culture. In architecture, the",Paragraph
ongoing adaptation of the styles of antiquity,Title
for modern purposes was subjected to,Paragraph
rationalization. The culture of science began,Paragraph
"to assert itself, particularly the questions of",Paragraph
astronomy necessary for naval navigation.,Paragraph
Although reason—beyond rationalization—,Title
had yet to become the dominant discourse,Paragraph
"of philosophy, its ideas were already being",Paragraph
addressed in works such as those of,Paragraph
Galileo and Copernicus. The push toward,Paragraph
science was furthered in particular by the,Paragraph
innumerable nautical and territorial maps,Title
that had to constantly be made and updated;,Paragraph
the success of the colonial missions relied,Paragraph
on their accuracy. As countries carefully,Paragraph
guarded their knowledge of new cartographic,Paragraph
"information, it is no surprise that the French,",Paragraph
"Dutch, and English disputed the location of",Paragraph
the prime meridian.,Paragraph
The European upper classes largely,Title
expended their new wealth building,Title
"fantastic new palaces and the like, the",Paragraph
most celebrated example being Louis XIV's,Paragraph
extravaganza at Versailles. The fusses and,Paragraph
frills of the Baroque continued to hold court,Paragraph
"in these palaces, as they did in the numerous",Paragraph
Baroque churches and abbeys that were built,Title
"across Europe. The Russians, under Czar",Paragraph
"Alexander, forced their way to the Baltic Sea",Paragraph
"in search of a viable port. Here, instead of",Paragraph
launching a massive colonial campaign to,Paragraph
"compete with the British and French, they",Paragraph
built a massive new capital city called St.,Paragraph
"Petersburg, founded in 1703 and modeled",Paragraph
after French and Italian Baroque precedents.,Paragraph
St. Petersburg was a project both heroic,Paragraph
"and extravagant, a self-conscious attempt",Paragraph
to “catch up” with other countries that,Paragraph
were considered more advanced by simply,Paragraph
importing their culture and knowledge via a,Paragraph
massive systematic transfer—thus mistaking,Paragraph
symptom for cause. Such efforts would be,Paragraph
"repeated many times over in years to come,",Paragraph
particularly by nations that were late to the,Paragraph
colonial enterprise.,Paragraph
"In England, the revolution wrought by the",Paragraph
creation of the Church of England continued,Title
to play itself out with the radical Puritan,Paragraph
"call for de-Catholicization, which for a short",Paragraph
while starting in 1688 even resulted in the,Paragraph
overthrow of the monarchy. Its subsequent,Paragraph
restoration resulted in the prosecution of the,Paragraph
"Puritans, many of whom then left for New",Paragraph
England to join descendants of the Mayflower,Title
passengers. In the new world they sought to,Paragraph
build their Puritan churches with renewed,Paragraph
"vigor, but their congregations included",Paragraph
"dissenters, such as Roger Williams, who",Paragraph
"left to found his own colony in Providence,",Paragraph
"Rhode Island, with religious toleration as",Paragraph
one of its cornerstones. In keeping with,Paragraph
"their larger ethic, the Puritans, like the",Paragraph
"adherents of the Church of England, followed",Paragraph
the austere renderings of a neo-Palladian,Paragraph
architecture that relied on proportion and,Paragraph
"order for effect, rather than on style and",Paragraph
gesture as in the Baroque style.,Paragraph
"By the early 18th century, the Whigs had",Paragraph
emerged as a force in English politics; they,Paragraph
were strong supporters of English mercantile,Paragraph
expansion (with protections in place) and,Paragraph
advocates of constitutional monarchy. It was,Paragraph
"under the Whigs, and in their wake, that Sir",Paragraph
Christopher Wren built his neo-Palladian,Paragraph
churches in the aftermath of a great fire. The,Paragraph
English picturesque garden now emerged—,Paragraph
influenced though it was by descriptions of,Paragraph
Chinese gardens—as an irregular landscape,Paragraph
with distributed follies that sought to unite,Paragraph
the experience of the peripatetic visitor with,Paragraph
"surrounding nature. These gardens, along",Paragraph
with philosophical propositions such as cogito,Paragraph
"ergo sum (| think, therefore | arm), were at the",Paragraph
genesis of the Enlightenment’s autonomous,Title
subject.,Paragraph
The African slave trade was going full,Paragraph
steam in the 1700s. Most of the slaves came,Paragraph
"from West Africa, and as a consequence,",Paragraph
social structures in the region were,Paragraph
devastated.,Paragraph
"Meanwhile, the mineral wealth extracted",Paragraph
from America continued to find its way,Title
"across the Pacific to China, where it was",Paragraph
exchanged by the Chinese for luxury goods,Title
such as porcelain and lacquerware. In the,Paragraph
"17th century, China was in transition from",Paragraph
the rule of the Ming to the Qing dynasty.,Paragraph
"The Ming, unable to capitalize on their early",Paragraph
"gains, had overprinted the Middle Kingdom's",Paragraph
"paper currency (the world’s first), which led",Paragraph
"to serious inflation. In consequence, silver",Paragraph
began to circulate as the de facto currency of,Paragraph
"the realm, which promoted coastal piracy.",Paragraph
"Into the gap stepped the Manchu,",Paragraph
Jurchen Mongolians from the northeastern,Title
"frontier of China, who took over Ming China",Paragraph
without a major battle and formed the Qing,Paragraph
dynasty. Although theirs was still the largest,Paragraph
"economy in the world by far, the Qing quickly",Paragraph
realized that they desperately needed silver,Paragraph
to stabilize the currency. They also had to,Paragraph
"legitimize themselves as rulers, since they",Paragraph
were a small and foreign minority. Not only,Paragraph
"did they manage to stabilize the currency,",Paragraph
but they were also able to establish—first,Paragraph
under the rule of the Kangxi Emperor and,Paragraph
"then under his grandson, the Qianlong",Paragraph
Emperor—an administrative order that,Paragraph
merged Confucian and Han Chinese systems,Title
with a transnational Manchu perspective that,Paragraph
was keenly aware of the wider world beyond,Paragraph
"the Middle Kingdom. With their wealth, the",Paragraph
"Qing vastly expanded their borders, built vast",Paragraph
"and lavish palaces and gardens, established",Paragraph
"new cities, and, most importantly, renewed",Paragraph
infrastructure. They also produced a new,Paragraph
and comprehensive manual on building,Title
construction.,Paragraph
Even though a great quantity of Qing,Paragraph
"architecture still stands, it is not best served",Paragraph
by a detailed analysis of its formal properties.,Paragraph
Formal orders and the quest for their,Title
perfection were an obsession in Europe at,Paragraph
"that time, but in China these things had been",Paragraph
settled for some time and were no longer the,Paragraph
"defining question. Rather, the focus was on",Paragraph
"standardization, efficiency, and integration",Title
with the larger administrative machinery of,Paragraph
the empire.,Paragraph
Qing China functioned as an efficient,Paragraph
pre-modern empire and quickly became the,Paragraph
cynosure of European intellectuals. Colonial,Paragraph
"ships carried missionaries to China, who",Paragraph
settled there and subsequently produced,Paragraph
detailed accounts of life and order under,Title
the Qing. These illustrated accounts made,Paragraph
"their way to Europe, where they were",Paragraph
avidly read and citied by Enlightenment,Paragraph
"thinkers, particularly those who were keen to",Paragraph
demonstrate nonreligious moral and political,Paragraph
orders. It is in this sense that European stroll,Paragraph
"gardens such as Stowe in England, which",Paragraph
were trying to establish the new human,Paragraph
subject who was comfortable in nature rather,Paragraph
"than differentiated from it, can be seen as a",Paragraph
reading of Chinese garden precedents. The,Paragraph
"Qing bureaucracy, or jinshi system, based on",Paragraph
"open competitive exams, was the role model",Paragraph
of the European civil services. On the Chinese,Paragraph
"side, the Qing invited the Jesuits to court to",Paragraph
learn from them and even built one of their,Paragraph
palaces in European Baroque style.,Paragraph
"The Koreans, strong supporters of the",Paragraph
"Ming, were forced to recognize the Qing",Paragraph
"authority in China; but once they did, they",Paragraph
quickly adopted to it.,Paragraph
"In Japan, the Tokugawa shoguns were",Paragraph
also in the midst of redefining their culture,Paragraph
"at this time, creating a world that followed",Paragraph
"a strict code of behavior. The Bakafu code,",Paragraph
"as it was known, was in many respects",Paragraph
"astonishingly modern, as the rising middle",Paragraph
class sought ways to articulate institutions,Paragraph
suitable to its needs despite the restrictions,Paragraph
placed on it by the shoguns.,Paragraph
The original colonial project to find an,Paragraph
ocean route to the Indies for the spice trade,Title
continued to be pursued by several European,Paragraph
"powers—the Portuguese in particular, but",Paragraph
also by the Dutch and the French—via,Paragraph
private companies with monopolistic charters.,Paragraph
The Portuguese built forts across the Amazon,Paragraph
"delta, and then across South and East Asia.",Paragraph
"In this way, the Portuguese colonial port",Paragraph
network established the first infrastructure of,Paragraph
today's global cities of Asia. The Dutch did,Paragraph
"the same, but their focus was on the fertile",Paragraph
spice islands of modern-day Indonesia. The,Paragraph
"French, too, built trading posts worldwide,",Paragraph
"but their main interest, in competition with",Paragraph
"England, was in New England, Canada, and",Paragraph
along the Mississippi. In these areas the,Paragraph
"French traded in fur, a commodity with a vast",Paragraph
"market in the frigid lands of northern Europe,",Paragraph
where there were few forests left.,Paragraph
"In India, European colonial cornpanies",Paragraph
traded and built ports with the consent of the,Paragraph
"Mughals, who remained formidable through",Paragraph
the 17th century. Aurangzeb (r. 1658-1707),Caption
"vastly expanded the Mughal Empire, bringing",Paragraph
erstwhile vassal states directly under Mughal,Title
control. But unlike his predecessors and his,Paragraph
"Qing contemporaries in China, Aurangzeb",Title
adopted a much less tolerant attitude toward,Paragraph
"the diversity of India's peoples and cultures,",Paragraph
and consequently his death in 1707 initiated,Paragraph
a series of revolts. Shuja-ud-Daula in northern,Paragraph
"India, the Nawab of Oudh in Bengal, the",Paragraph
"Sikhs in Punjab, the Rajputs in Rajasthan,",Paragraph
and the Marathas in the Deccan wrestled,Title
"for power. At the same time, European",Paragraph
colonizers began to build on their coastal,Paragraph
footholds and start to acquire hinterlands. As,Paragraph
"a result, though this was a turbulent period",Paragraph
"in India, from a cultural and architectural",Paragraph
perspective it was also a time of tremendous,Paragraph
"exploration. Jaipur, a beautiful new city, was",Paragraph
"laid out by Sawai Jai Singh, a former Mughal",Paragraph
"general, along an important trade highway.",Paragraph
"The Sikhs, a reformist movement, took",Paragraph
root in northwestern India and established,Paragraph
a formidable kingdom. Darbar Sahib,Paragraph
(“Golden Temple”) in Amritsar was their,Paragraph
"most important shrine. The Mallas of Nepal,",Paragraph
"meanwhile, enjoyed relative immunity from",Paragraph
"these global events next door, but their royal",Paragraph
square in Patan embodied its own global,Paragraph
history.,Paragraph
In contrast to the energy on both sides of,Paragraph
"the Atlantic, in China, and in India, building",Paragraph
activity in West and Central Asia slowed,Title
down. The Ottomans held strong throughout,Paragraph
the 17th century and in 1683 laid siege to,Paragraph
Vienna again (after the first unsuccessful,Title
siege of 1529) but were conclusively,Paragraph
"defeated. In 1722, the Safavids of Persia",Paragraph
were overrun by the Afghans. During the 18th,Paragraph
"century, the Ottorman Empire continued to",Paragraph
"reign from Istanbul, but it was now buffeted",Paragraph
by the new wealth of the Atlantic trade. As,Paragraph
"in China, vast amounts of silver began to",Paragraph
"be smuggled into the Ottoman Empire, and",Paragraph
a significant black market emerged. The,Paragraph
resultant inflation destabilized their realms,Paragraph
and rebellion ensued. The Mamluks of,Paragraph
"Egypt, their most prized possession, declared",Paragraph
"independence in 1768, and thereafter the",Paragraph
Ottoman Empire began to go into decline.,Paragraph
Most books dealing with Islamic,Title
"architecture end around 1750, after which",Paragraph
time architecture that is retrospectively,Paragraph
described as purely Islamic was no longer,Paragraph
"done on the same scale. Instead, new",Paragraph
building forms emerged as a consequence of,Paragraph
the Islamic world grappling with the colossal,Title
changes taking place around it. The result,Paragraph
"was hybridized architectural forms, a mix of",Paragraph

COLONIALISM,Title
"By the end of the 17th century, what had",Paragraph
begun as risky sojourns to distant lands in,Paragraph
search of less expensive spices developed,Title
into a struggle among the various European,Title
nations for control of coastal trading posts,Title
"across the globe and with them, wherever",Paragraph
"possible, the hinterland that supplied those",Paragraph
ports. The principal competitors were,Paragraph
"Portugal, Spain, Holland, France, and Britain.",Paragraph
For the first two centuries of its history,Paragraph
"(roughly the 16th-18th centuries), the",Paragraph
colonial project was focused on the,Paragraph
competition to exploit and develop the,Paragraph
"Americas. Spain, Portugal, and then",Paragraph
"France, England, and Holland all competed",Paragraph
aggressively for a piece of the American pie—,Title
"first for its mineral wealth and then, more",Paragraph
"profitably and impacttfully, for its land. At the",Paragraph
"same time, all these European powers except",Paragraph
Spain also developed trading ports around,Paragraph
"the rest of the rest of the globe, particularly",Paragraph
"along the coasts of South, Southeast, and",Paragraph
"East Asia. But at this time, these ports had",Paragraph
only a fraction of the value of the American,Paragraph
territories. It would not be until the 19th,Paragraph
century—as most of the colonies in the,Paragraph
Americas became independent and European,Title
"wealth, particularly that of England, increased",Paragraph
exponentially with industrialization—that the,Paragraph
Buenos Aires,Title
colonial enterprise became fully global.,Paragraph
"Initially, the Portuguese focused on",Paragraph
"developing the Amazon coast, and the",Paragraph
Spanish conquistadores maintained their,Paragraph
aggressive focus on annexing the territories of,Paragraph
Central America and Andean South America.,Paragraph
"But then, as the gold and silver began to",Paragraph
"run out, they invented the plantation and its",Paragraph
hacienda culture focused on the large-scale,Paragraph
"production of sugar, coffee, and cocoa using",Paragraph
indentured labor. Most of the mineral wealth,Paragraph
was gone or tightly controlled by the time the,Paragraph
"French, Dutch, and British got into the game,",Paragraph
so they too ultimately focused on exploiting,Paragraph
"the plantation economies. At first the British,",Paragraph
"Dutch, and French developed footholds in",Paragraph
"the New England area, far from Spanish",Paragraph
"territories, and competed mostly for fur trade",Paragraph
with the indigenous people. But as these,Paragraph
"footholds evolved into full-fledged colonies,",Paragraph
they gained economic strength with the,Paragraph
"establishment of tobacco plantations, most of",Paragraph
"them British, in Virginia and territories farther",Paragraph
south.,Paragraph
"Before colonial plantations, in Europe",Paragraph
sugar was a highly luxurious commodity,Paragraph
"accessible only to the upper classes, coffee",Paragraph
"was an exotic Arabic drink, and cocoa was",Paragraph
mostly unknown. The plantations enabled,Paragraph
sugar to be sold on the streets. Together with,Paragraph
"coffee, cocoa, and tobacco, this chartered",Paragraph
an urban addictive culture that is still with,Paragraph
us. The plantations powered mercantile,Paragraph
"capitalism, the core of which was the large-",Paragraph
"scale, cheap production of a single crop",Paragraph
destined for mass consumption. Racial,Paragraph
slavery was its by-product.,Paragraph
"The plantations were massive, as land was",Paragraph
essentially “free.” Large tracts of land under,Paragraph
single control meant that large amounts of,Paragraph
cash crops could be produced efficiently.,Paragraph
The principal problem was the availability,Paragraph
and supply of labor. At first European settlers,Paragraph
"worked the land themselves, encouraging",Paragraph
locals to migrate. But this quickly became a,Paragraph
"poor economic proposition, although there",Paragraph
was a massive migration of Irish populations,Paragraph
(forced frorn Ireland by the policies of,Paragraph
James II} to the Caribbean and Virginia. In,Paragraph
1619 the Dutch brought slaves from Africa to,Paragraph
North America to work on the plantations. The,Paragraph
native American populations had already been,Paragraph
"decimated, and native slaves often escaped,",Paragraph
disappearing back to their tribes. But African,Paragraph
"slaves, in a completely foreign land with",Paragraph
no hope of ever making it back to their,Title
"homelands, were both more reliable and more",Paragraph
"easily obtained, with a steady stream of ships",Paragraph
bringing new slaves to American shores. This,Paragraph
is what led to the African slave “solution.”,Paragraph

"Initially, policies of the Spanish crown",Paragraph
identified the locals as heathens and sought,Paragraph
to destroy or convert them. By this system,Paragraph
conversion was a process of acceptance;,Paragraph
"however exploitative it was, it provided",Paragraph
potential paths to freedom. When the first,Paragraph
Africans were brought to the Caribbean in,Paragraph
"the 1520s, they too were given the option",Paragraph
of conversion. Racial slavery—the idea,Paragraph
"that African labor could be owned, and",Paragraph
that children of African women inherited,Paragraph
the slave identity of their mother and were,Paragraph
slaves regardless of their father—was only,Paragraph
developed as an institution on the British,Paragraph
tobacco plantations of Virginia around,Title
landmark court cases in the middle of the,Paragraph
"16th century. After that, the African slave",Paragraph
trade increased significantly.,Paragraph
Slavery had existed across Eurasia and,Paragraph
Africa since the beginning of history. The,Paragraph
"Egyptian pharaohs, the Greeks, Romans,",Title
"Phoenicians, Persians, Seljuks, Indians, and",Paragraph
"Chinese all practiced slavery in various forms,",Paragraph
particularly as it concerned subjugated and,Paragraph
"conquered peoples. In Africa, too, slavery",Paragraph
preexisted colonial trade. But the new,Paragraph
"colonial model, dependent on cheap labor,",Paragraph
magnified it to such a degree that the history,Paragraph
"of Europe, Africa, and the Americas was",Paragraph
irrevocably altered. It is estimated that more,Paragraph
"than 20 million people, and possibly as many",Paragraph
"as 40 million, were forcibly removed from",Paragraph
Africa; all the colonizing powers participated.,Paragraph
The legacy of the plantation system,Title
was unambiguously negative and had,Paragraph
consequences that are still playing out today.,Paragraph
"In Mexico, even by 1910, 70 percent of",Paragraph
all arable land was held by just 1 percent,Paragraph
"of the population, and similar situations",Paragraph
existed in South American countries. Almost,Paragraph
every country or region that was colonized,Title
by the plantation system had to struggle,Paragraph

Europeans.,Paragraph
While critics of the slave trade could be,Paragraph

slave labor. The situation in New England,Title
was arguably somewhat better: There,Paragraph

The hacienda system is thought to date to,Paragraph

"of Morelos, Mexico. The grant included all",Paragraph
the Native Americans then living on the,Paragraph
land and the power of life and death over,Title
"them. The Native Americans, like the slaves",Paragraph
"who soon arrived from Africa, were bound",Paragraph
"to a particular hacienda for life, as were",Paragraph
"their descendants. By the 18th century, the",Paragraph
"system, stretching from Mexico to Argentina,",Paragraph
was the primary means of export production,Paragraph
and in some cases the core of urban,Paragraph
developments. The hacienda was developed,Paragraph
"throughout the Americas, and later other",Paragraph
parts of the colonial world developed the,Paragraph
plantation system.,Paragraph
"Haciendas came in various sizes, and",Paragraph
"some were gigantic. Peotillos, 55 kilometers",Paragraph
"from San Luis Potosi in Mexico, for example,",Paragraph
"controlled an area of 193,000 hectares. The",Paragraph
word hacienda comes from an Old Spanish,Paragraph
"term (facienda) derived from the Latin focere,",Paragraph
"which means “to make something,” and most",Paragraph
"haciendas specialized in one or two products,",Paragraph
always an export-based cash crop. In areas,Paragraph
"where water was abundant, sugarcane was",Paragraph
"grown, which gave rise to rum and liquor",Paragraph
production. Other haciendas focused on,Paragraph
"livestock, cacao, coffee, tobacco, cotton,",Paragraph
"rubber, and a variety of woods. Since the",Paragraph
hacienda was often remote from metropolitan,Paragraph
"centers, it had to accommodate a wide range",Paragraph
"of functions. It had its own marketplace,",Paragraph
"cemetery, and jail. Layout followed a common",Paragraph
scheme involving courtyards for different,Paragraph

RATIONALIZATION AND THE AGE OF,Title
REASON,Title
While the Spanish thought that stockpiling,Paragraph
"gold and silver was the way to build wealth,",Paragraph
"the French, Dutch, and English, focused",Paragraph
on economic efficiency as a means of,Title
wealth generation. Their success lay in,Paragraph
combining absolutism with highly rationalized,Paragraph
governmental processes and investment in a,Title
national knowledge base. The rationalization,Title
of the national economy was the undertaking,Paragraph
"of Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619-83), one of",Paragraph
Louis XIV’s chief advisors. He was responsible,Paragraph
for many of the bureaucratic innovations,Paragraph
"that, though cumbersome, created the",Paragraph
base for France’s economic prosperity and,Paragraph
particularly its ordering of colonial territories,Paragraph
"and extraction processes. Thanks to Colbert,",Paragraph
there was a new understanding that there,Paragraph
was a nexus between global trade and the,Paragraph
national economy. Colbert also appreciated,Paragraph
that economic power was dependent on,Paragraph
knowledge. He therefore commissioned,Paragraph
"extensive studies of, for exarnple,",Paragraph
"shipbuilding, navigation, and armaments to",Title
ensure that the French fleet remained the,Paragraph
strongest in the world. He also founded the,Paragraph
Royal Academy of Science (1666) and the,Paragraph
"Academy of Architecture (1671), among",Paragraph
"other institutions, to serve and advise",Paragraph
government administrators and ministers.,Paragraph
"In economics, rationalization is defined",Paragraph
as the act of bringing order to ad hoc,Paragraph
workflows by defining appropriate rules,Paragraph
or processes. It is thus not surprising that,Paragraph
Netherlands,Title
"15.25 Observatoire de Paris, France",Caption
rationalization is linked to the so-called Age,Paragraph
"of Reason, for the scientific work of early",Paragraph
scientists and philosophers of this age was,Paragraph
also the search for the underlying processes,Paragraph
and rules that defined the apparent ad hoc,Paragraph
phenomenon of the world. Galileo and Tycho,Caption
Brache were both looking for mathematical,Paragraph
explanations for the movements of planets.,Paragraph
"Both knew René Descartes (1596-1650),",Paragraph
"the French-Dutch philosopher, with his",Paragraph
"famous declaration of the primacy of reason,",Paragraph
"“cogito, ergo sum"" (""| think, therefore |",Paragraph
"am”). Condemned by the Catholic Church,",Paragraph
"which purported to rule by God's design,",Paragraph
the rationalist world was conceived in the,Paragraph
crucible of the colonial experience. One saw,Paragraph

construction of the Observatoire de Paris,Caption

emphasized the undecorated aspects of,Paragraph
"antiquity, resisting the temptation, prevalent",Paragraph
"at his time, to dwell on ornamentation and",Paragraph
decoration. A particularly heated debate,Paragraph
revolved around the question of whether,Paragraph
the perception of beauty was a result of,Paragraph
custom or a spontaneous response. Perrault,Paragraph
"15.26 Courtyard, Hétel des Invalides, Paris",Caption
argued that beauty was not a fixed property,Paragraph
to be revealed by the artist but a variable,Paragraph
"depending on custom, pointing out, for",Paragraph
"example, that one can find neither two",Paragraph
buildings—nor two authors—that agree on all,Paragraph
subject or always follow the sare rules.,Paragraph
The Observatoire was quite austere by,Paragraph
the standards of the day. There were no,Paragraph
"orders, no columns, and no pilasters. Simple",Paragraph
string courses demarcating the stories and,Paragraph
openings are either slightly recessed from,Paragraph
the smooth wall surface or surrounded by,Paragraph
barely projecting moldings. Each side of,Paragraph
the octagonal corner towers was aligned,Paragraph
with the sun's position at solstices and,Paragraph
"equinoxes, and the eastern one was unroofed",Paragraph
for the use of a telescope within. The,Paragraph
building was put together with the greatest,Paragraph
"skill, and the staircase, with its complex",Paragraph
three-dimensional curving surfaces—all in,Paragraph
stone—still astonishes today. The roof was,Paragraph
used as a platform from which astronomical,Paragraph
measurements could be made. A hole in the,Paragraph
center of the floors of the main chambers,Caption
allowed the sun’s zenith to be calculated.,Paragraph
Hétel des Invalides,Title
Hospitals had first appeared in Europe,Paragraph
as a by-product of pilgrimages and of the,Paragraph
Crusades. There were several important,Paragraph
hospitals in Italy. The Knights of St. John,Caption
were well known for their hospitals on,Paragraph
"Rhodes and elsewhere. By the 18th century,",Paragraph
"however, hospitals were flooded not only",Paragraph
with the thousands of soldiers who fought in,Paragraph
"the alrnost endless cycle of battles, but also",Paragraph
"by the poor and the indigent, who formed",Paragraph
an increasingly large lower class. Plagues,Paragraph
and epidemics added to the problem. In,Paragraph
"Paris, a cholera epidemic in 1519 and the",Paragraph
"plagues of 1580, 1596, 1606, and 1630",Title
struck down thousands. But because,Paragraph
hospitals remained associated with religious,Paragraph
"orders and charitable institutions, there",Paragraph
was practically no distinction between a,Paragraph
"hospital, a pesthouse, and a poorhouse.",Paragraph
Conditions were so terrible that the sick were,Paragraph
often unwilling to leave their houses for a,Paragraph
"hospital, concerned that while they were",Paragraph
"sequestered, their property would be pillaged",Paragraph
or their income threatened. To combat these,Paragraph
"conditions, Henry IV decreed the construction",Paragraph
of the Hépital St.-Louis (begun 1607). It was,Paragraph
outside the city walls and easily accessible,Paragraph
from major roads. The wards consisted of,Paragraph
"wide, open corridors with patients’ beds",Paragraph
placed against the walls. Four of these,Paragraph
corridor buildings were linked to form a large,Paragraph
courtyard.,Paragraph
At the end of the Thirty Years’ War in,Paragraph
"1648, much of Europe was flooded with",Paragraph
"former soldiers, many of whom had lived",Paragraph
their entire adult lives in the military and,Paragraph
"had difficulty adjusting to civilian life,",Paragraph
suffering from a form of PTSD. The Hotel,Paragraph
des Invalides (1671-76) aimed to address,Paragraph
this problem in that it served as a military,Paragraph
retirement dormitory. Behind its moat and,Paragraph
"expansive entrance lies a large court, while",Paragraph
ranges of buildings to the right and left are,Paragraph
grouped around smaller courts. The north,Paragraph
0 50m,Title
15.27 Plan: Hotel des Invalides,Caption
facade is articulated in typical French fashion,Paragraph
by central and end pavilions that project,Paragraph
"forward. Apart from the entrance porches,",Paragraph
there are no columns or pilasters on the main,Caption
facade. The court has two stories of arches,Paragraph
on piers relieved only by the pedimented,Caption
pavilions at the center along the axis. There,Paragraph
were special areas for sick and wounded,Paragraph
"soldiers, for pauper soldiers, and a barracks",Paragraph
for older veterans. There were surgery areas,Paragraph
"and large mess halls where soldiers ate, with",Paragraph
their officers at the head table.,Paragraph
"Hospitals in England, built from public",Paragraph
"funds, tended to be simpler and less",Paragraph
generous by comparison. There was,Paragraph
considerable ambivalence among the English,Paragraph
upper classes and Tories about spending,Title
money in a way that many thought would,Paragraph
seem to reward poverty. Chelsea Hospital,Caption
"(begun 1682) shows, however, the first",Paragraph
awareness of French innovation regarding,Title
the problems of former soldiers. Designed,Paragraph
"yy Sir Christopher Wren, the cells were",Paragraph
"placed in ranges, back to back. At the end",Paragraph
"of the range, a larger room was set out",Paragraph
for the sergeants. Instead of an enclosed,Paragraph
"quadrangle, the wards faced each other",Paragraph
across a courtyard open to the Thames,Caption

wards at the far end. The hospital's governor,Paragraph
and lieutenant governor lived in detached,Paragraph

Neumann was an officer in the engineering,Paragraph

skills. He used wall piers or short sections,Paragraph

"The Jesuits, with their emphasis on",Paragraph
"education, were at the forefront of bridging",Paragraph
"the Chinese and European worlds. In 1601,",Paragraph
the Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci (1552-1610),Title
arrived in Beijing and established a Catholic,Paragraph
mission. For the next two centuries the,Paragraph
"Jesuits, as well as members of other Catholic",Paragraph
"orders, built close links to the Qing court",Paragraph
"while converting approximately 250,000",Paragraph
Chinese to Christianity. Because of their,Paragraph
strong interest in education and their own,Paragraph
"high levels of education, many Jesuits",Paragraph
became trusted members of the Qing court,Paragraph
"and were given important positions, such as",Paragraph
control of the Board of Astronomy.,Paragraph
These Europeans wrote home detailed,Paragraph
"accounts of what they saw, which were",Paragraph
"published as books, usually in French or",Paragraph
"Latin, in Paris, the European center of",Paragraph
"Jesuit activities. These included Confucius,",Paragraph
the Philosopher of the Chinese (1687);,Paragraph
"Description of China (1735), in 4 volumes;",Caption
"the long series Fdifying and Curious Letters,",Paragraph
in 34 volumes (1702-76); General History,Paragraph
"of China, in 13 volumes (1777-85); and",Paragraph
"Memoirs on the History, Sciences, Arts, etc.,",Paragraph
"of the Chinese, in 16 volumes (1776-1814).",Paragraph
The Chinese political system was studied,Paragraph
"and cited by many European thinkers,",Paragraph
"such as Voltaire (1694-1778), Francis",Paragraph
"Quesnay (1694-1774), and Gottfried Leibniz",Paragraph
"(1646-1716), at a time when Europeans",Paragraph
were beginning to develop alternatives,Paragraph
to monarchic and church procedures in,Paragraph
their own political systerns. The German,Paragraph
"philosopher Leibniz, who was considered",Paragraph
"an “expert” on things Chinese, argued that",Paragraph
a truly universal new civilization could be,Paragraph
achieved by merging the best elements,Paragraph
in Chinese and Western culture. He,Paragraph
published this argument in a little book of,Paragraph
"1697, Novissima Sinica (Latest News from",Caption
China). Of particular interest to European,Paragraph
philosophers was the concept of the,Paragraph
mandate—the idea that the emperor ruled,Title
"only by divine mandate, and that when things",Paragraph
"went wrong, it was a signal that the mandate",Paragraph
had been revoked. As Derk Bodde has,Paragraph
"argued, the European Enlightenment thinkers",Paragraph
particularly admired China as a land where,Paragraph
governmental power was negotiated not,Paragraph
"through the traditions of a feudal aristocracy,",Paragraph
"as in Europe, but by the mandarins, a group",Paragraph
"of highly educated scholars, who gained their",Paragraph
official positions only after proving their worth,Paragraph
by passing a series of state-administered,Paragraph
examinations. It became their aim to create,Paragraph
an “enlightened despotism” that would rule,Paragraph
"for the benefit of the people as a whole,",Paragraph
"rather than merely for a small, privileged",Paragraph
"group. They argued this concept, particularly",Paragraph
in the work of the economists known as the,Paragraph
"Physiocrats, whose leader, Francis Quesnay,",Paragraph
wrote The Despotism of China (1767) as an,Paragraph
example of a truly enlightened despotism.,Paragraph
Quesnay influenced the ideas of Adarn Smith,Paragraph
"(1723-90), the seminal thinker of modern",Paragraph
economics.,Paragraph
The most famous of the Enlightenment,Title
thinkers to learn from Qing China was,Title
"Voltaire, for whom China was the one country",Paragraph
where the ruler was also a philosopher,Paragraph
(Plato’s “philosopher-king”). He was,Paragraph
impressed by the idea that the Chinese were,Paragraph
not forcing their own religious ideas upon,Paragraph
other people. “One need not be obsessed,Paragraph
"with the merits of the Chinese,” he wrote in",Paragraph
"1764, “to recognize ... that their empire is in",Paragraph
truth the best that the world has ever seen.”,Paragraph
"In 1755, Voltaire wrote the play The Chinese",Paragraph
"Orphan, adapted from an old Chinese play,",Paragraph
as a rebuttal to Rousseau's (1712-78) “back-,Paragraph
"to-nature” theories that decried history, the",Paragraph
"arts, and other cultural constructs on the",Paragraph
grounds that they corrupted the natural,Paragraph
"goodness of human nature. By contrast,",Paragraph

invading Mongols.,Paragraph

Of particular importance amongst the,Paragraph
administrative buildings distributed around,Title
"the Forbidden City was the Gongyuan, or the",Paragraph

for entering the imperial bureaucracy were,Paragraph
held. Admittance to the Mandarin cadres,Paragraph
required three levels of examinations: first,Paragraph
"in local counties, second in the provincial",Paragraph
"capitals, and the final in the national capital,",Paragraph
held only once every three years. Those who,Paragraph
passed this final weeklong exam earned the,Paragraph
title jinshi (known in English as Mandarin).,Paragraph
"The Gongyuan was a huge walled enclosure,",Paragraph
inside of which were thousands of small brick,Paragraph
cells laid out in straight rows. This eliminated,Paragraph
"cheating. Still, candidates were searched,",Paragraph
"carefully supervised, and not permitted to",Paragraph
leave until the exam ended. The exams,Paragraph
demanded high standards of literary style and,Paragraph
"calligraphy, as well as detailed knowledge of",Paragraph
the Chinese classics.,Paragraph
"From the Gongyuan, the lucky few who",Paragraph
passed were allowed into the Forbidden,Paragraph
"City, where they participated in a daylong",Paragraph
"exam in the first of the great halls, which",Paragraph
was attended by a large assembly of civil,Paragraph
and military officials in full regalia. Of these,Paragraph
"examinees, the top three finalists were",Paragraph
presented directly to the emperor and allowed,Paragraph
"to exit from the central gate first, followed",Paragraph
by all the others who had passed the tests.,Paragraph
"The jinshi, who might have started out as a",Paragraph
"peasant's son, was quickly were incorporated",Paragraph

Enlightenment thinkers were looking for more,Paragraph
"egalitarian, merit-based models to replace",Paragraph
"the orders of the Church and the court, they",Paragraph
turned to the Chinese jinshi system. The idea,Paragraph
of a civil service that would be selected via,Paragraph
competitive exams open to anyone derived,Title
from studies of this Chinese bureaucracy.,Paragraph
The first written civil service exams were,Paragraph
held in European universities in 1702. The,Paragraph
"French established their civil service in 1791,",Paragraph
after the French Revolution. The British,Paragraph
"established their civil service exams in 1806,",Paragraph
initially only for recruitment to the British East,Paragraph
India Company. The United States began,Paragraph
to require exams for some administrative,Paragraph
positions after 1885. Contemporary licensing,Paragraph

"Zhu Yijun (known as the Wanli Emperor, r.",Paragraph

"tender age of nine, proved to be disastrous,",Paragraph
as he was incapable of dealing with the vast,Paragraph

inevitable; power brokers and local lords,Title
used the opportunity to carve out competitive,Paragraph

became increasingly reclusive. Lawlessness,Paragraph
"increased, and Japanese and even Chinese",Paragraph
pirates frequently raided coastal towns. At,Paragraph

was arriving from the Americas by coastal,Paragraph
"routes. Indeed, the Chinese demand for silver",Paragraph
was at the core of the growth of mining in,Paragraph

took on the Mongol title “khan.” Although,Paragraph
only a million strong in a kingdom of 250,Paragraph
"million native Chinese, the Manchu proved",Paragraph
"equal to the task of governance, and",Paragraph
quickly established stability. One of their,Paragraph
first acts was to establish a strong regulatory,Paragraph
framework for coastal trade. With that in,Paragraph
"place, they moved to establish internal order.",Paragraph
The core of Manchu administrative policy,Title
was to simultaneously adopt established,Paragraph
Confucian and Ming courtly practices,Title
while accommodating regional differences.,Paragraph
They maintained a strong grip on central,Paragraph
"administrative control, but like the Mongols",Paragraph
"and the Yuan before them, they tolerated",Paragraph
multiple religious and cultural practices. They,Paragraph
"settled into the Ming capitals, built similar",Paragraph
"tombs, restored and expanded the palaces",Paragraph
"and administrative wings, and, in Beijing,",Paragraph
"undertook a reorganization of the inhabitants,",Paragraph
pushing the old Han Chinese to the south,Title
to make room for their own bannermen.,Paragraph
The Qing also built scores of new towns and,Paragraph
administrative centers around the Middle,Title
"Kingdom, making sure to distribute their own",Paragraph
clansmen in these areas. The Dalai Lama was,Paragraph
"invited back, and stupas were built to mark",Paragraph
his visit.,Paragraph
The Qing had a strong appetite for,Paragraph
"silver, which they used to mint currency.",Paragraph
"For geographical reasons, China was poor",Paragraph
"in minerals. They had some gold, very little",Paragraph
"silver, and some copper. And yet at the same",Paragraph
time they had a vibrant economy that was,Paragraph
very commercial in that it relied on active,Paragraph
exchange of goods. Centuries before anyone,Paragraph
"else, during the Song period, the old Chinese",Paragraph
solution had been to print money. Printed,Paragraph
currency worked very well until the Yuan,Paragraph
and particularly the Ming did what many,Paragraph
governments in trouble do—they overprinted,Paragraph
"their currency, which resulted in loss of",Paragraph
public confidence in the printed currency.,Paragraph
The Qing solution to this was to mint,Paragraph
currency in silver. After they exhausted the,Paragraph
"silver supply in Japan, South America’s silver",Title
became the main source. It was transported,Paragraph
to China on European vessels. Between 1500,Paragraph
"and 1800, South America produced about 85",Paragraph
percent of the world’s silver; about 40 percent,Paragraph
of it went straight to China.,Paragraph
The Qing also embarked on a remarkably,Paragraph
successful military campaign that resulted,Title
in the largest territorial expansion the Middle,Paragraph
Kingdom had ever seen. The island of Taiwan,Paragraph
"(1683), Inner and Outer Mongolia (1697),",Paragraph
"Dzungharia (1757), and East Turkestan",Paragraph
"(1759), besides their own Manchurian",Paragraph
"homeland, became territories. Korea was",Paragraph
"made a vassal state in 1637, and Tibet a",Paragraph
protectorate in 1751. Part of this aggressive,Paragraph
expansion involved the genocide of the,Paragraph
"Dzungharia tribes, about 600,000 strong;",Paragraph
80 percent were killed on orders by Qing,Paragraph
"and Mongolian soldiers, and more by a",Paragraph
subsequent outbreak of smallpox.,Paragraph
To accommodate the vast diversity that,Paragraph
"the Middle Kingdom now incorporated, the",Paragraph
"Qing, particularly in the sixty-one-year rule of",Paragraph
the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735-96) developed,Paragraph
"a pan-Asian conception of empire, a model of",Paragraph
unity in diversity similar to that developed by,Paragraph
the English after they became a major world,Paragraph
"power. Confucians, Buddhists, Muslims, and",Paragraph
even Christian visitors were accepted and,Paragraph
"accommodated, and at the same time kept",Paragraph
in check and abeyance. All decrees were,Paragraph
issued in multiple languages. Underlying,Paragraph
it all was deep investment in Tibetan,Paragraph
"Buddhist ideology, with its long history of",Paragraph
accommodating multiple Asian peoples and,Paragraph
histories. The Qianlong Emperor thought of,Paragraph
"himself as a chakravartin, the Buddhist ideal",Paragraph
of royalty based on the canonical memory of,Paragraph
Emperor Asoka.,Paragraph
The 268-year reign of the Qing was,Paragraph
dominated by the sixty-year rule each,Paragraph

"(r. 1662-1722) and his grandson, the",Paragraph

China. The Dutch and Portuguese also,Paragraph
"established trading ports in Japan, although",Paragraph
the Chinese ships were given priority since,Paragraph

was blamed for the instability that imperiled,Paragraph
Ming China. The shoguns' vision of Japanese,Paragraph

hostile to the laissez-faire ambitions of,Paragraph

by tightening the strictures of the Bakufu,Paragraph

"Like the Qing, who had to both align",Paragraph
themselves with and distinguish themselves,Paragraph

"that cut through the old blocks, just as",Paragraph
Hausmann would later do in 19th-century,Paragraph
"Paris. This opened up new street frontage,",Paragraph

the borders of the city by building an earthen,Paragraph

The members of the warrior class were,Paragraph
"15.52 Plan: Sumiya, Kyoto, Japan",Caption
made to settle right next to the Nijo Castle,Paragraph

just north of the castle. The members of the,Paragraph
aristocracy were relocated to the peripheries,Paragraph
of the imperial palace. Special quarters for,Paragraph
the lowest classes—the ea (“the stained”),Title
"and the finin (“the nonhumans"" )—were",Paragraph
designated at the margins of the city.,Paragraph
yoto's prostitutes were a constant threat,Paragraph
"to the Bakufu code, since they conducted",Paragraph
their business in the mixed public space,Paragraph
of the street. In 1640 they were confined,Paragraph
to a single area that came to be called the,Paragraph
Shimabara. Located in the southwest corner,Paragraph
"of the city far from its core, it was enclosed",Paragraph
"with its own wall complete with a moat, the",Paragraph
purpose of which was not to prevent anybody,Paragraph
from coming in but to keep the prostitutes,Paragraph
from leaving. A single gate on the east side,Caption
controlled all movement in and out. With the,Paragraph
"merchants, warriors, and aristocrats sharing",Title
"the same space and the same prostitutes,",Paragraph
the Shimabara quickly became a place of,Paragraph
sanctioned transgression. The more exclusive,Paragraph

"(“pleasure houses"") catered to clients",Paragraph
"with high tastes. Accordingly, these places",Paragraph
adopted architectural forms and decorations,Title
normally prohibited to those of lower-class,Paragraph
status that were here appropriate to the high,Paragraph
status of the clientele. This double standard,Paragraph
was managed by making the exterior simple,Paragraph
but creating individual spaces in the interior,Paragraph
that were modeled on the residences of,Paragraph
"15.53 Sumiya, Kyoto",Caption

"that ensured no one could look in, but that",Paragraph
the guests could see out. They were also,Paragraph
"removable, so that when street entertainers",Paragraph
came calling or during festivals when the,Paragraph

In the interior are a range of styles taken,Paragraph

Anglicanism placed considerable emphasis,Paragraph
on the dignity of the service as prescribed,Title
"in the Book of Common Prayer, but unlike",Paragraph
"Italian Counter-Reformation churches, which",Paragraph
"emphasized the spectacle of devotion, Wren’s",Paragraph
churches possess some of the simplicity,Paragraph

The most imaginative of the English architects,Paragraph
of the early 18th century was undoubtedly,Paragraph
"Nicholas Hawksmoor (1661-1736), Wren's",Paragraph
apprentice. Wren shared with his apprentice,Paragraph
an interest in the architecture of Asia Minor,Paragraph

of Greece and Egypt. But if Wren had an,Paragraph
"eye for compositional unity, Hawksmoor",Caption
aimed to bring the elements of architectural,Paragraph
composition into dynamic interrelationship.,Paragraph
He pried features out of their expected,Paragraph
contexts.,Paragraph
The strangeness of Hawksmoor’s,Title
buildings is a result of a design process,Paragraph
that emphasized esoteric historical and,Paragraph
"philosophical meanings. In that sense,",Paragraph
Hawksmoor spoke to a generation of,Paragraph
designers that attempted to distance itself,Title
from amateur architects and questioned,Title
the normative production of aesthetic ideals,Title
as public spectacle. His St. Mary Woolnoth,Paragraph
(1716-24) is an astonishing building when,Paragraph
compared with the stiff linearity of the English,Paragraph
Palladian style that was starting to make its,Paragraph
presence felt. The double-tower front facade,Paragraph
appears to be two buildings stacked on top,Paragraph

It would be wrong to read Hawksmoor’s,Paragraph
"architecture as simply playful or baroque,",Paragraph
however. He was not just playing with formal,Paragraph
composition but also citing less well-known,Paragraph
references from antiquity. Not adhering,Paragraph
to the limited Palladian interpretation of,Paragraph
"the antique, Hawksmoor studied buildings",Paragraph
such as the Roman tomb of the Julii at St.-,Paragraph
"Rémy, France. The two columns flanking",Caption
the entrance are esoteric references to the,Paragraph

of the day were also interested in the Second,Paragraph
Temple of Solomon as a way to reconnect,Title

early Christianity. The upper portico was a,Paragraph
"reference to the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus,",Paragraph
one of the seven ancient wonders of the,Paragraph
"world, which had been destroyed but for",Paragraph
which Hawksmoor made a sketch based on,Paragraph
descriptions by Pliny and Vitruvius. In this,Paragraph

WHIGS AND THE PALLADIAN REVIVAL,Title
"By the early 18th century, the older",Paragraph
puritanical interests of England had been,Paragraph

a policy of aggressive mercantile capitalism,Title
focused on protecting British interests in,Paragraph

"and anti-slavery policies, and a strong",Paragraph
anti-Tory push for constitutional monarchy.,Paragraph
"Continuing the Whigs’ puritanical leaning,",Paragraph
the Georgian architecture of this time was,Paragraph
overtly simple and understated. Walls were,Paragraph
"usually of unadorned brick, and windows and",Paragraph
doorways were framed in wood painted white.,Paragraph
Facades were symmetrically arranged around,Paragraph
"the ground-level entrance or, on occasion,",Paragraph
accessed by a short flight of steps. Grander,Caption
"houses might have a portico, pilasters, or",Paragraph
corner quoins.,Paragraph
The Georgian style was England's,Paragraph
first truly national style; it was unique to,Paragraph
England and its colonies and arose out of,Paragraph
the Protestant ethic of nondemonstrative,Title
"simplicity. Functional and serviceable, it was",Paragraph
adopted by the newly emerging mercantile,Paragraph

had to be unified into a formal whole. Yet,Paragraph
"despite this penchant for abstraction, the",Paragraph

choice for cornmissions. The most important,Paragraph
of his buildings was his own Chiswick House,Paragraph
"(1723-29), which was not actually a house",Paragraph

entertain friends. Its basic model is that of,Paragraph

INTRODUCTION,Title
The start of the 19th century was a watershed,Paragraph
"moment in the advent of modernity. In 1800,",Paragraph
the world’s wealth was about the same it had,Paragraph
been a millennium before; China's wealth,Paragraph
was greater than that of the entire Western,Paragraph
world; and less than 2 percent of the world’s,Paragraph
"population lived in cities. Today, a little over",Paragraph
"two centuries later, the world's wealth has",Paragraph
increased more than sixteenfold; the West's,Paragraph
share of that wealth is almost 75 percent; and,Paragraph
about 50 percent of the world’s population,Paragraph
lives in cities.,Paragraph
Momentous events around 1800,Title
unleashed this radical transformation. The,Paragraph
"European Enlightenment, particularly its",Paragraph
"emphasis on nature, science, reason, and",Title
"egalitarianism, circulated in the colonial",Paragraph
world and eventually captured the global,Paragraph
imagination. Two major social revolutions—,Paragraph
the American and the French—translated,Title
"the Enlightenment into political form, creating",Paragraph
"new democracies that charted the path,",Paragraph
"however circuitous and fitful, that led to the",Paragraph
"decline of the monarchic institution, which",Paragraph
was replaced by that of the nation-state.,Paragraph
"And at the center of it all, the Industrial",Paragraph
"Revolution, particularly the invention of the",Paragraph
"cotton gin, transformed a global mercantile",Paragraph
economy into a mass-manufacturing,Title
"industrial economy, which made consumer",Paragraph
goods the new focus of the global economic,Title
system. One of its lesser consequences was,Paragraph
"a global building boom, and with it the steady",Paragraph
emergence of a new sensibility regarding the,Paragraph
purposes and forms of architecture.,Paragraph
But that was still in the future; in its time,Paragraph
this entire transformation was more gradual,Paragraph
and fraught with contradictions. Europe was,Paragraph
still oriented primarily toward accumulating,Paragraph
wealth from far-flung global territories; its own,Paragraph
"historical identity was as yet episodic, and its",Paragraph
sense of manifest destiny only just beginning,Title
"to emerge. Thus the call for egalitarianism,",Paragraph
"for instance, cohabited with the defense of",Paragraph
slavery and colonization: Jefferson’s home,Title
in Virginia was both a model of Neoclassical,Paragraph
utopianism and a site of slavery. As a,Paragraph

"the French (1791-1804) was first, and far",Paragraph
ahead of its time. When Napoleon invaded,Paragraph
"Spain and Portugal in 1808, their Latin",Paragraph

to give the Latin American independence,Title
movement some momentum. The Portuguese,Paragraph
monarchy relocated to Brazil during,Title
Portugal's occupation by Napoleon. After the,Paragraph

"remained in Brazil, declared independence",Paragraph
"successfully in 1822. In general, however,",Paragraph
the Latin American transition to nation-states,Title
"was tumultuous, and it would take almost half",Paragraph
a century before a series of long civil wars,Title
settled down enough to permit the creation,Paragraph
of stable administrations. For two decades,Paragraph
these erstwhile colonies tried unsuccessfully,Paragraph
to fashion a united federation. Eventually they,Paragraph
settled on the separate nations of today's,Paragraph
South America.,Paragraph
When the U.S. Declaration of,Paragraph
"Independence and Constitution were written,",Paragraph
"their authors, with all their idealism, likely",Paragraph
believed slavery was on the decline and,Paragraph
would to die a natural death. Tobacco fields,Paragraph
"were exhausted from overuse, slave revolts",Paragraph
"were endemic, and financing for plantation",Paragraph
expansions was becoming increasingly,Paragraph
scarce. Not wanting to confront the Southern,Paragraph
states that produced a majority share of,Paragraph
the plantation wealth of the newly minted,Paragraph
"United States, the Founding Fathers left the",Paragraph
"topic of slavery untouched, at the mercy of",Paragraph
the forces of history. And as history would,Paragraph
"have it, the Industrial Revolution—which",Paragraph
"itself had to rely on water, coal, and steam",Paragraph
for power—revitalized the economic value of,Paragraph
slavery like never before. As the demand for,Paragraph
"raw cotton skyrocketed, the slave plantations",Title
of the American South prospered—even as,Paragraph
the earliest industrial manufacturing towns of,Paragraph
"England, such as Manchester and Liverpool,",Paragraph
created a new industrial working-class culture,Paragraph
"that pointed to the end of rural, agricultural",Paragraph
civilization. With industrialization came,Paragraph
"industrial infrastructure—factories, ports,",Title
"warehouses, and shipyards, all built at the",Paragraph
"speed and size of utility, using the materials",Paragraph
closest at hand—as well as the first public,Paragraph
institutions designed to deal with urban,Title
"citizenship: hospitals, prisons, and lunatic",Title
asylums.,Paragraph
In the midst of this fundamental,Paragraph
"transformation in thought, political ordering,",Paragraph
"and economic production, the European",Title
powers also commenced a colonial expansion,Paragraph
project of a kind that had never been seen,Paragraph
before. England led the way. The “loss”,Paragraph
of America to independence meant first,Title
and foremost that British traders no longer,Paragraph
enjoyed monopolistic rights and had to pay,Paragraph
market price for American products. While,Paragraph
"this was still quite a viable proposition, the",Paragraph
English government decided on a policy of,Paragraph
aggressive expansion in the Old World to,Paragraph
offset the American losses. Unlike the first,Paragraph
"period of colonization, when the Western",Paragraph
European powers were looking for alternatives,Paragraph
to the Ottoman and northern Italian,Title
"stranglehold on the spice trade; now, in the",Paragraph
"late 18th century, the European powers were",Paragraph
"on the ascendant, flush with wealth from the",Paragraph
plantation trade in the American colonies and,Title
powered by the Industrial Revolution. British,Paragraph
warships in particular sailed the deep oceans,Paragraph
largely unchallenged.,Paragraph
The big colonial story of the tirne was,Paragraph
the unexpected ease with which the English,Paragraph
were able to take over most of the Indian,Paragraph
"subcontinent in just a few decades, after two",Paragraph
centuries of trying and succeeding only in,Paragraph
building coastal ports. As the Mughal Empire,Paragraph
"declined, the officers of the British East India",Paragraph
Company became increasingly bold and,Paragraph
began to find spectacular success in their,Paragraph
confrontations with local rulers. All this took,Paragraph
place precisely when the main cadres of the,Paragraph
British forces were being repeatedly defeated,Paragraph
by George Washington’s revolutionary,Title
"forces, with some help from the French. The",Paragraph
contrasting performances of the two armies,Paragraph
"possessed the British public imagination,",Paragraph
and the British government decided to,Paragraph
develop India as the counter-colony to the,Paragraph
United States. In 1773 the Crown appointed,Paragraph
the first official governor general of India to,Paragraph
oversee the operations of the private British,Paragraph
"East India Company, and with that began",Paragraph
"the so-called Raj, the British effort to bring",Paragraph
the best of the Enlightenment to India while,Paragraph
pursuing an aggressive mercantile policy to,Paragraph
feed the British mill and trade objectives.,Paragraph
"Calcutta (now Kolkata), once a swamp, was",Paragraph
transformed by the newfound wealth of the,Paragraph
British East India Company into a massive,Title
port city that—if only in its pretentions—tried,Paragraph
to vie with London by building plastered,Paragraph
colonial governmental structures and,Title
mansions.,Paragraph
"Meanwhile, East Asia, particularly China,",Paragraph
continued to advance economically. China,Paragraph
under the Qing dynasty extended its borders,Paragraph
"the old-fashioned way, conquering Tibet,",Paragraph
"urkestan, and Mongolia. In size, population,",Paragraph
"production, and raw wealth, it had no equal.",Paragraph

relocation of over 5 million Chinese peasants,Title
to Sichuan Province. The Chinese peasant,Paragraph
was technologically advanced for his time,Paragraph

land as the stereotypical provincial Western,Title
farmer. Later in the century China would,Paragraph
come to be viewed stereotypically in the West,Paragraph
"as tradition-bound and moribund, but in",Paragraph
1800 China was still the object of global envy.,Paragraph
"Apart from China, Europe, and the",Paragraph

"Whereas in England, Neoclassicism was",Paragraph
generally seen as the proper environment,Paragraph

antimonarchism driven in part by an,Paragraph
emerging interest in rationalism and legalism,Title
and a desire to rethink the role of civic,Title
"institutions. In architectural circles, all this",Paragraph
came into the open with the publication,Paragraph
in 1753 of Marc-Antoine Laugier’s Essai,Paragraph
sur architecture. Translated into English,Caption
"in 1775, it was a flashpoint of discussion",Paragraph
about the nature of architectural production.,Paragraph
Unlike Leon Battista Alberti's 7en Books on,Paragraph
"Architecture, Andrea Palladio’s Four Books",Title
"on Architecture, and Claude Perrault's French",Paragraph
"translation of Vitruvius, Laugier's work pointed",Paragraph
"not to a classical past, but rather to an earlier,",Paragraph
“rustic” past.,Paragraph
Here we have the beginnings of,Paragraph
primitivism in modern art and architecture.,Paragraph
Laugier wrote neither as an architect nor as,Paragraph
a gentleman connoisseur. He was a Jesuit,Paragraph
"priest and impassioned crator, in a clirnate of",Paragraph
"approaching revolt. Unlike previous writers,",Paragraph
Laugier frowned on the use of pilasters,Paragraph
as “fakes” that did not contribute to the,Paragraph
actual solidity of the object. Even though his,Paragraph
image of the ideal building was not based,Paragraph
"on Roman models, Laugier admired the",Paragraph
"Maison Carrée at Nimes, France, as the most",Paragraph
perfect building of antiquity: “Thirty columns,Paragraph
support an entablature and a roof which is,Paragraph
closed at both ends by a pediment—that is,Paragraph
all; the combination is of a simplicity and,Paragraph
a nobility which strikes everybody.” But,Paragraph
"critically for Laugier, unlike Adam and the",Paragraph
"other Neoclassicists, it was not the classical",Paragraph
"temple as such that needed to be imitated,",Paragraph
"but that which lay behind its design, the",Paragraph
"original “rustic hut,” or cabane rustique, as",Paragraph
he called it (widely mistranslated into English,Paragraph
"as “primitive hut""). This hut, according",Paragraph
"to Laugier, consisted only of columns,",Paragraph
"entablatures, and pediments. Vaults, arches,",Caption
"pedestals, and pilasters were not part of that",Paragraph
"system and, he argued, should therefore not",Paragraph
"be used. Even arcades, another important",Paragraph
"element in classical architecture, were listed",Paragraph
by Laugier as “abuses.”,Paragraph
Laugier's book was highly controversial.,Paragraph
He argued that architecture should not be,Paragraph
seen as representing a magical transition,Paragraph
"from the worldly to the heavenly, as had been",Paragraph
"implied by the Baroque style, or a search for",Paragraph
classical truths in the architecture of Greece,Title
"and Rome, but rather as a medium that told",Paragraph
nothing less than the story of the “origins” of,Paragraph
mankind—all mankind. This is why Laugier,Paragraph
is often cited as one of the key precursors,Paragraph
"of the discourses of modern architecture,",Paragraph
still more than a century away. These origins,Paragraph
had to remain embedded in architecture.,Paragraph
They were similar to the notion of grace—a,Paragraph
sign of divine approval that for Catholics is,Paragraph
embedded in the human soul.,Paragraph
"n this sense, Laugier’s argument echoed",Paragraph
the 15th-century debate between Bartolomé,Paragraph
de las Casas and Juan Ginés de Sepulveda in,Paragraph
Madrid on the question of the status of Native,Title
Americans. The Jesuits had studied and,Paragraph
written about the life and work of the Native,Paragraph
Americans and had lived more with ther in,Paragraph
the farthest reaches of the Americas than had,Paragraph
any other colonists. While Walpole collected,Paragraph
objects from around the world to glean in,Paragraph
"them meaning from the world's civilizations,",Paragraph
Laugier's hut sought to bring home to Europe,Paragraph
"what the Jesuits had learned from people,",Paragraph
who in their eyes were not “primitive” as in,Paragraph
"barbarians, but “noble” primitives. It was this,",Paragraph
"the Jesuits argued, that prepared them for",Paragraph
Christ.,Paragraph
Influencing Laugier's writings was the,Paragraph
just-published Discourse sur fes arts et,Title
Jes sciences (1750) by Jean-Jacques,Caption
Rousseau (1712-78). In this astonishing,Paragraph
"book, Rousseau critiqued what he saw as",Paragraph
the naivete of the Enlightenment’s careless,Title
atheism. Not only had reason in the hands,Paragraph
of the more powerful crushed individual,Title
"liberty, but it had also replaced simple",Paragraph
virtues with a labyrinth of false truths. The,Paragraph
arts and sciences did not lead to knowledge,Paragraph
"but to hypocrisy, and civilization led to class",Paragraph
"division, slavery, serfdom, robbery, war, and",Title
"injustice. The only real progress, he argued,",Paragraph
was moral progress. It was a powerful and,Paragraph
controversial critique of everything that the,Title
French intelligentsia had built up over the,Paragraph
"previous century. Rousseau, a native of",Paragraph
"the Calvinist city of Geneva, marveled at",Paragraph
the civilizational and devotional virtues of,Paragraph

that young architects in the Academy of,Paragraph

"to emulate. After the French Revolution, the",Paragraph
"history of Neoclassicism took many turns,",Paragraph
fusing with the Greek Revival in Germany and,Paragraph
Scotland and blending in with the eclectic,Title
stylistic preferences of the Victorians. Despite,Paragraph
"all this, traces of a vigorous and austere",Paragraph
Neoclassicism as pursued by Ledoux and,Paragraph
Boullée could be found throughout Europe,Paragraph
from 1800 onward.,Paragraph
Claude Nicholas Ledoux (1736—,Title
1806) designed a series of gates and,Paragraph
tollhouses for the French crown before the,Title
revolution—forty-five buildings in all—to,Paragraph
mark the boundary of Paris and to impress,Paragraph
approaching visitors. The stations also,Paragraph
served as toll collection places for a much-,Paragraph
hated tax on the importation of salt (which,Paragraph
had become very expensive) into the city.,Paragraph
"Like Christopher Wren’s churches, each of",Paragraph
Ledoux's gatehouses was different from the,Paragraph
next and in its own way varied and forceful.,Paragraph
"A few are still extant, including the Barriére",Paragraph
"de la Villette (1785-89), which provides a",Paragraph
good sense of Ledoux’s austerely simplified,Title
architectural vocabulary. The central drum,Caption
is supported by column pairs that serve,Paragraph
as a screen holding the arcaded bottom,Paragraph
"of a cylinder, which is basically a circular",Paragraph

core. Windows are without moldings and,Paragraph
ornamentation is held to a minimum. The,Paragraph

located in the east of France in the Franche-,Paragraph

sheds. The brine was brought to the site,Paragraph
from its source kilometers away by means.,Paragraph
of wooden pipes. Ledoux's plan called for a,Paragraph
semicircular arrangement of buildings with,Paragraph
the house of the director at the center and,Title
the salt-extracting buildings to both sides.,Paragraph
The circumference is occupied by storage,Paragraph
"buildings, with the main entrance to the",Paragraph
facility in the circle directly opposite the,Paragraph
director’s house. The salt trade was among,Paragraph
the grimmest aspects of life in 18th-century,Paragraph
France; the forcible imposition of a tax gave,Paragraph
"rise to widespread smuggling and robbery,",Paragraph
as salt was very much cheaper outside the,Paragraph
country. The security of the salt works was,Paragraph
therefore essential. The entrance contained,Paragraph
guardrooms and a small prison and is,Paragraph
marked by a dense peristyle of six baseless,Paragraph
"Tuscan columns, with a squat attic above.",Caption
Along the walls are openings out of which,Paragraph
"flows, in a sculptural mass, the thick, saline",Paragraph
"water. The columns, with their alternating",Paragraph
"round and square stones, were quite novel.",Paragraph
"Interpretations vary, but it seems that Ledoux",Paragraph
wanted to show them as if they were in the,Paragraph
process of being formed. This is perhaps,Paragraph
the first architect-designed factory in history;,Paragraph
what Ledoux hoped to demonstrate was the,Paragraph
advantage of a rational and comprehensive,Title
solution to an industrial problem elevated to,Paragraph
the level of the symbolic. Salt was produced,Paragraph
there until 1895.,Paragraph
"More than any other architect, Etienne-Louis",Paragraph
Boullée (1728-99) managed to straddle,Paragraph
these complex political times. He won,Paragraph
widespread acclaim during his lifetime for his,Paragraph
series of inspired drawings that seemed to,Paragraph
envision a postrevolutionary world. Boullée’s,Paragraph
"buildings have simple geometrical shapes,",Paragraph
"are monumental in scale, and often serve",Paragraph
"as backdrops for uncluttered, neo-pagan",Paragraph
devotions. His project for the Bibliotheque,Paragraph

"of 1804, for example, brought about the",Paragraph

lands under his control; it also modernized,Paragraph
the school system.,Paragraph
One of his important contributions to,Paragraph
architecture was in cemeteries. Prior to,Paragraph
"then Napoleon, the well-to-do were buried",Paragraph
in or near a parish church. The poor were,Paragraph
"buried in paupers’ graves. As for soldiers,",Paragraph
"they were easily dispensable figures, often",Paragraph
fighting as conscripts or mercenaries. They,Paragraph
were buried in unmarked graves on the,Paragraph
"battlefield. But in Napoleon's army, death",Paragraph
"in battle took on a new dignity, a notion that",Paragraph
would gain in importance in the Romantic,Paragraph
"period to come. Consequently, military death",Paragraph
achieved an honorable connotation that it,Paragraph
had not had since antiquity. As a result of,Paragraph
"these changes, the cemetery known as",Paragraph
"Pére Lachaise, which was laid out in 1804",Paragraph
"outside of Paris, was open to all citizens.",Paragraph
"Graves, however, were to last for only",Paragraph

"For that reason, post-Napoleonic French",Paragraph
architecture maintained the course of,Paragraph
Enlightenment rationalism. The most,Paragraph

"Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand (1760-1834),",Paragraph
a pupil of Etienne-Louis Boullée and a,Paragraph
professor at the Ecole Polytechnique,Paragraph

for more than a generation. The purpose,Paragraph
of the Ecole Polytechnique was to graduate,Paragraph
engineers capable of meeting the needs of,Paragraph

plans for civilian public works in the remote,Title
corners of the new republic. No such school,Paragraph
"existed in England, where the evolution of",Paragraph
"taste, remaining in the hands of the elite,",Paragraph
was decentralized and thus often eclectic.,Paragraph
"Durand's book Précis, first published in",Paragraph
"1802, became a reference book used",Paragraph
throughout Europe for half a century. In,Paragraph
"it, he rejected the standard Neoclassical",Paragraph
emphasis on historical relationship between,Title
contemporary architecture and classical,Title
"antiquity, and instead argued that even",Paragraph

LEnfant's design calls to mind the,Paragraph
gardens of Versailles because the grand,Title
avenues of the former are like the allées,Paragraph

White House are also connected by one of,Paragraph
several diagonals—Pennsylvania Avenue is,Paragraph
a Baroque device first articulated for Rome,Paragraph
under Sixtus V in his atternpt to link the great,Paragraph
pilgrimage sites of that city. In that sense the,Paragraph
"city blends aspects of Versailles and Rome,",Paragraph
bringing the Counter-Reformation ideal of,Paragraph
the freestanding monumental building into,Paragraph
line with the notion of a city as a landscape,Paragraph
traversed by grand ceremonial approaches.,Paragraph
The siting of both the Capitol and the,Paragraph
White House away fromm the river’s edge,Title

country house prototypes. It might also point,Paragraph
to the Hétel des Invalides (begun 1671) in,Paragraph

NATIONALISM,Title
Nationalism is presently such a ubiquitous,Paragraph
concept that one forgets that it is actually,Paragraph
"a modern concept, springing from the",Paragraph
end of the Napoleonic wars. As important,Paragraph
as Napoleon Bonaparte was in spreading,Paragraph
the ideas of liberty and justice throughout,Title
"Europe, the consequences of decades of",Title
war left Europeans in desperate need of,Paragraph
"stability. In 1813, Europe's diplomats met",Paragraph
in Vienna to discuss the political future of,Paragraph
Europe in the hope that the borders could be,Paragraph
stabilized. The Vienna Congress stipulated,Paragraph
"that countries were to create constitutions,",Paragraph
if they had not already done so—a promise,Paragraph
some rulers broke to create stronger bonds,Paragraph
between the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie.,Paragraph
"Prior to the Vienna Congress, that bond was",Paragraph
achieved mainly through the antiquated,Paragraph
"custom of marriage, which only tended to",Paragraph
splinter and fragment the political landscape.,Paragraph
It was hoped that countries with fixed,Paragraph
national boundaries and with a working legal,Title
infrastructure would avoid war or have the,Paragraph
means and recourse to avoid it. Though the,Paragraph
"ideals proved to be elusive, there is no doubt",Paragraph
that the Vienna Congress helped create the,Paragraph
"modern notion of a nation-state, and it was",Paragraph
certainly successful in determining the future,Paragraph
national boundaries in Europe—boundaries,Title
that drive European politics to this day.,Paragraph
"16.49 Church of the Savior on Blood,",Caption
"St. Petersburg, Russia",Caption
The new spirit of nationalism found an,Paragraph
easy alliance with Romanticism. For the,Paragraph
"nationalists, history was more than just a",Paragraph
gentleman’s pastime. State boundaries had,Paragraph
"to make sense historically, linguistically,",Paragraph
"geographically, and now ethnically, and this",Paragraph
led to an interest in local history and the,Paragraph
development of regional antiquarianism.,Paragraph
Russia experienced a revival of the Russian,Paragraph
"language (until the defeat of Napoleon, the",Paragraph
Russian aristocracy had spoken mainly,Paragraph
"French). In Germany, there was a fascination",Paragraph
with the medieval and with the imagery,Paragraph
"of the forest, as well as with the ancient",Paragraph
"Greeks, with whom many Romantics felt",Paragraph
an affinity. Romantic nationalism also,Paragraph
emerged in Scandinavia as a protest against,Paragraph
Russian occupation and took the form of a,Paragraph
revival of Nordic mythology. Apart from the,Paragraph
"development of national languages, Romantic",Title
nationalists were interested in folklore and,Paragraph
"local customs, even if these had to be",Paragraph
enhanced. A case in point is the “discovery”,Paragraph
"of Beowulf in a single manuscript, first",Paragraph
"transcribed in 1818, after the manuscript",Paragraph
had lain as an ignored curiosity in scholars’,Paragraph
collections for two centuries. Beowulf quickly,Paragraph
came to be seen as an English national epic.,Paragraph
"In architecture, Romantic nationalism was",Paragraph
slower to take hold due to the entrenched,Paragraph
"dominance of Neoclassicism, but as the",Paragraph
"century progressed, more and more examples",Paragraph
"could be found. One such, the Church of",Paragraph
the Savior on Blood in St. Petersburg (1883-,Caption
"1907), was clearly meant to give impetus to a",Paragraph
revival of Byzantine forms.,Paragraph
"In recent decades, with the post-Cold",Paragraph
"War multiplication of new countries,",Title
Romantic nationalism has become a global,Paragraph
phenomenon. Though it heralds the farmer,Paragraph
"and the workers, it often develops into an",Paragraph
aesthetic that appeals to upper-class tastes.,Paragraph
"As a result, Romantic nationalism is generally",Paragraph
a conservative response in the context of,Paragraph
the lower classes and a seemingly liberal,Title
response in the context of the upper classes.,Paragraph
The traits are clearly identifiable: passion for,Paragraph
one's country combined with a feeling—fact-,Paragraph
based or not—of past injustices at the hands,Title
of others. The past that Romantics point to is,Paragraph
often bucolic and pre-modern—a cleaned-up,Paragraph
fiction more than a reality.,Paragraph

"During the 17th century, the electors of",Paragraph

And with the defeat of Napoleon at Leipzig,Title
"in 1813, it became an important European",Paragraph

infatuation with Napoleonic ideas led to a,Paragraph
generation of German thinkers who hoped,Title

"Energetic reformers, including the noted",Paragraph

state by abolishing serfdom and curtailing,Paragraph
"the privileges of the nobility, introducing",Paragraph
agrarian and other social and economic,Title
"reforms, and creating an exernplary systern",Paragraph
of universal education. Among the leading,Paragraph
literary figures in Germany at the tirne were,Paragraph
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832),Title
"and Friedrich von Schiller (1759-1805),",Paragraph
who wanted to link German nationalism to,Paragraph
the ideals of ancient Greece. This gave the,Paragraph
German movement a different tenor than the,Paragraph
"nationalism in France, which emphasized the",Paragraph
idealization of political institutions and social,Title
arrangements.,Paragraph
The person who gave architectural,Title
shape to Romantic neo-Greek ideals was,Paragraph
ie,Title
"16.51 Schauspielhaus, Berlin",Caption
Karl Friedrich Schinkel (1781-1841). He,Paragraph
completed his training as an architect in,Paragraph
"1803 in Rome, where he met Wilhelm von",Paragraph
"Humboldt, with whom he became friends. It",Paragraph
was Humboldt who helped secure Schinkel’s,Paragraph
position in the Prussian bureaucracy; one,Paragraph
of his first public projects was the design,Paragraph
"of the Neue Wache, or New Guardhouse",Paragraph
"(1816-18), a monument to the new citizen's",Caption
"army of Prussia. Until then, the only",Paragraph
significant Neoclassical building in Berlin,Caption
"was the Brandenburg Gate, inspired by the",Paragraph
Athenian Propylaea. The Neue Wache is an,Paragraph
austere building with a Doric porch flanked,Caption
by two tower bases (rather than towers) that,Paragraph
make the building appear to be a temple-,Paragraph
gate combination. The tympanum shows the,Paragraph
Goddess of Victory controlling and deciding,Title
a battle. The interior is a simple square room,Paragraph
without a dome but with a round skylight at,Paragraph
the center.,Paragraph
A few of Schinkel's other prominent works,Paragraph
"included a theater, the Schauspielhaus",Paragraph
(1818-21); the Altes Museum at Berlin,Caption
(1823-30); Schloss Glienicke (completed,Caption
1827); and the Bauakademie (1831-36).,Paragraph
"No other architect in Europe, with perhaps",Paragraph
"the exception of John Nash, wielded so",Paragraph
much influence. Schinkel’s most visible,Paragraph
commission was for a public art museum,Paragraph
(1822-30) sited very prominently opposite,Paragraph
"the Schloss, or Royal Palace, in the very",Paragraph
heart of Berlin. Now called the Altes,Paragraph
"Museum, it embodies Schinkel’s commitment",Paragraph
to monumental civic architecture as a vehicle,Title
of the Enlightenment’s cultural irnperative.,Paragraph
"Though museums were beginning to appear,",Paragraph
most were refurbished palaces; the building,Paragraph
"type, as an institutional element in the",Paragraph
"urban landscape, did not yet exist, as up",Paragraph
until this period art collecting had largely,Paragraph
been an aristocratic privilege. Schinkel,Paragraph
designed the building as a great block with,Paragraph
two interior courtyards,Caption
The surmounting Pant,Title
and a central space.,Paragraph
"eonesque dome,",Title
"clamped into the frame of the building, was",Paragraph

"entering the rotunda, there is a loggia with",Paragraph
large open-air staircases to the right and left,Caption
of the principal axis. Art works were exhibited,Paragraph
in long rectilinear rooms with column pairs,Caption
forming a passage down the middle. This,Paragraph
"was not a temple or sanctuary, but rather",Paragraph
a type of civic warehouse resembling an,Paragraph
"agora, with the central space fitted out with",Paragraph
statues. The gallery spaces were designed,Paragraph
for perambulating and conversing about art,Title
as much as for looking at it. The plan was,Paragraph

COLONIAL CALCUTTA: THE,Title
ESPLANADE,Title
While the Americans were building,Paragraph
"Washington, DC, as their new federal capital,",Paragraph
and while Napoleon's armies were bringing,Paragraph
"France's revolution to the rest of Europe,",Paragraph
the English began their counterproposition,Paragraph
to these movements by beginning the large-,Paragraph
scale construction of what effectively became,Paragraph
their capital in colonial India.,Paragraph
The early days of the English colonists,Title
in India were far from idyllic. Calcutta (now,Paragraph
Kolkata) was awarded to the British by,Paragraph
the Mughals because it sat on one of the,Paragraph
least desirable pieces of land—a marshy,Title
"swampland. Cholera, typhoid, malaria, and",Paragraph
tuberculosis were endemic. Particularly,Paragraph
"feared were the monsoons, when flooding",Paragraph
increased health risks exponentially. But the,Paragraph
deep waters of the river Hooghly enabled,Title
"ocean-faring ships to travel 96 miles inland,",Paragraph
and Calcutta developed into a busy port. By,Paragraph
the 1780s the British East India Company,Title
army had become so large that only military,Paragraph
personnel were allowed to reside within the,Paragraph
"fort, and new public buildings had to be",Paragraph
constructed outside the fort. A huge open,Paragraph
space was created all around the fort to,Paragraph
maintain defensive sightlines. This made the,Paragraph
"avenues lining the edge of the Maidan, as",Paragraph
"the open space was called, into prime sites",Paragraph
for new mercantile and civic establishments.,Paragraph
"As Calcutta grew in prestige and wealth,",Paragraph
"two-, three-, and even four-story mercantile",Paragraph
establishments quickly filled in the avenue’s,Paragraph
"edges, creating a continuous facade around",Paragraph
the Maidan. Very visible and meant to be,Paragraph
"seen, monumental loggia, pilasters, and",Caption
the occasional pedimented portico rubbed,Paragraph
"shoulders with one another, as crisp, white,",Paragraph
Italianate and Neoclassical buildings lined,Paragraph
"up to announce the English presence,",Paragraph
forming what was called the Esplanade.,Paragraph
Little of the Esplanade was made from,Paragraph
"stone, however. Most of it was brick-based",Paragraph
indigenous construction with a generous,Paragraph
coating of painted chunar plaster. The chunar,Caption
looked good and shined in the sun but had,Paragraph
"to be constantly repaired, especially after",Paragraph
"the monsoons, when it often peeled away,",Paragraph
exposing the “sham” of the buildings—,Paragraph
"and by implication, of their nouveau riche",Paragraph
occupants—much to the chagrin and,Paragraph
derision of colonial commentators from the,Paragraph
homeland. (This discourse of pride and,Paragraph
shame as a function of appearance lingered,Title
around colonial architecture to its very end.),Paragraph
Writers’ Building,Title
Faced with huge financial losses with the,Paragraph
"impending American independence, the",Title
English parliament focused its attention on its,Paragraph
"colonies in the East, particularly in India, and",Paragraph
found that in spite of its political successes,Paragraph
"and ample displays of wealth, the British",Paragraph
East India Company was nonetheless badly,Paragraph
"in debt, according to the banking statements",Paragraph
in London. Its officers were accused of,Paragraph
"corruption and profiteering, and in 1773,",Paragraph
the company was reorganized in the hopes,Paragraph
of establishing accountability. A governor,Paragraph
"16.56 View of chunar Calcutta from the Esplanade, ca. 1850",Caption

"16.57 Writer’s Building, as originally built and as reskinned, Calcutta",Caption
general was appointed to ensure that,Paragraph
"besides becoming profitable, the company’s",Paragraph
administration over its territories was just,Paragraph
and in consonance with British ideals. A fair,Paragraph
government in India was necessary not only,Paragraph
to legitimize colonization but to also to soften,Paragraph
protest back in England. Thus was born the,Paragraph
ideological project of colonization.,Paragraph
"Warren Hastings, the first governor",Title
"general of India (1772-85), was a capable",Paragraph
and responsible administrator. He increased,Paragraph
revenues exponentially (mostly from,Paragraph
"opium production, set for export to China),",Paragraph
"expanded territories, and, most importantly,",Paragraph
ruthlessly enforced a strict administration,Paragraph
with detailed accounting. Hastings’s approach,Paragraph
to the problem of “just governance” was,Paragraph
supremely pragmatic. It was imperative that,Paragraph
"the English learn local languages, customs,",Paragraph
"and systems of government, he proposed,",Paragraph
because that would enable them to know,Paragraph
the people better and to govern them with,Paragraph
those systems. In 1784 he created the Asiatic,Paragraph
"Society of Bengal, with William Jones as its",Paragraph
"president, to study and translate the culture.",Paragraph
"For Hastings, Indian culture and civilization",Title
was a real and living thing that he was not,Paragraph
"interested in transforming or reforming, only",Paragraph
dads surf 4 7,Title
in governing—which he was wont to do with,Paragraph
personal discretion and an iron hand.,Paragraph
His signature building was the gigantic,Paragraph
secretariat and training school he had,Paragraph
built for the clerks of the British East India,Caption
Company. Known as the Writer’s House,Paragraph
(1780)—the “writers” were the clerks—this,Paragraph
interminably long three-story structure lines,Caption
one entire length of Calcutta’s water tank.,Paragraph
Given that it was the writers who enabled the,Paragraph

a remarkable essay in rationalization and,Paragraph

architect.,Paragraph
St. John’s Church,Title
"At the turn of the 19th century, English",Paragraph
"colonial policy changed again, this time",Paragraph
influenced by the Enlightenment's critique,Paragraph

Hastings was impeached by Edmund Burke,Title
"(1729-97), who argued that parliamentary",Paragraph
oversight was not enough: there had to be,Paragraph
a social contract attached to the principle of,Paragraph
divine sanction; the purpose of the colonial,Title
administration had to be consonant with,Paragraph
the “eternal laws” of good governance. For,Paragraph
"the Tories, good governance was ensured",Paragraph
by the abiding prestige of the king and his,Paragraph
"aristocracy. Lord Charles Cornwallis, the new",Caption
"governor general (1786-93), in an attempt",Paragraph
"to replicate European aristocracy in India,",Paragraph
created a new class of landowners called,Paragraph
zamindars.,Paragraph
The results were disastrous. In the Mughal,Paragraph
"administration, land had been collectively",Paragraph
"owned at the village level, and zamindars",Paragraph
were only tax collectors. Now that they owned,Paragraph
"the land, they could sell it in response to",Paragraph
market opportunities. The peasantry were,Paragraph
completely disempowered. Enterprising,Paragraph
"company officers exploited the opportunity,",Paragraph
making quick fortunes. Colonial architecture,Paragraph
was called upon to signify the new “eternal,Paragraph
laws.” The Writer’s Building was reskinned,Paragraph
and acquired Doric porticoes. St John's,Caption
Church (1787) built was based on the late,Paragraph
Georgian high steeple of St. Martin-in-the-,Caption
Fields in London. A sirnple box (a three-bay,Caption
nave and galleries) with a Tuscan portico,Paragraph
"and a stone steeple and spire, its symbolic",Paragraph

following the liberation of Greece from Turkish,Title

Klenze (1784-1864) as a hall of fame for,Paragraph

INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION,Title
"By the second decade of the 19th century,",Paragraph
industrialization in England began to have,Paragraph
global implications. A whole new society was,Paragraph
"being created, taking shape in a new type",Paragraph
of city and new types of political and power,Title
relations. Unlike the great metropolises of,Paragraph
"old, factory towns like Manchester, Leeds,",Paragraph
and Liverpool were not urban to begin with.,Paragraph
There was no core of elegance—no great,Paragraph
"boulevards, no parks, churches, palaces,",Paragraph
or cultural institutions. And yet these were,Paragraph
cities competing in size and population with,Paragraph
"the likes of London and Paris. Manchester,",Caption
nicknamed Cottonopolis because of all its,Paragraph
"cotton mills, became the second-largest",Paragraph
city in England after London. The industrial,Paragraph
"city was a novel urban landscape of people,",Paragraph
"traffic, and commerce—with a level of",Paragraph
squalor never witnessed before. There was no,Paragraph
urban planning; there was no sewage system;,Paragraph
and water delivery was haphazard. Typhoid,Paragraph
and tuberculosis outbreaks were common.,Paragraph
"Air pollution from the foul smells of factories,",Paragraph
"sewage, and slaughterhouses was a given. (In",Paragraph
"London, the stench fram the Thames River",Title
was so severe that work in the Parliament,Paragraph
"building, which is located right next to the",Paragraph
"river, was often impossible.) The cramped",Paragraph
conditions of the workers were startling; life,Paragraph
expectancy was twenty-eight years. During,Paragraph
"the Napoleonic wars, the government paid",Paragraph
"little attention to these problems, and even",Paragraph
"after the war, despite growing unrest, the",Paragraph
conservative Tory Party was resistant to,Paragraph
change.,Paragraph
16.68 View of Manchester factories depicted in a painting by William Wylde in 1857,Caption
When the Whig Party gained a majority in the,Paragraph
"830 elections, things began slowly to change.",Paragraph
The Reform Bill of 1832 reapportioned city,Title
istricts to reflect changes in the population;,Paragraph
it also liberalized voting qualifications and,Paragraph
lefined the idea of democracy as we,Paragraph
"understand it today, even though voting rights",Paragraph
"were, for a long time, still reserved for men",Paragraph
only. The Factory Acts of the 1830s reduced,Paragraph
the hours of child labor; the Mines Act of 1842,Title
prohibited underground work for all women,Title
and for boys under the age of ten; and the,Paragraph
en Hours Act of 1847 limited the workday,Paragraph
for women and young people to ten hours.,Paragraph
"Despite these improvements, factory life",Paragraph
remained dire and a major point of contention,Paragraph
and political strife. Efforts were made to control,Paragraph
"sanitation. In the 1860s, Joseph Bazalgette,",Paragraph
chief engineer of the Metropolitan Board,Title
"of Works, designed an extensive series of",Paragraph
underground sewerage pipes to that diverted,Title
waste downstream of the population center.,Paragraph
The modern notion of infrastructure was,Paragraph
"therewith born, and the system was soon",Paragraph
expanded to include electricity and water.,Paragraph
The most important change to the,Paragraph
landscape was the emergence of the factory—,Paragraph
in particular cotton and clothing factories,Title
located near streams used drive waterwheels.,Paragraph
"Established in 1771, Arkwright’s Mill at",Paragraph
Cromford {just south of Matlock Bath) was,Paragraph
the world's first successful large-scale cotton-,Paragraph

who has become known as the father of the,Paragraph

the main buildings had been completed.,Paragraph
"The buildings were uniform in look, mostly",Paragraph
brick or,Title
rectangular blocks of unadorne,Paragraph
stone with wooden floors and usually four to,Paragraph
six floors high. The power from the waterwheel,Caption
was distributed through the building by means,Paragraph
"of a system of shafts, gears, and beltings.",Paragraph
"From the main shaft on each floor, power was",Paragraph
distributed to smaller shafts. Belts from the,Paragraph
shafts drove the individual machines. The,Paragraph
"longer the shaft, the more vulnerable it was to",Paragraph
breakage. The maximum length was about 30,Paragraph
"meters, which limited the overall length of the",Paragraph
mills. The problem of mechanically distributing,Paragraph
power over long distances was solved with the,Paragraph
"introduction of wire rope, introduced around",Paragraph
1850. The developrnent of electrically powered,Caption
machines at the end of the century allowed,Paragraph
"factories to be designed with greater flexibility,",Paragraph
and they no longer had to be placed next to,Paragraph
rivers.,Paragraph
At first these factories provided for local,Paragraph
"markets, but by the 1830s factories were",Paragraph
oriented toward national and international,Title
markets. The early small factories employed,Paragraph
"families, relying often on the labor of children;",Paragraph
larger factories often employed young,Paragraph
"women, usually between the ages of thirteen",Paragraph
and twenty-five. Their lives were highly,Paragraph
"regularized, most living in boardinghouses",Paragraph
that had strict rules of behavior. The scale,Paragraph
of production can be best demonstrated,Paragraph
"by numbers: In 1860, England laid 27,000",Paragraph
"kilometers of new railroad track, compared",Paragraph
"to 16,000 kilometers in France. By 1870,",Paragraph
England controlled one-third of the world’s,Paragraph
overall production. English factories had,Paragraph
"39.5 million cotton spindles in its factories,",Paragraph
compared with just 5 million in France.,Paragraph

a series of expansions cementing its status,Paragraph
"as a global commercial power. By the 1890s,",Paragraph
it had become the second-largest port in,Paragraph
"England, after London. It now became",Paragraph
"England's main slave port. Cotton, tea, rice",Paragraph
"tobacco, sugar, and grain passed through",Paragraph
this port—as did immigrants. Specialized,Paragraph
docks were built to house different types,Paragraph
"of merchandise, from palm oil, cocoa, and",Paragraph
cotton to ivory and timber.,Paragraph
"The Albert Dock (1846) in Liverpool, built of",Paragraph
"cast iron, brick, and stone with no structural",Paragraph
"wood, was the first fireproof warehousing",Paragraph
system in the world. It also had the world’s,Paragraph
first hydraulic warehouse hoist system. Sited,Caption
"around a rectangular basin, the inner side",Paragraph
had a ground-level colonnade of hollow,Paragraph
"cast-iron columns filled with masonry, with",Caption
warehouses on the floors above. Tall windows,Caption
allowed cranes to load and unload from,Paragraph
and to the floors. To make the building fully,Paragraph
"fireproof, the cast-iron columns and beams",Paragraph
supported shallow brick-arched floors. At,Caption
"a cost of £700,000, the Albert Dock was",Paragraph
probably the most expensive structure,Paragraph
in the world of that time. But within two,Paragraph
"decades, the entrance was too small for the",Paragraph
"ships, which had kept getting larger, so it",Paragraph
"16.70 Aerial view: Albert Dock, Liverpool, England",Caption

Panoptic Prisons,Title
As the ideas of the Enlightenment were,Paragraph

"19th century, the definition of criminality",Paragraph
"changed considerably. In the 18th century,",Paragraph
"criminals, the insane, the poor, and the",Title
indigent—all the “unwanteds”—were,Paragraph
thrown together in large halls and corridors.,Paragraph
The Lunatics Tower in Vienna (1784) was,Paragraph
nothing more than a cylindrical fortress.,Paragraph
"Overcrowding, filth, and brutal conditions",Title
made them into exceptionally terrifying,Paragraph
"places. In England around 1819, there were",Paragraph
"220 capital offenses, ranging from murder",Title
to stealing bread. With the Enlightenment,Paragraph
"came the atternpt to refine the law, but it was",Paragraph
not so much the terror of the prisons that,Paragraph
so appalled the early 19th-century moralists,Paragraph
"as the fact that humanity could, in essence,",Paragraph
be placed outside the reach of the moral,Paragraph
life. A connection had to be made between,Paragraph
the reform of the body and mind of the,Title
prisoner and the legitimacy of the state. This,Paragraph
"engendered the first modern jails, such as",Paragraph
the Virginia Penitentiary (1798) by Benjamin,Caption
Latrobe and the Suffolk House of Correction,Title
"in Bury St. Edmunds, England (1803), where",Paragraph
the governor's house was at the prison’s,Paragraph
center to demonstrate the new force of law,Title
that now ostensibly protected the prisoners,Paragraph
from abuse while enforcing its own code of,Paragraph
behavior.,Paragraph
"16.73 Suffolk House of Correction, Bury St. Edmunds, England",Caption
These new prisons were designed with,Paragraph
isolated cells for the inmates grouped along,Paragraph
open corridors of buildings that were like the,Paragraph
"spokes of a wheel, giving rise to the name",Paragraph
panoptic prison. An exemplar of the panoptic,Paragraph
system can be found at the Eastern State,Paragraph
"Penitentiary in Philadelphia (begun 1821),",Paragraph
organized according to a philosophy set out,Paragraph
by the Pennsylvania Quakers that presumed,Paragraph
that isolation would promote monastic self-,Paragraph
reflection. Prisoners lived in a cell and could,Paragraph
go outside into a small private courtyard.,Paragraph
They were allowed out only for infrequent,Paragraph
baths or medical emergencies. Visits were,Paragraph
permitted only from officials. Masks and the,Paragraph
use of numbers rather than names ensured,Title
anonymity if inmates had to be removed,Paragraph
from their cells. Even the sewer pipes were,Paragraph
arranged to prevent communication frorn,Paragraph
wn,Title
"cell to cell. All the while, the prisoner's every",Paragraph
"movement was observed, either through",Paragraph
the corridor or from the towers during,Paragraph
exercises. Prisoners who were able were,Paragraph
"allowed to choose to perfect a few skills,",Paragraph
"such as shoemaking, basket-weaving, and",Paragraph
broom-making; it was thought that these,Paragraph
humble activities would reconnect them,Paragraph
with the principle that service to society,Paragraph
was the primary reason for existence. This,Paragraph
systern was much admired despite the fact,Paragraph
that it soon became obvious that quite a few,Paragraph
"inmates went insane. Its English equivalent,",Paragraph
"the Pentonville Prison in London (1844),",Paragraph
"designed by Jeremy Bentham, had five",Paragraph

AUGUST WELBY PUGIN AND THE,Title
ENGLISH PARLIAMENT BUILDING,Title
It is perhaps not coincidental that the two,Paragraph
most important architectural theoretical works,Title
of the time came not from secularists but,Paragraph
from secularism's—and industrialism’s—,Title
critics: Marc-Antoine Laugier and August,Title
"Welby Pugin (1812-52). Pugin’s father,",Paragraph
"August Charles, Comte de Pugin, fled France",Title
"during the revolution and, as an authority on",Paragraph
"the Gothic style, took up work in the office",Paragraph
"of John Nash, who had to accommodate the",Paragraph
growing demand for Gothic-style architecture,Title
even though he personally found it,Paragraph
troublesome. The younger Pugin was already,Paragraph
saturated in Gothic architecture and had even,Paragraph
converted to Catholicism as the only true,Paragraph
"religion. With little hope for a cornmission,",Paragraph
"he set about writing Contrasts, which he",Paragraph
published in 1836 at his own expense,Paragraph
because no publisher would agree to put,Paragraph
out such an explosive work. The book made,Paragraph
"his reputation, and soon commissions for",Paragraph
"chapels, churches, and even private houses",Paragraph
came his way. “The history of architecture,Paragraph
"is the history of the world,” he wrote, and,",Paragraph
"turning to the work of his own day, he asked",Paragraph
"whether “the architecture of our times, even",Paragraph
"supposing it solid enough to last, handl[s.",Paragraph
down to posterity any certain clue or guide,Title
to the system under which it was erected?,Paragraph
Surely not.... It is a confused jumble of,Paragraph
styles and symbols borrowed from all nations,Title
"and periods.” At stake was not just a style,",Paragraph
"he believed, but the history of civilization.",Paragraph
"Industrialism, greed, and secularism hai",Title
isolated man from his fellow man.,Paragraph
Contrasts set the tone for a critique o,Paragraph
industrialism that focused not on repairing,Paragraph
the inequities that it precipitated by means,Paragraph
"of law and politics, but by proposing a",Paragraph
quasi-utopian alternative—one harkening,Title
"back to the Middle Ages, for Pugin a time",Paragraph
during which a vibrant social conscience had,Paragraph
existed that he felt had since been lost. The,Paragraph
"architect, he argued, should therefore not just",Paragraph
adopt any style the client wanted. That would,Paragraph
be equivalent to encorsing the arbitrariness,Paragraph
of the modern world. Contrasts has a plate,Paragraph
"showing a town as Pugin imagined it in 1440,",Paragraph
and another one showing it again in 1840.,Paragraph
The former portrays a coherent city with,Paragraph
intact walls and a church in the foreground;,Caption
"16.79 A plate redrawn from Pugin’s Contrasts, showing a town in 1440",Caption
"16.80 A plate redrawn from Pugin’s Contrasts, showing the same town illustrated above in 1840",Caption
"the latter shows a cluttered river, a jumble",Paragraph
"of church spires and smokestacks, and",Paragraph
in the foreground a prison; the church,Caption
is still there but now overgrown and,Paragraph
neglected. It was an accusation against,Paragraph
rationalism that remains embedded in,Paragraph
"the image of modernity to this day, easily",Paragraph
retrieved by those who see modern life as,Paragraph
a downward spiral into ethical and moral,Title
decline. Architecture had to be based on,Paragraph
principles (and in this he was the child of,Paragraph
"the Enlightenment), including the use of",Paragraph
local materials in accordance with local,Paragraph
traditions. This was what made “true”,Paragraph
Gothic different from what he saw as the,Paragraph
"shallow Gothic of Horace Walpole or, worse,",Paragraph
the cald rationalism of the Neoclassicists.,Paragraph
"Only Gothic, he argued, could provide the",Paragraph
moral compass that one should expect from,Paragraph
a Christian society.,Paragraph
"Despite Pugin’s conservatism, he should",Paragraph
not be seen as naively antimodern. His,Paragraph
convictions in respect to regional traditions,Title
"and local climate, as well as his belief in",Paragraph
"“honest” construction, were all taken up",Paragraph
by modernists once the Gothic imperative,Paragraph
had played itself out. One of his arguments,Paragraph
against Italianate architecture was that it did,Paragraph
"not suit England. A building, he maintained,",Paragraph
"had to show its various purposes, and this led",Paragraph
to an appreciation for asymmetry and to an,Paragraph
emphasis on articulating the differing parts,Title
"of a building, an argument that modernists",Paragraph
would later take up as well.,Paragraph
It was because of this growing confidence,Paragraph
in the legitimacy of the neo-Gothic as a,Paragraph
"genuinely English format that, after the old",Paragraph
"palace at Westminster burned in 1834, a",Paragraph
parliamentary committee decided to rebuild,Title
"in the Gothic style. Two hundred years earlier,",Paragraph
a similar body had decided to rebuild old St.,Paragraph
Paul’s in the Neoclassical style.,Paragraph
A competition for the commission for the,Title
new Parliament building was announced; it,Paragraph
"was eventually given to Charles Barry, who",Paragraph
worked closely with Pugin. Few can deny the,Paragraph
"brilliance of the plan, with its lucid hierarchies",Paragraph
that differentiate between public and private,Paragraph
areas and the grandeur of the approaches,Title
to the great octagonal hall that separates,Caption
the House of Lords to the north from the,Paragraph
House of Commons to the south. An internal,Caption
"spine, which allows for a special sovereign’s",Paragraph
entrance at the southeast corner of the,Caption
"building, was buffered by a number of open-",Paragraph
air courts that allowed light into the various,Paragraph
"rooms. Offices, libraries, and meeting rooms",Paragraph
were lined up along the principal facade,Paragraph
toward the river. The exterior-—done almost,Paragraph
"uniformly in a soft, yellowish limestone—",Paragraph
was designed in a Perpendicular Gothic,Paragraph
style that replicated the taste of the 15th,Paragraph
century. Despite the monotone treatment of,Paragraph
"the building's external mass, Barry was able",Paragraph
to introduce picturesque elements to the,Paragraph
skyline through the asymmetrical positioning,Title
"of the vertical elements—the Victoria Tower,",Paragraph
"the lantern over the octagonal room, and",Paragraph
"the spectacular Big Ben, Parliament’s now-",Paragraph
jamous clock tower. The debates that swirled,Paragraph
around this building concerning the role and,Paragraph
purpose of architecture were remarkable. The,Paragraph
istory of modern architecture is intertwined,Paragraph
"with the history of polemics, beginning with",Paragraph
"Charles Perrault's attack on beauty, carried",Paragraph
forth by Marc-Antoine Laugier’s attack on the,Paragraph
"classical orders, and extended into the 19th",Paragraph

"the Gothic at the time, who envisioned the",Paragraph
"uilding as a showcase of the Gothic style, a",Paragraph

"XVe siécle, which was published in several",Paragraph
"editions, first appeared in 1854. Without",Paragraph
"doubt, the period represented a turning point",Paragraph
in architectural discourse. Viollet-le-Duc was,Paragraph
a strong advocate of the modern material,Paragraph
"of iron. Unlike other architects of his time,",Paragraph
who were giving cast iron a Gothic flavor to,Paragraph
appease the demands of the followers of,Paragraph
"16.83 Oriel Chambers, Liverpool, England",Caption
"August Welby Pugin, Viollet-le-Duc made no",Caption
such demand.,Paragraph
Neither was he advocating the,Paragraph
technological rationalism of Sir Joseph,Title
Paxton in the Crystal Palace in London. Cast,Caption
"iron, and then iron, had emerged relatively",Paragraph
"quickly on the architectural scene, but",Paragraph
the application proper to its aesthetic was,Paragraph
not yet obvious to mid-century architects.,Paragraph
"In the 17th and 18th centuries, Baroque",Paragraph
"architects, because of the large domes",Paragraph
"and complex lighting effects, operated in a",Paragraph
realm between architecture and technology.,Paragraph
"Neoclassicism, with its emphasis on image,",Paragraph
made significantly fewer technical demands,Paragraph
on the architect. But with the introduction,Paragraph
"of cast iron, that changed rapidly. The",Paragraph
catalogues of architectural components,Title
published by the design offices of British,Caption
"foundries began to grow thicker, and it was",Paragraph
a short step from adding cast-iron balconies,Paragraph
(excellent examples of which abound in the,Paragraph
"French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana) to",Paragraph
designing entire houses and structures out of,Paragraph
cast iron.,Paragraph
By 1850 some were arguing for a,Paragraph
"congruence between material and form,",Paragraph
as can be seen in the remarkable Oriel,Paragraph
"Chambers (1864) in Liverpool, England, by",Caption
the architect Peter Ellis. The thin cast-iron,Caption
frame holds glazed bay windows with no,Caption
"concession to ornamentation. At the time, it",Paragraph
was not well received; architects preferred to,Paragraph
use cast iron mainly for floor supports. In that,Paragraph
"sense, the general approach of Quatremére",Paragraph
"de Quincy, who taught at the Ecole des",Paragraph
"Beaux-Arts, still prevailed. He critiqued the",Paragraph
use of exposed iron in anything other than,Paragraph
"industrial buildings, setting a tone with long-",Paragraph
lasting consequences. Iron received strong,Paragraph
"support, however, from the Romantics,",Paragraph
who saw it as an opportunity to escape,Paragraph
the strictures of the classical orders and,Paragraph
to introduce a more local or regional flavor,Paragraph
to architecture. Viollet-le-Duc tried to hold,Paragraph
"a middle ground, arguing against both the",Paragraph
"academy, with its Neoclassical allegiances,",Paragraph
and the autonomy of rational engineering.,Paragraph
"For him, rationalism was a question not of",Paragraph
numbers and efficiency but of style—a style,Title
that emerged from a thorough familiarity with,Paragraph
the history of architecture and with the visual,Title
and functional needs of the program.,Paragraph
Viollet-le-Duc's approach is best,Paragraph
exemplified in his design for an iron armature,Paragraph
"for a concert hall (1886), which even today",Paragraph
strikes one as astonishing. Using the idea of,Paragraph
a buttress but inverting it and placing it on,Paragraph
"the inside instead of the outside, he holds",Paragraph
up a steel frame that in turn supports a thin,Paragraph
masonry roof.,Paragraph

ARCHITECTURAL PRESERVATION,Title
"Today, architectural preservation is a major",Paragraph
"part of the architectural profession, but",Paragraph
that was not always the case. Medievalists,Paragraph
were especially concerned about the bad,Paragraph
"conditions many cathedrals were in, and the",Paragraph
first preservation efforts were concerned with,Paragraph
medieval buildings. Viollet-le-Duc played a,Paragraph
"large part in this movement, having been",Paragraph
asked in 1835 to restore the Romanesque,Paragraph
Abbey of Vézelay in France. This led to,Paragraph
"restorations at Notre-Dame in Paris, Mont",Caption
"St.-Michel in Normandy, and the town of",Paragraph
Carcassone in Provence. Whereas John,Paragraph
Ruskin advocated a restoration that preserved,Paragraph
"only the building's status quo, Viollet-le-",Paragraph
Duc advocated a more aggressive form of,Paragraph
preservation that included the possibility of,Paragraph
rebuilding and even extending a building in,Paragraph
"the same stylistic manner. At Carcassone,",Paragraph
the high-pitched roofs and the Cathedral of,Paragraph
"Vézelay are basically his designs. In France,",Paragraph
many cathedrals had been damaged during,Paragraph
the French Revolution or had fallen into,Paragraph
"disrepair. On some buildings, Baroque and",Paragraph
Neoclassical additions had been added.,Paragraph
In dealing with such complex situations—,Paragraph
and given that a medieval church might,Paragraph
have taken centuries to complete and thus,Paragraph
exhibited numerous styles—his approach,Paragraph
was not to pick a particular time and restore,Paragraph
"it to that moment, but rather to synthesize",Paragraph
the building and make the restoration a,Paragraph
completion. This put a lot of power in the,Paragraph
hands of the designer; the final result might,Paragraph
have been a building that could never have,Paragraph
existed prior to that moment. To advance his,Paragraph
"cause, Viollet-le-Duc made extensive studies",Paragraph
of medieval building practices—not only,Paragraph
"so that the restoration could be accurate,",Paragraph
but also to show how this knowledge could,Paragraph
ensure the conceptual and perceived,Paragraph
authenticity of the new parts of the building.,Paragraph

BIBLIOTHEQUE STE.-GENEVIEVE,Caption
Among those who argued in favor of the,Paragraph
use of iron in France was Henri Labrouste,Paragraph
(1801-75). His Bibliotheque Ste.-Genevieve,Caption
"(designed 1843, built 1845-51), with its",Paragraph
"slender columns and billowing domes,",Paragraph
"coexists with stone walls, themselves without",Paragraph
any trace of classical columns and pilasters.,Paragraph
The distinction between the two floors is,Paragraph
"made on the outside by a thin entablature,",Paragraph
with a continuous row of garlands suspended,Paragraph
"beneath it. Below, the wall is punctuated by",Paragraph
"relatively small, Romanesque-style round-",Paragraph
"headed windows. Above, from end to end,",Caption
"runs an arcade, with pilasters forming a",Paragraph
regular rhythm across the facade; it is,Paragraph
distinctly Roman in flavor. The lower two,Paragraph
thirds of the arcade are filled in to allow for,Paragraph
a window in each bay. The whole is topped,Paragraph
"by a stripped-down cornice, lightly decorated",Caption
in a neo-Greek manner. The building thus,Paragraph
"makes numerous historical references, but is",Paragraph
in no way historicist. Labrouste attempted to,Paragraph
"create an idiom that, through its reductivist",Paragraph
"aesthetic, could demonstrate a fluid",Paragraph
connection between the old and the modern.,Paragraph
To indicate the iron used on the interior for,Paragraph
"those with a keen eye, Labrouste articulated",Paragraph
the end bolts of the tie rods with round,Paragraph
panels nestled between the archivolts. The,Paragraph
"building also has a Picturesque component,",Paragraph
for inscribed on the panels in the arcades are,Paragraph
the names of the authors of the books on the,Title

contrast with the spindly cast-iron arches.,Paragraph
But these arches were meant to evoke,Paragraph
"the branches of a sacred grove, an image",Paragraph
reinforced by wall frescoes that show treetops,Caption
over the busts of famous literary figures.,Caption
The vestibule thereby becomes a reference,Paragraph
to the fabled Elysian Fields. Because,Paragraph

"more conservative tastes of the academy, his",Paragraph

"the next decades and was used, for example,",Paragraph
at Notre-Dame de la Croix (1870) in Paris.,Caption
The building is sited with its back against the,Paragraph
urban fabric and its long facade facing into,Paragraph
the open square that flanks the Pantheon.,Paragraph
Semper made an equally bold argument:,Paragraph
that the origins of architecture lay not in the,Paragraph
Greek post and lintel and not even in the,Paragraph
"need to add a roof to the post and lintel, as",Paragraph
"Laugier had argued. Architecture began, so",Paragraph

The earliest theaters were ternporary,Paragraph
structures similar to those used for special,Paragraph
"public Noh performances, except that they",Paragraph
were more plebeian than the high-class,Paragraph
stages of the Noh. The Kabuki stages were,Paragraph
fenced-off outdoor areas focused on a,Paragraph
temporary stage with a gabled roof. Their,Paragraph
"placement was casual and improvised, taking",Paragraph
advantage of already existing situations or,Paragraph
"props, such as the Sumiya’s removable",Paragraph
screens that enabled the street to suddenly,Paragraph
become a stage for the audience seated in,Paragraph
its front rooms. The stages became more,Paragraph
permanent when a wooden wall was added,Paragraph
ind the stage. As Kabuki becarne popular,Paragraph
"more elite audiences, a separate space",Paragraph
for them above that of the commoners in the,Paragraph
form of raised boxes (sajiki) was added along,Paragraph
the sides. These early theaters were equipped,Paragraph
"with dressing rooms, viewing boxes, teahouse",Caption
"additions, and corollary entertainments.",Paragraph
The mature form of the Kabuki theater,Paragraph
emerged in the late 17th century. With a solid,Paragraph
"wall running around the perimeter, it had only",Paragraph
"a single entrance, low and small, to regulate",Paragraph
access. Only one person at a time could,Paragraph
"enter or exit, and then only by bending, as",Paragraph
one entered a teahouse. The facade had shoji,Paragraph
screens and wooden slats to control sight,Caption
"lines. A small tower with a drum, vertical",Caption
"banners, and platforms extending into the",Paragraph
streets furnished a framework for advertising.,Paragraph
There was no lobby. The audience entered,Paragraph
"directly into the main space, known as the",Paragraph
"doma, which was basically an open lawn. In",Paragraph
"front was the main stage, roughly 12 meters",Paragraph
"square. To the sides, lifted on stilts, were",Paragraph
"the cubicles, with passages behind to admit",Paragraph
the higher-class clients. The stage and the,Paragraph
cubicles all had individual gabled roofs. The,Paragraph
stage roof was held up by corner pillars with,Paragraph
"the gable end facing the audience, as in Noh",Paragraph
"stages. The stage, however, had an extensive",Paragraph
"backstage area, including side wings of",Paragraph
"different sizes, and an extensive preparation",Paragraph

Though China increased its export of tea,Paragraph
by more than 50 percent in the first third,Paragraph
of the 19th century and quadrupled its,Paragraph
"silk exports, Chinese traders showed little",Paragraph
"interest in European merchandise. Indeed,",Paragraph
they demanded hard currency payment in,Paragraph
silver. The result of this asyrnmetrical trade,Paragraph
"relationship was that by 1800, almost half of",Paragraph
the Spanish silver mined in America ended,Paragraph
"up in Chinese coffers. England, meanwhile,",Paragraph
was having serious financial problems and,Paragraph
began to force Chinese traders to accept,Paragraph
"opium in exchange for tea, a policy they",Paragraph
pursued so relentlessly that by the end of the,Paragraph
"19th century, the Chinese economy went into",Paragraph
a long-lasting tailspin. This is arguably one,Paragraph
of the great civilizational tragedies created by,Paragraph
European colonialism.,Paragraph
"Back in the 18th century, the eventual",Paragraph
reversal of China's fate would not have been,Paragraph
"conceivable. At that time, China under the",Paragraph
Qianlong Emperor (r. 1736-96) was the,Paragraph
"largest and richest empire in the world, and",Paragraph
"from the Chinese perspective, trade with the",Paragraph
new European mercantile world had to be,Title
severely regulated to minimize disruption.,Paragraph

"and being a ruler of foreign origin himself,",Paragraph
Qianlong aspired to establish a model of,Paragraph

Qingyi Garden,Title
One of Qianlong's additions was a new,Paragraph
"garden, originally called Qingyi Garden",Paragraph
(1750-64) and now known as the Summer,Paragraph
Palace. It was designed as a series of palaces,Paragraph
and pavilions around a large oval lake that,Paragraph
is separated from two smaller lakes by long,Paragraph
narrow islands. A stroll path goes around the,Paragraph
lake and across all the small islands. In the,Paragraph
middle of the main lake is a small artificial,Paragraph
"island, connected to the edge on the east by a",Paragraph
"long, arched, graceful bridge. The north edge",Paragraph
of the lake is dominated by a huge palace and,Paragraph
"a Buddhist shrine complex, raised high on a",Paragraph

"island. In the west, the horizon is filled with a",Paragraph
series of long mountains with distinct peaks. A,Paragraph
pagoda and several pavilions were built on the,Paragraph
crests of the peaks.,Paragraph
Chinese gardens were intended to evoke,Paragraph
the order of nature distilled to its essence. The,Paragraph
design skill lay in ensuring that every element,Paragraph
functioned in a way that was harmonious,Paragraph
with the whole from the perspective of,Paragraph
viewing sites along the strolling paths. A,Paragraph
garden's quality was described as a function,Paragraph
"of its scenic spots, which were thought of",Paragraph
as embodied poems and three-dimensional,Title
paintings. Symmetry was abhorred.,Paragraph
"At the same time, all the expectations",Paragraph
and conveniences of a royal palace and,Paragraph
seat of government were to be fulfilled.,Paragraph
There are three palpable visual foci at the,Paragraph
Summer Palace: the island in the middle of,Title
"the lake, the Buddhist shrine at the northern",Paragraph
"edge, and the tall pagoda on the hills in the",Paragraph
west. Although the Buddhist shrine is the,Paragraph
"largest element, the island is in the middle",Paragraph
and constantly attracts the eye. Yet while,Paragraph

"Until the end of the 15th century, most Jews",Paragraph
lived within the footprint of the old Roman,Paragraph
"Empire, whether in Trastevere in Rome, in",Paragraph
"Spain, or in Thessalonica in Greece. This",Paragraph
was the result of the great diaspora imposed,Paragraph
"on the Jews by the Ronan emperor Titus,",Paragraph
after his victory over the Jews and the,Paragraph
destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE.,Paragraph
"Beginning with the Christian era, restrictions",Paragraph
were imposed on Jews wherever they lived.,Paragraph
hey were not allowed to own land and were,Paragraph
"excluded from affairs of the military, thus",Paragraph
denying them access to aristocratic privileges.,Paragraph
Since banking was one of the few trades,Paragraph
"they were permitted to engage in, Jews were",Paragraph
able to create a network that transcended,Paragraph
"local rivalries, and in that capacity were often",Paragraph
"protected by kings and princes, who used",Paragraph
"them as private bankers. In Venice, Jews",Paragraph
were allowed to come to the city principally,Paragraph
because of their banking associations. They,Paragraph
were assigned to live in an area known as,Paragraph
"the ghetto, a term from then on used to",Paragraph
designate where Jews were required to live.,Paragraph
"An exception was in Lithuania, where, frorn",Paragraph
"316 onward, Jews had a surprising amount",Paragraph
of freedom.,Paragraph
With their expulsion by the Spanish in,Paragraph
"1492 and by the Portuguese in 1496,",Paragraph
the Sephardic Jews were forced to seek,Paragraph
"sanctuary in Poland, Amsterdam, Venice,",Caption
"Greece, Istanbul, and even Rome. In",Paragraph
"Amsterdam, a Sephardic synagogue was",Paragraph
built in 1675 that has remained largely,Paragraph
"unchanged, and is today one of the few",Paragraph
tangible remnants of Amsterdam's once-,Paragraph
thriving Jewish community. It is a large,Paragraph
"rectangular brick building, with large round-",Paragraph
headed windows on all sides that emphasize,Paragraph
its vast interior space. It became the model,Paragraph
"for several later synagogues, including",Paragraph
the Bevis-Marks Synagogue in London,Caption
{1700) and the smaller Touro Synagogue,Title
"in Newport, Rhode Island, the oldest",Paragraph
synagogue in the United States. Jewish life,Title
in Germany improved slightly in the 18th,Paragraph
century when courts invited Jews to come,Title
"and serve as financial agents. In 1714, King",Paragraph
Frederick William | of Prussia permitted the,Paragraph
construction of a synagogue in Berlin.,Paragraph
"16.113 Plan: Sephardic synagogue, Amsterdam",Caption
"16.114 Interior: Beth Elohim Synagogue, Charleston, South Carolina",Caption
The fate of Jews significantly improved,Paragraph
"under Napoleon, who passed a number of",Paragraph
measures supporting the position of Jews in,Paragraph
"the French Empire and Austria—and, just",Paragraph
"as importantly, in conquered countries. He",Paragraph
abolished laws restricting Jews to ghettos,Title
or to certain professions. In 1797 when he,Paragraph
"invaded Italy, he threw open the gates to the",Paragraph
"ghettos. In 1807, like his conternporary Qing",Paragraph
"emperors of China, he sanctioned several",Paragraph
religions as “official”—a first for a European,Paragraph
"ruler; these included Judaism, Roman",Paragraph
"Catholicism, Lutheranism, and Calvinism.",Paragraph
"As a result of Napoleon's initiatives, Jews in",Paragraph
other lands sought and eventually received,Paragraph
"emancipation in Germany in 1848, in Great",Paragraph
"Britain in 1890, in Russia in 1917, and finally",Paragraph
in Spain in 1930.,Paragraph
The response by Jews to German,Title
emancipation was a building boom of,Paragraph
unprecedented proportion. During the,Paragraph
"19th century, more than two hundred",Paragraph
large synagogues were built. It would be,Paragraph
shortsighted to see synagogue architecture,Title
as part of the general European trend,Paragraph
toward eclecticism. Synagogue eclecticism,Title
was a direct response to the new freedom,Paragraph
from restrictions on what could be built.,Paragraph
"Furthermore, most of the architects were",Paragraph
"non-Jews who brought their own, often",Paragraph
"romanticized, expectations of what a Jewish",Paragraph
space should look like. Gottfried Semper,Paragraph
(1803-79) designed a synagogue in Dresden,Paragraph
(1840) that was on its exterior Carolingian-,Paragraph
"Romanesque, presumably to emphasize the",Paragraph
"aspirations of assimilation, but on the inside",Paragraph
there was an order of columns with deep,Paragraph
impost blocks copied from the Alhambra at,Paragraph
Granada.,Paragraph
"The emergence of the Reform Judaism,",Paragraph
"intended to appeal to urban Jews, had",Paragraph
a major influence on synagogue design.,Paragraph
Reform Jews stressed the universal teachings,Paragraph
of Judaism but also sought to modernize,Paragraph
rituals that were difficult to maintain in a,Paragraph
modern world. Reform Jews held that Jewish,Paragraph
people were not in a state of permanent,Paragraph
exile but were contributing members of their,Paragraph
community and nation. They considered,Paragraph
"every house of worship a temple, as holy",Paragraph
as the original temple in Jerusalem. Pews,Caption
"were permitted, and prayer was in German.",Paragraph
The organ was introduced. The first Reform,Paragraph
synagogue was opened in Seesen in central,Paragraph
"Germany in 1810 and was called a “temple,”",Paragraph
in keeping with Enlightenment ideals. Some,Paragraph
synagogues took up the classical theme and,Paragraph
"were designed almost literally as temples,",Paragraph
as in the Seitenstettengasse Synagogue,Paragraph
in Vienna (1826) and the Beth Elohim,Paragraph
"Synagogue in Charleston, South Carolina",Caption
(1840).,Paragraph
"16.115 Beth Elohim Synagogue, Charleston,",Caption

"16.116 Tempio Israelitico, Rome",Caption
Others were in keeping with the general,Paragraph
19th-century preoccupation with history and,Title
were developed along Egyptian and Byzantine,Paragraph
"lines, as, for example, the Princes Road",Paragraph
"Synagogue (1874) in Liverpool, which is a",Paragraph
type of Norman Gothic with Oriental touches;,Paragraph
"and the Tempio Israelitico (1882) in Florence,",Paragraph
"whose prayer hall is almost square, with",Paragraph
galleries on three sides supported by colurnns,Caption
with Moorish cusped arches. Every inch of,Paragraph
surface is covered with patterns and colored,Paragraph
"designs of abstract Islamic configurations,",Paragraph
creating a soft reddish-golden atmosphere.,Paragraph

human figures.,Paragraph

INTRODUCTION,Title
"As the 198th century wore on, the forms,",Paragraph
"institutions, and modes of representation that",Paragraph
can be retrospectively identified as being,Paragraph
modern or modernist eventually started to,Paragraph
coalesce. But that was a long time coming.,Paragraph
"By the middle of the 19th century,",Paragraph
the new nation-states of Europe and the,Title
Americas were jockeying with each other,Paragraph
to envision and establish the institutions,Paragraph
"and the accompanying social, political,",Paragraph
and economic practices of modernity. The,Paragraph
burgeoning colonial industrial economy,Title
fueled slow but steady growth. British,Paragraph
"supremacy on the sea continued to flourish,",Paragraph
and by the end of the century England was,Paragraph
"the dominant global force, controlling land",Paragraph
all around the world. As other European,Paragraph
nations scrambled to compete with the,Paragraph
"English, the rest of the world began to adapt",Paragraph
"to, and challenge, the new global imperatives",Paragraph
"of the colonial world. At the same time,",Paragraph
the social costs of industrial concentration,Title
became more apparent—devastation of old,Paragraph
"rural economies; development of massive,",Paragraph
subsistence-level working classes; and rapid,Paragraph
growth in urban populations—creating cities,Title
that were woefully underprepared to deliver,Paragraph
the services that were suddenly expected,Paragraph
"of them. The consequent urban upheavals,",Paragraph
accompanied by a chorus of criticism from,Paragraph
"the likes of as Ruskin, Morris, Marx, and",Paragraph
"Engels, were met with the establishment of",Paragraph
a series of new urban institutions designed,Paragraph
"to cope with the new city. For the first time,",Paragraph
what we now recognize as public-sector,Paragraph
"works—such as hospitals, fire stations,",Paragraph
"law courts, and the like—were undertaken",Paragraph
"by European municipal bodies. Soon,",Paragraph
these bodies began also to take pride in,Paragraph
their work and in their cities and began,Paragraph
to build larger public works that sought to,Paragraph
establish the identity of the city as a civic,Paragraph
space. Particularly celebrated were railroad,Paragraph
stations that moved the people and goods,Title
necessary to the new economy; law courts,Title
"that signified the new, more public-minded",Paragraph
jurisprudence of the city; and museums that,Paragraph
catered to new conceptions of an educated,Paragraph
citizenry. New public societies that debated,Paragraph
"the meaning of the public, such as libraries",Paragraph
"and athenaeums, began to be established;",Paragraph
and as the ultimate democratic civic space,Title
"accessible to all, the large urban park in the",Paragraph
midst of the city became a central part of the,Paragraph
urban experience. This was especially true,Paragraph
"in the United States, spearheaded by the",Paragraph
creation of Central Park in Manhattan in the,Paragraph
"1850s, designed by the landscape architect",Paragraph
Frederick Law Olmsted in collaboration with,Paragraph
"Calvert Vaux, a European-trained architect.",Paragraph
"Central Park, former site of immigrant slums",Caption
"and squatter settlements, soon came to",Paragraph
embody the idea of massive public works as,Paragraph
"the signature mark of a prosperous city, even",Paragraph
though it would still take more than half a,Paragraph
century before the park was fully established,Paragraph
as the heart of the city.,Paragraph
"In terms of architectural expression, the",Paragraph
18th-century Enlightenment ideal—which,Paragraph
held up a restatement of the Greco-Roman,Paragraph
classical ideal as the specific European,Title
heritage that best expressed the new,Paragraph
institutions of modernity—for the most part,Title
continued to hold sway. Classicism and,Paragraph
"classical revivalism, however, had their",Paragraph
critics. The proponents of the Arts and,Paragraph
Crafts movement in particular felt that the,Paragraph
true expression of an architectural style,Title
must be derived only from expressions of,Paragraph
"handwork, as in the past, and favored a more",Paragraph
Gothic-inspired vocabulary. Early modernist,Paragraph
opinions that eschewed all styles were also,Paragraph
beginning to surface. An important flashpoint,Paragraph
in this debate was the first world’s fair ever,Paragraph
"held, the Great Exhibition of 1851 in Hyde",Caption
"Park, London. Eventually remembered as",Paragraph
the Crystal Palace Exhibition on account,Title
of the massive temporary pavilion of stee,Caption
and glass that was designed for it by the,Paragraph
"engineer Joseph Paxton, this event was",Paragraph
intended to showcase the global derman,Paragraph
"for British goods. Instead, Arts and Crafts",Paragraph
enthusiasts used it to stage a political,Paragraph
demonstration showcasing the shoddiness of,Paragraph
those goods and extolling in their place the,Paragraph
exotic handcrafted indigenous goods of the,Paragraph
colonies. The demonstrators called on the,Paragraph
British Empire to protect crafts and a craft,Title
"ethic in England, as in its territories.",Paragraph
"The Arts and Crafts revolution, as a",Paragraph
"consequence, became one of the first truly",Paragraph
"global transformative movements, intended",Title
to revolutionize lives by rethinking livelihoods,Paragraph
"and ways of working. In the United States,",Paragraph
"the ethics of Arts and Crafts, if not always its",Paragraph
"aesthetic, permeated the complete array of",Paragraph
"architectural explorations, fueled in part by",Paragraph
a nascent sense of American exceptionalism,Title
that sought to generate an original American,Paragraph
architectural expression. The craft-based,Paragraph
"ideal, though still significantly derivative of",Paragraph
"European styles, catered to this desire. The",Paragraph
strong sense of rustication and the attention,Title
to detail and ornament that can be found in,Paragraph
work by H. H. Richardson as well as some,Paragraph
"early work by McKim, Mead & White can",Caption
be understood in this context. And certainly,Paragraph
"the bungalow, which began as a white",Paragraph
man’s domestic space in colonial India but,Paragraph
"then spread through the colonial world, and",Paragraph
"particularly the United States, as the symbol",Paragraph
"of the good life, was widely proselytized as an",Paragraph
expression of the craft aesthetic.,Paragraph
"Concomitantly, Arts and Crafts enthusiasts",Title
also built the first set of design schools,Paragraph
in colonial India as part of their effort to,Paragraph
preserve and revive the crafts against the,Paragraph
standardization that was the staple of the,Paragraph
colonial Public Works Department. In the,Paragraph
process they invented a new architectural,Paragraph
style that sought expressly to modernize,Paragraph
"Mughal building and aesthetic traditions,",Paragraph
known as the Indo-Saracenic. This was,Paragraph
particularly popular in some of the so-called,Paragraph
"princely states, such as Jaipur, where a",Paragraph
"former military engineer, Colonel Swinton",Title
"Jacobs, organized the massive Jeypore",Paragraph
Portfolio of Architectural Details as something,Title
of a catalogue of Indic styles curated for,Paragraph
reuse. The Yankee blockade of the Southern,Paragraph
ports during the American Civil War,Title
(1861-65) prompted the British to source,Paragraph
"its raw cotton from western India, which had",Paragraph
suitable volcanic soil for cotton production;,Paragraph
this resulted in the establishment of Bombay,Paragraph
(now Mumbai) as a major port. The Suez,Paragraph
Canal was cut by the British primarily to,Paragraph
shorten the passage from Bombay to the,Paragraph
cotton mills of Manchester. The cotton trade,Title
"brought new wealth to Bombay, whose new",Paragraph
"architecture, to suit the extant Arts and Crafts",Paragraph
"trends in England, was of course built in the",Paragraph
Venetian Gothic style.,Paragraph
"In a different register, however, the",Paragraph
critiques of strict classicism also led to,Paragraph
"eclecticism—that is, appreciation and skillful",Paragraph
reuse of the vast diversity of architectural,Paragraph
styles from European history and beyond.,Paragraph
The eclectic assertion that architectural,Paragraph
languages were more a question of materials,Paragraph
and aesthetics than of political ideology,Title
was fueled in particular by the rise of the,Paragraph
"architect, in the late 19th century, as an",Paragraph
"independent professional, riding on the",Paragraph
coattails of similar movements by doctors,Paragraph
and lawyers. The move to professionalize,Paragraph
was centered in Paris. In spite of England's,Paragraph
"dominance in the 19th century, Paris was",Paragraph
the more influential center of the new,Title
urban culture of the times. Its center was,Paragraph
thoroughly rebuilt during the Second Empire,Paragraph
under Napoleon Il and became the model,Paragraph
for urban redesigns in Europe and around,Title
"the world. Argentina’s exports, for example,",Paragraph
"may have largely gone to England, but when",Paragraph
it came to designing streets and public,Paragraph
"buildings, Argentina’s elite turned to Parisian",Paragraph
"models. The French Beaux-Arts, as a voice",Paragraph
that combined bourgecis elegance and,Paragraph
professional expertise (also known as the,Paragraph
"Second Empire style), was an international",Paragraph
movement in its own right. Although the,Paragraph
Ecole des Beaux-Arts had already been in,Paragraph
"existence for almost a century, in the late",Paragraph
19th century it became a central powerhouse,Paragraph
"for architectural thinking, moving the",Paragraph
discourse away from the drawing rooms and,Paragraph
boudoirs of the gentlemen architects of the,Caption
past. Its compositional strategies—strongly,Paragraph
"axial, eclectic, and focused on the production",Paragraph
of the framed spectacle—came to embody,Paragraph
the expressions of the new urban world,Title
that was emerging at the time. Beaux-Arts,Paragraph
aesthetics were widely adopted not only in,Paragraph
Europe and North America but also in many,Paragraph
"other parts of the world, including Japan,",Paragraph
"Argentina, and China, as the international",Paragraph
standard of the global-colonial world.,Paragraph
One influential manifestation of the,Paragraph
Beaux-Arts ideal was the City Beautiful,Paragraph
movement. It began with Chicago-based,Paragraph
architect Daniel Burnham's iron-fisted,Title
production of the spectacle of the extremely,Title
successful Chicago's World's Fair of 1893.,Paragraph
"With the buildings all painted in white,",Paragraph
Burnham's vision permanently imbricated,Title
into the modern sensibility the suggestion,Title
"that monochromatism, and particularly white",Paragraph
"monochromatism, successfully liberated",Paragraph
architecture from the weight of history and,Title
suspended it in an eternal present where,Paragraph
it was only the composition that mattered.,Paragraph
"When the National Mall in Washington, DC,",Paragraph
was redesigned according these principles,Paragraph
"in 1901, the Burnham vision became a",Paragraph
movement and was adopted by cities across,Paragraph
the United States. In 1905 Burnham also,Paragraph
"prepared a proposal for Manila, which had",Paragraph
just become a U.S. territory.,Paragraph
"By 1900, European territorial expansion,",Paragraph
"with its larger global sphere of influence,",Paragraph
was at its very height. English successes,Paragraph
"in Southeast Asia and China, along with its",Paragraph
"continued domination of India, initiated a new",Paragraph
sphere of economic migration between those,Title
areas that paid some small local dividends,Paragraph
for the colonized populations—as in the,Paragraph
example of the Chettinad mansions—while,Paragraph
driving most of the profit back to London. The,Paragraph
British also built out an extensive utilitarian,Paragraph
infrastructure orchestrated around railroads,Title
"to enable the extraction of raw materials,",Paragraph
and to distribute the manufactured goods.,Paragraph
The imperial Public Works Department,Title
commanded a mini-army in its own right.,Paragraph
But the centerpiece of the new European,Paragraph
colonial expansion was the tragic land-grab,Paragraph
of the African continent. Largely defenseless,Paragraph
"against European armaments, Africa had",Paragraph
hitherto been protected by the sheer lack,Paragraph
of knowledge of its hinterland. As accurate,Paragraph
"cartography revealed its true size, all the",Paragraph
major European powers rushed to claim,Paragraph
African territory by any means they could.,Paragraph
The African land-grab epitornizes the,Paragraph
proverbial heart-of-darkness at the center,Caption
of the colonial 19th century. While the,Paragraph
"old colonial powers—the English, French,",Paragraph
"Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch—continued",Title
"to dominate distant shores, the remaining",Paragraph
"European nations, the latecomers to the",Paragraph
"colonial game, in particular the Germans,",Paragraph
"Belgians, and Italians, rushed to grab the",Paragraph
"lands that were still “available,” mostly in",Paragraph
Africa. Africa was literally divided up at a,Paragraph
conference held in Berlin in 1884. Even,Paragraph
"so, there were battles. South Africa was a",Paragraph
"particularly contested prize, with its newfound",Paragraph
"mineral wealth, which pitted the earlier Dutch",Paragraph
settlers against the British.,Paragraph
"Late in the 19th century, Germany under",Paragraph
Otto von Bismarck had been particularly,Paragraph
"determined to catch up with, and surpass,",Paragraph
England and France in wealth and power.,Paragraph
Bismarck pushed through a process,Title
of aggressive industrialization that saw,Paragraph
Germany's output rival that of England in,Paragraph
less than a generation. By the early 20th,Paragraph
"century, Germany was a significant power",Paragraph
to be reckoned with. Somewhat free of the,Paragraph
long discussions of style and modernity that,Paragraph
had dominated earlier discourses in places,Paragraph
"like England and France, late 19th-century",Paragraph
Germany sought to embody its own vision of,Paragraph
"an incipient modernism. Thus, the factories",Paragraph
"of Peter Behrens, the Deutsche Werkbund,",Paragraph
and the new uses of concrete looked to,Paragraph
"American factories for inspiration, rather than",Paragraph
to Beaux-Arts academies.,Paragraph
Germany's success at bootstrapping itself,Title
without the advantage of a far-flung colonial,Paragraph
empire (and without the vast reserves of,Paragraph
a United States) made it into a model for,Paragraph
other parts of the world that were looking,Paragraph
for non-colonial models of growth. Japan in,Paragraph
particular took Germany as its role model.,Paragraph
"Anticipating a colonial incursion, and tired of",Paragraph
"the old practices of the Bakafu code, Japan’s",Paragraph
elite orchestrated a revolt against the reigning,Paragraph
shogunate. The consequent so-called Meiji,Paragraph
Restoration of 1868 aggressively worked,Title
"to import Western knowledge, skills, and",Paragraph
"institutions to Japan, launching it as",Paragraph
an industrial and economic power. The,Paragraph
Meiji Restoration positioned Japan as a,Paragraph
"counterforce to European colonial expansion,",Paragraph
thereby transforming Japan into a colonial,Paragraph
power in its own right.,Paragraph
"Inescapably, the watershed event of",Paragraph
"these tires was World War |. Germany, in",Paragraph
collaboration with the Old World empires—,Title
the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman—went,Title
to war with a world that had grown powerful,Paragraph
on colonial riches. The consequence was,Paragraph
"a long stalemate, and a particularly bloody",Paragraph
one because of the extensive use on both,Paragraph
sides of new industrial technologies to,Title
develop weaponry. The fallout of World,Paragraph
War | perrnanently eradicated all vestiges,Paragraph
"of the preindustrial, pre-colonial world",Paragraph
and ultimately even spelled the death of,Paragraph
"the colonial world. Thenceforth, industrial",Paragraph
"technologies and capital reigned, and the",Paragraph
whole world decisively advanced toward,Title
"nation-statehood. Architecturally speaking,",Paragraph
"these transformations put modernity, and",Paragraph
the continued search for a distinctive new,Title
"architectural modernism, firmly in the driver's",Paragraph
seat. The 1926 competition for the new,Paragraph
League of Nations embodied the contentions,Title
of this new world order.,Paragraph
"After World War |, the United States’",Paragraph
emergence as the global economic,Title
superpower of the 20th century seemed,Title
"assured. Its industrial might, vast natural and",Paragraph
"land resources, and sense of opportunity",Title
gave it a decisive edge. Besides its industrial,Paragraph
"forms, the new skyscrapers of its cities like",Paragraph
"Chicago and New York, although dressed",Paragraph
"in various neoclassical garbs, had already",Paragraph
demonstrated the possibilities of new,Paragraph
"materials, structures, and ways of living.",Paragraph
Frank Lloyd Wright shone forth as the main,Paragraph
American figure with a comprehensive vision,Title
"of how to articulate a new architectural order,",Paragraph
"complete with ornamentation, based on new",Caption
materials and his own vision of a land-based,Paragraph
agro-rural lifestyle. Working in a milieu that,Paragraph
was almost completely isolated from the early,Paragraph
"modernists of Europe, Wright began to outline",Paragraph
his vision first in Wisconsin and then in the,Paragraph
"American Southwest and Japan, searching",Title
for what he was to later describe as a,Paragraph
"comprehensive, “organic” aesthetic order that",Paragraph
"integrated all aspects of design—painting,",Paragraph
"furniture, architecture, ornamentation,",Title
"landscape, and even urbanism. His sources",Paragraph
were diverse—Richardson and Sullivan,Paragraph
"by direct influence, the American prairie",Paragraph
"by context, the Celtic world by personal",Paragraph
"connection, and the pre-Columbian and",Paragraph
Japanese realms by affinity. Divorced from,Paragraph
"the European modernist milieu, Wright",Title
constructed an alternate modernist universe,Paragraph
whose potential may still be unfulfilled.,Paragraph
The early 20th-century American,Title
"architectural academy, however, was still",Paragraph
"dominated by the Beaux-Arts teaching model,",Paragraph
as it was in Europe. This was decisively,Paragraph
"challenged on multiple fronts, especially by",Paragraph
the establishment of the Bauhaus in Germany,Title
"in 1919, led by Walter Gropius; the irruption",Paragraph
of a diverse range of modernist idiorns to,Paragraph
express the communist ideals of the new,Paragraph
Soviet Union after the Communist revolution,Title
"in Russia and, emanating from Paris starting",Paragraph
"in 1917, the Cubist-inspired writings and",Paragraph
projects by the Swiss-born architect and,Paragraph
painter Le Corbusier.,Paragraph
Determinedly seeking to reboot design,Title
"discourse in Germany, Gropius’s Bauhaus",Paragraph
was initially strongly influenced by early,Paragraph
"modern German and Viennese discourses, in",Paragraph
particular Art Nouveau and Expressionism.,Paragraph
With figures like Johannes Itten central to,Paragraph
"the teaching staff, early Bauhaus looked to",Paragraph
"diverse sources, including a kind of emotional",Paragraph
"mysticism, to find a path to a new modern",Paragraph
aesthetic. But soon after it moved to Dessau,Paragraph
"in 1925, Bauhaus became rigorously devoted",Paragraph
"to a strict machine aesthetic, ernbodied in",Paragraph
particular by Gropius's design of the new,Paragraph
school building and dormitory.,Paragraph
The Soviet world was by far the most diverse,Paragraph
"and experimental, actively seeking to invent",Paragraph
"new forms, idioms, and ideologies for what,",Paragraph
"at that time, seemed like a brave new frontier",Paragraph
for humankind. Pushing modernist ideas to,Paragraph
"their limits, the Soviets assembled themselves",Paragraph
into loose groups under intentionally avant-,Paragraph
"garde titles such as the Constructivists,",Paragraph
"the Suprematists, and, by contrast,",Paragraph
the Rationalists. Their explorations and,Paragraph
propositions advanced many new frontiers in,Paragraph
"architectural thinking, the diversity of which",Paragraph
has only recently begun to be fully accounted,Paragraph
for.,Paragraph
But the loudest and most distinctive,Paragraph
bell announcing the birth of a new era was,Paragraph
"sounded in Paris by Le Corbusier, who,",Paragraph
"in the 1920s, published his ideas of a",Paragraph
focused agenda for a new modernism in,Title
"a series of books and conceptual projects,",Paragraph
the most influential of which was Vers une,Paragraph
"Architecture, translated into English as",Paragraph
“Towards a New Architecture.” Vers offered a,Paragraph
"succinct vision of modernism, delineated into",Paragraph
"clear principles, aphoristic assertions, and",Paragraph
"tabulated principles, such as the “five points”",Paragraph
of a new architecture. Le Corbusier skillfully,Paragraph
backed these up with dramatic theoretical,Paragraph
"projects, such as replacing the architectural",Paragraph
"fabric of Paris with crystalline towers, which",Paragraph
quickly captured the international imagination,Paragraph
"and sparked strong reactions, catapulting Le",Paragraph
Corbusier into iconic status.,Paragraph

The Victorian era on the whole was still tied,Paragraph
to the Picturesque ideal that architecture had,Paragraph
to be linked creatively to the past in order,Paragraph
to dignify the present. But the Victorians,Paragraph
tended to be less attached to the purity,Paragraph
of Roman or Greek prototypes than the,Paragraph
generation of Robert Adam and John Nash.,Paragraph
They experimented with historical styles that,Paragraph
resonated with the increased archaeological,Paragraph
erudition of the time and with the diverse,Title
philosophical persuasions of their clientele.,Paragraph
"George Edmund Street (1824-81), who",Paragraph
"designed the London Law Courts (1870-81),",Paragraph
"for example, used an early medieval style,",Paragraph
not August Welby Pugin’s high Gothic.,Paragraph
Street chose this style for its more stern and,Paragraph
primitive associations. He and many of the,Paragraph
young architects of the time were enthralled,Paragraph
with the ideals of Gallic toughness. What,Paragraph
"today might be seen as medieval, they saw",Paragraph
as Saxon. The Saxons were not known,Paragraph
"for their architectural accomplishments,",Paragraph
"however, and here the added problem is that",Paragraph
the precedents are more Franco-Norman,Paragraph
than English.,Paragraph
"With four different systems of circulation,",Paragraph
the Law Courts building was quite complex,Paragraph
and mirrored the new and expanded horizons,Title
"of law. It had eighteen courtrooms, two of",Paragraph
them larger than the others for the more,Paragraph
prominent trials. A private corridor for the,Paragraph
bar circled the building between the courts,Paragraph
and the central hall. Judges were provided,Paragraph

just under that of the judges accommodated,Paragraph
attorneys and had its own doorways into the,Paragraph

THE ATHENAEUM,Title
"By the turn of the century, the idea of",Paragraph
associations—citizens coming together,Title
around a particular set of common,Paragraph
interests—had become a social movement,Paragraph
"unto itself, reaching into the middle class.",Paragraph
The theoretical underpinnings of this,Paragraph
development can be found in the writing of,Paragraph
"Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-59), the French",Paragraph
philosopher and social scientist. He argued,Paragraph
that associations were an important part of,Paragraph
a healthy civil society. Given the contrary,Paragraph
"propensity for isolation in the modern world,",Paragraph
"society needed to be bound together, he",Paragraph
"argued, not through the abstract authority of",Paragraph
"the state but through voluntary associations,",Paragraph
"educational institutions, newspapers,",Title
and even commercial and manufacturing,Title
associations.,Paragraph
Building on the older mercantile culture,Title
"of coffeehouses, the new associations of",Paragraph
"the 19th century tended to be pro-urban,",Paragraph
"seeing the city, despite its faults and ugliness,",Paragraph
as the symbol of civilization and the place,Paragraph
"where the virtues of polity, politeness, and",Paragraph
urbanity could be exercised and maintained.,Paragraph
Associations took many forms: some were,Paragraph
"social, others political; some secular, others",Paragraph
religious. Among them were the Natural,Paragraph
"History Society, the Mechanic's Institute, the",Title
"Architectural Association, the Royal Victoria",Title
Gallery for the Encouragement of Practical,Title
"Science, and a rich array of musical groups,",Paragraph
"library societies, and philosophical and",Title
charitable organizations.,Paragraph
Before the public library came the,Paragraph
athenaeum. Inspired by Hadrian's,Paragraph
"Athenaeum in Rome, which was meant to",Paragraph
emulate the culture of learning associated,Paragraph
"with ternples dedicated to Athena,",Paragraph
19th-century athenaeum societies sought to,Paragraph
promote a culture of literary and scientific,Paragraph
"learning focused on books, poetry, criticism,",Paragraph
and the like. Their roots were in the,Paragraph
"Enlightenment, probably in the 1798 literary",Paragraph
magazine called the Afhenaeum that was,Paragraph
started by the brothers August and Karl,Paragraph
"Friedrich Schlegel, pioneers of Indo-European",Title
studies and active advocates of the German,Title
Romantic movement.,Paragraph
A wide diversity of athenaeums sprang,Paragraph
up all over Europe and the United States.,Paragraph
"Rather than stick to a specific visual heritage,",Paragraph
athenaeums sought to be very current and,Paragraph
in tune with extant intellectual cultures.,Paragraph
They were modern-day temples of Athena.,Paragraph
Many were designed in the Italianate,Paragraph
"manner, while others were Greek Revival.",Paragraph
"Some were a mix, such as those in London",Paragraph
and Boston. The Wadsworth Atheneum in,Caption
"Hartford, Connecticut, is the oldest in the",Paragraph
United States and exhibits a fascinating,Paragraph
blend of diverse architectural idioms. Its,Paragraph
"original building, designed by Alexander",Caption
"Jackson Davis and Ithiel Town in 1842, was",Paragraph
a neo-Gothic building complete with turrets,Caption
and a crenelated roofline. Besides a large,Paragraph
"fine arts collection, this building housed",Paragraph
the beginnings of what later became the,Paragraph
Hartford Public Library and the Connecticut,Title
"Historical Society. In 1910 and 1915, two",Paragraph
new wings were added to house the growing,Paragraph
"art collection, one in Tudor Revival style and",Paragraph
the other in a more Italianate Renaissance,Paragraph

"Morris. In 1934, the museum chose a strong",Paragraph
modernist idiom for its new wing—the first,Paragraph

modernism—making the entire structure an,Paragraph
eclectic assemblage.,Paragraph
The athenaeum was an international,Paragraph

parts of Europe. The Finnish Athenaeum,Caption

"Before the European Enlightenment, history",Title

"But beginning in the Enlightenment,",Paragraph
history began to be perceived in terms,Paragraph
of a civilizational dynamic and verifiable,Paragraph

Greece expanded into a fascination with,Paragraph
"global history—particularly that of Egypt,",Paragraph
"Mesopotamia, China, and India—with nations",Title
"such as England, France, and Germany",Paragraph
seeing themselves as the protectors and heirs,Paragraph
of antique values. With William Jones’s 1786,Paragraph

WORLD’S FAIRS,Title
The first industrial exhibition was held in,Paragraph
France in 1801 to search for buyers of,Paragraph
products during an economic depression,Title
that followed the French Revolution. The,Paragraph
"English also had such fairs, but on a smaller",Paragraph
scale. The success of these fairs led Henry,Paragraph
"Cole (1808-82), a leading advocate of the",Paragraph
necessity for improvement in industrial design,Title
and well-known through his Journal of Design,Paragraph
"and Manufactures (1849-52), to argue",Paragraph
that what was needed was not a national,Paragraph
exhibition but a large international one that,Paragraph
could assemble the best goods from the,Paragraph
"world over and, at the same time, showcase",Paragraph
England's unique influence in the global,Paragraph
economy. The fair he organized was held in,Paragraph
1851 and took place in a building that came,Paragraph
to be called the Crystal Palace.,Paragraph
he Crystal Palace was designed,Paragraph
"and engineered by Sir Joseph Paxton,",Paragraph
an innovative designer of steel and glass,Paragraph
greenhouses. Unlike Henri Labrouste’s,Paragraph
Bibliothéque St.-Genevieve with its custom-,Paragraph
"detailed iron elements, or St. Pancras Station",Caption
"with its massive beams, the Crystal Palace",Paragraph
"was composed of thin, lightweight elements",Paragraph
that were mass-produced and assembled,Paragraph
on-site. Tension wires kept the structure from,Paragraph
falling over. The effect was of a building that,Paragraph
seemed almost to be woven; compression,Paragraph
and tension forces were brought into the,Paragraph
open as no other building had ever done,Paragraph
before. Paxton also understood that the,Paragraph
17.18 Plan: Crystal Palace,Caption
structure had to be inspiring and so designed,Paragraph
its central element in the form of a long nave,Paragraph
"filled with exhibits, trees, and gardens. On",Paragraph
display were the first English mass-produced,Paragraph
"machines and products, alongside intricate",Paragraph
handcrafted products from the colonies. The,Paragraph
contradiction between the two reflected the,Paragraph
intellectual mindset of the time. The industrial,Paragraph
bosses marveled at the engineering and mass,Paragraph
production; the Arts and Crafts enthusiasts,Title
pointed to the colonial products as evidence,Paragraph
of what was lost to England. John Ruskin,Paragraph
and Qwen Jones decried the building and,Paragraph
its industrial contents as representing the,Paragraph
"superficiality of modern culture, while",Paragraph
extolling the colonial products for their,Paragraph
beauty.,Paragraph
No one had ever seen such a spectacle.,Paragraph
The fair was a phenomenal success:,Paragraph
6 million people visited in the six short,Title
months the exhibition was open. The fair’s,Paragraph
unprecedented triurmph set the stage for,Paragraph
a seemingly endless series of repeats:,Paragraph
the Great Industrial Exhibition of Dublin,Title
"(1853), the New York Crystal Palace (1853),",Paragraph
the International Exhibition of London,Title
"(1862), the Dublin International Exhibition",Caption
"(1865), and London's Colonial and Indian",Paragraph
Exhibition (1886). There were still others:,Paragraph
"the international exhibitions in Paris in 1855,",Paragraph
"1867, 1878, 1889, and 1900; the Centennial",Title
Exhibition in Philadelphia (1876); the World’s,Paragraph
"Columbian Exposition in Chicago (1893),",Paragraph
"and the World's Exposition at Melbourne,",Paragraph
Australia (1880). And then there were,Paragraph

"Jaipur, India (both in 1883); in South Africa",Paragraph
"(1887, 1893); in Belgiurn (1894); in Jamaica",Paragraph
(1891); and in Guatemala (1897). A cultural,Paragraph
history of these exhibitions would map out,Paragraph
"the core topics of 19th-century modernity,",Paragraph

goods; the spectacle of display; the rituals of,Paragraph
consumption; and the relationship between,Paragraph

GLOBAL ARTS AND CRAFTS,Title
MOVEMENT,Title
No Victorian-era theorist was as widely read,Paragraph
and discussed as John Ruskin. Ruskin,Paragraph
preferred the simpler Italian medieval,Paragraph
style to the more complicated northern,Title
"Gothic, because form, he argued, should",Paragraph
be determined by the material of which,Paragraph
it consists and of the way in which it is,Paragraph
"constructed. The early medieval period,",Paragraph
"he felt, embodied this ethos. Unlike Pugin,",Paragraph
Ruskin was not opposed to the use of,Paragraph
"iron, but he much preferred conventional",Paragraph
materials. Disturbed by the rawness of,Paragraph
"industrialism, he wanted to bring a new",Paragraph
awareness to the aesthetic intensity of the,Paragraph
architectural surface. The fact that a wall is a,Paragraph
"series of layers, he argued, should be shown",Paragraph
as distinctly as possible on the surface. He,Paragraph
"was not opposed to thin walls, for example,",Paragraph
but wanted the thinness to be expressed in,Paragraph
the paneling or in the use of a checkered,Paragraph
pattern. Ruskin also asked his readers to,Paragraph
"rethink their attitude to the past, looking not",Paragraph
at the question of proportion and order in,Paragraph
"the neoclassical sense, nor at the question of",Paragraph
"Roman versus nen-Roman motifs, but rather",Paragraph
at the physical and material rationale that,Paragraph
underlies architectural reasoning.,Paragraph
Ruskin's concern for the visual led him to,Paragraph
prefer monolithic columns. He rejected the,Paragraph
"use of piers and buttresses, as they interfered",Paragraph
with the visual impact of a form. Mass was,Paragraph
not to be constricted by cold geometry;,Paragraph
"rather, it was something to be molded freely",Paragraph
with simple and grand outlines. He very rarely,Paragraph
dealt with interiors and thus rarely asked,Paragraph
questions about program and function. For,Paragraph
"Ruskin, the shape of a building—as would",Paragraph
have been significant for Durand—was less,Paragraph
important than the architect's attitude toward,Paragraph
designing it; and a building's tactile surface,Paragraph
and detail were just as important as the plan.,Paragraph
"After Ruskin, a generation of architects",Paragraph
began to design in a way that they thought,Paragraph
conformed to his vision of the constructed,Paragraph
world. This entailed a shift away from the,Paragraph
enforced medievalism of Pugin to a more,Title
inventive style for which there is no particular,Paragraph
name apart from the term Ruskinian Gothic.,Paragraph
Among those who worked in this direction,Paragraph
"was the firm of Deane and Woodward,",Paragraph
which designed the interior of the Museum,Paragraph
of Natural History at Oxford University,Title
"(1853) using exposed Gothic-styled iron,",Paragraph
demonstrating its expressive qualities down,Paragraph
to the rivets holding the elernents together.,Paragraph
The industrial feel is offset by individually,Paragraph
designed capitals with inventive floral motifs,Caption
and the use of column clusters to create a,Paragraph
"light, transparent appearance. In the United",Paragraph
"States, one of the best examples of Ruskinian",Paragraph
Gothic is Memorial Hall (1865-68) at Harvard,Paragraph
"University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",Paragraph
"Housing a theater and dining hall, it was",Paragraph
designed by William Robert Ware and Henry,Caption
Van Brunt. Most of the building is in red brick,Caption
accented in a lively manner with yellowish,Paragraph
"17.21 Museum of Natural History, Oxford, England",Caption
"limestone. The roof is stripped in grays,",Paragraph
"whites, and reds, with a massive tower rising",Paragraph
over the ensemble.,Paragraph
"In this context, a movement sprang",Paragraph
up that defined a middle ground between,Paragraph
socialism and capitalism. Known as the,Paragraph
"Arts and Crafts movement, it appealed to",Paragraph
"individuality, novelty, and good taste; but it",Paragraph
refined these tendencies into a social and,Paragraph
philosophical position that revolved around,Paragraph
the critique of what many saw as the ethical,Paragraph
vacuum at the center of England’s mercantile,Title
culture. The concern of the Arts and Crafts,Paragraph
"was not with the end product of design, and",Paragraph
"certainly not with efficiency, but with the",Paragraph
processes shaping the design—there had to,Paragraph
be an intimate connection between design,Paragraph
and production. This position was to have,Paragraph
"significant influence on later modernists,",Paragraph
"such as Henry Van de Velde, Hermann",Paragraph
"Muthesius, Adolf Loos, and Walter Gropius.",Paragraph
"Arts and Crafts artists were, for the most",Paragraph
"part, resistant to making connections to",Paragraph
"industry, as they were frustrated by what they",Paragraph
perceived as the drift toward mechanization.,Paragraph
"Perfection of finish, symmetry, and precision",Title
"were suspect, since they represented the",Paragraph
denial of the human element. But just,Paragraph
ecause the movement critiqued capitalism,Title
and industrialismn did not mean it was a,Paragraph
"riend of the socialists, who for their part",Paragraph
paid little regard to the Arts and Crafts,Paragraph
movement; the socialists’ weapons were the,Paragraph
"trade unions, not guilds of bookbinders and",Paragraph
"urniture makers. In reality, the Arts and",Paragraph
Crafts appealed more to the disenfranchised,Paragraph
"ourgecisie, social utopians, and upper-class",Title
aesthetes than to members of the working,Paragraph
"class. In this it was, in essence, an extension",Paragraph
of Victorian ideals that tried to educate the,Paragraph

colonial stereotype of the putative “decline”,Title
of Indian civilization. The English claimed,Paragraph
that they had succeeded in conquering India,Paragraph
because Indian civilization in general had,Paragraph
Vt,Title
gone into decay. One of the chief proponents,Paragraph
"of this idea was James Fergusson, the first",Paragraph
historian of Indian architecture. Without any,Paragraph
understanding of the functional or conceptual,Title
"basis of Indian architecture, Fergusson",Caption
classified and evaluated Indian buildings,Title
based on their formal properties and,Paragraph
proposed that Indian architecture periodically,Paragraph
went into decline and that it had thus to be,Paragraph
revived by contact with foreigners.,Paragraph
"For John Ruskin, the crucial index of",Paragraph
decline could be mapped by differentiating,Paragraph
between Indian craft and Indian art.,Paragraph
"While craftsmen, working in their native",Paragraph
"“innocence,” were seen as a positive example",Paragraph
"for the English, the Indian arts had, in his",Paragraph
"opinion, gone into a decline accompanied",Paragraph
by a downslide in morality. Fearing that,Paragraph
this decline might be due to the corrupting,Paragraph
"influence of Europeans, his prescription was",Paragraph
to educate Indian craftsmen in European,Title
aesthetics while preserving and reviving their,Paragraph
craft traditions. European art with Indian craft,Paragraph
in the service of modern colonial buildings,Title

“modern” Indian architecture.,Paragraph

At this time Bombay (Mumbai) emerged as,Paragraph
"the primary port of British India, especially",Paragraph
after the opening of the Suez Canal in,Paragraph
1869. The Northern blockade of Southern,Caption
cotton during the U.S. Civil War (1861-65),Paragraph
suddenly made Bombay the prime exporter,Paragraph

still the appropriate style for the buildings,Paragraph
"of British India; and in Victorian England,",Paragraph
"in the wake of Pugin’s critiques, Ruskinian",Paragraph
Gothic was championed as the special,Paragraph

Sir Gilbert Scott designed the University,Paragraph

Giotto’s campanile at Florence. With high-,Paragraph
"pitched roof, crenellations, towers, dormers,",Caption

The most spectacular of the Gothic Revival,Title

derives from Gilbert Scott's St. Pancreas,Paragraph
"Station in London, although with its fanciful",Paragraph
"Gothic detailing, polychromatic stone,",Paragraph
"decorative tile, marble, and stained glass,",Paragraph
it arguably exudes a certain un-English,Paragraph
"exuberance and excess, symptomatic",Title
perhaps of growing English interest in,Paragraph
Indian ornamental details. The largest,Paragraph
"British building in India at that time, Victoria",Paragraph
Terminus was a success with the English,Paragraph
"public and, quite appropriately given the",Paragraph
city’s success as a center of import and,Paragraph
"export, immediately became the iconic image",Paragraph

One of the most celebrated atternpted,Paragraph
translations of Arts and Crafts ideals into,Title
the practice of architecture in India was,Paragraph
undertaken by Colonel Swinton Jacobs. An,Paragraph
"engineer by training, Jacobs worked in the",Paragraph
"“princely state” of Jaipur, in Rajasthan, for",Paragraph
"more than forty years, frorn 1867 to 1912.",Paragraph
(Princely states were nominally independent,Paragraph
but governed by local rulers who were subject,Paragraph
to the oversight of the British Empire.) Jacobs,Paragraph
believed that draftsmen trained to accurately,Paragraph
copy full-size details from examples of,Paragraph
Indian architectural history would come to,Paragraph
appreciate the intrinsic quality of their own,Paragraph
culture. His Jeypore Portfolio of Architectural,Paragraph

Robert F. Chisholm (1840-1915),Caption
belonged to the generation of professional,Paragraph
architects who believed more in exploring,Paragraph
their professional freedom than in following,Paragraph
designs from ideological strictures. It was this,Paragraph
search that led him inevitably to eclecticism.,Paragraph
His unbuilt design for the Bombay Municipal,Paragraph
"Hall competition, for example, called for a",Paragraph
three-story volume with a large central dorne,Caption
that was based on the Taj Mahal. Chisholm,Paragraph
did not hesitate to open up the dome at,Paragraph
the base with tall arched openings that,Paragraph
necessitated an internal structural system,Title
made of steel. Smaller dares on octagonal,Paragraph
bases terminated the corners of the main,Paragraph
cubic volume. The corners were further,Paragraph
emphasized by the suggestion of turrets,Paragraph
"created by faceting the edges, with a string",Paragraph
of moldings close to the ground that flare,Paragraph
"out slightly at the base, as, for instance,",Paragraph
in the Hindu Victory Tower at Chittorgarh.,Caption
The overall conception of the massing is,Paragraph
reminiscent of Henry Hobson Richardson’s,Paragraph

supported by paired columns on the ground,Caption

by careful attention to detail.,Paragraph
Arts and Crafts enthusiasts and the,Title

Singh (r. 1835-80) brazenly continued to,Paragraph
"have his workmen build imitation, hybridized,",Paragraph
"European-style buildings, such as his Town",Paragraph

had used the typical colonial misrecognition,Paragraph
of his relationship with his feudatories to,Paragraph

California’s Arts and Crafts artists extolled,Title
the state’s natural beauty and were much,Paragraph
more intimately associated with the outdoors,Paragraph
than their counterparts in England and the,Paragraph

houses exploited the fine views and outdoor,Paragraph
living afforded by the natural settings. These,Paragraph
Arts and Crafts houses featured deliberate,Title
blurring of interior and exterior space through,Paragraph
"the use of decks, pergolas, porches, and",Paragraph

these houses gave way to an aesthetic of,Paragraph
"primitivism embodied, for example, in the",Paragraph

CENTRAL PARK,Title
Building on the Romantic associations with,Paragraph
nature as integral to the development of,Paragraph
"citizenship, by the early 19th century urban",Paragraph
parks were widely recognized as an important,Paragraph
indicator of a city's livability. Although not,Paragraph
included in the original Commissioners’,Paragraph
"Plan of 1811, New York City’s Central Park",Caption
(1853-83) was not only the nation’s first,Paragraph
"and largest urban park, but it also became",Paragraph
the model of American landscape design.,Paragraph
"Won in an open competition, Central Park",Caption
was the very first commission of the famous,Paragraph
landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted,Title
(1822-1903). Olmsted began his career,Paragraph
as a journalist and was influenced first by,Paragraph
"his dispatches from Europe, where he was",Paragraph
particularly impressed by the new urban,Paragraph
"parks, such as Birkenhead Park in England",Paragraph
"by Joseph Paxton of Crystal Palace fare,",Caption
and subsequently by his travels in the,Paragraph
"South, where he carefully documented and",Paragraph
commented on the adverse effects of the,Paragraph
slave economy.,Paragraph
Central Park was championed by Andrew,Paragraph
"Jackson Downing, an advocate of landscape",Paragraph
design and a famous critic of industrialization,Title
"and urbanization, as well as a mentor to",Paragraph
"Olmsted. Downing (1815-52), influenced",Paragraph
by Picturesque ideas as well as the growing,Paragraph
"moralism of the early Victorian era, saw",Paragraph
in landscapes more than just beauty. He,Paragraph
saw the garden as something more than a,Paragraph
convenient stage for setting up monuments,Paragraph
"to heroes, as it was at Stowe Gardens in",Paragraph
"Buckinghamshire, England. Landscape, so",Caption
"Downing held, strengthened character and",Paragraph
supported the integrity of the farnily. The,Paragraph
"intimate house garden, he argued, served",Paragraph
as a civilizing and protective veil around the,Paragraph
house and helped it to blend as naturally as,Paragraph
"possible into the landscape. At the time, the",Paragraph
area around most large cities in the United,Paragraph
States had been radically deforested to make,Paragraph
"way for farms. In 1845, when Henry David",Paragraph
Thoreau lived for two years in solitude next to,Paragraph
Walden Pond in Massachusetts in an attempt,Title
"to immerse himself in nature, the pond was",Paragraph
one of the few areas for many miles around,Paragraph
surrounded by trees. Downing believed that,Paragraph
one could bring nature to the city in the form,Paragraph
"of parks, but only if they were big enough to",Paragraph
simulate a landscape—albeit one that had,Paragraph
been tamed and brought into balance with,Paragraph
human needs.,Paragraph
When Downing was killed in a stearnboat,Paragraph
"explosion on the Hudson River in 1852,",Paragraph
Olmsted joined with Calvert Vaux to submit,Paragraph
the competition entry for the park. Vaux was,Paragraph
an English architect who had come to the,Paragraph
United States to work with Downing. The,Paragraph
"3.4-square-kilometer park, in the heart of",Caption
"Manhattan, was built on land occupied by",Paragraph
"free slaves and Irish immigrants, who were",Paragraph
"forcibly evicted. The park was not raw nature,",Paragraph
but a carefully constructed vision of it. This,Paragraph
"involved vast amounts of cut and fill work, the",Paragraph
"planting of millions of trees, the construction",Paragraph
"of thirty-six bridges, and the creation of",Paragraph
"meadows, forests, hilltop lookouts, castles,",Paragraph
"sheep farms, skating rinks, and eateries.",Paragraph
In keeping with the Romantic Picturesque,Paragraph
"tradition, a flock of pedigreed Dorset sheep",Paragraph
were maintained in a specially designated,Paragraph
meadow. Two major reservoirs stored water,Paragraph
for the city. Underneath was an elaborate,Paragraph
drainage system.,Paragraph
Olmsted and Vaux were at constant,Paragraph
loggerheads with the park’s commissioners,Title
to ensure that the park was maintained as a,Paragraph
democratic space accessible to all. Although,Paragraph
"first years, it went into severe decline around",Paragraph
"the turn of the century. In 1934, Robert",Paragraph
Moses cleaned up and restored the park as,Paragraph
part of his drive to transform New York City.,Paragraph
"Olmsted, Vaux and Company, founded",Paragraph
"in 1861, also designed parks in Milwaukee,",Paragraph
"Wisconsin; Buffalo, New York; and other",Paragraph
cities. The firm was inherited by Olmsted's,Paragraph
Central Park attracted 10 million visitors in its <),Paragraph

"Georges-Eugéne Haussmann (1809-91),",Paragraph

"approaches—as in Rome under Sixtus V,",Paragraph

boulevards in relationship to major buildings,Paragraph

new streets were laid out according to,Paragraph

lower classes.,Paragraph
"17.37 Paris Opera House, France",Caption
Though there was some atternpt to integrate,Paragraph
"the new streets with the old, little was spared",Paragraph

The new streets were lined with apartments,Paragraph
and provided with sewage pipes and gas,Paragraph
"lines. To forestall conflagrations, the use of",Paragraph
"stone for buildings, once the privilege of the",Paragraph
"rich, was now common throughout the new",Paragraph
parts of the city. Haussmann’s Paris would,Paragraph
become the model for cities around the,Paragraph

"and Saigon. “Haussmannization,” which",Paragraph
"impeded effective blockading of streets, is",Paragraph
sometimes blamed for the suppression of the,Paragraph

One of the centerpieces of the new Paris,Caption
"was the Opera House (1861-75), set at the",Paragraph

a young architect who was only thirty-six,Paragraph
years old when he won the competition.,Paragraph

THE PASSAGE,Title
"Besides train stations and industrial fairs, the",Paragraph
building type that perhaps best epitomized,Paragraph
the Industrial Revolution and its new culture,Title
of mass consumption was the shopping,Paragraph
gallery. These buildings were places where,Paragraph
one could see firsthand not only the wealth,Paragraph
of the global marketplace but also the use,Paragraph
"of new building materials, metal and glass.",Paragraph
"At the beginning of the 19th century, most",Paragraph
shops differed very little from those of,Paragraph
medieval times—a window or counter faced,Paragraph
"the street, and there was a small enclosure",Paragraph
where business could be transacted. The,Paragraph
fall in the price of glass made large shop,Title
"windows possible, and they appeared at",Paragraph
"the end of the 1820s in Landon, Paris, and",Paragraph
"lew York. In Paris, shopping streets—called",Paragraph
galeries or passages—were soon designed,Paragraph
with rows of shops under a single glazed roof.,Paragraph
"By the end of the 19th century, passages",Paragraph
or their equivalents could be found in most,Paragraph
European cities. At first they were on a single,Paragraph
"loor, but soon they were built on two or",Paragraph
more levels. They provided security for shop,Paragraph
owners as well as convenience for shoppers:,Paragraph
most 19th-century cities were noisy and,Paragraph
"chaotic, and the streets unpaved. Passages",Paragraph
offered protected enclaves for bourgeois,Paragraph
patrons.,Paragraph
Marking the zenith of this building type,Paragraph
was the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in,Paragraph
"Milan, a building that became a symbol of",Paragraph
the young nation. Its entrance was located,Paragraph
"facing the piazza in front of the Duomo,",Paragraph
the facade of which had only been finished,Paragraph
in 1806. The planning of the piazza had,Paragraph
"Stalled for decades, but it was revived with",Paragraph
the unification of Italy in 1859. Almost,Paragraph
irmmediately the designing of the galleria was,Paragraph
"put into motion, and when it was opened",Paragraph
"in 1867, it was seen as an engineering and",Paragraph
urban marvel.,Paragraph
"The building, whose four wings meet at",Paragraph
"a great, glasse",Title
"on the interior,",Paragraph
existing structures around it. There are seven,Paragraph
"floors, not including the cellar, with a network",Paragraph
of concealed intersecting supports that,Paragraph
"dome, is completely regular",Paragraph
ut it dovetails with the older,Paragraph
allow for a flexible use of space. Staircases,Paragraph
are located at the rear and are accessible,Paragraph
through courtyards so as not to disturb,Paragraph
the visual unity of the facades. The main,Paragraph
staircases are located at the reentrant angles,Paragraph
of the crossings. The third floor is reserved,Paragraph
"for club rooms, offices, and studios, while the",Paragraph
uppermost floors are residential. More than,Paragraph
"just a shopping arcade, this building is an",Paragraph
urban entity in itself.,Paragraph

ECOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS,Title
"Throughout the 19th century, Europe's",Paragraph
prime school for the study of architecture,Title
was the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris.,Paragraph
"Though intended for French citizens, it was",Paragraph
by the end of the 19th century visited by,Paragraph
"students from around the world, creating a",Paragraph
cadre of devotees who spread the school's,Paragraph
pedagogical system and architectural style to,Title
places around the globe. Its influence could,Paragraph
still be felt in American architectural schools,Paragraph
well into the 1940s. The Beaux-Arts was,Paragraph
originally founded as the Académie Royale,Paragraph
d’Architecture in Paris in 1671 by Jean-,Caption
"Baptiste Colbert, minister of Louis XIV, who",Paragraph
envisioned it as a place that would create,Paragraph
the talent necessary for the king’s cornplex,Title
building program. The French Revolution,Title
"ended the royal acadernies, but in 1803,",Paragraph
"architectural education resumed, mainly",Paragraph
to prepare students for state-sponsored,Paragraph
architectural competitions. The founding,Paragraph
of the Société Centrale des Architects in,Paragraph
1840 made architecture into an academic,Paragraph
profession similar to law and medicine. The,Paragraph
Société ended the aristocratic system of,Paragraph
patronage. It was also the death knell of the,Paragraph
gentleman architect (though that tradition,Paragraph
had always been stronger in England than in,Paragraph
"France). This is important to note, because",Paragraph
even though the academic style of the French,Paragraph
was much criticized by the moderns of the,Paragraph
"20th century, the Ecole elevated architecture",Title
to an autonomous and structured discipline.,Paragraph
With that autonomy came new and,Paragraph
complex theoretical questions about the,Title
nature of architectural production. Should,Paragraph
one use new materials like steel and glass?,Paragraph
"And if so, how? What is the relationship",Paragraph
"between the identity of a nation, its history,",Paragraph
and its architecture? By mid-century these,Paragraph
issues became quite divisive. On the one,Paragraph
side stood defenders of idealized classicism,Title
such as Quatremére de Quincy; on the other,Paragraph
"were the Romantics such as Henri Labrouste,",Paragraph
with their flexible understanding of history.,Paragraph
The conflict broke into the open with the,Paragraph
appointment of Eugene-Emmanuel Viollet-le-,Caption
Duc in 1863 as professor of the history of art,Paragraph
and aesthetics. He supported the use of iron,Paragraph
"in buildings, which many French architects",Paragraph
resisted.,Paragraph

HENRY HOBSON RICHARDSON,Title
"By the late 1830s, the Greek Revival had",Paragraph
become without question the adopted style,Title
"of the United States, and it remained so up",Paragraph
"to the Civil War. The simplicity, ideological",Paragraph
"coherence, and the ease with which its forms",Paragraph
could be copied in brick and wood by local,Paragraph
carpenters contributed greatly to its success.,Paragraph
It had little competition from the Gothic,Paragraph
"style, which in the United States, unlike in",Paragraph
"Europe, had few major representatives. The",Paragraph
result was a fluid movement from the Greek,Paragraph
Revival to a French-derived style known,Paragraph
as Second Empire. With its compositional,Paragraph
emphasis on vertical pavilions and classically,Paragraph
"derived ornamentation, the Second Empire",Paragraph
remained an important subcurrent until well,Paragraph
into the advent of modernism. In the 1880s,Paragraph
"and 1890s, a group of architects began to",Paragraph
"chart their own way, however, bringing out",Paragraph
latent ideas of the Picturesque while trying,Title
to match this aesthetic with the needs of,Paragraph
rising the mercantile class. These architects,Paragraph
"were Frank Furness in Philadelphia, Louis",Paragraph
"Sullivan in Chicago, and Henry Hobson",Title
Richardson in Boston. All developed very,Paragraph
distinctive approaches. Furness brought to,Paragraph
the United States many of Viollet-le-Duc’s,Paragraph
ideas about integrating iron into design.,Paragraph
Sullivan stressed bold simplicity combined,Title
with rich ornamentation in his buildings. And,Paragraph
Richardson's work from the late 1870s to the,Paragraph
mid 1890s came to be seen by many as a,Paragraph
style unto itself.,Paragraph
When Richardson (1838-86) was young he,Paragraph
"had intended to become a civil engineer,",Paragraph
but he switched to architecture while,Paragraph
"studying at Harvard. In 1859, he began",Paragraph
to study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and,Paragraph
remained in Paris for five years. Because,Paragraph
"of his Parisian training, Richardson was",Paragraph
well suited to serve the needs of the rising,Paragraph
Class of new businessmen who wanted to,Paragraph
see their success endorsed by the currently,Paragraph
fashionable style of cosmopolitan Paris. But,Paragraph
"by the 1870s, Richardson was increasingly",Paragraph
drawn to the English medieval style and to,Paragraph
"the Picturesque, attempting to synthesize",Paragraph
their disparate and even contradictory,Paragraph
"aspects. Richardson's plans, for example,",Paragraph
maintain the clarity typical of the Beaux-,Paragraph
"Arts, while his attention to the tactility and",Paragraph
color of the building’s stone surface evoke,Paragraph
a tactility more in line with Queen Anne,Paragraph
style and Ruskinian Gothic. Richardson,Caption
closely collaborated with landscape architect,Paragraph
Frederick Law Olmsted on many of his,Paragraph
projects.,Paragraph
In 1872 Richardson achieved national,Paragraph
prominence by having been selected to,Paragraph
build Trinity Church in Boston. It was set,Paragraph
"on a triangular site, designed in a soft",Paragraph
pink limestone accented by dark brown,Paragraph
"stones for the columns, entablatures, and",Caption

movement.,Paragraph
Richardson was fortunate that his.,Paragraph
mature career coincided with the rise of,Paragraph
the American public library movement.,Paragraph
The flowering of public education and the,Title
spread of interest in cultural developments,Title
in England and the United States led to the,Paragraph
creation of many towns’ lending libraries. It,Paragraph
was a highly successful experiment in making,Paragraph
the printed word accessible to a general,Paragraph

THE GLOBAL BUNGALOW,Title
One of the most visible manifestations of the,Paragraph
global colonial economy was the development,Title
and spread of the bungalow. The bungalow,Paragraph
(the word derives from the Bengali word,Paragraph
bangla) was first used by the English,Paragraph
colonists in India as a type of garden and,Paragraph
plantation house. Most had a single ridge roof,Paragraph
"that overhung the house, creating a porch",Paragraph
called the verandah (originally a Hindi word).,Paragraph
The verandah served as an intermediate,Paragraph
space where colonizer and colonized could,Paragraph
interact. In tropical climates it was also the,Paragraph
most comfortable space of the house. In,Paragraph
"time, bungalows added an entrance porch,",Paragraph
which had to be large enough to receive a,Paragraph
carriage. The interior space was designed,Paragraph
around a central room with bedrooms directly,Caption
"off to the sides, and toilets and kitchens in",Paragraph
the back so that they could be serviced by,Paragraph
the local staff. Servant quarters were built,Paragraph
at a distance in the back of the garden.,Paragraph
The colonial bungalow spread as a type,Paragraph
throughout the tropical colonies in the late,Paragraph
18th and early 19th centuries.,Paragraph
"As a symbol of the good life, the bungalow",Paragraph
was exported back to England and soon,Paragraph
"could be found in the United States as well,",Paragraph
"in the form of the detached, single-family",Paragraph
residential dwelling that could be easily,Paragraph
built on small parcels. Climate and lifestyle,Paragraph
dictates did not allow the core properties of,Paragraph
"the colonial bungalow to be exported, but its",Paragraph
17.58 Typical block of bungalows,Caption
image was variously translated as it spread.,Paragraph
The noncolonial bungalow was usually a,Paragraph
single-story house (though sometime it,Paragraph
"had two floors) of modest scale, with a low",Paragraph
overhanging roof and a porch running along,Caption
its front. Many subcategories evolved. The,Paragraph
California bungalows—which were among,Paragraph
"the earliest in the United States, dating from",Paragraph
about the 1880s onward—cormmonly have,Paragraph
"wood shingles, horizontal siding, or stucco",Paragraph
"exteriors, as well as brick chirmneys. The",Paragraph
"so-called Chicago bungalow, which was",Paragraph
"popular between 1910 and 1940, was often",Paragraph
"made of brick. In many cases, the bungalow",Paragraph
was inexpensive to build and did not need,Paragraph
"an architect. Furthermore, with its space-",Paragraph
"saving layout, it appealed to middle-class",Paragraph
owners who could not afford live-in servants.,Paragraph
The kitchen was compact and located next,Paragraph
to the dining room. The walls were usually,Paragraph
"wallpapered, whereas the trim for the doors",Paragraph
and windows was dark-stained oak.,Paragraph
"In the 1880s, the bungalow became",Paragraph
associated with the Arts and Crafts,Title
"movement, and indeed many bungalows",Paragraph
were built in the so-called American,Paragraph
"Craftsman style, which was a reaction against",Paragraph
the overdecorated aesthetic of the Victorian,Paragraph
era. Though the Arts and Crafts emphasized,Paragraph
"the handmade over the mass-produced,",Paragraph
and some early bungalows followed in this,Paragraph
"aesthetic, the bungalow was soon nothing",Paragraph
"less than an industrialized product. In fact,",Paragraph
"by the turn of the 20th century, an entire",Paragraph
house could be ordered through catalogues;,Paragraph
the bungalow was then shipped by rail,Paragraph
"or boat to be assembled on-site. Doors,",Paragraph
"windows, and built-in furnishings such",Paragraph
"as bookcases, desks, and folding beds",Paragraph
could also be purchased from mail-order,Paragraph
catalogues. The bungalow was spread as part,Paragraph
"of the suburbanization of the American city,",Paragraph
with whole bungalow districts appearing in,Paragraph
many U.S. cities.,Paragraph
SHINGLE STYLE,Title
"Unique to the United States, and parallel",Paragraph
"to the Arts and Crafts movement, but more",Paragraph
"closely allied with the Queen Anne style,",Paragraph
was the development of what is now called,Paragraph
the Shingle Style. Houses designed in this,Paragraph
manner—often as summer homes for the,Paragraph
New England elite—show an inventiveness in,Paragraph
"plan, with elements not merely touching each",Paragraph
other but seeming to pass through or overlap,Paragraph
with each other. The firm that developed this,Paragraph
"style more than any other was McKim, Mead",Paragraph
"& White (founded 1879), which eventually",Paragraph
became one of the leading design firms in,Paragraph
the United States.,Paragraph
"William Rutherford Mead (1846-1928),",Paragraph
"who had an affinity for the Renaissance,",Paragraph
and Stanford White (1853-1906) had little,Paragraph
"formal training, but they worked their way",Paragraph
up as apprentices. Charles Follen McKim,Caption
"(1847-1909), by contrast, had studied at the",Paragraph
a SS,Title
"17.59 Isaac Bell House, Newport, Rhode Island",Caption
Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Between the three they,Paragraph
produced a style of architecture that brought,Paragraph
out the best in each of them. One of their,Paragraph
innovations in their Shingle Style homes was,Paragraph
to take the rooms of the servants’ quarters,Paragraph
out from under the attic and place thern,Paragraph
"in a compact block or wing, against which",Paragraph
the more openly designed living rooms of,Paragraph
the first floor were contrasted. This can be,Paragraph
seen in the Isaac Bell House (1882-83) in,Caption
"Newport, Rhode Island, where the staircase",Caption
was situated in a large room that served as a,Paragraph
circulation center and as a spatial extension,Title
of the neighboring study and drawing,Title
rooms. This makes it different from the more,Paragraph
controlled and boxy spaces of Arts and,Title
Crafts houses. Even though it was common,Paragraph
to raise the first floor above the level of the,Paragraph
"ground, the use of porches made the house",Paragraph
appear as if were resting on an elevated,Paragraph
"terrace, protected from the sun and rain by",Paragraph
generously proportioned overhangs and roofs.,Paragraph
The vertical surfaces of the houses were,Paragraph
"completely clad in wooden shingles, using",Paragraph
a variety of possible patterns to differentiate,Paragraph
certain elements like the gable front. The,Paragraph
interior surfaces were usually covered with,Paragraph
dark wooden paneling in combination with,Caption
"stucco, usually wallpapered but sometimes",Paragraph
left plain.,Paragraph
"In contrast, the Watts Sherman House (1874)",Paragraph
"in Newport, Rhode Island, by Henry Hobson",Caption
"Richardson, is closer to the Queen Anne and",Paragraph
the Arts and Crafts styles. The rooms are,Paragraph
arranged in a more formal way and less open,Paragraph

UNITED STATES,Title
"The Land Grant Act of 1861, signed into law",Paragraph
"by President Abraham Lincoln, had a major",Paragraph
impact on the history of U.S. education. It,Paragraph
stipulated that each state was to have its own,Paragraph

"shared certain basic goals, including the",Paragraph
"promotion of practical education, the right",Title
"of education for all social classes, and the",Paragraph
reedom of students to choose their course,Title
of study. By the 1870s almost every state,Paragraph
ad one such university. Among the earliest,Paragraph
"were Cornell University in Ithaca, New York,",Paragraph
"and the University of California, Berkeley.",Paragraph
"By the turn of the century, dozens of",Paragraph
"private universities had also been built, and",Paragraph
ecause of the rapid professionalization of,Paragraph
"the sciences in the 1880s, a new generation",Paragraph
of technical institutions emerged. The,Paragraph
"Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),",Paragraph

soon there were also the Illinois Institute of,Paragraph
echnology (1890); the Carnegie Technical,Paragraph
"nstitute (1900), which later became",Paragraph
Carnegie Mellon University; and the California,Title
Polytechnic State University (1901). The net,Paragraph

and technical universities was a university,Paragraph
system unique in the world.,Paragraph

This led to the design of campuses with,Paragraph

atmosphere such as the rural environs,Paragraph

Universities built in this period by the,Paragraph

that era. Designs came in three basic styles:,Paragraph

and sports; examples can be found at,Paragraph
Princeton University in New Jersey and at,Title

no central quad but a loose arrangement of,Paragraph
buildings in the landscape. The Neoclassical,Paragraph
was also frequently used—as for example,Paragraph

Art Nouveau had parallels with the Arts,Paragraph
"and Crafts movement in England, but there",Paragraph
were important differences. Whereas the,Paragraph
Arts and Crafts movement aimed to heal,Title
the alienation that had arisen between,Paragraph
man and his products as a consequence,Title
"of industrialization, Art Nouveau stressed",Paragraph
creativity. While the products promoted,Paragraph
by Arts and Crafts were by no means,Paragraph
"inexpensive, the movement carried with it",Paragraph
spiritual and therapeutic connotations and,Title
a back-to-the-land naturalness that was,Paragraph
ostensibly accessible to all; Art Nouveau,Paragraph
appealed mainly to the wealthy.,Paragraph
"Victor Horta, active in Belgiurn, was",Paragraph
probably the greatest of the Art Nouveau,Paragraph
"architects. In Maison Tassel (1893), Horta",Caption
"brought out the expressive quality of iron,",Paragraph
which he used both inside and outside of,Paragraph
the house in the form of ribbons that appear,Paragraph
"weightless, spiraling and twisting into space.",Paragraph
Since the floors were supported for the most,Paragraph
"part by iron columns, rooms could open into",Paragraph
one another and be distributed in a novel,Paragraph
manner. Horta rejected the standard Brussels,Paragraph
"building type, with the staircase to one side of",Paragraph
"the building. Instead, the staircase, combined",Paragraph
"with a lightwell, is placed at the center. This",Paragraph
allowed hirn to vary the elevations of the,Paragraph

RISE OF PROFESSIONALISM,Title
Medicine and law were among the first,Paragraph
"fields to be professionalized, starting around",Paragraph
"1860. Architecture lagged behind, long",Caption
considered to be more of a gentleman’s,Paragraph
occupation. By the middle of the 19th,Paragraph
"century, the professionalization of the field",Title
"was gradually winning converts, especially",Paragraph
since the Beaux-Arts system was so,Paragraph
"successful. In England, The Royal Institute",Paragraph
of British Architects (RIBA) was founded in,Paragraph
"1834, and with it came increased attention",Paragraph
"on the education of the architect, with the",Paragraph
RIBA sponsoring lectures and publications,Title
on a variety of subjects. Professionalism,Paragraph
"discouraged ad hoc, on-the-spot solutions",Paragraph
in favor of precise architectural drawings.,Paragraph
This is clearly demonstrated in the case of,Paragraph
"William Butterfield (1814-1900), who is",Paragraph
often associated with the aesthetics of John,Paragraph
Ruskin. The first church he built required,Paragraph
only nine drawings; but for the chancel of St.,Caption
"Mark’s Dundela in Belfast (completed 1891),",Paragraph
the contract was accompanied by about,Paragraph
"forty drawings, including working details and",Paragraph
fittings down to the boot scrapers. The new,Paragraph
prerequisite for explicitness such as detailed,Paragraph
specifications and drawings had its effect on,Paragraph
"the contractual relationship between client,",Paragraph
"architect, and craftsmen. By the middle of",Paragraph
"the 20th century, a building of any magnitude",Paragraph
would require perhaps one thousand,Paragraph
"drawings, accompanied by a detailed",Paragraph
specifications.,Paragraph
"In the United States, the American",Paragraph
Institute of Architects (AIA) had already,Paragraph
"been formed in 1836. But, interrupted",Paragraph
by the Civil War and handicapped by the,Paragraph

and the commensurate communications,Title
"difficulties, architectural professionalism did",Paragraph

"the Tarsney Act was never fully implemented,",Paragraph
the status of the professional—as opposed to,Paragraph

THE GARDEN CITY MOVEMENT,Title
"By the late 19th century, the great new",Paragraph
industrial Victorian cities of the world like New,Title
"York had, despite their significant financial",Paragraph
"success and clout, become overcrowded,",Paragraph
"dirty, and violent. Many in the middle and",Paragraph
upper classes preferred to turn their backs,Paragraph
on the city for the comfort and security of the,Title
"suburbs, with their socially and economically",Paragraph
stratified neighborhoods. The results shaped,Paragraph
the debate about the nature of a city. On one,Paragraph
"hand, there was the uncomfortable density",Paragraph
"of life, the cagey interaction between the",Paragraph
"classes, and the persistence of poverty and",Title
grime; but side by side with these negatives,Paragraph
were the benefits of urbanity: the centers of,Paragraph
"learning, the theaters, the libraries, and the",Title
concert halls. For every theory that decried,Paragraph
"the city as an uncontrollable behemoth, there",Paragraph
were those who were deplored the blandness,Paragraph
and false security of the suburbs.,Paragraph
It was in an attempt to solve this,Paragraph
controversy that Ebenezer Howard wrote his,Paragraph
book Tomorrow: A Peaceful Path to Real,Title
"Reform (1892), republished as Garden Cities",Paragraph
of To-morrow (1902). The city suggested,Paragraph
therein was to have the virtues of both,Paragraph
"the city and the suburbs, but in a highly",Paragraph
controlled way that controlled or abolished,Title
the contested extremes and made for,Paragraph
pleasant surroundings. Howard's garden city,Caption
was not a suburb but a type of mini-city with,Paragraph

no mere village either. The size was set at,Paragraph
"a comfortable 6,000 acres, which were not",Paragraph
owned by individual citizens but held in a,Paragraph
"trust. The town was to consume only 1,000",Paragraph
"acres at the center, where there would be a",Paragraph
"park with public buildings, surrounded by",Paragraph
shops. Running all around this central park,Paragraph
would be a wide glass arcade or “crystal,Paragraph
palace” where purchases could be made.,Paragraph
The population of the town was to be kept,Paragraph
"at 30,000. Factories, warehouses, and the",Paragraph
"like, fronting on a circular railway, were",Paragraph
"on the outer ring of the town, and beyond",Paragraph
that were the farms. Since there was no,Paragraph
"land ownership, the town was run as a",Paragraph
corporation. The rents would provide income,Paragraph
"for the company, which would then be",Paragraph
invested back into the community.,Paragraph
Howard's vision did not arise in a vacuum.,Paragraph
There had been already several attempts,Paragraph
"to create somewhat similar towns, but most",Paragraph
of these were factory towns built by factory,Paragraph
owners who wanted to convenient access to,Paragraph
the workforce. The societal benefit in such a,Paragraph
solution was the creation of a stable working,Paragraph
class. The “company stores” often associated,Paragraph
with such schemes were run by the factory,Paragraph
"owners. Port Sunlight (1888), for example,",Paragraph
"not far frorn Liverpool, was founded by the",Paragraph
owners of a soap manufacturing business;,Paragraph
in addition to factory-owned stores and,Paragraph
"businesses, the town had schools, churches,",Paragraph
and training centers.,Paragraph
"Letchworth (1903) north of London, was",Paragraph
the first garden city to be actually built on,Paragraph
Howard's model. Though it did not develop,Paragraph

"factories like the Spirella Company (1912),",Paragraph

Between 1870 and 1910 the global economic,Title
situation changed considerably. England,Paragraph
was at such heights that its slide was not,Paragraph
"immediately noticeable, but by 1900,",Paragraph
England had to share its economic power,Paragraph
"with the United States and, increasingly, with",Paragraph
the economic might of Germany. The rise of,Paragraph
Germany was not accidental. Its educational,Paragraph
system was first rate: by the end of the,Paragraph
"century, Germany possessed a literacy rate",Paragraph
"of 99.9 percent, an educational level that",Paragraph
"provided Germany with engineers, chemists,",Paragraph
"opticians, skilled workers for its factories,",Paragraph
"skilled managers, knowledgeable farmers,",Paragraph
"and skilled military personnel. In comparison,",Paragraph
"literacy in Britain, France, Norway, Sweden,",Paragraph
and Australia was 30 to 50 percent. France,Paragraph
"was certainly the world’s cultural leader, but",Paragraph
by 1880 it produced only 7.8 percent of,Paragraph
"world manufacturing output, and by 1900.",Paragraph
"this had dropped to 6.8 percent; that year,",Paragraph
Italy had only a 2.5 percent share of the,Paragraph
"global market. Meanwhile, Germany’s output",Paragraph
had risen to 13.2 percent due to its greatly,Paragraph

One of the consequences was that Beaux-,Paragraph

this phenomenon.,Paragraph
These global realities left their most,Paragraph

"20th century, particularly in the United",Paragraph
"States, it is the skyscraper. It did not appear",Paragraph
"suddenly, for it took considerable time for",Paragraph
"its function, production, design, and even",Paragraph
its purpose to be synthesized. The most,Paragraph
significant contributing factor was the,Paragraph
"improved quality of steel, which allowed",Paragraph
prefabricated elements to be brought to the,Paragraph
construction site and erected with relative,Paragraph
rapidity. The technology of steel framing was,Paragraph
"well established by 1890; in fact, during",Paragraph
"construction, many buildings of that time",Paragraph
would look as modern as buildings of today.,Paragraph
Questions about how to design the steel,Title
"frame were, however, the least problematic",Paragraph
part of the building. Elevators needed to be,Paragraph
improved and their operation guaranteed. The,Paragraph
"same was true of the plumbing, electrical,",Paragraph
and heating systerns and the integration of,Title
all these systems with each other. At the,Paragraph
"1900 Paris Exposition, the designers of the",Caption
"U.S. exhibition chose to emphasize just this,",Paragraph
using as an example the recently erected,Paragraph
eighteen-story Broadway Chambers Building,Caption
in New York City. The exhibition presented a,Paragraph
4-meter-high model of the building with an,Caption
exterior skin in plaster that could be removed,Paragraph
"to show the underlying steel frame, complete",Paragraph
"with mechanical systems, boilers, pipes, and",Paragraph
furnaces. It was an eye-opening lesson in an,Paragraph
emerging architectural ideal.,Paragraph
"From a financial standpoint, the idea was",Paragraph
"relatively straightforward. An investor, typically",Paragraph
"a bank, insurance agency, or newspaper,",Paragraph
would finance the building and use it as,Paragraph
"home office, occupying the lower, walk-in",Paragraph
floor while renting out the rest to business,Paragraph
tenants. Besides having a stately home,Paragraph
"office, the owner would have made a good",Paragraph
investment in a booming rental market hungry,Paragraph
for representative office space. The owner,Paragraph
company’s logo would be affixed to the top of,Paragraph
the building and beam forth its message.,Paragraph
The Woolworth Building (1911-13) in,Caption
"New York City, designed by Cass Gilbert",Caption
"in a Gothic style, was at the time of its",Paragraph
construction the world’s tallest building. It,Paragraph
"was built for Frank W. Woolworth, owner",Paragraph
of the famous five-and-dime chain. The,Paragraph
whole was sheathed in elaborate terra-cotta,Paragraph
tiles with equally elaborate Gothic-inspired,Paragraph
detailing. The interior lobby had mosaic-,Paragraph
covered vaults.,Paragraph
This commercialization of styles,Title
resulted in an increased need to outdo the,Paragraph
competitor. Many early designers assumed,Paragraph
that a classical or Gothic front was still the,Paragraph
"appropriate response, but in Chicago, which",Paragraph
in the 1890s had more tall buildings than any,Paragraph
"other city in the world, a group of designers",Paragraph
were beginning to challenge that notion.,Paragraph
Among the most innovative was the firm of,Paragraph
"Daniel Burnham & Company, which designed",Paragraph
the fifteen-story steel-and-glass Reliance,Caption
"Building in 1894, with the principal design",Paragraph
credits going to John Root and Charles B.,Caption

Instead of the heavy cornice that is seen,Paragraph
in buildings like Dankmar Adler and Louis,Paragraph

"Missouri (1890), the Reliance Building is",Paragraph
"topped with a thin square lid, and the top",Paragraph
"floor, which houses machinery for heating",Paragraph
"and other utilities, converts into a type of",Paragraph
"frieze. Bay windows reach out into space,",Paragraph
giving the building an inner dynamic. The,Paragraph
insistent verticality of the Wainwright Building,Caption
has been replaced by a layered look; but,Paragraph
"instead of appearing heavy, one floor almost",Paragraph
"seems to float over the next, assisted in this",Paragraph
"effect by the building’s spandrels, which are",Paragraph
lined with delicately ornamented white terra-,Paragraph
cotta tiles that give it an ethereal presence.,Paragraph
Wrigley Building,Title
The Reliance Building was more the,Paragraph
exception than the rule. A look of modernity,Paragraph
"in tall buildings was not insisted upon and,",Paragraph
"in fact, went counter to the idea that these",Paragraph
buildings were meant to advertise old wealth,Paragraph
"and culture. For that very reason, most",Paragraph
tall buildings after the World’s Columbian,Title
Exposition were clad in historical styles. A,Paragraph
typical example is the headquarters building,Paragraph
"of AT&T, the largest and most innovative",Paragraph
"17.81 Reliance Building, Chicago",Caption
"corporation in the United States, in New York",Paragraph
(1912). It was designed by the Beaux-Arts—,Paragraph
"trained architect William Welles Bosworth, an",Paragraph
"American who had also studied at MIT, one",Paragraph
of the first institutions in the United States,Paragraph
to model itself on the Beaux-Arts system of,Paragraph
education. Corporate representation at the,Paragraph
turn of the century was a form of modernity,Paragraph
"in its own right. In that sense, the skyscraper",Paragraph
"was similar to the train stations of the 1860s,",Paragraph
"and much like the train stations of the period,",Paragraph
skyscrapers competed against each other in,Paragraph
size and lavishness.,Paragraph
It is often argued that Beaux-Arts,Paragraph
modernism survived so long in the United,Paragraph
States because of the hold that the system,Paragraph
had on acaderne—but that is not the,Paragraph
only reason. Beaux-Arts modernism had,Paragraph
become the language par excellence of,Paragraph
corporations eager to promote themselves.,Paragraph
Historical awareness and reference to great,Title
architectural accomplishments of the past,Title
were an integral part of this ambition. That,Paragraph
was the reason Bosworth chose to model his,Paragraph
columns in the lobby of the AT&T building,Caption

"Antonio Gaudi (1852-1926), despite his",Paragraph
"obvious talent, was not a particularly good",Paragraph
student at the school of architecture at,Paragraph
Barcelona. The Beaux-Arts academic,Paragraph
styles and rationalization of construction,Title
did not appeal to him; he preferred history,Paragraph
and economy. After a period in which he,Paragraph
"apprenticed with various local architects, he",Paragraph
set out on his own. One of the characteristics,Paragraph
of his work was his use of color. His,Paragraph
"architecture, more than any produced in the",Paragraph
"20th century, must be experienced in person",Paragraph
in order to be fully understood. Le Corbusier,Paragraph
and Frank Lloyd Wright were consummate,Paragraph
"colorists, but for Wright, color was a question",Paragraph
"of patina, and for Le Corbusier, color served",Paragraph

Islamic past. Gaudi experimented with,Paragraph
"colored stone and glass, polychrome glazes,",Paragraph

Despite the seemingly impromptu character,Paragraph
"of his buildings, Gaudi was very much a",Paragraph
"perfectionist, working out every project",Title
in great detail. The facade of Palau GUell,Caption
(1886-90) was completely redrawn twenty-,Paragraph
"eight times, and some of its details changed",Paragraph
completely. This explains why it took him four,Paragraph
years to perfect the columns of the nave of,Paragraph

of Gaudi’s forms might make his work seem,Paragraph
"preeminently sculptural, but according to",Paragraph

material—and only then form. Already in his,Paragraph
"first works, he was creating hyperbolic and",Paragraph
"trumpet-shaped helical forms, but always",Paragraph

FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT,Title
The long and complex career of Frank Lloyd,Title
Wright (1867-1959) can be divided into,Paragraph
several phases: from the time he opened,Paragraph
his office in 1893 to the Robie House,Paragraph
(1908-10); the Taliesin phase (1911-14); the,Paragraph
period from the design of the Imperial Hotel,Caption
to Falling Water (1934) and Taliesin West,Title
(1938); and the period from the Johnson,Paragraph
Wax Administration Building (1936) to the,Caption
Marin County Civic Center (1957) and the,Paragraph
end of his life in 1959. His production was,Paragraph
vast and includes about four hundred houses,Paragraph
and a dozen or so other major buildings. By,Paragraph
the time Wright designed the Robie House in,Paragraph
"Chicago, his style had become quite distinct",Paragraph
when compared to the Victorian mansions,Paragraph
"that were then in vogue. Furthermore, unlike",Paragraph
other architects who changed style slowly or,Paragraph
"at the behest of a client, Wright's break with",Paragraph
tradition was driven by a personal stylistic,Paragraph
development in search for ever greater,Title
"abstraction. At the Robie House, its Shingle",Paragraph
Style origins can still be seen in the service,Paragraph
"rooms, which are packed into a massive",Paragraph
block against which the building rests. The,Paragraph
hip roofs have been flattened so that they,Paragraph
practically disappear. The fireplace has now,Paragraph
become the spatial and visual hub of the,Paragraph
"building, freed from encroaching walls and",Paragraph
linked only to a staircase.,Paragraph
The house is screened against the street,Paragraph
and no staircase is visible; it seems almost,Paragraph
"defensive while, at the same tirne the design",Paragraph
emphasizes the linearity of the street. The,Paragraph
bands of white stone parapets form a series,Paragraph
of striations that rise to meet the dark-,Paragraph
"edged roof lines, with the bands of windows",Paragraph
recessive in the shadows. The main floor,Caption
opens onto a balcony that runs along the,Paragraph
entire southern exposure. And in good Arts,Paragraph
"and Crafts fashion, every aspect of the house",Paragraph
"was designed by Wright himself, from the",Paragraph
carpets to the light fixtures.,Caption
A comparison of the Robie House with,Paragraph
the Steiner House by Adolf Loos yields more,Paragraph
similarities than are obvious at first glance.,Paragraph

"horizontal courses, as if partially natural and",Paragraph
"partially manufactured. The house, with its",Paragraph
"broad, hooded roofs, gave the occupants a",Paragraph
sense of being embedded in the landscape.,Paragraph
"It was, Wright explained, a “natural house,”",Paragraph
by which he meant not that it was like a,Paragraph
cave or log cabin but that it was “native,Paragraph
in spirit.” Taliesin’s plan organization is a,Paragraph
"geometric ordering of the landscape, with",Paragraph

ADOLF LOOS,Title
"A stonemason’s son, Adolf Loos (1870-1933)",Paragraph
"was born in rural Moravia, 100 kilorneters",Paragraph
"north of Vienna. When he was nine, his father",Paragraph
"whom he idolized, died. Loos’s relationship",Paragraph
"with his mother, Maria Hertl, was strained",Paragraph
"at best, and when he was twenty-three she",Paragraph
"cut him off from the family, with just enough",Paragraph
money for a passage to the United States. In,Paragraph
"the United States, Loos was enraptured by",Paragraph
"the Chicago exposition, American industrial",Title
"infrastructure, and the writings of Louis",Title
"Sullivan. After returning to Austria, he settled",Paragraph
"in Vienna, where at first he evinced much",Paragraph
enthusiasm for the Secessionists. But then,Paragraph
he began to denounce Secessionist art,Paragraph
"and architecture, along with other modern",Paragraph
"decorators such as the Deutsche Werkbund,",Paragraph
for their moral degeneration. In 1908,Paragraph
Loos wrote a now-famous article entitled,Paragraph
"“Architecture and Ornament” in which,",Paragraph
relying on Jean-Jacques Rousseau's critique,Paragraph
"of civilization, he railed against the use of",Paragraph
ornament as a degenerate form of art not,Paragraph
suitable for advanced European cultures.,Paragraph
"For Loos, ornament was appropriate in tribal",Paragraph
"societies, where it played an important part",Paragraph
"in social interaction, but for an advanced",Paragraph
"civilization, ornament was no longer a",Paragraph
relevant form of communication. Loos was,Paragraph
not opposed to using the color and texture of,Paragraph
"natural materials for their ornamental quality,",Paragraph
however. His opinions put a damper on his,Paragraph
"career, but he did secure a number of jobs",Paragraph
leading up to the design for a commercial,Paragraph
building in Vienna in a style now called the,Paragraph
"Wiener Moderne; popularly, the building is",Paragraph
called the Loos Haus (1909-10).,Paragraph
By the time Loos designed the Steiner,Paragraph
"House (1910), even the residual classical",Paragraph
"motifs of his earlier work were gone, leaving",Paragraph
only a pure white exterior. The building,Paragraph
certainly anticipates—and indeed was highly,Paragraph
influential in—the modernist aesthetic that,Paragraph
would become the norm from the 1930s,Paragraph
"onward, although it differed markedly from",Paragraph
later functionalist buildings. Here the stark,Paragraph
exterior was meant to contrast with the lush,Paragraph
"and almost sensual interior. “On the outside,",Paragraph
the building must remain dumb and reveal,Paragraph
"all its richness only on the inside,” Loos wrote",Paragraph
in 1914.,Paragraph
The Moller House (1927-8) is,Paragraph
paradigmatic of Loos’s approach. Its facade,Paragraph
"is simple and rather forbidding, with the",Paragraph
"entrance, balcony, and windows bound",Caption
together into a tight compositional unit. Since,Paragraph
"the windows on the top floor face the rear,",Paragraph
the number of windows on the facade is,Paragraph
"limited. Despite the external symmetry, the",Paragraph
interior is labyrinthine. The living and family,Paragraph
rooms on the second floor are separated by,Paragraph
steps and framed openings to create a range,Paragraph
"of areas, some more private than others.",Paragraph
The interiors of the principal rooms are richly,Paragraph
outfitted with light-colored wood veneers on,Paragraph
"the walls and oriental carpets on the floors,",Paragraph
creating a sense of sumptuous elegance.,Paragraph
"In this respect, though Loos is seen as the",Paragraph
"harbinger of the modern movement, his work",Paragraph
maintained a strong allegiance to the Arts,Paragraph
and Crafts ideal of interiority and intimacy.,Paragraph
"17.105 View of Ludwigshafen, Germany",Caption
THE FACTORY AESTHETIC,Title
"By the early 20th century, factory design",Paragraph
had changed considerably over the previous,Paragraph
century. The introduction of electricity in,Paragraph
the 1880s freed the factory floor from the,Paragraph
"cumbersome system of pipes, gears and",Paragraph
belts that had driven the coal and steam,Paragraph
powered machines during most of the 19th,Paragraph
century. Advances in steel engineering,Title
allowed factory buildings to become larger,Paragraph
and spaces wider. Glass was used extensively,Paragraph
to permit illumination. Skylights were,Paragraph
"common, sometimes in saw tooth form or",Paragraph
as part of a Pratt truss. Flat roofs were also,Paragraph
"adopted, since it was easy for fire to develop",Paragraph
"in the old gable roof system, with its complex",Paragraph
wood supports. The development of concrete,Paragraph
provided a fireproof—although expensive—,Paragraph
"alternative to buildings that were of brick,",Paragraph
"stone, or terra-cotta. Standardized building",Caption
types became widely available in the form of,Paragraph
iron- and steel-frarned structures.,Paragraph
The late 19th century also saw the,Paragraph
emergence of a search for a factory aesthetic,Title
once it became clear that the building,Paragraph
was—or could be—used for advertising.,Paragraph
Some factories had main buildings that were,Paragraph
in a type of Gothic or Romanesque—and,Paragraph
occasionally classical—style. The Yenidze,Paragraph
"Tabakfabrik (1907-9) in Dresden, Germany,",Paragraph
"bloomed forth in an Oriental style, even",Paragraph
using simulated minarets and a glazed,Paragraph
dome to conform to the branding of its,Paragraph
"cigarettes. Usually, such buildings were",Paragraph
designed without an architect. But even,Paragraph
"when an architect was involved, there was",Paragraph
a noticeable difference between the image,Paragraph
of the building that the architect designed,Paragraph
"and the factory itself, designed by engineers.",Paragraph
"17.106 Yenidze Tabakfrabik, Dresden, Germany",Caption
The latter was seen—at least until the advent,Paragraph
of modernism—as not really part of the,Paragraph
architect’s concern. The freedom engineers,Paragraph
achieved had resulted in a type of building,Paragraph
that was designed around the concepts,Paragraph
of function and utility. Decoration was,Paragraph
"eschewed, but there was a desire to express",Paragraph
strength and stability. There was also a,Paragraph
"contradictory desire for light, and the creation",Title

GERMAN CONCRETE,Title
Even though Ford's factories brought to the fore the,Paragraph
radical modernity of reinforced concrete from the,Title
"point of view of civil engineering, the architectural",Title
question still remained open. While the expressive,Paragraph
potential in concrete's ability to take any form,Paragraph
languished in England—suffering in part under,Paragraph
Ruskinian proscriptions—it flourished in France and,Paragraph
Germany. If the French contribution consisted of,Paragraph
attempting to integrate concrete into the conventions,Paragraph
"of architectural practices, the Germans contributed",Paragraph
toward its engineering. One of the earliest uses of,Paragraph
concrete in a major public building in Germany was,Paragraph
"the Garnisonskirche in Ulm (1906-8), a Protestant",Paragraph
"church that, as its name implies, was made for",Paragraph
and by a military base. It was designed by Theodor,Paragraph
"Fischer (1862-1938), a prolific architect and noted",Paragraph
"educator, and one of the founders of the Deutsche",Paragraph
"Werkbund. He argued for a contextual modernity,",Paragraph
and his work therefore seems more neo-medieval,Paragraph
"than modern today. Nonetheless, the building is",Paragraph
a landmark in the history of modern architecture.,Paragraph
The body of the church consisted of a reinforced-,Paragraph
concrete skeleton with brick infill. The towers,Caption
"are huge empty silos 55 meters high, with a bell",Paragraph
chamber suspended between them.,Paragraph
A second important building was the Breslau,Paragraph
"Jahrhunderthalle (1913), which showed off",Paragraph
the virtuosity and elegance of concrete. Part of,Paragraph
a campaign by the city to define itself as the,Paragraph
"“Metropolis of the East,” it was designed by Max",Paragraph
"Berg, Frankfurt am Main's building department",Caption
"director, to serve as both an exhibition hall and",Paragraph
assembly hall. The Jahrhunderthalle (literally,Paragraph
"“Centennial Hall”) was an enormous building, with",Paragraph
"an enclosed floor space of over 5,600 square meters",Paragraph
that could hold ten thousand people. Due to the,Paragraph
fires that had broken out at a building of the 1910,Paragraph
"world's fair in Brussels, the builders decided to use",Paragraph
concrete—the first attempt ever to use the material,Paragraph
for a building on that scale. The structure consisted,Paragraph
of four large curved arches that formed a continuous,Paragraph
ring on which rested the dome. To provide a more,Paragraph
"secure environment against weather, the glazing was",Paragraph
"not laid in the interstices of the ribs. Instead, Berg",Paragraph
designed a system of stepped glazing applied to the,Paragraph
outside of the dome in the form of vertical windows,Caption
"and horizontal roofs. From the inside, the small",Paragraph
horizontal roof planes disappear in the light that,Paragraph
streams through the vertical apertures of glass.,Paragraph
EXPRESSIONISM,Title
Architecture before and after World War | was,Paragraph
surprisingly imaginative and experimental.,Paragraph
"Expressionism, as it soon came to be known,",Paragraph
had begun to develop before World War |,Paragraph
in the work of Bruno Taut and a few others.,Paragraph
Particularly influential were the writings of,Paragraph
"Paul Scheerbart, who in 1914 published",Paragraph
"Glass Architecture, a book describing a",Title
utopian architecture of colored glass in,Title
combination with sparkling jewels and,Paragraph
"enamel. The Expressionists, despite their",Paragraph
"differences, all envisioned an architecture",Paragraph
as far removed from classicism as could,Paragraph
be imagined at that time. The old notion,Paragraph
that architecture reembodied the power of,Paragraph
the past gave way to a desire to create an,Paragraph
architecture that spoke to the irmmediacy,Paragraph
of perception and the psychology of the,Title
"beholder. As one commentator, Heinrich de",Paragraph
"Fries, explained, “Buildings are in the highest",Paragraph
degree alive.... We can only guess at the,Paragraph
extent to which the art of spatial articulation,Paragraph
will one day transcend the art of pictorial,Title
creation.” Expressionism rejected the duality,Paragraph
"of interior and exterior, and of building and",Paragraph
landscape. It also opened architecture to,Paragraph
influences from the other arts—in opposition,Title
"to the Arts and Crafts movement, which had",Paragraph
hoped to integrate the artistic conception,Paragraph
within the framework of craftmaking.,Paragraph
The movement was particularly strong,Paragraph
in Prague between 1910 and 1914. In the,Paragraph
"1880s, Czech artists, dissatisfied with the",Paragraph
poor standards of the Prague Academy of,Paragraph
"Painting, departed en masse for Munich,",Paragraph
a leading center for the German Arts and,Paragraph
"Crafts movement. Many others went to Paris,",Paragraph
where they encountered the work of Auguste,Paragraph
"Rodin, whom many Czechs admired for the",Paragraph
spontaneity and expressiveness of his work.,Paragraph
Other sources of inspiration were found in,Paragraph
"French Cubism, which began to be exhibited",Paragraph
in 1908. But despite the pictorial innovations,Paragraph
"of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, the",Paragraph
possibility of a Cubist architecture was not,Paragraph
pursued in France until the arrival of Le,Paragraph
Corbusier in the 1920s—and certainly not,Paragraph
"in Germany, where French developments",Paragraph
were generally viewed with suspicion. The,Paragraph
introduction of Cubism into architecture in,Title
"Prague was, therefore, path-breaking.",Paragraph
"17.112 Pavilion of Commerce, 1908 Jubilee Exhibition, Prague",Caption
One of the leading architects among the,Paragraph
Czech Cubists was Jan Kotera (1871-,Paragraph
"1923), a professor at the Prague School of",Paragraph
"Decorative Arts, who actively collaborated",Paragraph
with Czech sculptors like Jan Stursa and,Paragraph
Stanislav Sucharda on his architectural,Title
designs. He saw prismatic shapes as,Paragraph
appropriate to the intellectual vitality of the,Paragraph
"modern age. For him, structure had to give",Paragraph
way to the logic of visual dynamics. This,Paragraph
"was also true for Pavel Janak (1882-1956),",Paragraph
whose idiosyncratic interpretation of,Paragraph
"Cubism led him to shift toward tapered,",Paragraph
"slanted, and triangular forms. He argued",Paragraph
that the orthogonal architecture reflected,Paragraph
"its dependency on matter and weight,",Paragraph
"whereas the new Cubist style, with its angles,",Paragraph
expressed the active nature of the human,Paragraph
spirit and its ability to prevail over matter.,Paragraph
"After World War I, with the downfall of the",Paragraph
"aristocratic regime in Germany, Expressionist",Title
architecture found one of its more realistic,Paragraph
"voices in Hans Poelzig (1869-1936),",Paragraph
"whose first major cormmission, the Grosse",Paragraph
Schauspielhaus (“Large Performance Hall”),Title
"in Berlin, had a plaster ceiling, hung from",Paragraph
"the rafters, that looked like cave stalactites.",Paragraph
"Thousands of light bulbs, variously colored",Paragraph
"in shades of yellow, green, and red, were",Paragraph
embedded in the vault so that the whole,Paragraph
"thing resembled both a cave and, when the",Paragraph
"lights were dimmed, a starry night sky. The",Paragraph
"foyer was supported by a single column that,",Paragraph

—also illuminated by recessed colored light,Paragraph
bulbs—until it reached the vault above.,Paragraph

"17.114 Interior: Grosse Schauspielhaus, Berlin",Caption
Another important figure in the Expressionist,Paragraph
camp was Hans Bernhard Scharoun (1893-,Paragraph
"1972), who rejected the crystalline shapes",Paragraph
of some of the other Expressionists in favor,Paragraph
"of soft, rubbery forms. In his design for a",Paragraph
"stock exchange building (1922), he warped",Caption
"and bent space around the central lobby,",Paragraph
giving the appearance of a building that had,Paragraph
ingested the various aspects of the program.,Paragraph
"In Italy, Expressionism took an even",Paragraph
"stronger form under the name of Futurism,",Paragraph
initially a literary movement created by,Paragraph
Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in 1909—it was,Paragraph
"his manifesto, Le futurisme, published in",Paragraph
"Paris, that coined the name of the movement.",Paragraph
Marinetti was a keen follower of the Cubist,Paragraph
movement and even took a group of Italian,Paragraph
painters to Paris to show them recent work.,Paragraph
"Soon, however, the Italians developed their",Paragraph
"own distinctive style, significantly more",Paragraph
aggressive in tone in comparison to the quiet,Paragraph
utopianism of Scheerbart. The Futurists,Paragraph
"were particularly enamored of technology,",Paragraph
"speed, and machinery and expressed",Title
this in their painting and poetry. They saw,Paragraph
the outbreak of World War | as a positive,Title
development for the Italians and hoped it,Paragraph
would propel the young country into the,Paragraph
"modern age. “Art,” so Marinetti stated,",Paragraph
"“can be nothing but violence, cruelty, and",Paragraph
injustice.” The movement eventually came,Paragraph
"to include architecture, and in a 1914",Paragraph

"manifesto, called upon Cubists, Futurists,",Paragraph

The architect most associated with,Paragraph
Expressionism was Eric Mendelsohn (1887-,Paragraph
"1953 }, as famous for his drawings as for his",Paragraph
"buildings. His sketches, many unrelated to",Paragraph
"any commission, emphasized the building's",Paragraph
flowing silhouette. There are no pictorial,Paragraph
"enhancements, no landscape features—just",Paragraph
"the building without context, drawn in dark",Paragraph
lines on a white sheet of paper. Despite,Paragraph
his seemingly impossible and grandiose,Title
"ambitions for the field of architecture,",Paragraph
Mendelsohn was an extremely successful,Paragraph
"architect, even during the 1920s, and was",Paragraph

DE STIL MOVEMENT,Title
"After World War |, Expressionism in Holland",Paragraph
gave way to a vibrant avant-garde culture that,Paragraph
focused on issues of abstraction and color; at,Paragraph
the center of it were Piet Mondrian and Theo,Paragraph
van Doesburg. The latter still had ties to the,Paragraph
Expressionist cause insofar as he advocated a,Paragraph
form of three-dimensional color environment.,Paragraph
As Van Doesburg explained in several essays,Paragraph
"published in de Sti! between 1926 and 1928,",Paragraph
the essence of the countercomposition was,Paragraph
its opposition to the orthogonal character,Paragraph
"of architecture and nature. Art, he argued,",Paragraph
"in aspiring to the spiritual, must provide for",Paragraph
architecture an additional dimension—the,Paragraph
obligue—that architecture by itself was,Paragraph
"not capable of creating, given that it was",Paragraph
"shackled to weight and gravity. In that sense,",Paragraph
"art, for him, was opposed to functionality as",Paragraph
well as to construction.,Paragraph
Van Doesburg was deeply influenced,Paragraph
by the work of painter Piet Mondrian. His,Paragraph
"designs for a cinerna/dance hall, the Café",Caption
"Aubette in Strasbourg (1926-28), which",Paragraph
involved broad compositions of colored,Paragraph
"rectangles in relief, oriented at 45-degree",Paragraph
angles. Mirrors were placed between the,Paragraph
windows to reflect the ceiling and the three,Paragraph
"other walls, all treated in a manner that",Paragraph
turned the architectural surface into a kind of,Paragraph
plastic relief sculpture.,Paragraph
One of the few examples of de Stijl,Paragraph
"architecture is the Schroder House (1924),",Paragraph
designed by Dutch architect Gerrit Thornas,Caption
"Rietveld, who lived and worked in Utrecht.",Paragraph
"The client, Truus Schrader-Schrader, the wife",Paragraph
"of a noted lawyer, wanted a house with as few",Paragraph
walls as possible. It is built at the end of a,Paragraph
block of conventional 19th-century attached,Paragraph
"row houses, giving it views in three directions.",Paragraph
Rietveld exploited this to create a house in,Paragraph
which the volumes seem to be composed of,Paragraph
"plains, some hanging free from the facade.",Paragraph
"The principal colors were white and gray,",Paragraph
"17.135 Schroder House, Utrecht, Netherlands",Caption
"with red, yellow and blue serving as accents.",Paragraph
The ground floor was relatively conventional,Paragraph
but the upper floor had numerous movable,Paragraph
walls that allowed for spaces to be opened or,Paragraph
closed as desired.,Paragraph
Walter Gropius rejected Van Doesburg’s,Title
"position, as did architect Jacobus Johannes",Paragraph
Pieter Oud (1890-1963). They argued that,Paragraph
architecture needed to focus on social and,Paragraph
"economic realities, rather than abstract",Paragraph
spiritual speculations.,Paragraph

Germany's most influential Art Nouveau,Title

built during the 1920s were certainly,Paragraph
competent but hardly imaginative. They stood,Paragraph
"in sharp contrast with his unbuilt work, which",Paragraph
was an evocative and imaginative expression,Paragraph
of the emerging modernist aesthetic. His,Paragraph

Mies firmly within the emerging modernist,Title

artists and architects had to draw their,Paragraph

"was grounded in an image of industrial labor,",Paragraph
was not a one-to-one translation of industry,Paragraph
"into aesthetics, but it was the first modernist",Paragraph
"aesthetic that admitted, and in fact glorified,",Paragraph
the mass-produced object. Constructivists,Paragraph
used the term faboratory work to describe,Paragraph
their formal investigations and to emphasize,Paragraph
their solidarity with both science and labor.,Paragraph
"Laboratory work was, however, not to be",Paragraph
equated with the pragmatism of problem,Paragraph

the time was Constructivist: there were also,Paragraph
Rationalists and Suprematists. The theme of,Paragraph
eroism was tackled in the work of a group,Paragraph
"jeaded by a charismatic figure, Nikolai",Paragraph
"Ladovsky, whose ASNOVA group (Association",Paragraph

THE BAUHAUS,Title
In 1919 Walter Gropius (1883-1969),Paragraph
was made the head of a new school of,Paragraph
architecture formed by the merger of two,Paragraph
older schools of arts and crafts. Significantly,Paragraph
less pragmatically oriented than the,Paragraph
"Deutsche Werkbund, the Bauhaus sought",Title
to engender a new unified pedagogy and,Paragraph
"vision that unified the arts and crafts, in",Paragraph
collaboration with industry. Though nominally,Paragraph
"a national school, the Bauhaus was always",Paragraph
"cosmopolitan in orientation, open to all",Paragraph
"students regardless of gender, nationality, or",Paragraph
previous qualifications. Initially the Bauhaus's,Paragraph
purpose was to produce a new “guild of,Paragraph
"craftsmen,” but that does not mean it was",Paragraph
"reactionary, for Gropius also wanted a school",Paragraph
that could unify the arts and close the gap,Paragraph
"between industry and craft. In that sense,",Paragraph
"unlike William Morris, who saw craft as a",Paragraph
"bulwark against industry, or the Werkbund,",Paragraph
"which was seeking an industrialized craft,",Paragraph
Gropius was seeking to discover the internal,Paragraph
ethos of industrial production itself. The,Paragraph
"question was not just how to make things,",Paragraph
but how to perceive and experience things,Title
"as well. For that reason, Gropius brought in",Paragraph
"painters, including Lyonel Feininger, Paul",Paragraph
"Klee, and Johannes Itten. The celebration",Paragraph
of painters as form-makers reflected a,Paragraph
not-so-subtle shift away from the social,Paragraph
(and thus from the contentious political,Paragraph
"issues of the time), toward the language of",Paragraph
abstraction and design. |tten was placed in,Paragraph
"17.146 The Bauhaus, Dessau, Germany",Caption
charge of the basic course required of all,Paragraph
incoming students. Its purpose was to free,Paragraph
the students’ creative powers and guide,Title
them toward a suitable direction in their later,Paragraph
studies.,Paragraph
"In 1924, the reduction of funding from",Paragraph
"Weimar, its host city, forced the school to",Paragraph
"move to Dessau, where the Junkers aircraft",Paragraph
factory was located. Gropius used this,Paragraph
"opportunity to reinvent the Bauhaus, purging",Paragraph
its faculty and stripping the curriculurn,Paragraph
of its more expressionistic and mystical,Paragraph
"elements, to focus more single-mindedly on",Paragraph
an industrial aesthetic inspired in part by the,Paragraph
Junkers factory. Johannes Itten left and was,Paragraph
replaced by the Russian Wassily Kandinsky.,Paragraph
The city of Dessau helped finance a new,Paragraph
"campus, which was designed by Gropius as a",Paragraph
"signature, representative work. The program",Paragraph
of the Dessau building (1919-25) included,Paragraph
"workshops, administrative offices, a lecture",Title
"hall, and a stage, as well as workroorms,",Paragraph
"a canteen, and student accommodations.",Paragraph
Gropius divided the program into two major,Paragraph
elements separated by a road and connected,Paragraph
"by a bridge. The bridge, fittingly, was where",Paragraph
Gropius had his office: to go from the,Paragraph
"classrooms to the studio spaces, one had to",Paragraph
pass by Gropius's office. The building was,Paragraph
"not particularly unified in the classical sense,",Paragraph
for each element had its own programmatic,Paragraph
logic. The dormitory at the east end stood,Paragraph

"Due to the dominance of the Beaux-Arts system,",Paragraph
the innovations in design that were taking place,Paragraph

modernism to develop it needed someone who,Paragraph

"once in Paris, and after a travel tour to Turkey,",Paragraph
"Greece, Italy, and other parts of Europe and",Paragraph

Le Corbusier. Vers une architecture outlined,Caption
Five Points toward a New Architecture: the,Title
"pifotis (stilts) that support the building, the free",Paragraph
plan with the only structural support coming in,Paragraph
"the form of columns, the free facade, the strip",Paragraph
"window, and the roof terrace. These features,",Paragraph
"he argued, were based on structural properties",Paragraph
of reinforced concrete as well as the increasing,Paragraph
availability of mass-produced architectural,Title
elements. They also allowed the architect to work,Paragraph
with pragmatic forms. The idea of the pilotis,Paragraph
was to remain with Le Corbusier throughout his,Paragraph
career. Inspired by Rousseauesque thinking,Paragraph
that invested undisturbed nature with an ideal,Paragraph
"of plenitude, Le Corbusier’s pilotis were meant",Paragraph
to liberate the land from the oppression of a,Paragraph
building that interrupted its flow and rhythm.,Paragraph

"which now houses the Fondation Le Corbusier,",Paragraph
was a combined set of houses for two different,Paragraph
clients. Le Corbusier responded to the spatial,Paragraph
"17.152 Villa Savoye, Poissy, Paris",Caption
demands of the different households by designing interweaving layers of,Paragraph
"spaces, connected by a central court. The house was painted white, but on",Paragraph
"the inside, walls were painted in a variety of soft hues of red, yellow, and",Paragraph
"blue, as well as white.",Paragraph
His most influential work from this time was the Villa Savoye (1931) at,Paragraph
"Poissy, a suburb of Paris, where the client owned a large parcel of land that",Paragraph
"swelled up to a gentle hill. At its apex, Le Corbusier placed a cubic volume,",Paragraph
"lifted on pilotis, a column-and-slab construction in reinforced concrete. The",Paragraph
walls were built of brick and stuccoed over. The plans on every floor were,Paragraph
"customized to their functional requirements, and a simple strip window was",Paragraph
the centerpiece of the elevation.,Caption
The ground-floor plan was designed around the turning radius of the,Paragraph
"client's automobile, which, after dropping off his employer at the entry",Paragraph
"on axis with the center, was to be parked by the chauffeur in parking",Paragraph
"slots located around the curve. (In Vers une architecture, Le Corbusier",Paragraph

achievement as great as the Parthenon.) Inside the front door and past the,Paragraph

villa. Living spaces were arranged around the ramp on three sides on the,Paragraph
irst floor. A terrace fills up the rest. The ramp reverses direction and ends,Paragraph
"on the roof, where a freestanding wall with a single window self-consciously",Paragraph
"rames the landscape. Although Le Corbusier celebrated the automobile, he",Paragraph
also designed the building as a prornenade with experiences unfolding at,Paragraph

"1940s, with the arrival of Walter Gropius",Paragraph
and Mies van der Rohe. There are two,Paragraph
principal reasons for American resistance,Title
to modernism: Beaux-Arts architecture,Title
was still strong and taught in architecture,Paragraph
"schools; and Frank Lloyd Wright, the",Paragraph
"dominant American architect of the time,",Paragraph
"was a trenchant critic of the Europeans’ boxy,",Paragraph
unadorned aesthetic.,Paragraph
Early examples of European modernist,Title
architecture in the United States are thus,Paragraph
"few and center on the work of two architects,",Paragraph
Rudolf Michael Schindler (1887-1953) and,Title
"Richard Neutra (1892-1970). Schindler,",Caption
whose work was very much underappreciated,Paragraph
"at the time, was born in Austria but moved",Paragraph
to the United States in 1914. He found,Paragraph
employment in the office of Wright until,Paragraph
"branching out on his own, setting the tone",Paragraph
for an architecture that had never been seen,Paragraph
in the United States with his Lovell Beach,Paragraph
House (1922-26). It was not a house in,Paragraph
any traditional sense; nor was it a house in,Paragraph
"the Corbusian sense, with floor slabs and",Paragraph
"columns. Instead, a series of five concrete",Paragraph
wall elements elevated the living quarters,Caption
high above the ground to catch the sea,Paragraph
breezes. The house appeared from below like,Paragraph
"the underside of a bridge. The floors, roofs",Paragraph
and walls were built of wood.,Paragraph
The same clients commissioned Neutra to,Paragraph
design their principal residence (1927-29),Caption
in the Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles. It,Paragraph
was built against a steep hill with views to,Paragraph
the city to the south. The entrance was at,Paragraph
"the top level, where the family bedrooms",Paragraph
and sleeping porches were also located. A,Paragraph
"staircase, enclosed on two sides by glass",Caption
"and with spectacular views, led down to the",Paragraph

INTRODUCTION,Title
"By the middle of the 20th century, the great",Paragraph
expectations of the European Enlightenment,Title
and its modernist institutions were being,Paragraph
pursued with greater zeal than ever—and,Paragraph
being widely critiqued for their contradictions,Paragraph
"and failures. It was High Modernism’s heyday,",Paragraph
but it was also its watershed point: from mid-,Paragraph
"century it went into steady decline, severely",Paragraph
challenged and eventually supplanted by,Paragraph
its postmodern critics in the late 1970s and,Paragraph
early 1980s.,Paragraph
"The defining event of the era was, of",Paragraph
"course, World War II. Although World War |",Paragraph
"had been bloody and expensive, the ensuing",Paragraph
peace had given rise to the hope that the,Paragraph
utopian aspirations of modernism could,Title
now be realized. Although the interwar,Paragraph
years were marked by political chaos and,Paragraph
financial instability—including the turmoil,Title
of the Weimar Republic in Germany and,Title
the Great Depression of 1929 in the United,Title
States—they were also characterized by,Paragraph
grand projects that sought to finally deliver,Paragraph
on the social and aesthetic possibilities of,Title
"the industrial age. In architecture, significant",Paragraph
events of the time included Walter Gropius's,Paragraph
"new school of design, the Bauhaus (founded",Paragraph
"in 1919), Le Corbusier's books Vers une",Paragraph
"Architecture (Toward a New Architecture),",Paragraph
"first published in 1923, and City of Tomorrow",Paragraph
and Its Planning (1929); and Ludwig Mies,Paragraph
van de Rohe's Weissenhof Siedlung Exhibition,Caption
in 1927. The Congrés Internationaux,Paragraph
"d’Architecture Moderne (CIAM), founded",Paragraph
"in 1928, also played an important role as",Paragraph
it quickly grew into an organization with,Paragraph
"dozens of members from around the world,",Paragraph
all committed to deploying the ideals of,Paragraph
functionalism and rationalism in building and,Title
urban planning. Even in the early days of,Paragraph
"the Soviet Republic, the social expectations",Title
of modern architecture were broadly,Paragraph
"vouchsafed, as in the Palace of the Soviets",Paragraph
competition of 1931. A major exhibition at the,Paragraph
Museurn of Modern Art in New York City in,Caption
1932 sought to codify this modernism as the,Paragraph
International style.,Paragraph
By 1935 Adolf Hitler in Germany and,Paragraph
Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union had put,Paragraph
an end to modernism in their respective,Title
spheres of influence. World War II brought,Paragraph
the utopian aspirations of the modernist,Title
project to a screeching halt—not only by,Paragraph
"putting a stop to construction, but even more",Paragraph
by undermining its grounding assumptions.,Paragraph
The fact that the model,Paragraph
"rnist Western world,",Paragraph
instead of producing models of social,Paragraph
"utopias, could just as easily create a model",Paragraph
"machine for the Holocaust, provoked an",Paragraph
era of soul-searching a,Title

at accompanied the,Title
modern world. Le Corbusier himself was a,Paragraph
leading light of this project that was ultimately,Paragraph
"embraced all around the globe, particularly",Paragraph
in the postcolonial world and Western,Title
academia. Many of the new buildings on,Paragraph
"U.S. university carmpuses were brutalist, such",Paragraph
as the University of California—Berkeley's,Paragraph
Wurster Hall (1964) and the University of,Paragraph
Washington's Gould Hall (1972).,Paragraph
"Modern architecture, like other",Paragraph
"forms of culture, was impacted by the",Paragraph
tumultuous1960s and its aftermath. Tearn,Caption

and aspirations of the modern movernent,Title
"into a more human-scaled, softer expression",Paragraph
that was more community- and region-based.,Paragraph
"nstead of celebrating the machine, a more",Paragraph
climate-responsive architecture began to take,Paragraph
shape. Peter and Alison Smithson bridged the,Caption
rutalist and Team X carps. Maxwell Fry and,Caption
Jane Drew codified their work in Africa under,Paragraph
the rubric of Tropical Architecture. A group,Paragraph
"rom England, Archigram, whose name came",Paragraph
"rom the banner of the journal it founded,",Paragraph
promoted an architecture influenced by pop,Paragraph
"art and a counterculture that was mobile,",Paragraph
"lexible, transitory, and youth-oriented.",Paragraph
enzo Tange built the Yamanashi Press and,Paragraph
"Broadcasting Center (1966) in Kofu, Japan,",Paragraph
and Denys Lasdun the Royal National Theatre,Caption
(1976) in London.,Paragraph
An indirect consequence of World War II,Paragraph
was that it finally dismantled the colonial,Paragraph
"world. Beginning in 1947 with India, the",Paragraph
"European colonies in Asia and Africa, one by",Paragraph
"one, declared independence in the 1950s",Paragraph
and 1960s. Many of these newly independent,Paragraph
postcolonial nation-states adopted modern,Title
architecture as the idiom with which to,Paragraph
"build their new institutions of state, such as",Paragraph
"Chandigarh in India, Brasilia in Brazil, and",Paragraph
Islamabad in Pakistan; these were followed,Paragraph
"by a series of new African capitals, such as",Paragraph
Ibadan in Nigeria and Dodoma in Tanzania.,Paragraph
"Even in communist Cuba, as in the early days",Paragraph
"of the Soviet Republic, modern architecture",Title
"found a unique voice and form. Thus,",Paragraph
whereas modernism was highly contested,Paragraph
"in Europe and the United States, it was",Paragraph
more readily embraced in places such as,Paragraph
"Ankara, colonial North Africa, Latin America,",Title
"Australia, Japan, and India. In part this was",Paragraph
"because in the former colonies, modernism,",Paragraph
"with its claims to universality, represented a",Paragraph
"path to modernity that, unlike classicism, was",Paragraph
not so strongly identified with Eurocentrism.,Paragraph
"Of course, the formation of major global",Paragraph
"institutions, such as the United Nations",Paragraph
"with all its accessory bodies, also played a",Paragraph
major role in the worldwide dissemination of,Paragraph
modernism. Not only were the headquarters,Paragraph
of major UN institutions such as the General,Paragraph
Assembly in New York and UNESCO in Paris,Title
"designed in the modernist mold, but the UN",Paragraph
unded habitat consultants to travel around,Title
the world and advocate for modernist urban,Title
and rural planning models. At the vanguard,Paragraph
of this movement were visionaries such as,Paragraph
Buckminster Fuller and structuralist urban,Title
thinkers such as Constantinos Doxiadis and,Paragraph
"is Ekistics group based in Athens, Greece.",Paragraph
"As part of this new global outlook, the new",Paragraph
"postwar embassies of the United States, such",Paragraph
as Edward Durell Stone’s embassy in New,Title
"Delhi, were also built in modernist style.",Paragraph
"European modernism, quite distinct",Paragraph
rom the homegrown modernism developed,Title
"y people like Frank Lloyd Wright, was",Paragraph
ushered into the United States through the,Paragraph
"academies, in particular when Mies van der",Paragraph
Rohe began teaching at the Illinois Institute,Paragraph
"of Technology in Chicago, and Walter Gropius",Paragraph
at Harvard University. As the American,Paragraph
"economy boomed in the 1950s and 1960s,",Paragraph
private corporations eagerly adopted the new,Paragraph
style with its sleek outlines as the new symbol,Paragraph
"of big business, eschewing their prewar",Paragraph
penchant for neoclassicism. The steel-and-,Paragraph
glass skyscraper quickly established itself,Paragraph
"as the new symbol of corporate America,",Paragraph
supplanting the stone-clad tower epitomized,Paragraph
by the Empire State Building. Lever House,Caption
"(1950-52), designed by Skidmore Owings",Paragraph
"and Merrill (SOM), and the Seagram Building",Paragraph
"by Mies van der Rohe, both in New York City,",Caption
set the tone. SOM specialized in designing,Paragraph
corporate headquarters in the United States,Title
"and abroad, and became one of the largest",Paragraph
architectural firms of the time. As the steel-,Paragraph
and-glass skyscraper became established,Paragraph
"as the symbol of U.S. capitalism, even old",Paragraph
iconoclasts like Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd,Paragraph
Wright came to be seen as anachronistic.,Paragraph
Post-World War II architecture also,Paragraph
saw the rise of the master-architect and,Paragraph
the prestige commission. Many of these,Paragraph
came to define the popular identity of the,Paragraph
"modern movement, such as the town hall in",Paragraph
"Saynatsalo, Finland (1952) by Alvar Aalto,",Caption
the Guggenheim Museum (1956-59) by,Paragraph
"Frank Lloyd Wright, the Berlin Philharmonic",Title
"Hall (1956-63) by Hans Scharoun, and the",Caption
Sydney Opera House (1957-73) by Jarn,Caption
Utzon. A structure-based expression of,Paragraph
"monumental architecture, exemplified by",Paragraph
"the work of U.S.-based Eero Saarinen, made",Paragraph
for an architecture of distinctive profiles.,Paragraph
The standout figure of the late-modernist,Paragraph
"period, however, was Louis Kahn. This",Paragraph
Philadelphia-based self-styled disciple of Le,Paragraph
Corbusier developed a distinctive body of,Paragraph
work that began as a discourse of “serving”,Paragraph
"versus “served” spaces, but eventually",Paragraph
sought to reintroduce ideas of classical,Paragraph
"monumentality into a modern architecture,",Paragraph
influenced in particular by his idiosyncratic,Paragraph
phenomenological reading of the antiquities,Title
of Rome.,Paragraph
"By the mid-1970s, the critics of modern",Paragraph
architecture were well entrenched. What,Paragraph
began as a critique of the perceived failures,Paragraph
"of modernist urban schemes, evolved into a",Paragraph
scathing criticism of the formal orthodoxies,Title
"of modern architecture. Some architects,",Paragraph
"like Aldo Rossi in Italy, hoped for a return",Paragraph
"to history; others, like Robert Venturi and",Paragraph
"Denise Scott Brown, sought out parody",Title
and irony; whereas Peter Eisenman in the,Paragraph
United States and Oswald Mathias Ungers,Title
in Germany aimed for a formalisrn more,Paragraph
rigorous than even that of the modernists.,Paragraph
The most enduring aspect of postmodernism,Paragraph
was its call for a heightened awareness of a,Paragraph
building's context—but how context was to be,Paragraph
"defined was much debated, and varied from",Paragraph
Daniel Libeskind’s highly abstract Jewish,Title
Museurn in Berlin (2001) to the efforts of,Paragraph
Prince Charles of England to reawaken an,Title
"interest in traditional styles. In the 1990s,",Paragraph
in opposition to the conservative tenor of,Paragraph
"much architectural production, a group of",Paragraph
"avant-garde architects, among them Rem",Paragraph
"Koolhaas from Holland, called for a revival of",Paragraph
modernist forms and abstractions. Advances,Paragraph
in technology and computers also enabled,Paragraph
architects to build structures that in previous,Paragraph
decades would have been unthinkable. Frank,Paragraph
Gehry’s Guggenheim Museum (1997) in,Paragraph
"Bilbao, Spain, with its curved titanium skin,",Paragraph
"and the blue, bubble-shaped Kunsthaus",Title
"(2003) in Graz, Austria, by Peter Cook and",Caption
"Colin Fournier, are noted examples.",Paragraph
MODERNISM,Title
An inescapable problem in discussing,Paragraph
20th-century architecture is the definition of,Paragraph
"such terms as modernity, modernization, and",Paragraph
"modernism. For example, different artistic",Paragraph
fields—and even different practitioners—,Paragraph
tend to have contradictory understandings,Paragraph
of modernism. In the collages of Kurt,Paragraph
"Schwitters, modernism might be used to",Paragraph
indicate fragrnentation; in James Joyce's,Paragraph
"Finnegan's Wake, a heightened sense of",Paragraph
subjectivity is implied; and to understand the,Paragraph
"music of Arnold Schoenberg, objectivity is",Paragraph
"the precondition. In architecture, modernism",Paragraph
is associated with a radical break with past,Paragraph
forms. The ballast of literal historical allusions,Paragraph
"is thrown overboard. In the late 1920s,",Paragraph
buildings by LeCorbusier or Mies van der,Caption
"Rohe had white walls and simple forms, with",Paragraph
the emphasis on function and structure.,Paragraph
Explicitly codifying modernism as a style,Paragraph
was Philip Johnson's and Henry-Russell,Paragraph
"Hitchcock's book, The International Style,",Paragraph
which followed on the heels of an exhibition,Paragraph
at the New York Museum of Modern Art,Caption
(1932). In the Weimar Republic between,Paragraph
"1923 and 1933, there arose the term Neue",Paragraph
Sachlichkeit (“New Objectivity”); a critique of,Paragraph
the overemotional aspects of some forms of,Paragraph
"Expressionism, it advocated clean lines and",Paragraph
matter-of-fact design. The word functionalism,Paragraph
"also came into play, though this term also",Paragraph
had several connotations. For Mies van der,Paragraph
"Rohe, the emphasis was on the clarity of",Paragraph
a building's form and detailing; for Walter,Paragraph
"Gropius, it was on the building’s massing",Paragraph
"and organization. For Le Corbusier, it meant",Paragraph
"the use of concrete and of the free plan, as",Paragraph
defined by his Five Points.,Paragraph
"The 1930s, and the period between",Paragraph
"the world wars in general, was an era of",Paragraph
optimism for the modernists in Europe. After,Paragraph
World War | had cleared out the detritus of,Paragraph
"history, a rational reordering of the world",Title
seemed possible and desirable. Even small,Paragraph
18.1 Modern steel construction,Caption
projects were imbricated with an avant-garde,Paragraph
spirit—optimistic harbingers of things to,Title
come. Iconic works from this ethos included,Paragraph
"Gerrit Rietveld’s Schréder House (Utrecht,",Caption
"Netherlands, 1924); Alvar Aalto’s Viipuri",Paragraph
Library (1927-35); Richard Neutra's Lovell,Paragraph

he politics associated with,Paragraph
"modernization, though firmly anchored in",Paragraph
"the Enlightenment project, have varied from",Paragraph
totalitarianism and elitism to republicanism,Title
and radical democracy. An example of,Paragraph
modernization impacting aesthetics is,Paragraph
"the Tennessee Valley Authority, which in",Paragraph
the 1930s redesigned a huge area along,Paragraph
the Tennessee River to create a series,Title
of strikingly modern dams for electricity,Paragraph
generation. The tightest relationship between,Paragraph
modernism and modernization was to be,Paragraph
found in the days of the newly forming,Paragraph
"Soviet Union, when there was, for a few",Paragraph
Koy,Title
"18.2 Norris Dam, Tennessee Valley Authority; Cling River, Anderson and Campbell Counties, Tennessee",Caption
"years, a sense of excitement about the new",Paragraph
"social promise of communism. El Lissitzky,",Caption
"Vladimir Tatlin, and Konstantin Melnikov",Title
"were at the core of this development, which",Paragraph
"also included Mart Stam, a Dutch architect,",Paragraph
"as well as Max Taut and Hannes Meyer,",Paragraph
"both Germans, the latter serving as head of",Paragraph
the Bauhaus for a few years before moving,Paragraph
"to Moscow. For these men, and for like-",Paragraph
"minded Constructivists, factory life had to",Paragraph
"find its expression in cubist forms, open steel",Paragraph
"structures, and the absence of historical",Title
references.,Paragraph
"The idea of integrating modernism,",Paragraph
"modernization, and nationalism was",Paragraph
particularly attractive to the elites of some,Paragraph
non-European countries eager to create a,Paragraph
new idiom. These trends appeared early on:,Paragraph
"in Turkey, as a pro-modernist state formed",Paragraph
"by Kemal Atatuirk; in Tel Aviv, which was to",Paragraph
become one of Israel's leading cities after,Paragraph
nationhood was established in 1948; and,Paragraph
"then in Brazil, which had been independent",Paragraph
"since 1822, but which under Getulio Vargas",Paragraph
strove for national self-articulation. It was,Paragraph
most vigorously explored in post-World War II,Paragraph
"South Asia, where several modernist-style",Paragraph
cities and capitals were built.,Paragraph
The works of Frank Lloyd Wright and Alvar,Title
Aalto have a somewhat unusual position in,Paragraph
the discussions about modernism: both men,Title

"are integral to its history, yet both were critics",Paragraph

Weissenhof Siedlung,Title
"In the late 1920s, with the German economy",Paragraph
slowly gaining steam after the inflationary,Paragraph
"crisis of 1923, housing projects sponsored",Paragraph
by municipal and state governments and,Paragraph
cooperative building societies had begun to,Paragraph
be built across Germany. To support these,Paragraph
"efforts, the Deutsche Werkbund, at the time",Paragraph
"under a pro-modernist leadership, sponsored",Paragraph
an exhibition of houses to be designed by,Paragraph
architects from all over Europe. Stuttgart was,Paragraph
chosen as the site because of the progressive,Paragraph
politics of its regional government. Ludwig,Paragraph
"Mies van der Rohe headed the project,",Paragraph
which opened in 1927. What was presented,Paragraph
to the world was an entire housing estate,Paragraph
(or Siedfung) dedicated to avant-garde,Paragraph
European modernist thinking. Included in the,Paragraph
"exhibition were buildings by Le Corbusier,",Paragraph
"Walter Gropius, Adolf Loos, J. J. P. Oud,",Caption
"Hans Scharoun, and Bruno Taut, among",Paragraph
"others. Initially, Mies even hoped that Erich",Paragraph
Mendelsohn and Henry van der Velde would,Title
contribute—a wish that did not materialize.,Paragraph
Mies organized the buildings into a,Paragraph
loose rectangular composition above a,Paragraph
"broad, S-shaped road that followed the",Paragraph
"slope of the land, with the taller buildings",Paragraph
"at the top. To create a unified image, all the",Paragraph
architects had to employ flat roofs and white,Paragraph
facades. Included in the exhibition were,Paragraph
"rowhouses, duplexes, single-family houses,",Paragraph
and apartment buildings. The Weissenhof,Paragraph
Siedlung marked a turning point in the history,Paragraph
of modernism.,Paragraph
Though the movement was hardly uniform—.,Paragraph
there were important differences among its,Paragraph
leading rembers—the exhibition created,Paragraph
"for the public, and indeed for the architects",Paragraph
"themselves, the appearance of a common",Paragraph
mission.,Paragraph
The building that Mies designed for the,Paragraph
"exhibition, an apartment block, showcased",Paragraph
the earliest use of structural steel in an,Paragraph
apartment building in Europe. The steel,Paragraph
"allowed Mies to create thin, non-load-bearing",Paragraph
"18.5 Mies van der Rohe’s apartment block, Weissenhof Siedlung",Caption
walls on the interior. As would become,Paragraph
"his custom, he combined the walls that",Paragraph
contained the water and plumbing pipes with,Paragraph
stairwell walls to create a core that repeated,Paragraph
itself on the various floors. This core is in,Paragraph
"the shape of a two-pronged fork, with the",Paragraph
staircase between the prongs. The walls,Caption
contained the plumbing and water pipes for,Paragraph
the kitchens and bathrooms. It was a brilliant,Paragraph
and simple compression—and unification—of,Paragraph
"structure, space, and function.",Paragraph
"18.6 Two houses by Le Corbusier, Weissenhof Siedlung",Caption
"Le Corbusier's building, by contrast, followed",Paragraph
the principles of his Five Points. It was,Paragraph
elevated against the slope of a hill and had,Paragraph
a roof terrace with a pergola and planters.,Caption
"Much as in Mies’s plan, Le Corbusier's",Paragraph
"interior is almost completely open, but in",Paragraph
Le Corbusier's case the partition walls do,Paragraph
not reach the facade. There are no rooms,Paragraph
"in the conventional sense, but rather a",Paragraph
typically French enfilade organization along,Paragraph
"the facade. The kitchen, bath, and toilet are",Caption
"lined up against the far wall, which might",Paragraph
seem reasonable given the need for pipes,Paragraph
and ventilation. But the wall is suspended in,Paragraph
space and thus the pipes had to be hidden,Paragraph
in the floor.,Paragraph
Both buildings speak to the image of,Paragraph
"the new, modern man. Mies’s building",Caption
organizes the service elements around their,Paragraph
"unctionality, separating the bodily functions,",Paragraph
"ike eating and bathing, from empty space.",Paragraph
Le Corbusier organizes the space around,Paragraph
"culturally based hierarchies, while bathing",Paragraph
and cooking areas are whittled down and,Paragraph
placed in marginal spaces. Although the,Paragraph
jouses of the Sied/ung ( twenty-one in all),Caption
were designed for the working class—the,Paragraph
intended beneficiary of modernist politics—,Paragraph
the actual cost would have been way out,Paragraph
of reach for most workers. This disparity,Paragraph

The Great Depression of 1929 had left,Paragraph
"millions homeless in the United States, and",Paragraph
"Wright was eager to show that his housing,",Paragraph
"in contrast to that of a Weissenhof, could",Paragraph
accommodate the changed economic,Title
conditions without loss of integrity. Wright,Caption
proposed a single-story house that did not,Paragraph
require expensive excavations for basements,Paragraph
"or upper-floor framing. Steel, which was",Paragraph
"expensive, was not used; instead, the houses",Paragraph
"were to be made of wood, brick, local stone,",Paragraph
and prefabricated blocks. The bricks were,Paragraph
not covered with stucco and the wood was,Paragraph
"left plain, thus reducing finishing costs. The",Paragraph
houses were sited not only to make optimal,Paragraph
"use of the lot, but also to include as much",Paragraph
openness as possible frorn the living room to,Paragraph
the backyard. Heating was incorporated into,Paragraph
the concrete floor in the form of looped water,Paragraph
pipes buried under the slab. The elaborate,Paragraph
and expensive millwork needed to conceal,Paragraph
radiators in Prairie houses could thus be,Paragraph
eliminated.,Paragraph
Wright fused the dining and living rooms and,Paragraph
in some cases combined them into a single,Paragraph
space. This was a radical departure fromm his,Paragraph
"earlier houses, and indeed from centuries of",Paragraph
"tradition: because of noise, smells, and the",Paragraph
"activities of servants, the kitchen was always",Paragraph
set apart from the dining room. But the,Paragraph
owners of these houses were not expected to,Paragraph
be wealthy enough to afford a maid. Wright,Paragraph
also wanted to create spaces that were,Paragraph
conducive to family conversation. The kitchen,Caption
"was placed close to the carport as well,",Paragraph
minimizing the distance between the car and,Paragraph
the kitchen to facilitate the transportation of,Paragraph
groceries.,Paragraph

The competition turned into a contest,Paragraph
"tween modernists and traditionalists, with",Paragraph
Le Corbusier's entry rejected in favor of a,Paragraph
Beaux-Arts project designed by Henri-Paul,Caption
Jénot. Though the membership of CIAM was,Paragraph
constantly changing—as were its priorities—,Paragraph
Le Corbusier played the dominant role in,Paragraph
"it, along with Walter Gropius and the Swiss",Paragraph
architectural historian Siegfried Giedion.,Paragraph
"From its inception, there were arguments",Paragraph
"about which direction to take, but the group",Paragraph
managed to hang together for almost two,Paragraph
"decades. Nonetheless, in the five congresses",Paragraph
"eld before World War ||, CIAM shifted its",Paragraph
position from an organization that encouraged,Paragraph
a plurality of views about modern architecture,Title
to one increasingly dominated by the ideas of,Paragraph
Le Corbusier.,Paragraph
"The first congress, in 1928, produced a",Paragraph
"manifesto known as the Sarraz Declaration,",Paragraph
named after the Chateau de la Sarraz in,Paragraph
"France, where the group met. Twenty-four",Paragraph
"architects signed the document, which",Paragraph
attacked the academies for their sterilizing,Paragraph
grip on the architectural profession; it instead,Paragraph
"promoted an architecture based on practical,",Paragraph
"economic, and sociological considerations.",Paragraph
The document held that modern architecture,Paragraph
had the obligation to satisfy not only the,Paragraph
material needs of the population but also,Paragraph
the spiritual and intellectual demands of,Title
"contemporary life. Modern urbanism, it",Paragraph
"argued, should be based not on arbitrary",Paragraph
aesthetic principles but on a collective and,Paragraph
methodological land policy. This realism,Paragraph
was eventually replaced by a more utopian,Paragraph
ethos emphasizing the question of whether,Paragraph
architects should adopt a sociological,Paragraph
approach or a more formal one. The urban,Paragraph
designers with practical experience tended to,Paragraph
"favor the former, whereas Le Corbusier, ever",Paragraph
"the elitist, favored the latter.",Paragraph
"At CIAM 3, held in Brussels, Le Corbusier",Caption
began to gain the upper hand in determining,Paragraph
the agenda and in promoting his Ville,Paragraph
"Radieuse (“Radiant City""). At the fourth",Paragraph
"CIAM congress, in 1933, the participants",Paragraph
published their conclusions as the Athens,Paragraph
Charter (so-called because the Congress,Paragraph
was held on board a ship that sailed from,Paragraph
Marseille to Athens). It committed CIAM,Paragraph
"to rigidly functional cities, whose citizens",Paragraph
"would be housed in high, widely spaced",Paragraph
apartment blocks based on CIAM planning,Title
principles that called for the separation of,Paragraph
living functions. Greenbelts would separate,Paragraph
"each zone of the city. Generally speaking, it",Paragraph
"was assumed, as Le Corbusier phrased it,",Paragraph
that the positions adopted by CIAM would be,Paragraph
accepted by “an enlightened population that,Paragraph
"would understand, desire and demand what",Paragraph
the specialists have envisioned for it.”,Paragraph
18.12 Le Corbusier’s vision for the residential quarter of the Radiant City,Caption
Pavilion Suisse,Title
Le Corbusier reinvented the ideal industrial,Paragraph
city of the modern age. He published his,Paragraph
ideas in the form of several utopian proposals,Title
"to remake Paris, among which were The",Paragraph
Contemporary City (1922) and The Radiant,Title
City (1933). Drawn frorn the viewpoint of a,Paragraph
"bird or a plane, these cities erased a huge",Paragraph
"swath of the existing urban fabric of Paris,",Paragraph
leaving only some of the more respected,Paragraph
monuments and churches in place. The,Paragraph
new city consisted of rows of identical,Paragraph
cruciform skyscrapers clustered around an,Paragraph
"airfield in the center. In later schemes, he",Paragraph
"showed housing organized in long, multistory",Paragraph
blocks that twisted and turned to create,Paragraph
bounded fields between their curves. Le,Paragraph
Corbusier also made a series of perspectives,Paragraph
from the human-eye level that showed a,Paragraph
continuous green landscape flowing under,Title
"the skyscrapers, built on stilts, as far as the",Paragraph
eye could see. The audacity of Le Corbusier's,Paragraph
proposals—particularly the impunity with,Paragraph
which he proposed to erase the historic city—,Paragraph
"provoked loud reactions, both of praise and",Paragraph
"horror. For his defenders, his urban designs",Paragraph
catapulted him into the role of the messiah,Paragraph
of a new industrial age. Le Corbusier was,Paragraph
never able to realize any of his sweeping,Paragraph
"urban plans as he wished, even though some",Paragraph
of the suggested features eventually came,Paragraph
"to influence urban planning the world over,",Paragraph
especially after World War II.,Paragraph
The Radiant City was an example of social,Paragraph
functionalism. Each apartment block was,Paragraph
equipped with a catering section and laundry,Paragraph
in the basement. The space between,Paragraph
the blocks was dedicated to sports and,Paragraph
"leisure, and the roof was for gardens and",Paragraph
day-care centers. Transportation systerns,Paragraph
were designed throughout the city. All this,Paragraph
was part of Le Corbusier's critique of the,Paragraph
horizontal spread of the Garden City and the,Paragraph
wasted cornmuting time that engendered.,Paragraph

also the visual sensation created by the,Paragraph

is impossible to understand the columns as,Paragraph

"known as Mouridism, according to which",Paragraph
the material world is not complete in and of,Paragraph
"itself: matter, it teaches, is relevant to life only",Paragraph
insofar as it is infused by the divine. Bamba,Paragraph
perceived his mission as also a social one;,Paragraph
he wanted his adherents to return to the,Paragraph
“straight path” of Islam. So Touba became,Paragraph
a holy city in which everything frivolous—,Paragraph
"laughing, dancing, drinking alcohol—was",Paragraph
forbidden.,Paragraph
At first the French colonial authorities,Paragraph
viewed Bamba’s growing popularity as,Paragraph
a threat to their authority and sent him,Paragraph
"into exile, but since his position was one",Paragraph
"of nonviolence, they released him and",Paragraph
eventually gave him their nominal support.,Paragraph
"In the 1920s, Bamba launched the",Paragraph

experience. It was designed symbolically,Paragraph
around an ancient sacred baobab tree,Paragraph
(which died in 2003). On the qibla side of,Paragraph
"the mosque is another tree, a palm tree,",Paragraph
that marks the spot where the first birth in,Paragraph
Touba took place. These trees are called,Paragraph
palaver trees by the locals. (Palaver derives,Paragraph
"from the Portuguese palavra, which means",Paragraph
"speech or discussion.) Since ancient times,",Paragraph
palaver trees have served as the heart of,Paragraph
community meetings and been at the center,Title
of civic and religious functions; because,Paragraph
"of their longevity, the trees are considered",Paragraph
the spiritual guarantors of a community's,Paragraph
life. The palaver tree tradition can be found,Paragraph
"across central Africa. In Islamic areas, it is",Paragraph
the mosque that serves as the political and,Paragraph
"social center of the Islamic community, which",Paragraph
can bring the mosque into competition with,Paragraph
"this older tradition. Here, however, the old",Paragraph
"and the new were fused, the ancient tradition",Paragraph

The overall planning of Villa Mairea can be,Paragraph

"Two towering curved shapes, covered with",Paragraph

Costa and Niemeyer also collaborated on,Paragraph
the design of the Brazilian Pavilion for the,Caption

a building that would stand out not for its,Paragraph

"(Brazil was still poor), but for its inherent",Paragraph
formal qualities. Simplicity and the suggestion,Paragraph
of direct functionalism was its message. The,Paragraph
two-story design lifted the main volume of,Paragraph
the pavilion above the ground and made a,Paragraph

transparency.,Paragraph
Mies was not only appointed head of,Paragraph
the architecture department of the Illinois,Title
Institute of Technology (IIT) but was given the,Paragraph
commission to lay out the campus. It became,Paragraph
the first truly modern campus in history with,Paragraph
"all buildings made of steel, brick, and glass.",Paragraph
"The site was laid out on a 7.3-meter grid,",Paragraph
that being the dirnension of the standard,Paragraph
"18.54 Crown Hall, IIT, Chicago",Caption

guaranteed that if only a part of the carnpus,Paragraph
"were constructed, future architectural unity",Paragraph
could be preserved. The buildings were all,Paragraph
rectangular and more or less of the same,Paragraph
"height but varied in shape, according to",Paragraph
program.,Paragraph
"In designing the buildings, a new type of",Paragraph
space became central to Mies’s aesthetics.,Paragraph
"Whereas in earlier decades, his spaces",Paragraph
"flowed along walls and columns, here he",Paragraph
"became interested in large, vacuous spaces",Paragraph
defined by a simple symmetry of form,Paragraph
and bounded at the perimeter by colurnns,Paragraph
conceived in rigorous geometrical order. Mies,Paragraph
realized the potential of these ideas in the,Paragraph
plans for his unbuilt library building (1942-,Caption
"43), where, however, he did not abandon",Paragraph
"his notion of a conceptual core, formed",Paragraph
here by the book stacks placed in a square,Caption
toward one end of the building and flanked,Paragraph
by bathrooms and stairs. This conceptual,Paragraph
mass was contrasted with an open courtyard,Paragraph
that was to be fronted by an interior waiting,Paragraph
"room. The plan was flexible, but not “free” as",Paragraph
"Le Corbusier would define it. It was layered,",Paragraph
"thickened, and thinned. Since this was to be",Paragraph
"a one-story building, the fire code permitted",Paragraph
"the use of unencased steel, allowing Mies to",Paragraph
reveal the structural elements inside and out,Paragraph
with maximum clarity. Mies elaborated on the,Paragraph
theme again in the Crown Hall at IIT (1950-,Caption

Gallery in Berlin (1962-67).,Paragraph

"Because the site, not far from a river, was",Paragraph
"prone to flooding, Mies elevated the house",Paragraph
2.2 meters above ground level. Entrance was,Caption
gained by a broad flight of steps interrupted,Paragraph
"by a large, open podium without railings.",Paragraph
Two sets of four columns support a roof,Caption
cantilevered at both ends. There are no,Paragraph
"walls, but rather sheets of glass between",Paragraph
the columns that span from floor to ceiling.,Paragraph
The kitchen and bathrooms were unified,Paragraph
into a single core element set to one side,Paragraph
of the space to define two separate zones.,Paragraph
The floors of white travertine and the white,Title
painted steel frame created a sense of grace,Paragraph
and refinement. The curtains were of natural,Paragraph
"shantung silk and the woodwork of teak,",Title
Mies being very luxury-conscious when it,Paragraph
came to the sparse interior furnishings. There,Paragraph
"were difficulties, however, in actually living",Paragraph
in the house (Mrs. Farnsworth complained,Paragraph
of feeling like she was in a fish bowl). The,Paragraph
house nonetheless became the model for,Paragraph
"several other experiments, the most notable",Paragraph
being the private residence designed by,Paragraph
"Philip Johnson on his estate in New Canaan,",Paragraph
Connecticut (1949). The Johnson house used,Paragraph
"steel for the posts but the roof was of wood,",Paragraph
which was significantly easier to construct,Paragraph
and repair. Johnson separated the bathroor,Paragraph

"slender steel columns, cantilevered out from",Caption
"the slope of a hillside lot. However, in 1947,",Paragraph
they designed it to enclose more space using,Paragraph

"house, anchored by a retaining wall, nestles",Paragraph
"against the hillside, parallel to its contours,",Paragraph
"making it a statement as much about the site,",Paragraph
"the location, and the inhabitants as about",Paragraph
the deployment of prefabricated industrial,Title
materials. The house featured extremely,Paragraph
thin steel framing with exposed corrugated,Caption
"metal roofing, and consisted of 18 bays—",Paragraph
"each 2.3 meters wide, 6 meters long, and 5",Paragraph
meters high—that determined the rhythm of,Paragraph

the house a vibrant and playful character.,Paragraph
The Eameses filled the house with a,Paragraph
collection of iterns they had accumulated,Paragraph

"called House after Five Years of Living,",Paragraph
implying that their house was not so much,Paragraph
a designer display but an organic organism,Title
with the patina of lived-in existence that,Paragraph
reflects the character and preferences,Paragraph
of the inhabitants. Other than designing,Paragraph

furniture. One of their earliest successes,Paragraph
"was a technique for bending plywood, which",Paragraph
was used in World War Il field hospitals for,Paragraph

But that does not mean that his work was,Paragraph

"Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut",Caption
(1951-53) is remarkably unrhetorical with,Paragraph
horizontally marked brick walls defining,Paragraph
one direction and the aluminum glazing of,Paragraph
the windows defining the other. He placed,Paragraph
the building's programmatic needs within,Paragraph
this very simple framework by organizing,Paragraph
them into cylinders and rectangles. The,Paragraph
idea is not unlike the way Mies attempted,Paragraph
to unify secondary program elements into a,Paragraph
"vertical spine, except that here they become",Paragraph
almost sculptural. Kahn was intrigued by,Paragraph
the interaction between humans and the,Title
technical systems that service them—and,Paragraph
that are therefore an integral part of the,Paragraph
architectural world. So he chose to make a,Paragraph
"virtue out of electrical wiring, outlets, lighting",Paragraph
"ixtures, and ductwork, all of which are",Paragraph
allowed to remain visible. The entrance is,Paragraph
almost invisible from the street as it is on a,Paragraph

"set of stairs. Mies, more likely than not, would",Paragraph
ave made the entrance at street level with,Paragraph
lots of glass; Gropius might have made a thin,Paragraph
canopy. But Kahn's entrance is something,Paragraph
one finds somewhat unexpectedly—perhaps,Paragraph
ike in a medieval European town. Even,Paragraph
the steps seem to indicate a change in the,Paragraph
urban elevation. It is a subtle homage to the,Paragraph
power of a type of space that is both intimate,Paragraph
and urban. Kahn continually downplayed,Paragraph
"entrances in his architecture, deemphasizing",Paragraph
the ceremonial aspect of approach. The,Paragraph
uncompromising bluntness of the building,Title
foreshadows an aesthetic that came to be,Paragraph
"known as brutalism, which was to take root in",Paragraph
the late 1960s.,Paragraph
Kahn studied at the American Academy,Paragraph
"in Rome in 1950, followed by travels to Italy,",Paragraph
"Egypt, and Greece in 1951. Unlike most",Paragraph
"modernists, who rejected the architecture",Paragraph
"of antiquity, he saw in it a struggle to",Paragraph
make the building hold its own against the,Paragraph
overwhelming grandeur of the landscape. For,Paragraph
"this reason, he preferred the archaic Temple",Paragraph
of Paestum to the refined proportions of the,Paragraph
Parthenon. His study of Greek and Roman,Paragraph
architecture led Kahn to use simple but,Paragraph
arresting forms—and even symmetries—at a,Paragraph
time when these would have been frowned,Title

traditional framework of rooms and walls. But,Paragraph
as innovative and controversial as Wright's,Paragraph
"exhibition ideas were, there is no debate",Paragraph
about the building's impressive central space.,Paragraph
"Accessed virtually directly frorn the street,",Paragraph
it was conceived as an extension of the,Paragraph
urban site. In that respect it constituted an,Paragraph
important breakthrough in the relationship,Title
of modernism to civic space. Though the,Paragraph
Museum of Modern Art (1938-39) by Philip,Caption
Goodwin and Edward Durell Stone was,Paragraph
technically the first modern building in New,Paragraph
"York, the Guggenheim was the city’s first truly",Paragraph
modernist civic structure.,Paragraph
The project went through several,Paragraph
permutations. At first the building was to be,Paragraph
"a type of private gallery, showing the works",Paragraph
"of Solomon R. Guggenheim, but later in",Paragraph
1952 the museum expanded its definition to,Paragraph
"become something much broader, rivaling",Paragraph
the Museum of Modern Art as an institution,Title
of experimentation and taste-making across,Title
the whole range of modern art. The expanded,Paragraph
program forced Wright to make amendments,Title
"and concessions, but he did not change",Paragraph
his stance that flat paintings would be well,Paragraph
"served by hanging against curving walls, and",Paragraph
the public's positive reception of the building,Paragraph
offset complaints by curators and painters.,Paragraph
The building was based on an innovative,Paragraph
structural system of radially splayed concrete,Paragraph
ribs that held the floor plates and came,Paragraph
together at the top to form the dome. While,Paragraph
the building soon became a Manhattan,Paragraph
"landmark, the success of its functional",Paragraph
purpose—the display of paintings—remains,Paragraph
questionable and was never imitated. One,Paragraph
complaint is that the building competes by,Paragraph
claiming artwork status itself and thus may,Paragraph
distract from the display; another is that,Paragraph
"visitors cannot really come to rest, as they are",Paragraph
is in motion on a ramp that urges movernent,Paragraph

"expand the scientific basis of architecture,",Paragraph
"urban design, and planning in order to reject",Paragraph
arbitrary self-expression and monotonic,Title
versions of rationalism and also to embrace,Title
extratechnological and nonfunctionalist,Title

dramatic change with Mies van der Rohe’s Seagram,Title
"Building (1958) in Midtown Manhattan, designed",Caption
in collaboration with Philip Johnson and built as the,Paragraph
headquarters for the Canadian distillers Joseph E.,Paragraph
Seagram & Sons. The thirty-eight-story building is,Paragraph
a vertical box with clean and sharp edges. Unlike,Paragraph
"early skyscrapers, whose bodies were punctuated by",Paragraph
"windows, here glass reaches from floor to ceiling and",Paragraph
serves as the skin of the building. The visible edge of,Paragraph
the floor plate is covered by bronze spandrels that give,Paragraph
a light horizontal zippering effect to the floors during,Paragraph
"the day, when light reflects off the glass—an effect",Paragraph
"even more pronounced at night, when the reflection",Paragraph
contrasts with the interior illumination.,Paragraph
Although the building seems to be all structural,Paragraph
"steel and glass, this is not exactly true. Fire code",Paragraph
"prohibited exposed steel, meaning that the steel",Paragraph
supports had to be covered in fireproof concrete.,Paragraph
Since this is not how Mies wanted the building to read,Paragraph
"on the outside, he used nonstructural, bronze-toned",Paragraph
"Ibeams running vertically, like mullions, down the",Paragraph
facades. These vertical mullions are equally spaced,Paragraph
across the entire facade. Together with the horizontal,Paragraph
"spandrels, they create a pronounced grid pattern. This",Paragraph
"surfacing does not extend to the ground, however,",Paragraph
allowing the building's real structure—the concrete-,Paragraph
encased beams—to be visible in the lobby. The glass,Paragraph
"is not purely transparent, but tinted bronze, so that",Paragraph
"in certain lighting conditions, the whole building—its",Paragraph
"structure and its glass—seem to have a golden hue,",Paragraph
"perhaps, it has been argued, subtly suggesting the",Paragraph
"color of whiskey, one of the building owner's products.",Paragraph
"nthe 1960s, Chicago's skyline began to change",Paragraph

at the Architectural Association (AA) in,Paragraph
"London, embraced the language and images",Title
of the youth culture that was blooming in,Paragraph
England and abroad. His investigations into,Paragraph
inflatable technology led to the Automat in,Paragraph
1968. It was a user-responsive pneumatic,Paragraph
structure supported by internal bracing,Caption
"cables, which, attached to high-pressure",Paragraph
"jacks, allowed the structure to expand and",Paragraph
contract in response to a user's weight,Paragraph
requirements. Fisher improved the Automat,Paragraph

inflatable stage props for the Animals tour,Title

The most memorable of the Animals tour,Title
"inflatables were the series of pigs, which",Paragraph

Buckminster Fuller,Title
"Among the modernists, the one who most",Paragraph
radically rethought the question of technology,Title
was Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983). In,Paragraph
"1929, at the age of thirty-two, Fuller decided",Paragraph
to study what he called the ecological,Paragraph
principles of life. His goal was to analyze,Paragraph
nature's resources and think of ways to,Paragraph
make ther available to all of humanity,Paragraph
"through an informed, efficient, flexible, and",Paragraph
responsible attitude toward design. His key,Paragraph
"concepts were synergetics, which is what",Paragraph
he called the underlying coordinate system,Paragraph
of both physical and metaphysical nature;,Paragraph
"and ephemeralization, which essentially is",Paragraph
doing more with less. Unlike some European,Paragraph
"modernists, who saw housing as primarily a",Paragraph
question of social needs allied loosely with,Title
"industrial realities, Fuller saw housing as",Paragraph
tightly interwoven with industrialization and,Paragraph
social utopian thinking.,Paragraph
"What resulted in 1928, after a series of",Paragraph
experiments with large-scale towers and,Paragraph
"multiple-family housing systerns, was the",Paragraph
"project for a prefabricated, mass-produced",Paragraph
"4D Dymaxion House, in which plumbing and",Caption
"electrical networks, as well as appliances,",Paragraph
were contained in the central mast. The,Paragraph
house could therefore operate independently,Paragraph
"of any utility network, which made it flexible",Paragraph
enough to be located anywhere in the world.,Paragraph
"lt was enclosed by transparent, shuttering",Paragraph
"walls rade of vacuum-pane glass, which",Paragraph
eliminated the need for windows. A specially,Paragraph
designed ventilation system made dusting,Caption
"unnecessary, as air drawn through vents was",Paragraph
filtered and then heated or cooled as desired.,Paragraph
An in-home laundry facility was designed,Paragraph
"to wash, dry, fold, and place clean laundry",Title
in appropriate compartments. The entire,Paragraph
structure was to be mass-produced and,Paragraph
"flown to its site by blimps, with installation",Paragraph
"requiring only a single day. All of this, Fuller",Paragraph
"estimated, would cost only slightly more than",Paragraph
a 1928 Ford or Chevrolet automobile. The,Paragraph

realized.,Paragraph

Fuller's breakthrough discovery—and this,Title

the most efficient structure ever designed.,Paragraph
"Geodesic domes, in fact, become stronger",Paragraph

Balkrishna V. Doshi (1927-) and Charles,Title

consequence was a structure that was just as,Paragraph

of vaulted roofs (covered with broken china),Caption
derived from the original shed that stood on,Paragraph
the site.,Paragraph
Correa extended Le Corbusier's fascination,Paragraph
with sunlight to create a series of houses,Paragraph
made of brick and concrete that used the,Paragraph
concept of sections as well as a pergola,Paragraph
roof to create microclimatic conditions. His,Paragraph
"Parekh House (1967-68) in Anmedabad,",Caption

distant influence of Kahn's Trenton Bath,Paragraph
Houses can be seen in Correa’s design for,Paragraph
"the Gandhi Ashram Museum (1958-63),",Paragraph
intended to house artifacts and an exhibition,Paragraph
of the life of Mahatma Gandhi. Here Correa,Caption
used a 6-meter grid composed of I-shaped,Paragraph
brick piers to set up an interconnected,Paragraph
network of spaces—some open to the,Paragraph
"sky, some covered but open, and some",Paragraph
fully enclosed—that showed an early skill,Paragraph
in developing courtyard-like spaces to,Paragraph
"18.129 Sangath, Ahmedabad",Caption
"advantage. Correa used a mud-tile roof, held",Paragraph

POSTMODERNISM,Title
The word postmodernism does not refer,Paragraph

"it is very different from other designations,",Paragraph
like Georgian or Shingle Style or even the,Paragraph
"International style, which, despite its multiple",Paragraph
"meanings and origins in architecture, by the",Paragraph
1950s described a set of practices loosely,Paragraph
defined around the ideals of CIAM. But,Paragraph
what had seemed so promising in 1950,Paragraph
was by 1970 seen not only as constricting,Paragraph
but also as failing to live up to its promises.,Paragraph
"More and more, critics began to associate",Paragraph
"modernism with capitalism, bureaucracy,",Paragraph
"and failed social housing. And for Europeans,",Paragraph
modernism after World War Il meant endless,Title
"rows of hastily built, drab housing blocks.",Paragraph
"There were no Brasilias, Chandigarhs, or",Paragraph
"Daccas in Europe, and few examples of",Paragraph
successful civic modernism. In the United,Paragraph
"States, modernism was more successful. It",Paragraph
had made significant inroads in domestic,Paragraph

"18.132 AT&T Building, New York City",Caption
Charles Jenck’s 1977 book The Language of,Title
Postmodern Architecure sought to establish,Paragraph
a canon for postmodernism by linking,Paragraph
"architectural vocabulary to structuralism,",Paragraph
or the study of the structure of language.,Paragraph
Michael Graves (1934-2015) was singled out,Paragraph
"by Jencks. His buildings used color, stripped",Paragraph
"down classical vocabularies, and applied the",Paragraph
methodology of the collage. Other architects,Paragraph
"moved in the direction of social realism, such",Paragraph
as Robert Venturi (1925-) and Denise Scott,Paragraph
"Brown (1931-), who were influenced by pop",Paragraph
art and who turned their gaze at highway,Title
architecture and most specifically to Las,Title
"Vegas, Nevada. Charles Moore (1925-93),",Caption
"by way of contrast, sought a deeper personal",Paragraph
commitment to architecture than that which,Paragraph
could be provided by a standard professional,Paragraph
practice. In his writings we see the,Paragraph
"beginnings of an interest in phenomenology,",Paragraph

Moving from Philip Johnson to Charles,Title
"Moore, one can begin to recognize the",Paragraph
inherent and unresolved complexity of,Paragraph
"postmodernism, for though it heralded a",Paragraph

"and was thus a liberating movement, it",Paragraph
"also had conservative leanings, as was",Paragraph
"brought to the fore by the phenomenologists,",Paragraph
"who, in the United States and elsewhere,",Paragraph
began to replace the socially oriented,Paragraph
architects in acadernia. Those who wanted,Paragraph
to take up the issue of community-oriented,Paragraph
architecture often left the field of architecture,Paragraph
for the rapidly expanding discipline of,Paragraph
urban planning. Among the very early,Paragraph
"phenomenologists, Christian Norberg-Schultz",Title
(1926-2000) was strongly influenced by,Paragraph
the German philosopher Martin Heidegger,Title
"and argued for a regionally-based aesthetic,",Paragraph
whereas Moore argued that architecture,Paragraph
needed to integrate a sensitivity to landscape,Paragraph
with an aesthetic determined by psychology,Paragraph
and memory. At the opposite extreme from,Paragraph
"phenomenology was psychoanalysis, which",Paragraph
"among architects, unlike artists at the time,",Paragraph
received very little interest.,Paragraph
"18.133 Piazza d'Italia, New Orleans",Caption
Certainly one of the most intriguing aspects,Paragraph
of postmodernism was its interest in irony.,Paragraph
No architecture before or after has allowed,Paragraph

there were many postmodernists who rejected,Paragraph

seriousness. This movement was particularly,Paragraph

"English styles. In Italy, Aldo Rossi (1937-97)",Paragraph
argued for a typological coherence to,Paragraph
architecture and challenged both modernists,Title
and postmodernists by staying within the,Paragraph
brutalist aesthetic. At the Gallaratese (1969-,Paragraph
"73), a large apartment building project on",Paragraph
"the outskirts of Milan, for example, Rossi",Paragraph
designed one of the blocks with a rhetoric,Paragraph
of extreme formalist stoicism. The result was,Paragraph
the emergence of an ethos of “regionalism”,Title
which had many defenders since it allowed,Paragraph
"for a criticism of modernism, on the one",Paragraph
"hand, and of postmodernism’s penchant",Paragraph
for irony and arbitrariness on the other.,Paragraph
Regionalisrn was particularly strong outside,Paragraph
"of the West, where it tapped into nationalist",Paragraph
and anticolonialist sentiments. But there were,Paragraph
"also a handful of European regionalists, such",Paragraph
"as the Swiss architect Mario Botta (1943-),",Paragraph
"whose work drew somewhat vaguely on local,",Paragraph
"historical forms. Nonetheless, his buildings’",Paragraph
"plans remained in some sense modern, as",Paragraph
did their massing.,Paragraph
Whereas many of the more conservative,Paragraph
postmodernists attempted to orient,Title
"architecture back to its temporal, contextual,",Paragraph
"and historical roots, Peter Eisenman (1932-),",Paragraph
along with John Hedjuk (1929-2000),Paragraph
"and a few others, rejected any softening",Paragraph
of architecture in the direction of culture.,Paragraph
"Architecture, to maintain itself as a discipline,",Paragraph
"18.135 House at Stabio, Switzerland",Caption
jad to remain aloof from cultural traditions,Title
and bourgeois demands. Eisenman thus,Paragraph
created for his buildings a set of formal,Paragraph
constraints that had nothing to do with,Paragraph
unction or program. His radical formalism,Paragraph
ies at the opposite end of the spectrum,Paragraph
rom Robert Venturi’s pop contextualism.,Paragraph
"lonetheless, both celebrated the disjuncture",Paragraph
of expectations in the understanding of what,Paragraph
"is architecture. Eisenman’s architecture,",Paragraph
"jowever, maintained a focus on the design",Paragraph
process by seeking out a self-referential,Paragraph
janguage that excluded the traditional priority,Paragraph
of client needs. For the design of a house,Paragraph
e created a type of game in which a cube,Paragraph
"was cut, rotated, sliced, and otherwise",Paragraph
"manipulated, so that what was left over was",Paragraph
"the “house”: function, siting, weather, and",Paragraph
use were given no consideration at all. He,Paragraph
wanted to demonstrate that function is just,Paragraph
as flexible as form and that a “house” is a,Paragraph
"semantic indicator of an architectural object,",Paragraph
not its typology. This is different frorn the,Paragraph
"views of Rossi, who wanted functionalism to",Paragraph
bend to the primacy of type.,Paragraph
"Postmodernism, through the influences of",Paragraph
"pop art, also began to accommodate itself to",Paragraph
the new medium of signage and advertising.,Paragraph
The Centre Georges Pompidou (1971-77) in,Paragraph
"Paris, designed by the firm Piano & Rogers,",Caption
was about “legibility.” It was originally to,Paragraph
have large billboards suspended frorn its,Paragraph
"metal structure. The service conduits, too,",Paragraph
had to be legible. Air-conditioning ducts are,Paragraph

Postmodernism had such a profound impact,Paragraph
on the non-Western world that in the 1980s,Paragraph
and early 1990s it found itself reassessing,Paragraph
its claims to modernity and nationalism.,Paragraph
"Japanese architecture, for example, moved",Paragraph
away from Metabolism and other forms of,Title
modernist expression. Arata Isozaki (1931-),Caption
became more literal in his references to,Paragraph
"Japanese forms, whereas younger, self-",Paragraph
trained architects like Tadao Ando (1941-),Paragraph
gravitated toward elemental forms that,Paragraph
stressed the interplay of light and materials in,Paragraph
"the experience of minimalist, poetic creations.",Paragraph
His work became the hallmark of a new,Paragraph
and very successful Japanese aesthetic that,Paragraph
was highly modern and abstract and that,Paragraph
also found common cause with traditional,Paragraph
"Japanese forms. His work in concrete, the",Paragraph
"predominant material of his expression,",Paragraph
was immaculately poured. The Shingonshu,Paragraph
"Honpukuji (“Water Temple,” 1991), for",Paragraph
"instance, focused on an singular moment",Paragraph
where a stair descended through a round,Paragraph
pond with a smattering of water lilies. At his,Paragraph

that hover weightlessly next to each other,Paragraph
"to create a luminous cross; at the rear, in",Paragraph
"another tour de force, the slight gap between",Paragraph
the walls allows a blinding sliver of light to,Paragraph
penetrate the dark stillness.,Paragraph
Japanese postmodernism could be seen,Paragraph
"as a highly refined form of modernism,",Paragraph
"and not really as postmodernism at all,",Paragraph
since it is stripped of all except the most,Paragraph
basic of cultural references. But the,Paragraph
rise of postmodernism in other places,Title
was significantly messier and was often,Paragraph
accompanied by the erosion of the secular,Paragraph
nation-state as the common reference,Title
point for diverse communities. Since,Paragraph
postmodernism allowed alternative claims,Title
"to the conventions of nationalism, irony",Paragraph
was almost never brought into play: on the,Paragraph
"contrary, the search was usually for some",Paragraph
form of regional authenticity based on,Paragraph
traditions. Just what constituted “tradition”,Paragraph
"then became highly contested, particularly",Paragraph
"in places like South Asia, where different",Paragraph
"claims, due to India's complex past, could",Paragraph
be made upon history and its associated,Title
"aesthetics. For example, right-wing Hindu",Paragraph
nationalists demolished a mosque in northern,Paragraph
India in the early 1990s on the grounds that,Paragraph
it had been built on the foundations of a,Paragraph
Hindu temple a millennium ago; the incident,Title
"sparked religious riots. Similarly, the Islamic",Paragraph
world saw a resurgence of orthodox claims to,Paragraph
"Islamic identity in cultural expression, forcing",Paragraph
the rollback of national modernism in places,Title
"such as Turkey and Egypt. Often, however,",Paragraph
the tendency to see everything before,Title
"modernism as traditional—that is, as firmly",Paragraph
established and permanent—has left a gap in,Paragraph
how to engage earlier aesthetic modalities in,Title
the modern world.,Paragraph
A long list could be made of architects of,Paragraph
the postcolonial and non-Western world who,Paragraph
are searching for a way to resolve this issue,Paragraph
"without resorting to, or endorsing, regressive,",Paragraph
"nationalist politics. For the most part, such",Paragraph
"architects, deeply steeped in the sensibilities",Paragraph
"of modern architecture, have attempted to",Paragraph
reimagine their practices by referencing easily,Paragraph
accessible and often somewhat stereotypical,Paragraph
"claims to mandalas, and other traditional or",Paragraph
iconesque construction systems. Others talk,Paragraph
"of urban morphologies, place-making, and",Paragraph
"even genius foci, a term that has its origins in",Paragraph
European Romantic philosophy of the early,Title
19th century. More realistic was the work,Paragraph
of Hassan Fathy (1899-1989) in Egypt. He,Paragraph
utilized ancient design methods and materials,Title
to create low-cost architecture. He also,Paragraph
trained locals to make their own materials,Paragraph
"18.141 San Cristobal Stables, Los Clubes, Mexico City",Caption
and build their own buildings. Climatic,Paragraph
"conditions, public health considerations, and",Paragraph
ancient craft skills also affected his design,Paragraph
decisions.,Paragraph
"Geoffrey Bawa (1919-2003), an architect",Paragraph
from Sri Lanka trained at the Architectural,Paragraph
"Association in London, engaged problems",Paragraph
of managing large land and water systems,Title
while building with masons who know,Paragraph
nothing of modern building techniques.,Paragraph
"He drew, nonetheless, on local solutions",Paragraph
and developed an aesthetic that is freely,Paragraph
eclectic in its expression. His house for Dr.,Paragraph
Bartholomew (1961-63) utilized a mixture of,Paragraph
"locally available materials, including coconut",Paragraph
"trunks, granite, and fired-earth tiles, as well",Paragraph
as concrete for the foundation. He also,Paragraph
"introduced water pools, not only for cooling",Paragraph
but also to serve as visual beacons along a,Paragraph
circulation path.,Paragraph
"In Mexico, Luis Barragaén (1902-88),",Paragraph
who had collaborated with Louis Kahn on,Paragraph
the design for the plaza at the Salk Institute,Caption
"building, developed a design vocabulary of",Paragraph
"simple forms, their elegance heightened by",Paragraph
"the use of color. Somewhat like Ando, he",Paragraph
maintained a minimalist aesthetic insisting,Paragraph
on stark planes in studied juxtapositions. As,Paragraph
"a consequence, his work has a strong poetic",Paragraph

The awareness that we live in a world of,Paragraph
global relationships is now itself global. Fifty,Paragraph
"years from now, it is likely that the end of the",Paragraph
"Cold War, the rise of China, and the onset of",Paragraph
global warming will be remembered as the,Paragraph
"definitive events of the late 20th century, not",Paragraph
the spectacle of 9/11 or the rise of ISIS. Since,Paragraph

"of globalization, or the determined push to",Paragraph

of favorable trade and tariff regimes.,Paragraph
Unshackled by the structural reforms,Title
"initiated by Deng Xiaoping in 1978, China has",Paragraph
stepped up to the opportunity of globalization,Paragraph
"to corner much of the market, pioneering the",Paragraph
"concept of the special economic zone (SEZ),",Paragraph
an updated version of the colonial port treaties,Title
that were once signed to enable special,Paragraph
places like Hong Kong to operate. Since the,Paragraph
"mid-1990s, formerly Third World countries",Paragraph
have jostled to ernulate the Chinese economic,Paragraph
"model, creating a new intermediate class of",Paragraph
nations in the global hierarchy. Today they are,Paragraph
"known as the BRICS—Brazil, Russia, India,",Paragraph
"China, and South Africa—but others, such as",Paragraph
"Nigeria and Mexico, are clamoring to join in.",Paragraph
The keystone in the infrastructure of,Paragraph
globalization is the containerization that,Paragraph
has optimized international shipping in,Paragraph
"an unprecedented way, accompanied by",Paragraph
"massive purpose-built ships, automated",Paragraph
"ports, and radically rationalized truck and",Paragraph
rail transport. None of this would have been,Paragraph
possible without the concomitant spread of,Paragraph
"the new digital network, the Internet, which",Paragraph
has not only generated the sense of a self-,Paragraph
aware global community but has also enabled,Paragraph
instantaneous financial transactions across,Title
"national boundaries, transactions that power",Title
the engines of globalization. To support this,Paragraph
"network of global finance, a new empire of",Paragraph
global cities has emerged—maijor cities that,Paragraph
compete and collaborate to control global,Title
finance. Generic infrastructural buildings,Paragraph
"such as airports, airport malls, transit",Paragraph
"systems, and convention centers are also",Paragraph
being built around the world to smooth the,Paragraph
movement of the agents of global finance.,Paragraph
Global self-consciousness has also been,Paragraph
spurred by two global crises: climate change,Title
and terrorism. Two centuries of relentless,Paragraph
"industrialization, powered by fossil fuels, has",Paragraph
produced more wealth than ever before but,Paragraph
has also ended up threatening the delicate,Paragraph
equilibrium that is the atmosphere of planet,Paragraph
"19.2 Container ships in port, Seattle",Caption
Earth. Architecture’s role in this process,Paragraph
is certainly not without blame; buildings,Paragraph
are the largest consumers of energy in the,Paragraph
"United States, for instance. But the new",Paragraph
crisis of terrorism can only be indirectly,Paragraph
indexed to architecture. In the face of the,Paragraph
overwhelming military might of today’s,Title
"dominant nation-states, insurgencies around",Paragraph
the world have found a way to use the power,Paragraph
of media—and more recently the Internet—,Title
"to globalize the impact of guerilla warfare,",Paragraph
originally a very localized and supplementary,Paragraph
military tactic. Architecture plays the role,Paragraph
of collateral damage in this war. More than,Paragraph
the destruction of habitats that conventional,Title
"warfare brings about, the bombing of iconic",Paragraph
architecture like the Twin Towers in New York,Title
"captures global attention, reminding us that",Paragraph
"architecture, in spite of all its materiality and",Paragraph
"massive capital expenditures, is ultimately",Paragraph
just as subject to its media image as a,Paragraph
supermodel. Architecture's supermodel-like,Paragraph
"qualities have resulted, on the one hand, in",Paragraph
the fortification of significant public buildings,Title
"such as embassies with bollards, high-",Paragraph
"perimeter walls, and other security features;",Paragraph
"and, on the other hand, in a global obsession",Paragraph
"with super-iconic buildings, recognizable",Paragraph
"worldwide, designed by a dazzling class of",Paragraph
storied “starchitects.”,Paragraph
"19.3 Bollards protecting the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC",Caption
"In spite of all the razzle-cazzle, the critical",Paragraph

If the psychological response to,Paragraph
"uncertainty is preservation, it is no surprise",Paragraph
that the movement for preservation—or,Paragraph
"conservation, as it is also termed—",Paragraph
has emerged as a major force in the,Paragraph
architectural community. Much more than,Paragraph
the old modernist distinction between,Paragraph
"the new and the old, preservation today",Title
is a multivalent movement that includes,Paragraph
strategies as diverse as building resilient,Title
social networks and banking the world’s,Title
seeds to ensure biodiversity in the future.,Paragraph
From World Heritage to DOCOMOMO to local,Title
"activist groups, preservation is enjoying an",Paragraph
"unexpected renaissance. And in its midst,",Paragraph
"the city—as the ancient, evanescent Greek",Paragraph
ideal of diverse communities sustained in,Paragraph
an egalitarian matrix—has emerged as the,Paragraph
focus of the civic objectives of professional,Title
architects. In 2009 half the world's population,Paragraph
"lived in cities, indicating the global trend",Paragraph

celebrated by both advocates and critics of,Paragraph
globalization.,Paragraph
There is no one equation that can,Paragraph

whitewashing of the world that is implied by,Paragraph
"the term globalization. Instead, the global and",Paragraph
the local have become so intertwined that,Paragraph
perhaps the neologism g/oca/ best describes,Paragraph
the world that architects design for today.,Paragraph
Rather than painting global architecture with,Paragraph
"a single brush, we would like to suggest an",Paragraph

In contradistinction to the approach just,Paragraph
outlined are the architectural practices that,Paragraph
come from the direction of nongovernmental,Title
organizations (NGOs) that airn to solve,Paragraph
pressing social and economic problems.,Paragraph
"Globally, one in seven people lives in a",Paragraph

will increase to one in three. NGOs are an,Paragraph
important part of the solution to this pending,Paragraph
"crisis, since they are more flexible than",Paragraph
government bureaucracies and thus often,Title
more capable of identifying problems and,Paragraph

nongovernmental organization only care,Title
into broader use with the establishment,Paragraph
"of the United Nations in 1945, when",Paragraph
provisions were made for the creation of,Paragraph
"such organizations. Today, the amount of",Paragraph
unacknowledged work done by NGOs around,Paragraph
the world is staggering. An example is the,Paragraph
building effort undertaken by Kutch Nav,Title
"Nirman Abhiyan, a collection of forty NGOs",Title

together after the devastating earthquake,Title
"of January 26, 2000, to undertake a range",Paragraph

management. It has also helped construct,Paragraph

A fourth type of architecture operating at the,Paragraph
global level is produced by local architects,Paragraph
"with small firms that, despite varying design",Paragraph
"methodologies, advocate a carefully crafted",Paragraph
and well-thought-out relationship between,Paragraph
program and the constraints formed by,Title
"climate, site conditions, and materials.",Paragraph
"Though explicitly local by orientation, these",Paragraph
architects constitute a global movement due,Paragraph
"to their shared ethic of design, which can",Paragraph
be described broadly as one derived frorn,Paragraph
modern architecture. At Atelier Feichang,Caption
"Jianzhu's Split House near Beijing, for",Paragraph
"example, the architect uses rammed earth",Paragraph
not only for its natural thermal insulating,Paragraph
properties but also because rammed earth,Paragraph
has been a part of Chinese architecture in,Paragraph
history. Framed against the backdrop of the,Paragraph
"nearby cliffs, it can even be seen through",Paragraph
a Ruskinian ethos as a commentary on the,Paragraph
nature of material and geology. In Adira,Paragraph
"& Broid & Rojkind’s F-2 House, volcanic",Caption
"basalt, a common local material in Mexico",Paragraph
"City, is used as a visual and tactile contrast",Paragraph
to the cast-in-place concrete. The aesthetic,Paragraph
"is close to that of Marcel Breuer, who helped",Paragraph
create a form of modernism compatible,Paragraph
with the open landscape and the need to,Paragraph
capture the breeze. Both these houses are,Paragraph
therefore high modernist in style—but that,Paragraph
should not be any reason to condemn them.,Paragraph
Designing within the context of “the local”,Paragraph
does not require using or replicating ancient,Paragraph
techniques or falsely aestheticizing local,Title
"customs, as is so often done, for example,",Paragraph
by those who reduce the Chinese tradition of,Paragraph
screens to working with metal screens.,Paragraph
The architecture of small firms is,Paragraph
important to the development of architectural,Paragraph

A sixth category of global production revolves,Title
around the question of environment. It was,Paragraph
only recently that mainstream architectural,Paragraph
professionals began to acknowledge the,Paragraph
impact buildings have on the environment.,Paragraph
"The production of materials like rubber,",Paragraph
"steel, and glass is highly polluting. There are",Paragraph
also issues of how much energy a building,Title
"requires for heating and cooling, and the",Paragraph
question of a building's life span. The U.S.,Paragraph
Environmental Protection Agency estimates,Title
that architectural debris comprises 25,Paragraph
percent of the nation’s overall waste stream.,Paragraph
This waste often contains materials such as,Paragraph
"lead paint, asbestos, fluorescent light bulbs,",Paragraph
"light ballasts, treated lumber, and other iterns",Paragraph
that pollute the environment.,Paragraph
The impact of industrialism on the,Title
environment and society began to be,Paragraph
critiqued in the late 19th century. Frederick,Paragraph
Law Olmsted designed parks that were,Paragraph
"oases of nature in the urban context, and",Paragraph
Frank Lloyd Wright and others attempted to,Paragraph
integrate the mechanical and the natural.,Paragraph
But it was only with the ecology movement,Paragraph
of the 1960s that environmentalism becarne,Paragraph
a political issue. The slow success of that,Paragraph
movement led to the emergence of the field,Paragraph
of environmental management in the 1980s.,Paragraph
"Most of the issues involved law, government,",Paragraph
"and industry, and architecture has only",Paragraph
recently begun to find a role within the,Paragraph
"debates. Today, some architects specialize in",Paragraph
"low-budget design-build projects; others, in",Paragraph
"green housing projects, self-sufficient houses,",Paragraph
"solar houses, eco-villages, and now, so-called",Paragraph
health houses.,Paragraph
The central term in this movement is,Paragraph
"the word sustainability, but it can mean",Paragraph
different things to different groups. In the,Paragraph
"context of environmental management, the",Paragraph
"issues revolve around questions of politics,",Paragraph
"government, law, planning, and banking.",Paragraph
"Architectural design, as such, is often left",Paragraph
until the end of the process. But this has,Paragraph
"begun to change, and most large firms now",Paragraph
offer a specialization in green architecture.,Paragraph
As a common standard of measurement of,Paragraph
"the sustainable character of a building, U.S.",Paragraph
architects now use the Leadership in Energy,Paragraph
and Environmental Design (LEED) Green,Title
Building Rating System.,Paragraph
at,Title
"19.21 Commerzbank, Frankfurt, Germany",Caption

a wide spectrum of criteria but usually favors,Paragraph
more technologically advanced solutions.,Paragraph

"conditioning costs, for example—with high-",Paragraph
end technology such as specially designed,Paragraph

A final but increasingly important global,Title
formation centers on the World Heritage,Title
List to preserve buildings and building,Title
"environments, created under the auspices",Paragraph
"of the United Nations Educational, Scientific",Title
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1972.,Paragraph
"Only forty-odd years old, the list now consists",Paragraph
of more than eight hundred properties in 134,Paragraph
"countries. The list is continually expanded,",Paragraph
"and even modernist sites like Chandigarh,",Paragraph
India have recently been added to it. The,Paragraph
amount of space worldwide that is now,Paragraph
"curated, or under some form of protection,",Paragraph
has increased exponentially since the list’s,Paragraph
"inception—entire valleys, villages, and",Paragraph
landscapes are now under protection.,Paragraph
As valuable as this movement for,Paragraph
"preservation is, it is the lure of tourist dollars,",Paragraph
"as much a need to preserve identity, that",Paragraph
drives the search for heritage. The Dogon,Paragraph
cities of Dienné were inscribed on the,Paragraph
"UNESCO Heritage List in 1988, and now a",Paragraph
road is being planned to reach the remote,Paragraph
location. Being “protected” will certainly,Paragraph
"be a mixed blessing, given that this is a",Paragraph
living community and not a set of fossilized,Title
ruins. More conventional is the protection of,Paragraph
archaeological sites. More than four hundred,Paragraph
thousand people visit the remote site of,Paragraph
Machu Picchu in Peru every year. A road has,Paragraph
now been built to carry tourists almost to the,Paragraph
"top of this remote mountain. In 1994, a new",Paragraph
category was created by UNESCO: “cultural,Paragraph
landscapes” were introduced to broaden the,Paragraph
representation of what UNESCO calls human,Title
"heritage, but the delimitations of this term",Paragraph
will become increasingly complex as such,Paragraph
cultural landscapes become increasingly,Title
entangled with politics.,Paragraph
The preservation of the modern,Title
architecture of the world has been,Paragraph
"championed by DOCOMOMO, an organization",Paragraph
that started in Europe in 1988 and has,Paragraph
established itself as a major force worldwide.,Paragraph
As most of the world’s modern architecture,Paragraph
"is now at least half a century old, it is",Paragraph
increasingly under threat of destruction.,Paragraph
"Through publications, awards, conferences,",Paragraph
"and local activism, DOCOMOMO’s regional",Paragraph
chapters have sought to make the case,Paragraph
that modern architecture is as deserving of,Paragraph
preservation as the pre-modern architecture,Title
of the world.,Paragraph
Preservation is a global force in the,Paragraph
architectural community today. While it,Paragraph
is largely devoted to fighting imminent,Paragraph
"destruction, a more critical approach to",Paragraph
thinking about preservation can be found,Paragraph
in the work of people like Jorge Otero-,Paragraph
"Pailos, who made the casting of pollution",Paragraph
into an interrogation of the conventions of,Paragraph
preservation practice.,Paragraph
Global heritage is most certainly a form of,Paragraph
global intermixing. Whether that intermixing,Paragraph
is to be understood as a form of cultural,Paragraph
liberation from the hegemony of the local or,Paragraph
as cultural contamination by the hegemony,Paragraph
of the global is a question that can only be,Paragraph
resolved in each particular situation.,Paragraph
"In the last decade, architectural educators",Paragraph
have been asking for a textbook that looks,Paragraph
beyond the Eurocentric approaches of the,Paragraph
"past. Ironically, recent decades have also",Paragraph
"seen the rising specter of nationalism, which",Paragraph
has become a global phenomenon in its,Paragraph
own right as countries seek to establish their,Paragraph
credentials in global historical narratives. This,Paragraph
"new nationalism, though it has played some",Paragraph
role in awakening an awareness about local,Paragraph
"realities, has had, and continues to have, a",Paragraph
dampening effect on learning about what lies,Paragraph
over the horizon. The tension between the,Paragraph
global and the national is the fundamental,Paragraph
paradox of our age.,Paragraph
Today we live in a world that is significantly,Paragraph
more static than in centuries before—,Paragraph
boundaries are controlled by international,Paragraph
"law and political alliances, UNESCO protects",Title
architectural and urban marvels of the,Title
"past, and local and national regulations",Title
govern what can and cannot be built. We,Paragraph
control our actions for the sake of global,Title
tranquility. But inequities and injustices in,Paragraph
"the location of boundaries persist, and so,",Paragraph
"too, do the tensions that result from inward-",Paragraph
"looking ideologies. In this environment,",Paragraph
the maxim “know your neighbor” is all the,Paragraph
more important but at the same time all the,Paragraph
"more elusive, since we can all, no matter",Paragraph
"our country of origin, easily revel in our",Paragraph
singularity—in the presumed uniqueness of,Paragraph
our history.,Paragraph
This is something we need to guard,Paragraph
against. A global history is not the history of,Paragraph
all the modern nations added up like beads,Paragraph
"on an abacus, but neither is it a history that",Paragraph
assumes a universal aspect to mankind and,Paragraph
its productions. For a global history to be,Paragraph
"more than just dates and facts, it has to be",Paragraph
rooted in the principle that each of us learns,Paragraph
how he or she is indeed different in the eyes,Paragraph
of others.,Paragraph
