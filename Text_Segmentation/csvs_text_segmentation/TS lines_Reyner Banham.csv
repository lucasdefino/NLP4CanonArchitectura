"Many technologies have contributed to this domestic revolution, but",Paragraph
most of therm make their point of impact on us in the form of small machines,Paragraph

"bound up in it. The Rationalist attitude was held in high regard, yet",Paragraph
"effectively repudiated by most of them, and the academic tradition was",Paragraph

"two years of blameless academic respectability, suitably adorned with",Paragraph
"numerous firsts, medals and the Prix de Rome. His own master had been",Paragraph
"Henri Labrouste, the ‘rogue’ academician of the middle of the century,",Paragraph
and through him Guadet was a link in an unbroken academic chain that,Paragraph
"went right back to the early days of the nineteenth century, and to the",Paragraph
heyday of neo-Classical architecture in France. So truly did the tradition,Paragraph
"run through him, that his own insistence on cornposition, the assembly of a",Paragraph
"building from its component volumes, is only an echo of J. N. L. Durand",Paragraph
"saying, in 19218",Paragraph
"‘See chapter zo,",Paragraph

"Any complete building whetever is not, and cannot be, anything but the result",Paragraph
of the assembly and putting together (composition) of a preater or lesser,Paragraph
number of parts.,Paragraph
But the specific mode of putting the parts together is something that,Paragraph
Guadet barely discusses—it occupies one chapter out of eight in the,Paragraph
"second book of the first of the five volumes of Elgments et Théortes, is not",Paragraph
very informative and is completely swamped by the mass of practical infor-,Paragraph
"mation contained in the other four volumes. The fact was, simply, that the",Paragraph
symmetrical disposition of the parts of a building about one or mote axes,Paragraph
was so unquestionably the master-discipline of academic architecture that,Paragraph
"there was no need for him to discuss it, any more than he would need to",Paragraph
discuss the clothing of the building's forms in one or ancther of a number,Paragraph
of recognised ‘catalogued styles’ (as Lethaby was to call them). The details,Paragraph
"of those styles could be had from a good crib-book, such as Normand’s",Paragraph
"Paraillele, the axial discipline would be part of the air a student breathed,",Paragraph
and Guadet’s business as Professor was to handle the information that,Paragraph
could not be acquired from these two sources. It was not until the idea of,Paragraph
"axial composition had ceased to be unquestionable, that any justification or",Paragraph
explanation of it appeared in print—Albert Ferran’s Philosophie de la,Paragraph

The resultant state is a curious one: here was the man who was the,Paragraph

"which perhaps half the architects of the twentieth century grew up, and",Paragraph

and historical styling—of the mental discipline that produced it. The direct,Paragraph

This attitude to history was regarded by Guadet as ‘scientific’,Paragraph
"The architect today is, or should be, a most manifold man: a man of science",Paragraph
"in ell matters touching construction and its applications, a man of science also",Paragraph
in his profound knowledge of the whole heritage of architecture,Paragraph
and this clearly implies a different meaning of the word seience to that which,Paragraph
was current even among the generation of his own pupils. He means science,Paragraph
"in the generalised sense in which Leonardo de Vinci understood science, as",Paragraph
erudition plus logical method {Paul Valéry’s Introduction d la Aféthode de,Title

Guadet was hostile to exact physical studics as a basis of design,Paragraph

"yet he certainly regarded his own teaching methods as scientific, and at one",Paragraph

"The confusion that he introduced here was widespread in later years,",Paragraph
though the blame is not always to be laid upon his influence. Much of the,Paragraph
"academic aesthetics of Blanc and his followers, which was scientific in the",Paragraph
"older and more generalised sense, acquired the prestige accruing to science",Paragraph
"in the newer and more specialised sense, in spite of the inconclusive result",Paragraph
of Charles Henry's atternpts in the Nineties to render them scientific in the,Paragraph
experimental sense as well.? The statement of Ozenfant and Jeanneret that,Paragraph
Part et la science dépendent du nombre*,Title
"suggests that they too, while claiming for their theories the prestige of the",Paragraph

confusion over the meaning af ‘scientific’ has been paralleled by an equal,Paragraph
"confusion between the two possible meanings of ‘objective’, and the",Paragraph
"aesthetics of Abstract art, largely derived from Charles Blanc, which are",Paragraph
"capable of being rendered objective in the sense of logically impeccable,",Paragraph
have been regarded as also objective in the sense of substantiated by,Paragraph
"experiment, which they have not been so far.",Paragraph

ideas were still sufficiently in vogue in the Twenties to be reprinted at some length,Paragraph
"in L'Esprit Nowveau, on which, see chapter 17,",Paragraph
* See chapter 15.,Paragraph
because Guadet has occasionally been represented as favouring an Abstract,Paragraph

"the work done zt the Ecole under his professorship, and the few buildings",Paragraph
"to emerge from his office do not substantiate this idea, It would be truer to",Paragraph
say that he facilitated the emergence of an architecture of pure form in,Paragraph
much the same way that Blanc facilitated the emergence of Abstract art.,Paragraph
"Blanc pays little attention to subject-matter, Guadet even less to stylistic",Paragraph
"details, but this does not imply that either envisaged doing without them.",Paragraph
"Guadet regards style as something outside the competence of his course,",Paragraph
open to the choice and temperament of the individual designer and the,Paragraph
examples in his book are drawn from all styles and periods; he is a sort of,Paragraph
"negative eclectic, and—as was pointed out above—his attitude is liber-",Paragraph
"tarian, he hated proscriptions and exclusivism,",Paragraph
The key point im his avoidance of the stylistic problem is the /arge et,Paragraph
sévére sense in which he understands the word elassigue. It is something like,Paragraph

"Classicism of Labrouste and, even more, the masters like Ledoux and",Paragraph

German industrial design have been founded on the English Arts and Crafts.,Paragraph

"other, though one can well see how a feeling that some virtue had gone out",Paragraph

gone with Muthesius to the adoptive Fatherland of the Arts and Crafts.,Paragraph
"Indeed, the synchronisation of the stages of decline in England and of",Paragraph

Thus the foundation of the Deutscher Werkbund in 1907 had been,Paragraph

1906 and was followed in 1908 by an attack on the Glasgow School in the,Paragraph

The comparison with non-architectural design in this last quotation is,Paragraph

"railway viaducts and bicycles whose value, for him, lay ‘in their nearness",Paragraph

use of the term is far less improper in his case than in Guadet’s.,Paragraph
"What I do urge, in the simplest and piaimest words, ig concentration on practical,",Paragraph
experimental and scientific education.,Paragraph

July 1905. The tone of the opening paragraph suggests a source close to,Paragraph
"Lethaby, and the use of his contemptuous tag ‘Architects’ Architecture’",Paragraph

Why ahould we architects live in perpetual rebellion with the present? We talk,Paragraph

To some extent this may be due to muddled thinking and squeamishness—,Paragraph

* In Voysey’s defence it should be said that other members and supporters of the,Paragraph
English Free architecture were capable of being quite as muddle-headed as he.,Paragraph
"Lethaby, for instance, went on record with his contempt for ‘mouldy Picturesque’",Paragraph
"and Muthesius was equally acathing about it, in spite of the fact that the Free",Paragraph
architecture they so much admired was more the product of the Picturesque than,Paragraph
"ef anything else, and was in many ways no more advanced than early Picturesque",Paragraph
architecture had been. A late tenant of John Nash's pioneer and highly Picturesque,Paragraph
free-plan dower-house at Cronkhill (1804) expressed his admiration of it to the,Paragraph
author in terme that would heave gratified any Free Architect of 1990—'It is very,Paragraph
convenient.’ Choisy’s admiration for the Picturesque is something that other,Paragraph
"Rationalista might profitably have emulated (and in the case of Le Corbusier,",Paragraph
profitably did).,Paragraph
ment of the Modern Movement. Yet it is common hearsay knowledge that,Paragraph
Voysey’s own intention was only to improve and continue the native cottage,Paragraph
vernacular of southern England. He had no conception of the importance,Paragraph
of what he was doing (he seems to have had that almost pathological,Paragraph
modesty of some English provincial intellectuals) and angrily deprecated,Paragraph
any attempt te link his name with the Modern Movement. Under these,Paragraph
circumstances it should not surprise us that his practices and aims should,Paragraph
be aesthetically at variance with one another. His work excels by the sharp,Paragraph
"definition of one smooth plain surface from another, the fine precision of",Paragraph

1go8 as saying that he preferred,Paragraph
The soft effect of the outline of an old building where the angles were put up,Paragraph

moral and intellectual discipline—such as the free style acquired in Ger-,Paragraph

masters were mostly coasting along on the accumulated moral momentum,Paragraph
"of the previous epoch. Worse still, the masters of the previous generation,",Paragraph

"Going only a littl way beyond Guadet’s indifference to particular styles,",Paragraph
"and thus to particular symbolic and narrative contents, he shrugs off all",Paragraph
symbolic and narrative qualities and offers instead an architecture of pure,Paragraph
form. He defines his position thus,Paragraph
"Architecture, simply and immediately perceived, is a combination, revealed",Paragraph
"through light and shade, of spaces, masses and lines,",Paragraph
and this puts him very close ta certain post-War theorists of Abstract art,Paragraph
who also took the view that simple and immediate perception took in only,Paragraph
"the formal or geometrical aspects of the object seen, As with later Abstract",Paragraph
theorists he also took this simple and immediate perception to be absolute,Paragraph

"acience, the calculations of science, cannot constitute or determine, though",Paragraph

The ‘few’ elements mentioned above are later rendered as ‘four’ by Scott,Paragraph
"By the direct agency of Mass, Space, Line and Coherence upon our physical",Paragraph
"consciousness, architecture communicates its value as an art.",Paragraph
Such are the four great elermenta of building frorn whose laws the finest masters,Paragraph
"of the Renaissance, hawever various their impulse and achievement, did not",Paragraph
"deviate, Theirs is an architecture which by Mass, Space and Line responds to",Paragraph
"human physical delight, and by coherence answers ta our thought.",Paragraph
The formation of this concept has a complex background. It is clear that,Paragraph
French academic theory has been laid under tribute both on the architec-,Paragraph
tural side and the painterly. If elements comes from Guadet so does,Paragraph
"coherence, which Scott uses to mean either an acceptance of mathematical",Paragraph
"order, or simply composition. The connection between this coherence and",Paragraph
thought sounds like Charles Blanc’s,Paragraph
The painter's prime means of expressing his thought is ‘ordonnance’,Paragraph
"and the insistence on fine, one of the factors that responds to Auman",Paragraph
physical delight recalls Blanc’s,Paragraph
"Straight or curved, horizontal or vertical, parallel or divergent—all lines have",Paragraph
a secret relationship with our feelings,Title
It is not necessary to refer these ideas back to direct French academic,Paragraph
sources; not only were Beaux-Arts ideas on architecture current in England,Paragraph
"in the decade before the War, but ideas on painting, from a similar source,",Paragraph
had been put in circulation by Roger Fry and his circle.,Paragraph
But there is a new ‘element’ among Scott's four—Space. This was not,Paragraph
"being discussed in architectural circles in France at the time, neither with-",Paragraph
"in the Beaux-Arts curriculum as recorded by Guadet, nor by Choisy and his",Paragraph
followers. Choisy uses the word espace to mean an area to be spanned by,Paragraph
"an arch or covered by a roof, and where we might nowadays use the word",Paragraph
‘space’ te indicate an unbuilt volume within a building he is more tnclined,Paragraph
"to use la vide. By Space, Scott means, effectively, Raum, with most of the over-",Paragraph
"tones that the word had acquired in German aesthetics, and he himself had",Paragraph
"avowedly taken it over from the writings of Theodor Lipps, along with the",Paragraph
theory of Einfithiung.,Paragraph

"respondence with human attitudes and actions. His position depends, on",Paragraph
"examimation, on a kind of pun on the word ‘Humanist’, which he uses",Paragraph
"indiscriminately to refer either to the world of humane learning, or to the",Paragraph
projection of human sentiments into the forms of architecture. This,Paragraph
"double-entendre appears to be quite unconscious, but it is upon it, and no-",Paragraph
"thing else, that his theory of Renaissance architecture as an art of pure",Paragraph
"form, pure taste and pure pleasure is founded. Presumably the material,",Paragraph
from which Professor Wittkower later developed his entirely different view,Paragraph
"of Renaissance architecture as an art of symbolic form, was also available to",Paragraph
"Scott had he wanted to use it, but, under the academic dispensation which",Paragraph
"set symbolic and narrative values aside, he could explain his liking for",Paragraph
Renaissance architecture only by assuming it to be meaningless at any but,Paragraph
the empathetic level.,Paragraph
"But in his borrowing of the idea of Raumempfindung from Lipps, and his",Paragraph
"introduction of it into the context of academic theory, he achieved an",Paragraph
"innovation. The introduction was not seminal, but it retains its interest",Paragraph
"as an illustration of a process which must have happened elsewhere, though",Paragraph
"not explicitly. The change-over from the Lippsian idea of space, as felt",Paragraph

"the later concept of space as a three-dimensional continuum, capable of",Paragraph

It should be emphasised here that this division of practical method does,Paragraph

1907 that Behrens joined AEG (Allgemeine Electricitdtspesellschaft) and,Paragraph

"if not connected, and are the two faces of the same coin—a rapprochement",Paragraph

spirited opposition from the ‘establishment’ of the German Arts and,Paragraph
"Crafts Movernent, and Muthesius’s success is a tribute to his diplomacy, as",Paragraph

evening classes. His masterpiece as rapporteur was undoubtedly Das,Paragraph
"Englische Haus, which covered, in three volumes of which the last appeared",Paragraph
"in 1g05, every aspect of the English free style from Stokesey Castle to",Paragraph
Sanitary Ware. The impact of this book can be seen as early as Peter,Paragraph
"Behrens’s Obenauer House of 1g06, and persisted until it was overtaken",Paragraph
by the Wasmuth publications of the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. Thus,Paragraph
these attempts to weld industry and the unattached artists and designers,Paragraph
"into a single, effective organisation that could make a useful contribution te",Paragraph
the national economy were regarded in some quarters as an attack on,Paragraph
German art.,Paragraph
The polemical situation came to a head in the early part of ige7.,Paragraph
Muthesius opened with a speech at the new Commercial College in Berlin,Paragraph
(of which he was then head) in the course of which he complained of the,Paragraph
"superficiality of the ‘so-called style’ then in use in German Kunstgewerbe,",Paragraph

What alarmed Muthesius about these Individualistic essays was that they,Paragraph

It is clear that this version of ‘Cubism’ contains very little of what went on,Paragraph

"space is infinite space, net the enclosed Rawm of Berlage, was probably",Paragraph
"vital to the integration of de Styi into international Abstract art, for both",Paragraph
Malevitsch and Lissitsky also regarded space in this manner.,Paragraph
The reader’s sense that he has reached one of those core concepts that,Paragraph
can only be discussed tautologically is reinforced at this point by the way,Paragraph
in which Oud suddenly abandons generalities and turns to more practical,Paragraph

"relizbly related in form and colour, it is perfectly similar to all other details of",Paragraph

Then he notes that new materials will not have any revolutionary effect,Paragraph
where traditional formulae hinder their proper use:,Paragraph
"When iron came in, great hopes were entertained of a new atchitecture, but",Paragraph
a an,Title

"fon, ...",Paragraph
Because of ita visible solidity—uniike plate-glass which is only solid to the,Paragraph

is that it offers the maximum of structural strength with the mimimum of,Paragraph
"maternal, ... Ita architectural value therefore lies in the creation of voida, not",Paragraph
"solids, in contrast to masg-walling, not continuing it.",Paragraph
similarly with glass,Paragraph
"divided ... into small parts by the customary glazing bars, it optically continues",Paragraph
the solidity of the wall over the openings as well,Paragraph
and should therefore always be used in the largest possible sheets with the,Paragraph
thinnest possible glazing bars and mulhons.,Paragraph
"He sees even more exciting possibilities in the use of reinforced concrete,",Paragraph
which avoids the limitations imposed on brick by its modular sizes and its,Paragraph
restricted spans over openings,Title
"Besides, the unfitness of other materials for the acceptance of tensile loading...",Paragraph
hinders the construction of extensive horizontal spans and cantilevers. The com-,Paragraph

have been used than where a more neutral tint is employed—a circumstance,Paragraph
wr,Title
that probably explains the preference for dark green paint to set againat the,Paragraph
"prevatling brick-grey of our country,",Paragraph
And so he comes to his conclusions,Paragraph
"All in all, it follows that an architecture rationally based on the circumstances",Paragraph
of life today would be in every sense oppesed to the sort of architecture that,Paragraph
"has existed up till now, Without falling into barren rationalism it would remain,",Paragraph
"above ail, objective, but within this objectivity would experience higher things,",Paragraph
In the sharpest contrast to the untechnically-formed and colourless products of,Paragraph
"momentary inspiration as we know them, its ordained task will be, in perfect",Paragraph
"devotion to an almost impersonal method of technical creation, to shape",Paragraph
"organisms of clear form and pure proportions, In place of the natural! attractiona",Paragraph
"of uncultivated materials, the broken hues in glass, the irregularity of finishes,",Paragraph
"the paleness of colour, the clouding of glazes, the weathering of walls, etc. it",Paragraph
"would unfold the stimulating qualities of sophisticated materials, the Limpidity",Paragraph
"of glass, the shine and roundness of finishes, lustrous and shining coloura, the",Paragraph
"glitter of steel, and so forth.",Paragraph

"do not really go beyond such a concept, and in the case of the car-body",Paragraph

some necessary connection. All but one of these essays had appeared in,Paragraph
"L'Esprit Nouveau, though not quite in the order of the book, and most of",Paragraph
"them are reproduit tel, page for page. Two main themes can be distinguished",Paragraph
"at once, and can be roughly labelled Academic and Mechanistic. All the",Paragraph
essays can be put under one or other of these headings in terms of their,Paragraph
"main subject-matter, and they are grouped in the book in a manner which",Paragraph
"emphasises this distinction. Thus, the Academic material comes in two",Paragraph
"compact blocks, the first labelled ‘Trats Rappels d MM les Architectes’,",Paragraph
"dealing with Surface, Volume and Plan, followed immediately by one on",Paragraph
"‘Tracés Régulateurs’. The second block, headed ‘Architecture’, contains",Paragraph
"three essays devoted to ‘The Lesson of Rome’, ‘The Illusion of Plans’,",Paragraph
and ‘Pure Creation of the Mind”.,Paragraph
The Mechanistic essays are fitted around these two blocks as follows:,Paragraph
"first (in the book, but not in the magazine) ‘Esthétique de P ingenieur’; next,",Paragraph
"after the ‘Rappels’, a section of three essays under the heading ‘Des Yeux",Paragraph
"qui ne Votent pas’, dealing with Liners, Aircraft, and Automobiles; and",Paragraph
"finally, after ‘Architecture’, the chapter on mass-production houses, and",Paragraph
"an entirely new one entitled ‘Architecture ou Revolution’. As will be seen,",Paragraph
"although the book opens on a Mechanistic note, the chapters which actually",Paragraph
deal with the virtues of machinery are firmly sandwiched between two,Paragraph
sections whose main function is to rehearse the more Abstract and Classical,Paragraph
"—large et sévére—ideas of the Academic tradition, so that the reader who",Paragraph
goes straight through the book gets the impression that he is being con-,Paragraph
ducted through an orderly argument in which machine-design stands as,Paragraph
a necessary intermediate stage between certain Abstract fundamentals of,Paragraph
design and the glories of the Parthenon. This impression is reinforced by,Paragraph
"a judicious intermixture of themes in the illustrations and captions. Thus,",Paragraph
Plan and Surface are illustrated by photographs of grain silos and American,Paragraph
"factory buildings respectively, while Pure Creation haa its photographs",Paragraph
of the Parthenon and the Propylaea captioned with phrases such as,Paragraph
Yoici la machine & émouvoir,Title
Or,Title
All this plastic machinery is realised in marble with the rigour thet we have,Paragraph
"learned to apply in the machine. The impression is of naked, polished steel.",Paragraph
This interfusion of the Mechanical and the Classical achieves a kind of,Paragraph
apotheosis in the chapter on Automobiles. Here on a pair of facing pages,Caption

"thenon on the right, and, below, a Humber of 1907 and a Delage of the early",Paragraph
‘Twenties. On reflection the reader realises that this is supposed to be read,Paragraph
"from page to page, implying an equivalent progress between Humber and",Paragraph
"Delage and between Paestum and Acropolis, but the immediate response",Paragraph
"seems always to be to read down the page, thus producing an image of",Paragraph
"contrast, like Marinetti’a between a racing car and the Nike of Samothrace,",Paragraph
The four illustrations together are clearly intended to be read in some such,Paragraph
"sense, as well as that of progress in design, and this is hardly surprising,",Paragraph
for other versions of the Marinettian image were current in Paris at the,Paragraph
"time, Thus, in February 1922, Francis Picabia mangled it® to suit his own",Paragraph

"Tristan Tzara ... has decided to put his top hat on a locomotive: obviously,",Paragraph

and in 1927 a reader of L’ Effort Moderne cornplained,Paragraph

"a motor manufacturer, a radiator cap representing a miniature Victory of",Paragraph
"Sarmothrace,' lookmge completely ndiculous, and quite contrary to the precise,",Paragraph
simple and logical order of the car itself.,Paragraph
But Le Corbusier's intention is not to present a contradiction d’esprit,Paragraph

"to the content of the individual essays, taking first those on Academic",Paragraph

Rappels are united by the proposition,Paragraph

to Le Corbusier’s argument that some such equivalence be accepted by,Paragraph

"Nevertheless, the drift of these first four Academic chapters is clear",Paragraph

Form follows function,Title
"Functionalism, as a creed or programme, may have a certain austere",Paragraph
"nobility, but it is poverty-stricken symbolically. The architecture of the",Paragraph
"Twenties, though capable of its own austerity and nobility, was heavily,",Paragraph
"and designediy, loaded with symbolic meanings that were discarded or",Paragraph
ignored by its apologists in the Thirties. Two main reasons emerge for this,Paragraph
"decision to fight on a narrowed front. Firstly, most of those apologists",Paragraph
"came from outside the countries—Holland, Germany and France—that",Paragraph
—,Title
eT ET,Title
rs a re,Title
"had done most to create the new style, and came to it late. They thus",Paragraph
"failed to participate in those exchanges of ideas, collisions of men and move-",Paragraph
"ments, congresses and polemics, in which the main lines of thought and",Paragraph
"practice were roughed out before 1925, and they were strangers to the local",Paragraph
"conditions that coloured them. ‘Thus, Sigfried Giedion, Swiss, caught only",Paragraph
"the tail end of this process in 1923; Sartoris, Italian, missed it almost com-",Paragraph
"pletely, Lewis Mumford, American, in spite of his sociological percep-",Paragraph
"tiveness, was too remotely placed to have any real sense of the aesthetic",Paragraph
issues involved—hence his largely irrelevant tergiversations on the problem,Paragraph
of monumentality.,Paragraph
The second reason for deciding to fight on the narrowed front was that,Paragraph
there was no longer any choice of whether or not to fight. With the Inter-,Paragraph
"national Style outlawed politically in Germany and Russia, and crippled",Paragraph
"economically in France, the style and its friends were fighting for a tochold",Paragraph
"in politically-suspicious Fascist Italy, aesthetically-indifferent England,",Paragraph
and depression-stunned America. Under these circumstances it was better,Paragraph
to advocate or defend the new architecture on logical and economic grounds,Paragraph
than on grounds of aesthetics or syrmbolisms that might stir nothing but,Paragraph
hostility. This may have been good tactics—the point remains arguable—,Paragraph
but it was certainly misrepresentation. Emotion had played a much larger,Paragraph
part than logic in the creation of the style; inexpensive buildings had been,Paragraph
"clothed in it, but it was no more an inherently economical style than any",Paragraph
"other. ‘The true aim of the style had clearly been, to quote Gropius’s words",Paragraph
about the Bauhaus and its relation to the world of the Machine Age,Title
... to invent and create forms symbolising that world.,Paragraph
and it is in respect of such symbolic forms that tts historical justification,Paragraph
"must lie,",Paragraph
"How far it had succeeded in its own terms in creating such terms, and in",Paragraph
"carrying such symbolism, can best be judged by examining two buildings,",Paragraph
"widely held to be masterpieces, and both designed in 1928. One of them is",Paragraph
"the German Pavilion at the Barcelona Exhibition of 1929, a work of Mies",Paragraph
"yan der Rohe, so purely symbolic in intention that the concept of Function-",Paragraph
alism would need to be stretched to the point of unrecognisability before it,Paragraph
could be made to fit it—the more so since it is not easy to formulate in,Paragraph
Rational terms precisely what it was intended to symbolise. A loose back-,Paragraph

Along this path industry and technology will join with the forces of thought,Paragraph
and culture.,Paragraph
We are in a period of transition—a transition that will change the world.,Paragraph
To explain and help along this transition will be the responsibility of future,Paragraph
expositions. ...,Paragraph
The ambiguities of these statements were resolved in the Pavilion by,Paragraph
"architectural usages that tapped many sources of symbolism-—ar, at least",Paragraph
sources of architectural prestige. Attention has been drawn to echoes of,Paragraph
"Wright, of de Sijjland Schinkelschiiler tradition, in the Pavilion, but its full",Paragraph
richness is only apparent when these references are rendered precise. All,Paragraph
"three of these echoes are, in practice, summed up in a mode of occupying",Paragraph
"space which is strictly Elementarist. Its horizontal planes, which have been",Paragraph
"likened to Wright, and its scattered vertical surfaces, whose distribution",Paragraph
"on plan has been referred to van Doesburg, mark out one of Moholy's",Paragraph
"""pieces of space’ in such a way that a ‘full penetration with outer space’ is",Paragraph
"effectively achieved. Further, the distribution of the columns which support",Paragraph
"the roof slab without assistance from the vertical planes, is completely",Paragraph
regular and their spacing suggests the Elementarist concept of space as a,Paragraph
"measurable continuum, irrespective of the objects it contains, And again,",Paragraph
"the podium on which the whole structure stands, in which Philip Johnson",Paragraph
"has found ‘a touch of Schinkel’, extending on one side a good way beyond",Paragraph

"metric relations that came from the Ladowski-Lissitsky circle, and, like",Paragraph
"them, appears to symbolise ‘infinite space’ as an active component of the",Paragraph

"To this last effect the materials aiso contribute, since the marble floor of",Paragraph
"the podium, everywhere visible, or at least appreciable even where covered",Paragraph
"by carpeting, emphasises the spatial continuity of the complete scheme.",Paragraph
"But this marble, and the marbling of the walls, has another level of mean-",Paragraph

"quantity to quality of which Mies had spoken, and introduces further para-",Paragraph
"doxical echoes of both Berlage and Loos. These walls are space-creators,",Paragraph
in Berlage’s sense and have been ‘let alone from floor to cornice’ in the,Paragraph
"manner that Berlage admired in Wright, yet, if it be objected that the sheets",Paragraph

"such as Berlage disapproved, one could properly counter that Adolf Loos,",Paragraph
"the enemy of decoration, was prepared to admit large areas of strongly",Paragraph
patterned marble as wall-cladding in his interiors.,Paragraph
The continuity of the space is further demonstrated by the transparency,Paragraph

It is clear that even if it were profitable to apply strict standards of,Paragraph

"such an analysis. ‘The same is true of the designs of Le Corbusier, whose -",Paragraph

"logical analysis alone. In his Dom-ine project for instance, he postulated a",Paragraph
structure whose only given elements were the floor slabs and the columns,Paragraph
"that supported them, The disposition of the walls was thus left at liberty,",Paragraph
but some critics have logically extrapolated also that this left Le Corbusier,Paragraph
at the mercy of his floor slabs. Nothing could be farther from the truth as,Paragraph
"far as his completed buildings are concerned which, from the villa at",Paragraph
"Chaux-de-Fonds onwards, have their floor slabs treated in a most cavalier",Paragraph
"fashion, and much of their internal architecture created by breaking",Paragraph
"through from one storey to another. Conversely, if there is a building in",Paragraph
"which the horizontal slabs are absolute, it is Mies’s Barcelona Pavilion—",Paragraph
"the pools merely diversify the surface of the podium, nothing breaks",Paragraph
through the roof slab and nothing rises above it; the whole building is,Paragraph
"desioned almost in two dimensions, and this is true of rouch of his later",Paragraph
work as well.,Paragraph
In the case of the other building of 1928 which it is proposed to study,Paragraph
"here, Le Corbusier’s house, Les Heures Claires, built for the Savoye family",Paragraph
"at Poissy-sur-Seine and completed in 1930, the vertical penetrations are of",Paragraph
