Introduction: Speaking Architecture,Title
In 1964 John Summerson published a short book entitled The,Paragraph
"Classical Language of Architecture, which has been very successful",Paragraph
throughout the world. I waited a decade for its logical and neces-,Paragraph
"sary sequel, “The Anticlassical Language of Architecture” or,",Paragraph
"rather, ‘“The Modern Language of Architecture,” but neither Sum-",Paragraph
merson nor anyone else wrote it. Why not? One can imagine a,Paragraph
host of daunting reasons. Nevertheless the gap needs filling. It,Paragraph
is the most urgent task facing architectural history and criticism,Paragraph
"today. It cannot be postponed, it is already long overdue.",Paragraph
"Without a language, we cannot speak. What is more, it is lan-",Paragraph
"~ guage that “speaks us,” in the sense that it provides the instru-",Paragraph
ments of communication without which it would be impossible,Paragraph
even to work out our thoughts. Yet in the course of centuries,Paragraph
"only one architectural language has been codified, that of classi-",Paragraph
cism. None other has been processed and put into the systematic,Paragraph
form required of an acknowledged language. All were considered,Paragraph
"exceptions to the rule, the classical rule, and not alternatives to",Paragraph
"it, with a life of their own. Even modern architecture, which",Paragraph
"emerged in reaction against neoclassicism, runs the risk of revert-",Paragraph
ing to stale Beaux-Arts archetypes unless it is structured into a,Paragraph
language.,Paragraph
This is an incredible and absurd situation. We are squandering,Paragraph
a colossal heritage of expression because we shirk the responsibil-,Paragraph
ity of transcribing it and making it transmissible. It may not be,Paragraph
"very long before we forget how to speak architecture at all. Indeed,",Paragraph
most people who are designing and building today can barely,Paragraph
mumble. They utter inarticulate meaningless sounds that carry,Paragraph
no message. They do not know how to speak. They say nothing,Paragraph
and have nothing to say. There is an even more serious danger,Paragraph
"facing us. If the modern movement is ever jettisoned, we may",Paragraph
-,Title
no longer be able to read the images of any architects who have,Paragraph
spoken a language other than classicism: the images of the Stone,Title
"Age, late antiquity and the Middle Ages, the works of the Man-",Title
"nerists, Michelangelo, Borromini, the Arts and Crafts movement",Title
"and Art Nouveau, Wright, Loos, Le Corbusier, Gropius, Mies,",Paragraph
"Aalto, Scharoun, and the younger men from Johansen to Safdie.",Paragraph
Nobody uses the classical orders today. But classicism is a state,Paragraph
of mind that goes beyond the ‘‘orders” and stultifies even those,Paragraph
discourses which are uttered using anticlassical nouns and verbs.,Paragraph
"The Beaux-Arts system actually codified Gothic, then Roman-",Paragraph
"esque, Baroque, Egyptian, Japanese, and finally modern architec-",Paragraph
ture by a very simple expedient: it put them on ice by classicizing,Paragraph
"their free structure. Surely, if it should prove impossible to formu-",Paragraph
"late the modern idiom in truly dynamic fashion, it would go",Paragraph
"the same suicidal way, which is what more than one wretched",Paragraph
critic and/or architect wishes would happen.,Paragraph
It is therefore essential that we try to codify the modern lan-,Paragraph
"guage at once, without looking for a priori solutions to all the",Paragraph
theoretical problems involved. Abstract theories are often an alibi,Paragraph
for further delays. Dozens of books and hundreds of essays have,Paragraph
discussed the question of whether or not architecture can be,Paragraph
"treated as a language, whether nonverbal languages have a double",Paragraph
"articulation (or dual patterning), and whether the attempt at codi-",Paragraph
fying modern architecture might not block its development. Se-,Paragraph
"miology is certainly essential, but by itself it cannot solve architec-",Paragraph
"tural problems. For better or worse, architects communicate. And",Paragraph
"the fact remains that they speak architecture, whether it is a",Paragraph
language or not. Thus we must set down precisely what it implies,Paragraph
"to speak architecture in an anticlassical key. If we can do this,",Paragraph
the theoretical apparatus will come by itself as we proceed with,Paragraph
our work.,Paragraph
There are thousands of architects and students of architecture,Paragraph
"designing, without knowing the vocabulary, the grammar, and",Paragraph
"the syntax of the contemporary language, which are, in fact, a",Paragraph
"kind of antivocabulary, antigrammar, and antisyntax in relation",Paragraph
"to classicism. Critical judgments are being made on two levels,",Paragraph
in the profession and in the schools. But what standards are used?,Paragraph
"And are they legitimate? This is the challenge that faces us, both",Paragraph
as producers and as consumers of architecture. If we are going,Paragraph
"to understand one another, we must use the same terms and",Paragraph
agree on their meaning. The problem seems enormous only be-,Paragraph
cause it has been so little investigated until now.,Paragraph
Ours is an intentionally provocative goal: to establish a series,Paragraph
"of “invariables” in the modern language of architecture, based",Paragraph
on the most significant and challenging buildings. A question,Paragraph
might arise. Some code is indispensable in verbal communication;,Paragraph
otherwise there is a danger of not communicating at all. In archi-,Paragraph
"tecture, however, anyone can dispense with it at will, without",Paragraph
"having to give up building for this reason. Of course, he can",Paragraph
"design even in Babylonian style if he wants to, but all he can",Paragraph
communicate are his own neuroses.,Paragraph
I have discussed the question of architectural language with,Paragraph
"scholars, practicing architects, and most often with anxious and",Paragraph
"confused students, quite bewildered by the fact that nobody",Paragraph
teaches them an idiom they can speak. A single conclusion came,Paragraph
out of these conversations: although there are excellent excuses,Paragraph
"for not facing such a difficult and painful problem, the present",Paragraph
impasse must be overcome and a beginning made.,Paragraph
This book is even shorter than Summerson’s. Only seven invari-,Paragraph
"ables are analyzed. One could add ten more, or twenty, or fifty,",Paragraph
so long as they do not contradict the first seven. The validity,Paragraph
of this approach must be tested on the drawing board and on,Paragraph
real buildings. Everyone can set about checking this “basic lan-,Paragraph
"guage.” And it should come as no surprise that, out of a hundred",Paragraph
"buildings erected nowadays, ninety prove to be altogether anach-",Paragraph
ronistic works that belong somewhere between the Renaissance,Paragraph
"and Beaux-Arts, while eight have some incoherent elements of",Paragraph
"modern “‘‘style,” and, in the best of circumstances, maybe two",Paragraph
"are merely ungrammatical, that is to say, they do not speak the",Paragraph
"old language, but neither do they speak the new one. And that",Paragraph
is not all. Even the great masters of the modern movement have,Paragraph
sometimes produced regressive classicist works. Thus one cannot,Paragraph
"help asking, what kind of language is this, if no one or very",Paragraph
few people can speak it? Let me answer with another question:,Paragraph
how could the modern language of architecture be widely spoken,Title
without a code?,Title
These pages have the same goal as any other heretical act: to,Paragraph
"arouse dissent. If they provoke argument, they will have achieved",Paragraph
"their aim. Instead of talking endlessly about architecture, we shall",Paragraph
finally begin to speak architecture. *,Paragraph

Listing as Design Methodology,Title
"The list, or inventory, of functions is the generating principle",Paragraph
"of the modern language in architecture, and it subsumes all other",Paragraph
principles. Listing marks the ethical and operational dividing line,Paragraph
between those who speak in modern terms and those who chew,Paragraph
"on dead languages. Every error, every involution, every psycho-",Paragraph
logical lapse and mental block at the drawing table can be traced,Paragraph
"back, without exception, to a failure to respect this principle.",Paragraph
Therefore it is the basic invariable of the contemporary code.,Paragraph
"Implicit in listing, or compiling an inventory of functions, is",Paragraph
"the dismantling and critical rejection of classical rules, “orders,”",Paragraph
"a priori assumptions, set phrases, and conventions of every type",Paragraph
and kind. The inventory springs from an act of cultural annihila-,Paragraph
tion—what Roland Barthes calls ‘the zero degree of writing’’—,Paragraph
and leads to a rejection of all traditional norms and canons. It,Paragraph
"demands a new beginning, as if no linguistic system had ever",Paragraph
"existed before, as if it were the first time in history that we had",Paragraph
to build a house or a city.,Paragraph
The list is an ethical principle even before it becomes an opera-,Paragraph
"tional one. Indeed, with tremendous effort and immense joy, we",Paragraph
must strip away the cultural taboos we have inherited. We must,Paragraph
track them down one by one in our minds and desanctify them.,Paragraph
"For the modern architect, the paralyzing taboos are dogmas, con-",Paragraph
"ventions, inertia, all the dead weight accumulated during centuries",Paragraph
"of classicism. By destroying every institutionalized model, he can",Paragraph
break free from idolatry. He can reconstruct and relive the whole,Paragraph
"process of man’s formation and development, realizing that more",Paragraph
"than once in the course of the millennia, architects have wiped",Paragraph
the slate clean and erased every grammatical and syntactical rule.,Paragraph
In fact. genuinely creative spirits have always started from scratch.,Paragraph
The modern revolution is not unprecedented or apocalyptic. There,Paragraph
has been a recurrent struggle against repressive bonds throughout,Paragraph
the ages.,Paragraph
"Listing. going back to the zero degree, makes you rethink archi-",Paragraph
"tectural semantics. In the beginning, verbs and conjunctions must",Paragraph
be eliminated. Words can no longer be used unless their content,Paragraph
and meaning have been analyzed in depth. Some examples will,Paragraph
get us to the heart of this methodology of design.,Paragraph
Windows. In the classical tradition a module is selected for,Paragraph
the openings of a Renaissance or pseudo-Renaissance building.,Paragraph
"Then the sequence of modules is examined, along with the rela-",Paragraph
"tionship between full and empty surface areas. Finally, the hori-",Paragraph
"zontal and vertical alignments, that is, the superimposition of",Paragraph
the orders. are established. Fortunately the modern architect is,Paragraph
tree of these formalistic concerns. He is engaged in a more complex,Paragraph
"and rewarding task of resemanticization. First of all, no repetitive",Paragraph
"modules. Every window is a word that stands for itself, what it",Paragraph
means and what it does. It is not something to be aligned or,Paragraph
"proportioned It may be any shape—rectangular, square, round,",Paragraph
"elliptical, triangular, composite, or free profile. Depending on the",Paragraph
"room it must light, the window may be anything from a long",Paragraph
narrow strip at ceiling or floor level to a cut in the wall or a,Paragraph
running band at eve level: whatever may be desired or considered,Title
suitable after calculating the specific window’s function room by,Paragraph
room. There is no reason why every window in a building should,Paragraph
be just like the next one and not have a character of its own.,Paragraph
"Onee vou get rid of the tvranny of classicism, windows will be",Paragraph
all the more effective if they are different and can convey a host,Paragraph
Of Messages.,Paragraph
Classicism breaks the facade into vertical and horizontal sec-,Paragraph
tions But eliminating the juxtaposition and superimposition of,Paragraph
modules will make the facade whole again. What is far more,Paragraph
important. the facade will become antoisted. When the openings—,Paragraph
high or low. straight or crooked—are no longer regulated by axial,Paragraph
"relationships, the facade will cease to be closed and aloof, an",Paragraph
"end in itself, and begin talking to its surroundings. It will stop",Paragraph
"2. The methodology of listing functions, applied to windows. Classicism, whether",Caption
"old classicism (above) or the pseudomodern (center), is concerned with the module,",Paragraph
"its repetition, the relationship between full and empty spaces, and alignment. It",Paragraph
is concerned with everything except windows. Listing gives back to every element,Paragraph
its specific meaning /below/ and then assembles the various elements.,Paragraph
being extraneous and hostile and start taking an active part in,Paragraph
the citv—or landscape.,Paragraph
Windows are not an appropriate example in discussing modern,Paragraph
"architecture because, as we will see later, the principle of func-",Paragraph
"tional listing precludes the very idea of “facade.’’ Nevertheless,",Paragraph
when an architect works in urban fabrics conceived according,Paragraph
"to preordained schemes and volumes, he is forced to design fa-",Paragraph
cades But that is no reason to give up the modern language.,Paragraph
"The minute he differentiates windows by form and position, he",Paragraph
has done away with the traditional facade and its classical conno-,Paragraph
"tations. Indeed, he can inject new life into it by making some",Paragraph
"windows protrude and others recede, by playing with the thick-",Paragraph
ness of the wall to create a frame of shadow around the glass,Paragraph
"or, an the contrary, to bring the glass forward into the blaze of",Paragraph
light. And why not slant the windows to the surface of the facade?,Paragraph
"One window can tilt down, focusing on a square, a tree, or a",Paragraph
"dvorway across the street. Another can turn up, framing a piece",Paragraph
of sky. A window can be slanted left or right to catch panoramic,Paragraph
"VIEWS, a section of street, a monument, or the sea. Windows",Paragraph
"can be conceived with a wealth of angles, so that their surfaces",Paragraph
are never parallel to the building front.,Paragraph
"Even when limited to the detail of windows, the principle of",Paragraph
"functional listing challenges the classical approach to the fagade,",Paragraph
"takes away its “finished” look, and breaks its square frame by",Paragraph
fragmenting the corners of the building and maybe the line be-,Paragraph
tween top floor and roof. A double aim is achieved: alternate,Paragraph
lighting solutions in the interiors and heightened expressive quali-,Paragraph
ties on the outside.,Paragraph
"IT can imagine two objections, one of simple dismay and the",Paragraph
other of ideological alibis masking dismay. The first objection,Paragraph
is that a frightening amount of work is involved in this procedure:,Paragraph
if the outline and position of every window have to be thought,Paragraph
"out separately, the design of a ten-window taqade is going to",Paragraph
"take too much time and energy, far out of proportion to the",Paragraph
rewards The second objection is that such a method may lead,Paragraph
"to an “academy of misrule,” to the triumph of arbitrariness.",Paragraph
The answer to the first objection ts that it is largely true. The,Paragraph
only correct way to design a window is to study the space it,Paragraph
"lights, for the perceptual and behavioral value of any space de-",Paragraph
"pends on how it is lighted. The fact is that spaces and volumes,",Paragraph
"the whole building, have to be planned before it is decided what",Paragraph
shapes of window to choose. Is modern architecture hard? Proba-,Paragraph
"bly, but it is splendid because every element, every word of it,",Paragraph
"is related to a social content. If it were easy, most of the buildings",Paragraph
put up today would be truly modern. Suffice it to look at their,Paragraph
windows to realize that they are quite often the product of aca-,Paragraph
demic irresponsibility.,Paragraph
"As to the second objection, that the modern language of archi-",Paragraph
"tecture tends to be arbitrary: on the contrary, classicism is totally",Paragraph
"arbitrary, in so far as it gives mythical value to abstract orders",Paragraph
that repress freedom and social behavior. Does functional listing,Paragraph
"lead to disorder? Yes, to sacrosanct disorder that drives out idola-",Paragraph
trous order and the taboos imposed by standardized and alienating,Title
mass production. The listing method rejects the products of neo-,Paragraph
"capitalist industry, just as William Morris rejected paleocapitalist",Paragraph
products in the second half of the nineteenth century. Industry,Paragraph
"too often promotes sameness; it categorizes, standardizes, and",Paragraph
classicizes. Recent skyscrapers with their curtain walls are more,Paragraph
"static, boxy, and monolithic than those built fifty years ago. You",Paragraph
can see it from the windows as well.,Paragraph
The two objections betray troubled psychological origins. The,Paragraph
"modern language increases the possibilities of choice, while classi-",Paragraph
"cal architecture reduces them. Choice creates anguish, a neurotic",Paragraph
“anxiety for certainty.’” What is to be done? There are no tranquil-,Paragraph
izers for this ailment. But are there in other areas? Does not,Paragraph
abstract painting arouse a similar anguish? What about dodeca-,Paragraph
phonic and aleatory or accidental music? And conceptual art? Is,Paragraph
it not anguishing to look at oneself in the mirror for the first,Paragraph
"time and recognize oneself in an image outside oneself, or to",Paragraph
learn that the earth rotates even though it seems to be standing,Paragraph
still? Fear of freedom and horror of irrational impulses are at,Paragraph
"the bottom of this anguish. Let us suppose for a moment that,",Paragraph
"in a given building, windows could be alike or different without",Paragraph
"altering their function in any way. The modern language says,",Paragraph
"let them be different, let there be more choices. The classical",Paragraph
"code dictates that they all be alike, they must be orderly—like",Paragraph
corpses But the hypothesis that they may be equally functional,Paragraph
"is absurd, really arbitrary. This merely contirms an established",Paragraph
"fact, but one that is very hard te instillin the minds of architects:",Paragraph
"What seems rational and logical, because it is regulated and or-",Paragraph
"dered, is humanly and socially foolish: it makes sense only in",Paragraph
"terms of despotic power What is presumed irrational, on the",Paragraph

What has been said about windows should be repeated for,Paragraph
"every aspect of design on any scale: volumes and spaces, their",Paragraph
"interrelationships, urban complexes, and regional planning. The",Paragraph
mvariable is always the functional list. Why should a room be,Paragraph
"cubical or prismatic, instead of free form and harmonious with",Paragraph
its uses? Why should a group of rooms form a simple box? Why,Paragraph
must a building be conceived as the wrapping for a lot of small,Paragraph
boxes packed inside a larger box? Why should it be closed in,Paragraph
on itself. making a sharp distinetion between the architectural,Paragraph
cavities and the urban or natural landscapes Why must all the,Paragraph
rooms in anapartment be the same height? And so on. The invari-,Paragraph
"able of modern language consists in whys and what-fors, in not",Paragraph

"that implies the “tree” use of the top of the building, and even",Paragraph
"the strip window, in so far as it offers further evidence that the",Paragraph
fagade is “tree of structural elements,Paragraph
The list appreach continually makes a clean start. It verifies,Paragraph
"and challenges even the tive principles, as Le Corbusier himself",Paragraph

"Why should we sanctity geometry. or straight lines, or right an-",Paragraph
gles? The functional list says ce to these prescriptions as well.,Paragraph
"It affects content and form, individual ethics and collective life,",Paragraph
just as language does.,Paragraph
The following chapters examine other applications of this in-,Paragraph
variable. There is no modern architecture outside the list process.,Paragraph
"The rest is fraud, classicist or pseudomodern. It is a crime, when",Paragraph
there is a proper language of architecture to speak.,Paragraph
"3. The methodology of listing functions, applied to volumes. Old and pseudo-",Caption
"modern classicism boxes man’s activities, ignoring their specific differences. Then",Paragraph
it sets the boxes above and beside each other to form a larger box (left). Listing,Paragraph
"gives meaning back to volumes, groups them, but preserving their individuality",Paragraph
(right).,Paragraph
4. Where to hang a picture. Anywhere except in the middle of a wall fabeve/.,Caption
"Where to put a door. Anywhere except in the middle ‘enter, The farther the",Paragraph
"door is from the middle, the deeper the room will look center, below/. The corner",Paragraph
door is the ideal it enhances the diagonal shrlowy.,Paragraph
Asymmetry and Dissonance,Title
Where then? Anywhere else. When you criticize something for being,Paragraph
"symmetrically arranged, and you are asked where else to put it,",Paragraph
your answer should be: anywhere else. There is only one place that,Paragraph
"is radically wrong, the place that is selected “spontaneously,”",Paragraph
dredging up all the atavistic conventions of the subconscious.,Paragraph
We can take an even simpler example than the window to,Paragraph
"demonstrate this, a picture. Here is a wall. Where shall we hang",Paragraph
"the picture? In the center, of course. No, anywhere else. To the",Paragraph
"right or left, higher up or lower down, anywhere but there. If",Paragraph
"you hang the picture in the middle, it splits the wall into two",Paragraph
equal parts. It reduces the visual dimensions and makes them,Paragraph
"trivial. The picture seems to be framed and isolated by the wall,",Paragraph
when it could open up the room and give it breathing space.,Paragraph
Symmetry is one of the invariables of classicism. Therefore,Paragraph
asymmetry is an invariable of the modern language. Once you,Paragraph
"get rid of the fetish of symmetry, you will have taken a giant",Paragraph
step on the road to a democratic architecture.,Paragraph
Symmetry = economic waste + intellectual cynicism. Any time,Paragraph
you see a house consisting of a central core with two symmetrical,Paragraph
lateral extensions you can reject it out of hand. What is in the,Paragraph
"left wing? The living room, perhaps. And in the right one? Bed-",Paragraph
rooms and bathrooms. Is there any conceivable reason why the,Paragraph
two enveloping volumes should be. identical? The architect wasted,Paragraph
space by enlarging the living room to make it the same size as,Paragraph
the bedrooms. Or else he restricted essential functions of the,Paragraph
sleeping area to keep it the same size as the living room. And,Paragraph
look at the height of the ceilings. Why should a vast living room,Paragraph
"5 Rome, Piazza Venezia. The old narrow square ‘hove: could have accommodated",Caption
"an evocative monument like Le Corbusier's “Open Hand” /second row, left! Instead",Paragraph
it was blasted open to make room for the pharaonic Victor Emmanuel Monument,Paragraph

"have a low ceiling? On the other hand, if the bedroom ceiling",Paragraph
"is too high, the space seems visually cramped and suffocating.",Paragraph
"It is a flagrant waste, both economically and esthetically; a double",Paragraph
injury and a double sacrifice. On the altar of what taboo is this,Paragraph
sacrifice laid? On the altar of symmetry.,Paragraph
"Symmetry =a spasmodic need for security, fear of flexibil-",Paragraph
"ity, indetermination, relativity, and growth—in short, fear of",Paragraph
living. The schizophrenic cannot bear the temporal aspect of liv-,Paragraph
"ing. To keep his anguish under control, he requires immobility.",Paragraph
Classicism is the architecture of conformist schizophrenia.,Paragraph
"Symmetry = passivity or, in Freudian terms, homosexuality. This",Paragraph
is explained by psychoanalysts. Homologous parts instead of,Paragraph
"heteronymous parts. It is infantile fear of the father—the academy,",Paragraph
"in this case, is a father figure, protective of the cowardly child—",Paragraph
"who will castrate you if you attack a heteronymous figure, the",Paragraph
"woman, the mother. As soon as one becomes passive and accepts",Paragraph
"symmetry, the anguish seems to subside, because the father no",Paragraph
"longer threatens, he possesses.",Paragraph
Perhaps the whole history of architecture could be reread in,Paragraph
terms of symmetry neurosis. Certainly that of Western architec-,Paragraph
"ture could be. It is no accident, for example, that Italy was the",Paragraph
first country to revive the worship of this idol during the Renais-,Paragraph
"sance, while other countries continued to develop the Gothic style.",Paragraph
The economy of the Italian peninsula was going through a severe,Paragraph
crisis which the dominant classes tried to conceal behind a classi-,Paragraph
cist mask. They evoked the Greco-Roman past in a mythical key,Paragraph
in order to camouflage the instability of the present. They assumed,Paragraph
"a courtly, forbidding, or Olympian air to hide the desolation of",Paragraph
society. It has always been like that: symmetry is the facade of,Paragraph
sham power trying to appear invulnerable. The public buildings,Paragraph
"of Fascism, Nazism, and Stalinist Russia are all symmetrical. Those",Paragraph
of South American dictatorships are symmetrical. Those of theo-,Paragraph
cratic institutions are symmetrical; they often have a double sym-,Paragraph
metry. Can you imagine an asymmetrical Victor Emmanuel Mon-,Paragraph
"ument in Rome, out of balance, varied in its parts, with an",Paragraph
equestrian statue to the left or right rather than in the center?,Paragraph
An Italy capable of building that kind of monument would have,Paragraph
"been another kind of nation, one committed to the creation of",Paragraph
"a democratic state administration, an efficient service sector, a",Paragraph
society. balanced between northern and southern regions and,Paragraph
"based on justice. As a matter of fact, such a country would not",Paragraph
have wasted public funds on a marble monstrosity like the Victor,Paragraph
Emmanuel Monument. Such a society would not have disfigured,Paragraph
the Piazza Venezia with something that made its proportions so,Paragraph
"trivial, by moving the Palazzetto Venezia and tearing down the",Paragraph
"Palazzo Torlonia; in short, ruining not only an architectural hub",Paragraph
but the whole townscape of Rome. [t would have used the money,Paragraph
"to build lower-class housing, schools. and libraries and to reform",Paragraph

all rhetorical buildings—symbols of totalitarian power or products,Paragraph
"of sloth and cynicism—are symmetrical. On closer examination,",Paragraph
"moreover, nonrhetorical symmetrical buildings prove to be only",Paragraph
"partially symmetrical, generally only on the main front. This leads",Paragraph

That would split the space in two. What ‘‘anywhere else” really,Paragraph

"And to accent the diagonal view, why not detach the entrance",Paragraph

"carrier in function of the interior space. If there is no view outside,",Paragraph
"try a strip window at floor level, another one at the ceiling (with",Paragraph
"a different width to avoid symmetry), and perhaps vertical strips",Paragraph
at the corners to light the walls. In the offices of the Rome railway,Caption
"station there are two strips of window per floor, one at desk",Paragraph
"level and one at the ceiling. This is a satisfactory arrangement,",Paragraph
although classicized by too much repetition of the motif. When,Paragraph
"windows are installed in opposite walls, they must not face each",Paragraph
other directly: they will merely light each other and not the room.,Paragraph
Take the Room of the Months in the famous Palazzo Schifanoia,Caption
in Ferrara. Every window faces a full panel on the other side of,Paragraph
"the room, thus providing magnificent lighting for the marvelous",Paragraph
Este frescoes.,Paragraph

Antiperspective Three-Dimensionality,Title
The hecatomb took place in the early fifteenth century. It was,Paragraph
the triumph of perspective. Architects stopped working concretely,Paragraph
on architecture and limited themselves to designing it. The dam-,Paragraph
ages were enormous; they have increased through the following,Paragraph
centuries; and they continue to proliferate with industrialized,Paragraph
building techniques. There is probably nothing comparable in,Paragraph
other areas of human activity. An almost unbridgeable chasm,Paragraph
has opened up between architects and architecture. It is no wonder,Paragraph
that quite a few architects have no idea what architecture is.,Paragraph
. Perspective is a drawing technique for representing three-di-,Paragraph
mensional objects on a two-dimensional surface. To make the,Paragraph
"job easier, buildings were broken down into squared parts and",Paragraph
"reduced to regular prisms. An immense visual heritage of curves,",Paragraph
"asymmetric forms, swerving lines, modulations, and angles other",Paragraph
than 90-degree was obliterated in one fell swoop. The world was,Paragraph
"turned into boxes, and the architectural “orders’’ were used to",Paragraph
distinguish superimposed or juxtaposed parts of the box.,Paragraph
What perspective should have done was provide a means of,Paragraph
acquiring greater awareness of three-dimensionality. Instead it,Paragraph
rigidified three-dimensionality to such a degree that drawing it,Paragraph
has become something mechanical and almost useless. It is a,Paragraph
symptomatic proof of what linguists maintain: it is not we who,Paragraph
speak a language; it is language that “speaks us.” We cannot,Paragraph
even think without a code. The perspective-based revival of clas-,Paragraph
sicism drastically impoverished the architectural language. Instead,Paragraph
"of inventing spaces for human life, packages were designed. With",Paragraph
"perspective, it was no longer architecture but its container that",Paragraph
was dominant.,Paragraph
"In theory, perspective should have provided an instrument to",Paragraph
enhance depth. It might have expected to enrich the representation,Paragraph
"of volumes by the use of dramatic foreshortening. To that end,",Paragraph
the corner view of a building should have become the driving,Paragraph

"Palazzo Farnese in Rome. It is a box, and it could not be anything",Paragraph

might have led the eye off in a series of dynamic vistas. Of course,Paragraph
the palace’s corners would have been totally different. The one,Paragraph
"facing the square should have been a clarion note, while the others",Paragraph
would have been muted to maintain the smooth flow of streets.,Paragraph
"Obviously, nothing of the sort was done. The Farnese Palace",Paragraph
does not communicate any stereometric reality. It is broken up,Paragraph
"into a main facade, heavy flanks on the small side streets, and",Paragraph
an almost independent second facade at the rear. The volume,Caption

"Nervi throws open a row of windows. Nevertheless, the space",Paragraph
"is still blocked, and there is no interplay with the world outside.",Paragraph
The security to be found in the shadow of classical idols is simply,Paragraph
fear decked out in fancy trappings.,Paragraph
What happened to Nervi after the Orbetello hangars? Did his,Paragraph
creative streak run dry? Suffice it to look at the Burgo paper,Paragraph
plant in Mantua and countless details of the buildings mentioned,Paragraph
above to see that it did not. The reason is simpler and much,Paragraph

The structural invariable of the modern idiom is less concerned,Paragraph

all the architectural elements in a symphony of static forces. It,Paragraph
is well known that a structure’s efficiency depends on its form,Paragraph
and the tension of its curves. But how many people take this,Paragraph
"principle into consideration? In an ordinary balcony, it is only",Paragraph
"the slab that does the structural work, not the railing or parapet;",Paragraph
"hence, waste.",Paragraph
But look at the astonishing Falling Water house. The cantile-,Paragraph
vered terrace seemed so precarious to the workmen that they,Paragraph

Is it really indispensable that there be a codified language? If,Paragraph
"its invariables are derived from architectural masterpieces, is it",Paragraph

"through a code, which is necessarily reductive, instead of going",Paragraph
straight to the original sources?,Paragraph
"Certainly, before the constants of the modern language of archi-",Paragraph
"tecture were formulated, the only historically legitimate path was",Paragraph
"Mannerism. At a theoretical level, there is nothing wrong with",Paragraph
that. On the contrary. Mannerism humanizes the styles of gen-,Paragraph
iuses by divesting them of the messianic attitude of a Wright,Paragraph
or the doctrinarianism of a Le Corbusier. If Mannerism could,Paragraph
"make these styles truly popular and available to all, there would,",Paragraph
"of course, be no need to codify an architectural language. Unfortu-",Paragraph
nately this is not the case. Mannerism neither popularizes nor,Paragraph
democratizes. It is a highly intellectual operation and almost un-,Paragraph
"transmittable. Take, for example, Rosso Fiorentino and Pontormo,",Paragraph
"the occasional followers of Michelangelo and Borromini, the disci-",Paragraph
"ples of Wright, Le Corbusier, and Mendelsohn; they amount to",Paragraph
a few dozen in the whole world. Why is this the case? Because,Paragraph
"Mannerists work from results, from finished products, and neglect",Paragraph
the process that developed the products. What they do might,Paragraph
"be called “speech about speech.” Mannerists elaborate on forms,",Paragraph
not on structure and formation. They annotate and distort forms,Paragraph
in a sagacious but limited and aristocratic way. The works of,Paragraph
the masters are derived from the reality of life. The works of,Paragraph
the Mannerists are derived simply from those of the masters.,Paragraph
"The masters continually destructure, they go back to the starting",Paragraph
"point, and they return to listing functions directly. The Manner-",Paragraph
"ists, on the other hand, perceive reality only through the filter",Paragraph
of selected and exalted images. Thus Mannerists tire quickly and,Paragraph
"are sucked back into the academy, which is always lying in am-",Paragraph
"bush (neo-sixteenth-centuryism, neoclassicism, contemporary",Title
neohistorical trends).,Paragraph
It is important to bear in mind the genetic weakness of Manner-,Paragraph
ism: the only way it can destroy classical models—either tear,Paragraph
them apart in anger or undo them with irony—is by preserving,Paragraph
those models as emblems of a sanctity to be desanctified. To,Paragraph
challenge their authority the Mannerists must first acknowledge,Paragraph
it. The infractions and dissonant notes of the Mannerists presup-,Paragraph
pose the tyranny of classical harmony. Indeed Mannerism has,Paragraph
nothing to work on when it encounters anticlassical methodolo-,Paragraph

development of language. The invariables are not axioms outside,Paragraph

functional requirements; one becomes truly aware of them by,Paragraph

"oped alongside Expressionism and especially with Cubism, when",Paragraph
the object was no longer observed from a privileged viewing point,Paragraph
"but dynamically, from innumerable points of view. The result",Paragraph
"was four-dimensional decomposition, the analytical syntax of the",Paragraph

"one of Cubism’s applications? Perhaps the fifth invariable, that",Paragraph
"is, the involvement of every architectural element in the structural",Paragraph
"play, could be moved, since it derives from all of modern engineer-",Paragraph
"ing. But Wright, in the last of his eight sketches reproduced above,",Paragraph
correlates it with the poetics of projecting structures and with,Paragraph
the dismembering of the box into dissonant panels. As for infusing,Paragraph
"space with time, this occupies the sixth place, and it could not",Paragraph
"be otherwise. In effect, this invariable applies the volumetric tech-",Paragraph
"niques of Cubism to the cavities, the vital hollow spaces, the",Paragraph
"special places of architecture. Finally, it is superfluous to repeat",Paragraph
that one cannot reintegrate what has not been separated. Other-,Paragraph
wise it would be a question of a priori integration and a retreat,Paragraph
to classicism.,Paragraph
The sequence of the seven invariables has been established,Paragraph
"by a historical process that lasted more than a century, and it",Paragraph
cannot be altered without serious consequences. Every architect,Paragraph
"must follow the single stages of this itinerary, always referring",Paragraph
"back to the preceding invariables, without omission, that is to",Paragraph

scale as it is on the architectural level. And reintegration seems,Paragraph

infused into organisms that have been zoned to death.,Paragraph
Urbatecture. To reintegrate the city means to reweave its very,Paragraph
fabric and yive new drive to the various functions of its coeffi-,Paragraph
cients. It has been remarked more than once that schools are,Paragraph
low-use structures if the city segregates them in separate areas.,Paragraph
"A school is unused for several hours of the day, all night, on",Paragraph

6. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT ARCHITECTURAL WRITING,Title
Is there not a risk that the codification of the modern language of architecture,Paragraph
will lead to a new academicism’ EVill not the seven invartables tend to become,Paragraph
"precepts like those of the Beaux-Arts school, albett in the opposite direction?",Paragraph
This question is typical of many architects’ mentality. Imagi-,Paragraph
nary specters are invented to avoid the responsibility of trying,Paragraph
"out something new. Why not try, instead, to design a building",Paragraph
or teach a course in design based on these invariables? The doubts,Paragraph
will vanish the minute you start listing functions.,Paragraph
"Language concerns forms of communication, but is not the present problem",Paragraph
"rather concerned with the content of those forms? And, in the last analysis,",Paragraph
does not the architects rele in society depend on that verw content?,Paragraph
"The first invariable, inventorying, is specifically concerned with",Paragraph
"functional content, building programs, and social behavior. If this",Paragraph
"invariable is neglected, the whole construct falls apart or, rather,",Paragraph
"makes no sense because there is nothing to express in dissonance,",Paragraph
nothing to decompose and reintegrate. This proves that the mod-,Paragraph
ern language will not tolerate alibis or excuses. If the question,Paragraph
"of content is evaded, there can be only regression to classicism.",Paragraph
A sustem oreriteism based on the incariadles miu provide criteria tor judging,Paragraph
"a fnisned building, bub iehat about atidesign. wond especially a citw plan?",Paragraph
The invariables provide a precision instrument for checking,Paragraph
"every stage of design, from the preliminary sketch to the final",Paragraph
working drawings. This has been verified a hundred times at,Paragraph
the drawing board and in the classroom. Of course in a rough,Paragraph
"plan you cannot, for example, estimate the exact degree of disso-",Paragraph
nance or four-dimensional decomposition. But the critical method,Paragraph
"is still appropriate; one asks, can the design at this stage still",Paragraph
accommodate the principle of dissonance and decomposition? If,Paragraph
"the answer is no, then the design is closed, reactionary, and classi-",Paragraph
"cist and should be repudiated. In the first stages, functional listing",Paragraph
alone may be enough. But one must make sure that the design,Paragraph
is sufficiently open to accommodate the other invariables.,Paragraph

Suffice it to consider the relationship between Latin and Italian.,Paragraph
The vulgar tongue brought Latin to zero degree in the sense that,Paragraph
"it destructured its code. True. it retained several elements, but",Paragraph
it took them out of the context of the old language and gave,Paragraph
"them a different context. In the same way, modern architecture",Paragraph
takes what is good from the past and reveals its anticlassical,Paragraph
essence. It rejects and annihilates not the past but the corruption,Paragraph
of it that was carried out by Beaux-Arts norms.,Paragraph
"But why condemn symmetry, which is so common in anerent archite dare",Paragraph
and even raises its head in several works by Wright?,Paragraph
"Cesare Beccaria, writing about crime and punishment (Der éesits:",Paragraph
"e delle pene, 1764), was interested in prisons, not in free democratic",Paragraph
"communities. Yet he said, “It is a false sense of utility that would",Paragraph
try to give a multitude of people that symmetry and order which,Paragraph
only inanimate material can absorb.” That epigraph ought to be,Paragraph
carved on the drawing boards of architects and city planners. It,Paragraph
"a building is conceived as an inanimate monumental object, only",Paragraph
"to be looked at and not to be used, then symmetry is fine, because",Paragraph
it is a perfect reflection of political and bureaucratic authoritarian-,Paragraph
ism. But if a building must perform specific Functions and accom-,Paragraph
"modate particular contents, it cannot be symmetrical, because",Paragraph
"symmetry, like harmony in music, binds every element to what",Paragraph
has gone before and what comes after and to what is above and,Paragraph
"below, Symmetry sacrifices the particular and individual on the",Paragraph
"altar of overall design, which is uniform, hierarchical, and unalter-",Paragraph
"able. As for Wright, it must be said that you cannot invent a",Paragraph
"new language in a single day. He had to fight the reigning, classi-",Paragraph
"cism (architectural ‘‘Latin’), and there is nothing scandalous in",Paragraph
the fact that he sometimes used partially symmetrical schemes.,Paragraph
"But what is more important in Wright, the rare leftovers of tradi-",Paragraph
tion or his revolutionary messages? The academic eye concentrates,Paragraph
"on whatever is obsolete in a genius, from Brunelleschi to Palladio.",Paragraph
What we should look at are their original achievements. Why,Paragraph
is there such fear of dissonance and asymmetry? The linguist,Paragraph
Giacomo Devoto wrote in / dinguayyto dltaha “UW is strange that,Paragraph
qualified scholars are 50 reluctant to accept the fertile principle,Paragraph
"of the contraposition of the marginal and the central, which has",Paragraph

The fear of change leads to the geometric and to symmetry.,Paragraph
Nowadavs no one is interested in problems of architectural language or in,Paragraph
architecture generally. The challenge comes trom outside the fleld and concerns,Paragraph
the struggle far a new kind of citv and a diferent environment. Why bother,Paragraph
ahoul the seven invartables?,Paragraph
To make the battle more successful and spirited. This came,Paragraph
out clearly in regard to a housing project built in Rome in the,Paragraph
Pietralata area. A group of leftist students set up a “protest dis-,Paragraph
play” about the conditions in that area. There were posters with,Paragraph
"photographs documenting the lack of service facilities, the dem-",Paragraph
"onstrations that had been staged by the residents, police action,",Paragraph
"and so on. They made a lot of noise, but there was very little",Paragraph
in the way of concrete achievement in this protest. At a certain,Paragraph
"point, however, the students decided to make an analysis of the",Paragraph
neighborhood in terms of the seven invariables. They produced,Paragraph
more posters showing that none of the invariables had been ap-,Paragraph
plied in the design of the area. The display was no longer dema-,Paragraph

"codited before? What caused this inexplicable delav, when the new language",Paragraph
could have been used extenstociu in the profession and in the schools during,Paragraph
these past decades ct feverish balding?,Paragraph
No answer to this anguished and almost obsessive question,Paragraph
can provide anything more than mere consolation. One may cite,Paragraph
a Variety of reasons: (1) as long as the masters of the modern,Paragraph
"movement were still alive and active, the illusion persisted that",Paragraph
some “manner” connected with their styles could take the place,Paragraph
"of a codified language; (2) structuralism, semiotics, and linguistics",Paragraph
were not sufficiently developed to shake the world of architecture;,Paragraph
"(3) it took a total reduction to zero degree, not just in architecture",Paragraph
"but existentially as well, as in the Paris spring of 1968, to stimulate",Paragraph
the codification of a democratic idiom. All these explanations,Paragraph
"are plausible, and others as well, but they are tautological. The",Paragraph
question remains. Schoenberg created and codified the language,Paragraph
"of modern music. Wright, Le Corbusier, Gropius, and Mendelsohn",Caption
"created the language of modern architecture, but they did not",Paragraph
"codify it. Why? Why didn’t someone else do it, then, and spare",Paragraph

"ously creative and critical commitment which, on the one hand,",Paragraph
stands for the right to speak architecture in a way that differs,Paragraph
"from the classical and, on the other, explores history in the search",Paragraph
for new roots in the past. We “write” architecture in a different,Paragraph
language because we “read” it in a heterodox frame of mind.,Paragraph
The impulse to write coincides with that of rereading the ancient,Paragraph
texts and thus avoiding false interpretations. Architects have,Paragraph
"thrown off the strictures of classicism. Similarly, historians spurn",Paragraph
"academic methods of examining and judging monuments. In fact,",Paragraph
"the critic, from Baudelaire to van Doesburg, is oftentimes one",Paragraph
