"‘ORNAMENTATION’, says Ruskin, ‘is the principal part of architec-",Paragraph
"ture,’ It is that part, he says in another place, which impresses on a",Paragraph
"building ‘certain characters venerable or beautiful, but otherwise un-",Paragraph
necessary’. Sir George Gilbert Scott amplified this surprising statement,Paragraph
"when he recommended to architects the use of the Gothic style, because",Paragraph
"its ‘great principle is to decorate construction’,}",Paragraph
How this basic doctrine of nineteenth-century architectural theory,Title
worked out in practice could not be shown more convincingly than by,Paragraph
"retelling the story of the new British Government offices in Whitehall,",Paragraph
"London, as erected by Scott between 1868 and 1873. The following are",Paragraph
the facts as told by Sir George. His original plans were in the Gothic,Paragraph
style. He writes: ‘I did not aim at making my style ‘Italian Gothic”;,Paragraph
"my ideas ran much more upon the French, to which for some years I",Paragraph
"had devoted my chief study. I did, however, aim at gathering a few hints",Paragraph
from Italy . . . I mean a certain squareness and horizontality of outline,Paragraph
"... I] combined this . . . with gables, high-pitched roofs and dormers.",Paragraph
"My details were excellent, and precisely suited to the purpose.’ In spite",Paragraph
"of this, Scott did not win the first prize in the competition, partly be~",Paragraph
cause Lord Palmerston thoroughly disliked medieval styles. Scott com-,Paragraph
"ments: ‘I did not fret myself at the disappointment, but when it was",Paragraph
"found, a few months later, that Lord Palmerston ‘had coolly set aside",Paragraph
"the entire results of the competition, and was about to appoint Penne-",Paragraph
"thorne, a non-competitor, I thought myself at liberty to stir.’ And stir",Paragraph
"he did, so that in the end he was appointed architect to the new building.",Paragraph
"However, he was not able to dissuade the Government from its pre-",Paragraph
dilection for the Italian Renaissance. What followed was described by,Paragraph
Lord Palmerston as the battle of the Gothic and Palladian styles. He,Paragraph
saw no insurmountable difficulty. He sent for Scott and told him ‘in a,Paragraph
"jaunty way that he could have nothing to do with the Gothic style, and",Paragraph
"that,’ continues Scott, ‘though he did not want to disturb my appoint-",Paragraph
"ment, he must insist on my making a design in the Italian style, which",Paragraph
"he felt sure I could do quite as well as the other’, Lord Palmerston was",Paragraph
"evidendy right, for, after long arguments, Scott promised ‘an Italian",Paragraph
design’. But he still hoped that Renaissance could be avoided. He,Paragraph
"altered the front of his building, and now it was ‘in the Byzantine of",Paragraph
the early Venetian palaces . . . toned into a more modern and usable,Paragraph
"form’. In vain, for the Prime Minister wanted ‘the ordinary Italian’,",Paragraph
and he would have it. He called the new plans ‘neither one thing nor,Paragraph
"vother — a regular mongrel affair’, and threatened to cancel Scott’s",Paragraph
"appointment. After that, for the sake of his family and his reputation,",Paragraph
Sir George ‘in sore perplexity’ decided to ‘swallow the bitter pill’.,Paragraph
He ‘bought some costly books on Italian architecture and set,Paragraph
vigorously to work’ to invent an Italian facade ‘beautifully got up in,Paragraph
outline’.®,Paragraph
The campaign of William Morris’s lifetime was directed against the,Paragraph
complete lack of feeling for the essential unity of architecture which,Paragraph
made this comedy possible. When his impressionable nature began to,Paragraph
"react on buildings, fine art, and industrial art, almost all contemporary",Paragraph
"building which surrounded him, as a youth in London and as a student",Paragraph
"at Oxford, and practically all industrial art was crude, vulgar, and over-",Paragraph
loaded with ornament. Examples will be given later. Responsible for,Paragraph
this state of affairs were the Industrial Revolution and — less known but,Paragraph
equally important — the theory of aesthetics created since 1800. ‘lhe,Paragraph
part played by the Industrial Revolution is to be discussed in Chapter 2.,Paragraph
"It is sufficient here to say that manufacturers were, by means of new",Paragraph
"machinery, enabled to turn out thousands of cheap articles in the same",Paragraph
time and at the same cost as were formerly required for the production,Paragraph
of one well-made object. Sham materials and sham techniques were,Paragraph
"dominant all through industry. Skilled craftsmanship, still so admirable",Paragraph
"when Chippendale and Wedgwood were at work, was replaced by",Paragraph
"mechanical routine. Demand was increasing from year to year, but",Paragraph
"demand from an uneducated public, a public with either too much",Paragraph
money and no time or with no money and no time.,Paragraph
"The artist withdrew in disgust from such philistinism or squalor, It",Paragraph
was not for him to condescend to the taste of the majority of his fellow-,Paragraph
"men, to meddle with the ‘Arts Not Fine’. During the Renaissance,",Paragraph
"artists had first learned to consider themselves superior beings, bearers",Paragraph
of a great message. Leonardo da Vinci wanted the artist to be a scientist,Paragraph
"and a humanist, but by no means a craftsman. When Michelangelo was",Paragraph
asked why he had portrayed one of the Medicis in the Medici Chapel,Paragraph
"beardless, though he had worn a beard in life, he answered: ‘ Who, in",Paragraph
"a thousand years, will know what he looked like?’ However, this attitude",Paragraph
of artistic presumption remained exceptional until the end of the eight-,Paragraph
eenth century. Schiller was the first to form a philosophy of art which,Paragraph
made the artist the high priest in a secularized society. Schelling took,Paragraph
"this up, and Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats followed. Poets, according",Paragraph
"to Shelley, are ‘the unacknowledged legislators of the world’. The artist",Paragraph
"is no longer a craftsman, no longer a servant, he is now a priest. Human-",Paragraph
"ity may be his gospel, or beauty, a beauty identical with truth (Keats),",Paragraph
a beauty that is ‘the completest conceivable unity of life and form’,Paragraph
"(Schiller). In creating, the artist makes conscious ‘the essential, the",Paragraph
"universal, the aspect and expression of the in-dwelling spirit of Nature’",Paragraph
(Schelling). Schiller assures him: ‘The dignity of Mankind is laid into,Paragraph
"thy hands’, and compares him to a king - ‘both living on the summits",Paragraph
of mankind’. The inevitable consequence of such adulation became,Paragraph
more and more visible as the nineteenth century unfolded. The artist,Paragraph
began to despise utility and the public (Keats: ‘Oh sweet fancy! let her,Paragraph
loose; Everything is spoilt by use’). He shut himself off from the real,Paragraph
"life of his time, withdrawing into his sacred circle and creating art for",Paragraph
"art’s, art for the artist’s, sake. Concurrently the public lost understand-",Paragraph
"ing of his personal, outwardly useless utterances. Whether he lived like",Paragraph
"a priest or lived a wie de Bohéme, he was ridiculed by most of his con-",Paragraph
"temporaries, and extolled by only a small set of critics and connoisseurs.",Paragraph
But there had been a time when nothing of all that existed. In the,Paragraph
"Middle Ages the artist was a craftsman, proud of executing any com-",Paragraph
mission to the best of his ability. Morris was the first artist (not the first,Paragraph
"thinker, for Ruskin had preceded him) to realize how precarious and",Paragraph
decayed the social foundations of art had become during the centuries,Paragraph
"since the Renaissance, and especially during the years since the Indus-",Paragraph
"trial Revolution. He had been trained as an architect and as a painter,",Paragraph
"first in the Gothic studio of Street, and then in the circle of the Pre-",Paragraph
"Raphaelites. But when, in 1857, he had to furnish his first studio in",Paragraph
"London, the thought struck him that before one can settle down to",Paragraph
"paint elevating pictures, one must be able to live in congenial sur-",Paragraph
"roundings, must have a decent house, and decent chairs and tables.",Paragraph
Nothing was obtainable that could possibly satisfy him. This was the,Paragraph
situation which all of a sudden awakened his own personal genius: if,Paragraph
"we cannot buy solid and honest furniture, let us make it ourselves. So",Paragraph
he and his friends set out to build chairs ‘such as Barbarossa might have,Paragraph
sat in’ and a table ‘as heavy as a rock’ (Rossetti). The same experiment,Paragraph
"was repeated when Morris had a house built for his wife and himself,",Paragraph
"the famous Red House at Bexleyheath. Ultimately, in 1861, instead of",Paragraph
"forming a new exclusive brotherhood of artists, such as the Pre-",Paragraph
"Raphaelite Brotherhood had been, and such as he had wished to found",Paragraph
"when he was studying at Oxford, Morris made up his mind to open a",Paragraph
"firm, the firm of Morris, Marshall & Faulkner, Fine Art Workmen in",Paragraph
"Painting, Carving, Furniture, and the Metals. This event marks the",Paragraph
beginning of a new era in Western Art.,Paragraph
The fundamental meaning of Morris’s firm and Morris’s doctrine,Title
is clearly expressed in the thirty-five lectures which he delivered be-,Paragraph
tween 1877 and 1894 on artistic and social questions.* His point of,Paragraph
departure is the social condition of art which he saw around him. Art,Paragraph
"‘has no longer any root’. The artists, out of touch with everyday life,",Paragraph
‘wrap themselves up in dreams of Greece and Italy ... which only a,Paragraph
very few people even pretend to understand or be moved by’. This,Paragraph
situation must seem exceedingly dangerous to anyone concerned with,Paragraph
"art. Morris preaches: ‘I don’t want art for a few, any more than",Paragraph
"education for a few, or freedom for a few’,® and he asks that great",Paragraph
question which will decide the fate of art in our century : ‘ What business,Paragraph
have we with art at all unless all can share it?’? So far Morris is the true,Paragraph
"prophet of the twentieth century, We owe it to him that an ordinary",Paragraph
man’s dwelling-house has once more become a worthy object of the,Paragraph
"architect’s thought, and a chair, a wallpaper, or a vase a worthy object",Paragraph
of the artist’s imagination.,Paragraph
"However, this is only one half of Morris’s doctrine. The other half",Paragraph
remained committed to nineteenth-century style and nineteenth-,Paragraph
century prejudices. Morris’s notion of art derives from his knowledge,Paragraph
"of medieval conditions of work, and is part and parcel of nineteenth-",Paragraph
"century ‘historicism’. Proceeding from Gothic handicraft, he defined",Paragraph
art simply as ‘the expression by man of his pleasure in labour’. Real,Paragraph
"art must be ‘made. by the people and for the people, as a happiness for",Paragraph
the maker and the user’.* The pride in artistic genius and some special,Paragraph
"form of inspiration, which he saw in all the art of his time, was therefore",Paragraph
abhorrent to him. ‘That talk of inspiration is sheer nonsense’ he said;,Paragraph
"‘there is no such thing: it is a mere matter of craftsmanship,’!°",Paragraph
It is obvious that such a definition of art removes the problem from,Paragraph
"aesthetics into the wider field of social science. In Morris’s mind, ‘it is",Paragraph
"not possible to dissociate art from morality, politics and religion’.1!",Caption
"Here, above all, he proves a faithful follower of Ruskin who in his turn",Paragraph
"owed a debt, just a little too emphatically denied, to Pugin, that brilliant",Paragraph
designer and pamphleteer who in the years between 1836 and 1851 had,Paragraph
"fought violently and relentlessly for Catholicism, for Gothic forms as",Paragraph
"the only Christian forms, and also for honesty and truthfulness in",Paragraph
design and manufacturing. Ruskin took up the latter causes but not the,Paragraph
"former. Among the Seven Lamps of Architecture, his book of 1849, the",Paragraph
"first is the lamp of sacrifice, that is the dedication of a man’s craft",Paragraph
"to God, and the second the lamp of truth. Truth in making is to",Paragraph
"Ruskin making by hand, and making by hand is making with joy.",Paragraph
Ruskin also recognized that here lay the two great secrets of the Middle,Paragraph
Ages and preached the superiority of the Middle Ages over the,Paragraph
Renaissance.,Paragraph
"In all this Morris followed him, and both were led to forms of",Paragraph
Socialism along this path. If Morris denounced the social structure of,Paragraph
"his time so eloquently, his main reason was that it is evidently fatal to",Paragraph
"art. ‘Art... will die out of civilization, if the system lasts. That in itself",Paragraph
does to me carry with it the condemnation of the whole system.’!* Thus,Paragraph
Morris’s Socialism is far from correct according to the standards estab-,Paragraph
lished in the later nineteenth century: there is more in it of More than,Paragraph
of Marx. His main question is: how can we recover a state of things,Paragraph
in which all work would be ‘worth doing’ and at the same time ‘of,Paragraph
"itself pleasant to do’?!> He looked backward, not forward, backward",Paragraph
"into the times of the Icelandic sagas, of cathedral building, of craft",Paragraph
"guilds, One cannot, from his lectures, obtain a clear view of what he",Paragraph
imagined the future to be. ‘The whole basis of Society . . . is incurably,Paragraph
"vicious,’ he wrote.'4 Hence it was sometimes his only hope ‘to think of",Paragraph
barbarism once more flooding the world . . . that it may once again be-,Paragraph
"come beautiful and dramatic withal’.!® And yet when, partly as a",Paragraph
"consequence of his own Socialist propaganda, riots began in London",Paragraph
"and revolution seemed for a moment not unlikely, he recoiled and",Paragraph
gradually withdrew back into his world of poetry and beauty.,Paragraph
This is the decisive antagonism in Morris’s life and teaching. His,Paragraph
"work, the revival of handicraft, is constructive; the essence of his teach-",Paragraph
ing is destructive. Pleading for handicraft alone means pleading for,Paragraph
"conditions of medieval primitiveness, and first of all for the destruction",Paragraph
of all the devices of civilization which were introduced during the,Paragraph
"Renaissance. This he did not want; and since, on the other hand, he",Paragraph
was unwilling to use any post-medieval methods of production in his,Paragraph
"workshops, the consequence was that all his work was expensive work.",Paragraph
In an age when practically all objects of everyday use are manufactured,Paragraph
"with the aid of machinery, the products of the artist-craftsman will be",Paragraph
bought by a narrow circle only. While Morris wanted an art ‘by the,Paragraph
"people and for the people’, he had to admit that cheap art is impossible",Paragraph
"because ‘all art costs time, trouble and thought’.’* He thus created",Paragraph
"art — though now applied art, and no longer the nineteenth-century art",Paragraph
of the easel-picture ~ which was also accessible to a few connoisseurs,Paragraph
"only, or, as he once expressed it himself, art for ‘the swinish luxury of",Paragraph
the rich’.!17 No doubt Morris’s art has in the end beneficially affected,Paragraph
"commercial production in many trades, but that is precisely what he",Paragraph
"would have hated, because the diffusion of his style on a large scale",Paragraph
"involved reintroducing the machine, and thereby expelling once more",Paragraph
the ‘joy of the maker’. The machine was Morris’s arch-enemy: ‘As a,Paragraph
"condition of life, production by machinery is altogether an evil.’!® Look-",Paragraph
"ing forward to barbarism, he certainly hoped for machine-breaking,",Paragraph
though in his late speeches he was careful (and inconsistent) enough,Paragraph
to admit that we ought to try to become ‘the masters of our machines’,Paragraph
and use them ‘as an instrument for forcing on us better conditions of,Paragraph
life’.19,Caption
Morris’s attitude of hatred towards modern methods of production,Title
remained unchanged with most of his followers. The Arts and Crafts,Paragraph
Movement brought a revival of artistic craftsmanship not of industrial,Paragraph
art. Walter Crane (1845~1915) and C.R.Ashbee (1863-1942) may be,Paragraph
"taken as representatives of this, Walter Crane, the most popular of the",Paragraph
"disciples of Morris, did not go one step beyond the doctrine of his",Paragraph
"master, To him, as to Morris, ‘the true root and basis of all Art lies in",Paragraph
"the handicrafts’.*° His aim, therefore, just like Morris’s, was ‘to turn our",Paragraph
"artists into craftsmen and our craftsmen into artists’.*! Moreover, he",Paragraph
agreed with Morris in the conviction that ‘genuine and spontaneous,Paragraph
"art... is a pleasurable exercise’,** and was led by such premises to a",Paragraph
romantic Socialism identical with that of Morris. The same conflict,Paragraph
"which was pointed out in Morris’s doctrine is to be found in Crane, He",Paragraph
too was compelled to admit that ‘cheapness in art and handicraft is well-,Paragraph
"nigh impossible’, because ‘cheapness as a rule... can only be obtained",Paragraph
at the cost of the . . . cheapening of human life and labour’.?* Crane’s,Paragraph
"attitude towards machine production also corresponds to Morris’s, His",Paragraph
dislike of ‘the monsters of our time clad in plate-glass [and] cast-,Paragraph
iron’*4 — Ruskin had been the first to inveigh against railway stations,Paragraph
and the Crystal Palace - is tempered only by the consideration that,Paragraph
machinery may be necessary and useful as ‘the servant and labour-saver,Paragraph
"of man’ for a ‘real saving of labour, heavy and exhausting labour’.*",Paragraph
Ashbee was certainly a more original thinker and more energetic,Paragraph
reformer than Crane.”* Proceeding also from Ruskin and Morris in his,Paragraph
belief that ‘the constructive and decorative arts are the real backbone’,Paragraph
"of any artistic culture, that every object ought to be ‘produced under",Paragraph
"pleasurable conditions’,** and that therefore art for workaday use cannot",Paragraph
"be cheap, he surpasses Morris in that he links up the problems of",Paragraph
workshop-reconstruction and of small-holdings. His Guild and School,Paragraph
"of Handicraft, founded in 1888, was removed in 1902 from the East End",Paragraph
of London to Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds. While this aspect of,Paragraph
his work and doctrine is even more ‘medievalist’ than the teaching,Paragraph
"of Morris, there is another side to his doctrine which seems genuinely",Paragraph
progressive. At the time of the Guild his attitude towards machine,Paragraph
production was still almost that of Morris and Crane. ‘We do not reject,Paragraph
"the machine’, he wrote; ‘we welcome it. But we desire to see it mas-~",Paragraph
"tered.’?* Within the next few years, partly perhaps as a consequence of",Paragraph
the hopeless struggle of the Guild against modern methods of manu-,Paragraph
"facturing, he broke away from what he now called Ruskin’s and",Paragraph
"Morris’s ‘intellectual Ludditism’,?® and the first axiom of his last two",Paragraph
"books on art, published after 1910, is that ‘Modern civilization rests on",Paragraph
"machinery, and no system for the encouragement or the endowment",Title
of the teaching of the arts can be sound that does not recognize this.’>?,Paragraph
"In pronouncing this axiom, Ashbee had abandoned the doctrine of",Paragraph
the Arts and Crafts and adopted one of the basic premises of the,Paragraph
"Modern Movement. But with him it was only adopting, and not",Paragraph
"creating. His foremost title to fame remains the Campden experiment,",Paragraph
an attempt to revive handicraft and husbandry far from the centres of,Paragraph
modern life. The true pioneers of the Modern Movement are those,Paragraph
"who from the outset stood for machine art. As forerunners, of a still",Paragraph
"somewhat transitional character, two contemporaries of Morris may be",Paragraph
"quoted, Lewis F.Day (1845-1910) and John D.Sedding (1837-91).",Paragraph
"Day, a well-known industrial designer of his time, wrote as one who",Paragraph
prefers a life in the real world to dreams of a medieval and idyllic,Paragraph
"existence. In discussing the ornament of the future, he said in 1882:",Paragraph
"‘Whether we like it or no, machinery and steam-power, and electricity",Paragraph
"for all we know, will have something to say concerning the ornament of",Paragraph
"the future.’ He said it would be useless to resist this fact, for it was",Paragraph
‘practically settled by the public that they want machine-work. ... We,Paragraph
"may protest that they have chosen unwisely, but they will not pay much",Paragraph
"heed to us."" And Sedding, perhaps the most original church architect",Paragraph
"of the late Gothic Revivalist school, who became a pupil of Street just",Paragraph
"two years after Morris had left him, gave the same advice in 1892: ‘Let",Paragraph
us not suppose that machinery will be discontinued. Manufacture,Paragraph
cannot be organized upon any other basis. We had better clearly recog-,Paragraph
nize this . . . rather than rebel against the actual and the inevitable.’3*,Title
"However, there is still an immense difference between this hesitating",Paragraph
acknowledgement of machinery and the wholehearted welcome which,Paragraph
it received in the writings of the leaders of the next generation. Not one,Paragraph
of them was English: England’s activity in the preparation of the,Paragraph
Modern Movement came to an end immediately after Morris’s death.,Paragraph
"The initiative now passed to the Continent and the United States, and,",Paragraph
"after a short intermediate period, Germany became the centre of pro-",Paragraph
gress. English writers have not failed to acknowledge this fact;3* but,Paragraph
hardly anybody has tried to explain it. One reason may be this: so long,Paragraph
as the new style had been a matter which in practice concerned only the,Paragraph
"wealthier class, England could foot the bill. As soon as the problem",Paragraph
"began to embrace the people as a whole, other nations took the lead,",Paragraph
"nations that lived no longer, or had never lived, in the atmosphere of",Paragraph
"the ancien régime, nations that did not accept or did not know England’s",Paragraph
educational and social contrasts between the privileged classes and,Paragraph
"those in the suburbs and the slums,",Paragraph
The new gospel was first preached by poets and writers. Walt,Paragraph
Whitman in his odes and Zola in his novels are carried away by the,Paragraph
overwhelming marvels of modern civilization and modern industry.,Paragraph
The first architects to admire the machine and to understand its essential,Paragraph
character and its consequences in the relation of architecture and design,Title
"to ornamentation were two Austrians, two Americans, and a Belgian:",Paragraph
"Otto Wagner (1841-1918), Adolf Loos (1870-1933), Louis Sullivan",Paragraph
"(1856-1924), Frank Lloyd Wright (1869-1959), and Henri van de",Paragraph
"Velde (1863-1957). To these five, one Englishman should be added,",Paragraph
"Oscar Wilde (1854-1900), although his occasional praise of machine",Paragraph
beauty may be only one of his many laborious efforts to éparer /e,Paragraph
"bourgeois. He said in a lecture of 1882: ‘All machinery may be beautiful,",Paragraph
when it is undecorated even. Do not seek to decorate it. We cannot but,Paragraph
"think all good machinery is graceful, also, the line of the strength and",Paragraph
"the line of the beauty being one,’**",Paragraph
"Van de Velde, Wagner, Loos, and Wright were decisively stimulated",Paragraph
in their thoughts by England. Wright’s manifesto was read at Hull,Paragraph
"House in Chicago, a social settlement on the pattern of Toynbee Hall;",Paragraph
Wagner expressed his great admiration of the comfort and cleanness of,Paragraph
English industrial art;°> Loos said explicitly : ‘The centre of European,Paragraph
"civilization is at present in London’,®* and his early criticism was to a",Paragraph
large extent passionate support of the exhibitions of modern English,Paragraph
objects arranged by the Osterreichisches Museum in Vienna; and from,Paragraph
van de Velde’s writings the following statement may be quoted: ‘The,Paragraph
"seeds that fertilized our spirit, evoked our activities, and originated the",Paragraph
"complete renewal of ornamentation and form in the decorative arts,",Paragraph
were undoubtedly the work and the influence of John Ruskin and,Paragraph
William Morris.’”,Paragraph
"Only Louis Sullivan, whose Ornament in Architecture is the earliest",Paragraph
"of these manifestoes of a new style, seems to have been independent of",Paragraph
"England. In his distant Chicago, where metropolitan architecture at",Paragraph
"that time meant New York and Boston, and, farther afield, Paris, he",Paragraph
worked out entirely on his own the theory which found its final form in,Paragraph
the Kindergarten Chats of 1901-2.5% In Ornament in Architecture,Paragraph
"Sullivan stated already in 1892 that ‘ornament is mentally a luxury, not",Paragraph
"a necessary’, and that ‘it would be greatly for our aesthetic good, if we",Paragraph
"should refrain entirely from the use of ornament for a period of years,",Paragraph
in order that our thought might concentrate acutely upon the pro-,Paragraph
duction of buildings well formed and comely in the nude’.?*,Paragraph
Whether Sullivan in formulating this thought was expressing directly,Paragraph
"the message of his own buildings which will be discussed in Chapter 5,",Paragraph
or whether he was influenced by more articulate critics who in their,Paragraph
"turn were influenced by his buildings, is not certain, In any case,",Paragraph
"Montgomery Schuyler (1843-1914), writer, journalist, and editor, had",Paragraph
brought out a book called American Architecture in the sare year 1892,Paragraph
and says in it just like Sullivan: ‘If you were to scrape down to the face,Paragraph
"of the main wall of the buildings of these streets, you would find that",Paragraph
"you had simply removed all the architecture, and that you had left the",Paragraph
buildings as good as ever.’?° Another American architect-writer with,Paragraph
similar convictions was Schuyler’s friend Russell Sturgis (1836-1909),Paragraph
who wrote in the Architectural Record:*' “All recognized styles are more,Paragraph
or less discredited by the sad misuse which they have undergone at the,Paragraph
hands of our own generation and the preceding one. ... The old styles,Paragraph
"simply do not apply to us, and we have to disregard them... . Things",Paragraph
"may be better, if architects were allowed to build very plainly for a",Paragraph
"while... . If the architects were to fall back upon their building, their",Paragraph
"construction, their handling of materials as their sole source of archi-",Paragraph
"tectural effect, a new and valuable style might take form.’!*",Paragraph
Such approval of the unadorned surface was not entirely new in,Paragraph
England either. It had already been said by Crane in 1889 that ‘plain,Paragraph
materials and surfaces are infinitely preferable to inorganic or in-,Paragraph
"appropriate ornament’,*? and one year after Sullivan, Charles F.",Paragraph
Annesley Voysey wrote that ‘discarding the mass of useless ornaments’,Paragraph
"would be healthy and desirable.** But just as Voysey, in spite of such",Paragraph
"suggestions, has been one of the most important representatives of the",Paragraph
"evolution of ornament between Morris and the twentieth century, so",Paragraph
Sullivan was in fact just as much a revolutionary in his ornament as in,Paragraph
"his use of plain, smooth surfaces. In his same paper of 1892, he stated",Paragraph
that ‘organic ornament’ should be the stage to follow the purge of all,Paragraph
ornament which had to come first.,Paragraph
Sullivan’s own decorative motifs belong to the species known as Art,Paragraph
"Nouveau. So do those of van de Velde who, in his lectures between",Paragraph
"1893 and 1900,""° pronounced — independently without doubt - the",Paragraph
same faith in a type of ornament which would be able to express sym-,Paragraph
"bolically ‘by means of pure structure . . . joy, lassitude, protection,",Paragraph
"etc,’,*6 and in the machine as a stimulus to the achievement of a new",Paragraph
beauty. Van de Velde showed his audience that a great deal of the,Paragraph
English Arts and Crafts had remained a pastime of highly sensitive,Paragraph
"artists for highly sensitive connoisseurs, and therefore was not much",Paragraph
healthier than the exquisite and decadent writing of Huysmans. He,Paragraph
"contrasted Morris’s art, which never broke away from reminiscences of",Paragraph
"the Gothic centuries, with his own new doctrine of the beauty inherent",Paragraph
"in machines, ‘The powerful play of their iron arms’, he exclaimed,",Paragraph
"‘will create beauty, as soon as beauty guides them.’*? This statement",Paragraph
dates from about 1894. Six years later van de Velde added more,Caption
explicitly: ‘Why should artists who build palaces in stone rank any,Paragraph
higher than artists who build them in metal?’'* ‘The engineers stand,Paragraph
at the entrance to the riew style.’** Engineers are ‘the architects of the,Paragraph
"present day’.54 What we need is ‘a logical structure of products, un-",Paragraph
"compromising logic in the use of materials, proud and frank exhibition",Paragraph
"of working processes’.*! A great future is prophesied for iron, steel,",Paragraph
"aluminium, linoleum, celluloid, cement.>? As to the appearance of",Paragraph
"objects in the house, van de Velde pleads for ‘that lost sense of vivid,",Paragraph
"strong, clear colours, vigorous and strong forms, and reasonable con-",Paragraph
"struction’,* and praises the new English furniture for its ‘systematic",Paragraph
discarding of ornament’.54,Caption
Precisely this was to be Adolf Loos’s gospel. He had been trained as,Paragraph
"an architect, first in Dresden and then in the United States. Coming",Paragraph
"back to Vienna in 1896, he was shown a small newly published book by",Paragraph
"Vienna’s most progressive architect, Otto Wagner.** The book was",Paragraph
"based on Wagner’s Inaugural Lecture at the Art Academy, in 1894,",Paragraph
and its doctrine was in many respects similar to van de Velde’s. ‘The,Paragraph
only possible departure for artistic creation is modern life.’*” ‘All modern,Paragraph
forms must be in harmony with. . . the new requirements of our time.”5*,Paragraph
‘Nothing that is not practical can be beautiful.’** So Wagner foresaw a,Paragraph
"‘coming Naissance’*” and, what is more astonishing, pointed out as",Paragraph
some of the characteristics of that future style ‘horizontal lines such as,Paragraph
"were prevalent in Antiquity, table-like roofs, great simplicity and an",Paragraph
"energetic exhibition of construction and materials’.6! Needless to say,",Caption
he too was passionately in favour of iron.,Paragraph
Adolf Loos wrote his first essays for newspapers and periodicals in,Paragraph
"1897 and 1898.° Attacking the Viennese Art Nouveau style, known as",Paragraph
"the style of the Sezession, which was just then at its height, he pointed",Paragraph
"out: ‘The lower the standard of a people, the more lavish are its orna-",Paragraph
ments. To find beauty in form instead of making it depend on ornament,Paragraph
is the goal towards which humanity is aspiring.’** For pure beauty in,Paragraph
an individual work of art is to Loos ‘the degree to which it attains,Paragraph
utility and the harmony of all parts in relation to each other’.6* The,Caption
engineers he regards therefore as ‘our Hellenes. From them we receive,Paragraph
"our culture,’ And he is consistent enough to call the plumber (the",Paragraph
term being used in the general American sense) ‘the quartermaster of,Paragraph
"culture, i.e. of the kind of culture which is decisive today’.",Paragraph
Only a few years later similar views were expressed with equally,Paragraph
"strong conviction, though in a more comprehensive and sweeping style,",Paragraph
"by Sullivan’s greatest pupil, Frank Lloyd Wright, who in rgo1 read a",Paragraph
manifesto on The Art and Craft of the Machine.” It begins straight away,Paragraph
"with a panegyric on our ‘age of steel and steam . . . the Machine Age,",Paragraph
"wherein locomotive engines, engines of industry, engines of light or",Paragraph
engines of war or steamships take the place works of Art took in previous,Paragraph
history’.68 Wright enthusiastically admires the new ‘simplified and,Paragraph
"etherealized’ rhythm of future buildings, where ~ an amazing pro-",Paragraph
"phecy — ‘space is more spacious, and the sense of it may enter into every",Paragraph
"building, great or small’.*® In such an age the painter or the poet does",Paragraph
"not count for much. ‘Today, we have a Scientist or an Inventor in the",Paragraph
place of a Shakespeare or a Dante.’”?,Paragraph
"But if Wright speaks of today, he means the twentieth century as it",Paragraph
"could be and ought to be, and not as it appeared in r90r1. The many",Paragraph
"disgraceful things perpetrated by machines are, according to Wright,",Paragraph
the fault not of the machine but of the designers. For ‘the machine has,Paragraph
"noble possibilities, unwillingly forced to this degradation . . . by the",Paragraph
Arts themselves’.?7! Hence one can be in no doubt as to the victory in,Paragraph
"the battle between the artist, in the old sense, and the machine. The",Paragraph
machine is a ‘relentless force’ bound to discomfit the ‘handicraftsmen,Paragraph
and parasitic artists’.’? It sounds like a deliberate challenge to Morris’s,Paragraph
"‘Art will die out of civilization, if the system lasts. That in itself does",Paragraph
"to me carry with it the condemnation of the whole system’, when",Paragraph
"Frank Lloyd Wright, looking at Chicago’s overwhelming silhouette and",Paragraph
"lights by night, exclaims: ‘If this power must be uprooted that civiliza~",Paragraph
"tion may live, then civilization is already doomed.’""? And Wright’s",Paragraph
belief in the machine is so strong that he foresees a possible salvation,Paragraph
for the craftsman in his humbly learning from the machine. ‘Rightly,Paragraph
"used,’ he says, ‘the very curse machinery puts upon handicraft should",Paragraph
emancipate the artists from temptation to petty structural deceit and,Paragraph
end this wearisome struggle to make things seem what they are not and,Paragraph
never can be.’’*,Paragraph
So Wright’s position in 1901 was almost identical with that of the,Paragraph
most advanced thinkers on the future of art and architecture today.,Paragraph
"However, this theory remained isolated in America for a long time.",Paragraph
"And it is an indisputable fact that, in most European countries as well,",Paragraph
those who pleaded for a new style of the century found very little re-,Paragraph
sponse before the First World War. This was for instance the case with,Paragraph
"Anatole de Baudot, Viollet-le-Duc’s pupil, who, as early as 1889, said:",Paragraph
"‘A long time ago the influence of the architect declined and the engineer,",Paragraph
"homme moderne par excellence, is beginning to replace him’,”* and it",Paragraph
"was also the case with H.P.Berlage (1856-1934) in Holland who, in",Paragraph
"two articles in 1895 and 1896, recommended to the architect not to",Paragraph
"think in terms of style while designing buildings. Only thus, he said,",Paragraph
"can real architecture comparable to that of the Middle Ages be created,",Paragraph
architecture as a ‘pure art of utility’.“© Such architecture he visualized,Paragraph
"as ‘the art of the twentieth century’, and it should be noted that the",Paragraph
century to him was to be one of Socialism.”?,Paragraph
To have achieved a wide movement promoting these new ideas is,Paragraph
undeniably the merit of German architects and writers. The movement,Paragraph
which they fostered proved strong enough to yield a universal style of,Paragraph
"thinking and building, and not merely some revolutionary sayings and",Paragraph
deeds of a few individuals.,Paragraph
The man who acted as a connecting link between the English style,Paragraph
of the nineties and Germany was Hermann Muthesius (1861-1927),Paragraph
"who, from 1896 till 1903, was attached to the German Embassy in",Paragraph
London for research on English housing. Since Art Nouveau had hardly,Paragraph
diverted English domestic architecture from the sound and slow course,Title
"of its evolution, Muthesius came back a convinced supporter of reason",Paragraph
and simplicity in building and art. Soon he became the acknowledged,Paragraph
"leader of a new tendency towards Sachlichkeit, which followed the",Paragraph
short blossom-time of Art Nouveau in Germany. The untranslatable,Paragraph
"word sachlich, meaning at the same time pertinent, matter-of-fact, and",Paragraph
"objective, became the catchword of the growing Modern Movement.7®",Paragraph
‘Reasonable Sachlichkeit’ is what Muthesius praiscs in English archi-,Paragraph
"tecture and crafts,*® ‘perfect and pure utility’ is what he demands from",Paragraph
the modern artist. And since today only machine-made objects are,Paragraph
"‘produced according to the economic nature of the age’, they alone can",Paragraph
be taken into consideration where the problem is the creation of a new,Paragraph
"style, a Maschinenstil.°° If we want to see existing manifestations of this",Paragraph
"new style, we are once more invited to look at ‘railway stations, exhibi-",Paragraph
"tion halls, bridges, steamships, etc. Here we are faced with a severe and",Paragraph
"almost scientific Sachlichkeit, with abstinence from all outward decora-",Paragraph
"tion, and with shapes completely dictated by the purposes which they",Paragraph
are meant to serve.’ Hence future progress can be imagined only in the,Paragraph
direction of strict Sachlichkeit and a discarding of all merely ‘tacked-on’,Paragraph
decoration. Building’ or objects for use that are created on such lines,Paragraph
will display ‘a neat elegance which arises from suitability and . . .,Paragraph
conciseness’.*!,Paragraph
"By pronouncing such ideas, still unfamiliar in Germany, Muthesius",Paragraph
soon became the centre of a group of congenial spirits. Of paramount,Paragraph
"importance, owing to the echo which he found among the bourgeoisie",Paragraph
"listening to his lectures and reading his pamphlets, was Alfred Lichtwark",Paragraph
"(1852-1914), art historian and director of the Hamburg Gallery. He",Paragraph
"was a teacher by nature, obsessed with the purest passion for education.",Paragraph
"The rapid development of art education in the widest sense of the word,",Paragraph
which has taken place in the German elementary schools and secondary,Paragraph
"schools since the beginning of the new century, is largely due to",Paragraph
Lichtwark’s efforts. His campaign in favour of Sachlichkeit started even,Paragraph
earlier than Muthesius’s. In the lectures which he delivered between,Paragraph
"1896 and 1899, and which are full of praise for England, he pleaded for",Paragraph
"practical, unadorned furniture in ‘smooth, polished, light forms’ con-",Paragraph
"venient to housewives, for sachliche Schénheit, for wide horizontal",Paragraph
"windows and ‘floods of light’, and for fresh flowers in the rooms.*?",Paragraph
The campaign thus started was soon taken up by others and diverted,Paragraph
into different channels without losing its zest for simplicity and honesty.,Paragraph
The architect Paul Schultze-Naumburg (1869-1949) began in 1901 to,Paragraph
"publish his Kudturarbeiten, a series of books starting with one on the",Paragraph
building of houses. In 1903 Ferdinand Avenarius (1856-1923) founded,Paragraph
"the Direrbund, and in 1904 the Heimatschutz was created, an associa-",Paragraph
tion corresponding roughly to our Society for the Protection of,Paragraph
"Rural England, that is, a preservationist, backward-looking, not a",Paragraph
"propagandist, forward-looking body, closer indeed to the ideals of",Paragraph
Morris than to those of Muthesius. Muthesius on the other hand was,Paragraph
supported by several Germans individually whom one would not,Paragraph
"expect to find in his camp, for instance to quote only three, by Hermann",Paragraph
"Obrist, one of the most original artists of the German Art Nouveau, by",Paragraph
"Wilhelm Schafer, a well-known writer and poet, and by Friedrich",Paragraph
"Naumann, a politician of importance in the development of social re-",Paragraph
forms and democracy in pre- and post-First-World-War Germany.,Paragraph
Obrist wrote in 1903 of steamers and ‘the beauty in the powerful sweep,Paragraph
"of their colossal yet quiet contours .. . their wonderful utility, their",Paragraph
"neatness, smoothness, and shine’. A look into the engine-room makes",Paragraph
him feel ‘almost intoxicated’.*? Wilhelm Schafer vividly recommends,Paragraph
the sachliche Ausbildung of all forms; this would necessarily lead to a,Paragraph
"modern style for all products, just as it has done in machines and iron",Paragraph
"bridges.*! As to Friedrich Naumann, his main interest was in the social",Paragraph
aspects of architecture and art. This led him to an early appreciation of,Paragraph
"the machine. Exactly like Muthesius, and no doubt inspired by him,",Paragraph
"Naumann speaks of ‘ships, bridges, gasometers, railway stations, market",Paragraph
halls’ as ‘our new buildings’. He calis ‘building in iron the greatest,Paragraph
"artistic experience of our time’, because ‘here there is not the application",Paragraph
"of art to construction, no stuck-on decoration, no frills. Here is creation",Paragraph
for use... here are as yet inexpressible possibilities. All our notions of,Paragraph
"space, of weight and support are changed.’**",Paragraph
"Naumann was a personal friend of Karl Schmidt (1873-1948) who,",Paragraph
"as a trained cabinetmaker, had started a furniture workshop at Dresden",Paragraph
"in 1898.""° In this shop he employed from the beginning modern archi-",Paragraph
tects and artists as designers. Though Schmidt started under the,Paragraph
influence of the English Arts and Crafts (he had travelled in England,Paragraph
"as a journeyman), his main interest soon became inexpensiveness and",Paragraph
production by machinery. As early as 1899-1900 the Deutsche Werk-,Paragraph
"statten, in an exhibition of industrial art in Dresden, showed an apart-",Paragraph
"ment of two living-rooms, bedroom, and kitchen for a mere £40. And",Paragraph
"in 1905-6, for another exhibition, again in Dresden, they produced their",Paragraph
"first machine-made furniture, designed by Richard Riemerschmid",Caption
"(1868-1957), Schmidt’s brother-in-law.*’ In their catalogue of the same",Paragraph
year they prided themselves on ‘developing the style of furniture from,Paragraph
the spirit of the machine’. This was a feat far more revolutionary than,Paragraph
it seems to us today. At that time there were hardly any instances outside,Paragraph
Germany of outstanding artists or architects working not for deco-,Paragraph
"rative art, but for industrial design, with the exception perhaps of",Paragraph
printing in England which just then took the step from the seclu-,Paragraph
sion of such a private venture as the Doves Press into the market for,Paragraph
"the common man. The important date is 1912, the year of the",Paragraph
"introduction, thanks to J.H.Mason, of the Imprint type into the",Paragraph
founts of the Monotype Corporation. The Deutsche Werkstitten,Paragraph
"soon turned to another, even more topical, problem: the standardization",Paragraph
"of parts. Their first ‘Unit’ furniture, to call it by the name which",Paragraph
"has become usual in England, was shown in 1910 as Typenmdbel. The",Paragraph
"idea came from America, where it had been in use for some time for",Paragraph
bookcases.®8,Paragraph
The most important step towards the establishment of a universally,Paragraph
recognized style out of individual experiments was the foundation of,Paragraph
"the Deutscher Werkbund. In 1907, Muthesius, then Superintendent",Paragraph
"of the Prussian Board of Trade for Schools of Arts and Crafts, had",Paragraph
"delivered a public lecture in which, in a very outspoken manner, he",Paragraph
warned German crafts and industries against continuing with the,Paragraph
imitation of the hackneyed forms of bygone times. The speech roused,Paragraph
a storm of indignation with the trades’ associations. Discussions be-,Paragraph
"came more and more excited and, before the end of the year 1907, a",Paragraph
"number of adventurous manufacturers together with some architects,",Paragraph
"artists, and writers, had made up their minds to found a new association,",Paragraph
"called Werkbund, with the aim of ‘selecting the best representatives of",Paragraph
"art, industry, crafts, and trades, of combining all efforts towards high",Paragraph
"quality in industrial work, and of forming a rallying-point for all those",Paragraph
"who are able and willing to work for high quality’.*® Qualiraz, the",Paragraph
"central idea of the group, was defined as meaning ‘not only excellent",Paragraph
"durable work and the use of flawless, genuine materials, but also the",Paragraph
"attainment of an organic whole rendered sachlich, noble, and, if you",Paragraph
"will, artistic by such means’.°° This definition shows clearly that the",Paragraph
"Werkbund was, from the outset, not opposed to machine production in",Paragraph
"any respect. In the Inaugural Address at the first Annual Meeting, the",Paragraph
architect Theodor Fischer said: ‘There is no fixed boundary line,Paragraph
"between tool and machine, Work of a high standard can be created with",Paragraph
tools or with machines as soon as man has mastered the machine and,Paragraph
made it a tool... . It is not the machines in themselves that make work,Paragraph
"inferior, but our inability to use them properly.’ And equally it is ‘not",Paragraph
"mass production and subdivision of labour that is fatal, but the fact",Paragraph
that industry has lost sight of its aim of producing work of the highest,Paragraph
quality and does not feel itself to be a serving member of our community,Paragraph
but the ruler of the age’.®!,Paragraph
"When, in 1915, the Design and Industries Association was founded",Paragraph
"in England, avowedly inspired by the example of the Deutscher Werk-",Paragraph
"bund, it declared in one of its first publications that it was ‘accepting",Paragraph
"the machine in its proper place, as a device to be guided and controlled,",Paragraph
"not merely boycotted’.** England, with the foundation of the D.1.A.,",Paragraph
was not early in taking up the programme developed by the Werkbund.,Paragraph
Other Continental countries had followed Germany before the war: the,Paragraph
"Austrian Werkbund dates from 1910, the Swiss from 1913; and the",Paragraph
Swedish Slojdsforening was gradually reshaped into a Werkbund be-,Paragraph
tween I910 and r917.,Paragraph
"In Germany itself, the existence of this enterprising and uncom-",Paragraph
promising body did a very great deal to spread the ideals of the Modern,Paragraph
Movement. But the Werkbund was not the only centre. Surprisingly,Paragraph
"quickly, German art schools had deserted the routine of the nineteenth",Paragraph
century and adopted the new course. New principals and new teachers,Paragraph
"were appointed everywhere. In Prussia, Muthesius was responsible for",Paragraph
"this. He called Peter Behrens to Diisseldorf and Poelzig to Breslau, both",Paragraph
as heads of the existing Academies of Art. Even before that time Josef,Paragraph
Hoffmann had become Professor of Architecture in the Viennese School,Paragraph
"of Arts and Crafts, and van de Velde head of the Weimar Art School.",Paragraph
"In 1907, the Berlin School of Arts and Crafts also secured a progressive",Paragraph
principal in the person of Bruno Paul.,Paragraph
"However, progressive as the spirit in these schools and the Werkbund",Paragraph
"was, the most essential problem was still unsettled, the very problem",Paragraph
with which this chapter is mainly concerned. Though machine art was,Paragraph
"now accepted as one means of artistic expression besides handicraft,",Paragraph
where should the stress lie in the future? This problem was for the first,Paragraph
time clearly put and explicitly discussed at the Annual Meeting of the,Paragraph
Werkbund in Cologne in 1914. Muthesius stood up for standardization,Paragraph
"(Typisierung), van de Velde for individualism, Muthesius said: ‘Archi-",Paragraph
tecture and the entire sphere of activity of the Werkbund tend towards,Paragraph
standardization. It is only by standardization that they can recover that,Paragraph
universal importance which they possessed in ages of harmonious,Paragraph
civilization. Only by standardization . . . as a salutary concentration of,Paragraph
"forces, can a generally accepted and reliable taste be introduced.’ Van",Paragraph
de Velde responded: ‘As long as there are artists in the Werkbund...,Paragraph
they will protest against any proposed canon and any standardization.,Paragraph
"The artist is essentially and intimately a passionate individualist, a",Paragraph
"spontaneous creator. Never will he, of his own free will, submit to",Paragraph
"a discipline forcing upon him a norm, a canon,”""!",Paragraph
The first ever to plead the cause of the machine and the new architec-,Paragraph
ture of a machine age with the same fervour with which van de Velde,Paragraph
had pleaded that of individualism were the Italian Futurists and especi-,Paragraph
ally the brilliant young architect Antonio Sant’Elia (1888-1917) who,Paragraph
"died without having had a chance of building as he thought, preached,",Paragraph
"and drew.® Sant’Elia’s Messaggio is a vision of the casa nuova, ‘con-",Paragraph
structed with loving care for all the resources of science and technics,Paragraph
"and determined in its new forms, new lines, its new raison d’étre, solely",Paragraph
by the special conditions of modern life... . The calculations of the,Paragraph
"insistence of materials, the use of reinforced concrete and iron exclude",Paragraph
architecture in the traditional sense.’ Buildings look grotesque if they,Paragraph
try to obtain within the possibilities of the slenderness and thinness of,Paragraph
concrete the heavy curves of arches and the massive character of marble.,Paragraph
"The job of today is not to build cathedrals but big hotels, railway",Paragraph
"stations, arterial roads, market halls, towers on grid plans in replacement",Caption
"of slums. ‘We must build the modern city ex novo’... , a town of",Paragraph
‘tumultuous streets’ with building below as well as above ground. The,Paragraph
house must be beautified not on the small scale of mouldings and capitals,Paragraph
"but in the grouping of its masses and the arrangement of its plan, It",Paragraph
"must be ‘similar to a gigantic machine’, made ‘of concrete, of glass, of",Paragraph
"iron, without painting or sculpture’, lifts ought to be exposed outside,",Paragraph
"cold calculation and the boldest audacity must unite forces, and the",Paragraph
"result will not be ‘an arid combination of the practical and the useful,",Paragraph
"but remains art, that is expression’.",Paragraph
This message appeared in the catalogue of an exhibition called Nuove,Paragraph
"Tendenze in Milan in May 1914. Two months later Marinetti, the",Paragraph
vociferous leader of the Futurists made it the centre of a Manifesto of,Paragraph
Modern Architecture issued in July 1914. He added passages with,Paragraph
"which Sant’Elia did not agrec, but it remains highly probable that",Paragraph
Marinetti’s original Futurist Manifesto of 1909 with its profession of,Paragraph
faith in motor-cars (‘we laid our hands on their burning breasts’) and,Paragraph
"in ‘the great crowd, the modern metropolis, arsenals and shipyards at",Paragraph
"night, railways, steamers, aeroplanes’ had inspired Sant’Elia’s thought",Paragraph
"on the City of the Future,*® and indeed those remarkable visions of",Paragraph
buildings to which we have to revert in Chapter 7.,Paragraph
These visions of about 1913-14 appear fantastical when set side by,Paragraph
side with the Sachlichkett of the work of those German architects who,Paragraph
"agreed with Muthesius, and especially Peter Behrens and Walter",Paragraph
"Gropius, What they built in 1909-14 will be illustrated at the end of",Paragraph
"this book, whose chief aim is in fact to prove that the new style, the",Paragraph
"genuine and legitimate style of our century, was achieved by 1914.",Paragraph
Morris had started the movement by reviving handicraft as an art,Paragraph
"worthy of the best men’s efforts, the pioneers about 1900 had gone",Paragraph
"further by discovering the immense, untried possibilities of machine",Paragraph
"art. The synthesis, in creation as well as in theory, is the work of Walter",Paragraph

"Staatliches Bauhaus, and it was to become, for more than a decade, a",Paragraph
paramount centre of creative energy in Europe. It was at the same time,Paragraph
a Jaboratory for handicraft and for standardization; a school and a,Paragraph

probably felt the same. The attendance as well as the size of the build-,Paragraph

and soon discussions started in England and other countries as to the,Paragraph

various such reasons; but it was hard indeed for a generation that had,Paragraph

fundamental requirements of decoration in general and of carpet,Paragraph
decoration especially ; we are forced to step over bulging scrolls and into,Paragraph
"large, unpleasantly realistic flowers; it seems unbelievable that the",Paragraph
teachings of Persian carpets should have been so completely forgotten.,Paragraph
And this barbarism was by no means limited to England. The other,Paragraph
nations exhibiting were equally rich in atrocities. Take the design for a,Paragraph
"silk shawl by E. Hartneck, shown in the French section (Pl.2). This is",Paragraph
at least as incongruous as the English carpet in its mixture of stylization,Paragraph
and realism. It shows the same ignorance of that basic need in creating,Paragraph
"patterns, the integrity of the surface; and the same vulgarity in detail.",Paragraph
It was not only that the machine had stamped out taste in industrial,Paragraph

simply a figment of our generation. The insensibility of the artist to-,Paragraph

is monstrous.,Paragraph
Once more the question has to be asked: Why was this bound to,Paragraph
come? The usual answer — because of industrial growth and the inven-,Paragraph
"tion of machines - is correct, but as a rule taken too superficially. The",Paragraph
"potter’s wheel is a machine, and so are the hand-loom and the printer’s",Paragraph
press. The development from such simple mechanical devices to,Paragraph
modern wonders of machinery was logical and gradual. Why did the,Paragraph
machine in the end become so disastrous to art? The transition from,Paragraph
the medieval to the modern state of applied art was reached somewhere,Paragraph
"about the end of the eighteenth century. After 1760, a sudden accelera-",Paragraph
tion in technical improvements set in. This no doubt was due to that,Paragraph
"profound change of mind which began with the Reformation, gathered",Paragraph
"strength during the seventeenth century, and was dominant in the",Paragraph
"eighteenth. Rationalism, inductive philosophy, experimental science,",Caption
were the determining fields of European activity during the Age of,Paragraph
"Reason, Even the religious revival which took place has a strong",Paragraph
element of rationalism and marked understanding for worldly tasks and,Paragraph
the ethical qualities of workaday life.,Paragraph
The change in European thought was accompanied and followed by,Paragraph
a change in social ideals. Thus the newly-roused inventiveness received,Paragraph
an equally new practical scope. Applied science'as a means of governing,Paragraph
the world soon became part of a programme directed against those,Paragraph
classes which had governed during the Middle Ages. Industry meant,Paragraph
the bourgeoisie as opposed to the Church and the Nobility. The French,Paragraph
Revolution accomplished what had been slowly preparing for more,Paragraph
than two centuries. The medieval social system was swept out of,Paragraph
"existence, and with it the class of cultured and leisurely patrons as well",Paragraph
as the class of cultured and guild-trained craftsmen. It is more than,Paragraph
coincidence that very soon after the dissolution of the guilds in France,Paragraph
"(1791), the Ecole Polytechnique and the Conservatoire des Arts et des",Paragraph
"Métiers were founded (1795 and 1798), and the first National Industrial",Paragraph
Exhibition was held (1798). Industry instead of handicraft is a con-,Paragraph
"ception of the ters état. This applies likewise to England; but, owing",Paragraph
"to the temperament of the English, the change was slower here and",Paragraph
came about without a sudden revolution. It started early in the eight-,Paragraph
eenth century and ended only with the Reform Bill in 1832. Guilds had,Paragraph
never been so influential in England as on the Continent. From the,Paragraph
"fourteenth century on, the nobility had already begun to merge with the",Paragraph
merchant class. Plutocracy began to replace aristocracy earlier in,Paragraph
"England than in France, It is only in a figurative sense that the history",Paragraph
of English civilization between 1760 and 1830 can be called the,Paragraph
"Industrial Revolution,",Title
Some dates may illustrate the rapid and impetuous industrial growth,Paragraph
"which formed a world capable, a century later, of creating the Modern",Paragraph
Movement. As England was leading in the Industrial Revolution nearly,Paragraph
"all these early dates are English. In 1709, Abraham Darby made cast",Paragraph
iron with coke (instead of wood); about 1740 Benjamin Huntsman in-,Paragraph
vented the crucible process of melting steel; in 1783 Cort introduced,Paragraph
the puddling process; about 1810 the decisive improvements in the use,Paragraph
of the blast-furnace took place (Aubertot); in 1839 Nasmyth invented,Paragraph
the steam-hammer; and in 1856 Bessemer his new method of producing,Paragraph
"steel free from carbon. To these innovations in metallurgy, we must",Paragraph
"add the invention of the steam-engine with separate condenser (J. Watt,",Paragraph
"1765), of the steam-boiler (1781), the screw steamer (1821), and the",Paragraph
railway engine (1825). The principal dates in the spinning and weaving,Paragraph
"industries are the following: 1733 fly-shuttle (J. Kay), 1760 shuttle drop",Paragraph
"box (R. Kay), 1764-7 spinning jenny (Hargreaves), 1769-75 water-",Caption
"frame for spinning (Arkwright), 1774-9 spinning mule (Crompton),",Caption
"1785 power-loom (Cartwright), 1799 Jacquard loom.",Caption
The immediate consequence of this precipitous development was a,Paragraph
"sudden increase in production, demanding more and more hands, and",Paragraph
so leading to an equally fast increase in population. Towns grew up,Paragraph
"with horrifying rapidity, new markets had to be satisfied, an ever bigger",Paragraph
"production was demanded, and inventiveness was stimulated anew.",Paragraph
A few more figures may illustrate this rank growth which made our,Paragraph
modern world out of a world less similar to ours than to that of the,Paragraph

ance of all products were left to the uneducated manufacturer. Designers,Paragraph
"of some standing had not penetrated into industry, artists kept aloof,",Paragraph
and the workman had no say in artistic matters. Work was bleaker than,Paragraph
ever before in European history. Working hours were between twelve,Paragraph
"and fourteen, doors and windows in factories were kept locked. Children",Paragraph
were employed from their fifth or sixth year on. Their hours of work,Paragraph
"were reduced in 1802, after long struggles, to twelve hours a day. In",Paragraph
"1833, 61,000 men, 65,000 women, and 84,000 children under eighteen",Paragraph
"years of age worked in cotton mills. In mines, no inquiries into accidents",Paragraph
were held before 1814.,Paragraph
Economists and philosophers were blind enough to provide an,Paragraph
ideological foundation for the criminal attitude of the employer. Philo-,Paragraph

the only natural and healthy way of progress.* Liberalism ruled un-,Paragraph
"checked in philosophy as in industry, and implied complete freedom",Paragraph
"for the manufacturer to produce anything shoddy and hideous, if he",Paragraph
"could get away with it, And he easily could, because the consumer had",Paragraph
"no tradition, no education, and no leisure, and was, like the producer,",Paragraph
a victim of this vicious circle.,Paragraph
All these facts and considerations have to be taken into account if we,Paragraph
are to understand the exhibits of 1851. They were indeed taken into,Paragraph
"account by the very organizers of the exhibition which, in the eyes of",Paragraph
"this group of energetic men, was, on the aesthetic side, to be an attempt",Paragraph
"at reform. These men were Henry Cole (1808-82), civil servant and",Paragraph
"reformer by constitution, his architect friends Owen Jones (1809-74)",Paragraph
"and Matthew Digby Wyatt (1820-77), and his painter friend Richard",Paragraph
Redgrave (1804-88). Cole began in 1847 to issue what he called art,Paragraph
"manufactures, i.e. things of everyday use, better designed, he thought,",Paragraph
"than was current at the time, and two years later he started a magazine",Paragraph
called the Journal of Design and Manufactures. This journal developed,Paragraph
a programme of remarkably sound aesthetics.’ ‘Ornament .. . must be,Paragraph
"secondary to the thing decorated’, there must be ‘fitness in the ornament",Paragraph
"to the thing ornamented’, wallpapers and carpets must have no patterns",Paragraph
"‘suggestive of anything but a level or plain’, and so on. Certain designs",Paragraph
by Owen Jones illustrate these principles to perfection although Cole’s,Paragraph
own and those made by his friends for his short-lived firm do not. The,Paragraph
commentary in the Journal of Design to Owen Jones’s chintz here,Title
"illustrated (Pl. 4) runs as follows: ‘The design is, as it ought to be, of a",Paragraph
"perfectly flat unshadowed character. Secondly, the quantities and lines",Paragraph
"are equally distributed, so as to produce at a distance the appearance of",Paragraph
"4. Owen Jones: Pattern design,",Caption
from the Journal of Design,Title
"and Manufactures, 1852.",Caption
"levelness. Thirdly, the colours [they are black and dark purple on white}",Paragraph
"produce a neutral tint. And lastly . . . it is quite unobtrusive, which a",Paragraph
covering of handsomer stuffs [the material was presumably for loose,Paragraph
"covers of chairs] ought to be. The lines and forms are graceful too,",Paragraph
when examined closely.”,Paragraph
The principles put forward in such a commentary and throughout,Paragraph
"the writings, occasional or permanent, of the Cole circle were based - as",Paragraph
they all freely admitted ~ on the tenets formulated a few years before,Paragraph
"by Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, to whom reference has already",Caption
been made as an inspirer of Ruskin’s theory of honesty in architecture,Paragraph
and design. Pugin had started his True Principles with ‘the two great,Paragraph
rules for design .. . that there should be no features about a building,Paragraph
"which are not necessary for convenience, construction, or propriety’,",Paragraph
and ‘that all ornament should consist of enrichment of the essential,Paragraph
"construction of the building’, yet the title of the book is The True",Paragraph
"Principles of Pointed or Christian Architecture, and Pugin was indeed",Paragraph
"unable to isolate his principles from the use which, in his view, Gothic",Paragraph
builders had made of them. So he remained firmly within a faithful,Paragraph
"5. Pugin: Ornamental design,",Caption
"from Foliated Ornament,",Paragraph
1849.,Paragraph
"imitation of the past, even if some of his own ornamented patterns",Paragraph
herald and certainly surpass the designs of Owen Jones and even herald,Paragraph
those of William Morris (Pl. 5).,Paragraph
What raises Morris as a reformer of design high above the Cole,Paragraph
circle and Pugin is not only that he had the true designer’s genius and,Paragraph
"they had not, but also that he recognized the indissoluble unity of an",Paragraph
"age and its social system, which they had not done. Cole, Jones, and",Paragraph
"Wyatt had accepted production by machine unquestioningly, they had",Paragraph
not seen that it posed any unprecedented problems and so had simply,Paragraph
attempted to improve design without ever pioneering to its roots.,Paragraph
Pugin’s panacea was Catholic faith and Gothic forms. He thundered,Paragraph
"against ‘those inexhaustible mines of bad taste, Birmingham and",Paragraph
"Sheffield’, against ‘Sheffield Eternal’ and ‘Brummagem Gothic’ and",Paragraph
succeeded in getting better work by employing ‘a devout and skilful,Paragraph
"goldsmith of Birmingham’- in fact Hardman, a manufacturer - and by",Paragraph
"supervising him closely, That alone clearly could not be enough, nor",Paragraph
could Cole’s attempts at a reform in the teaching principles of art schools,Paragraph
be enough.,Paragraph
"Morris alone felt that what was needed was the personal example, the",Paragraph
artist turning craftsman-designer himself. While he followed his inborn,Paragraph
"passion for making things with his own hands, he knew also that to do",Paragraph
this instead of painting pictures was his social duty. Before he was,Paragraph
"twenty-two, he had experimented with carving in stone and wood,",Paragraph
"moulding in clay, and illuminating. This helped him to acquire a respect",Paragraph
for the nature of materials and working processes. Wherever he looked,Paragraph
"in contemporary industrial art, he saw manufacturers blatantly violating",Paragraph
this. So his first furniture for his own rooms was nothing but a protest.,Paragraph
"The chairs and tables, ‘intensely medieval, like incubi and succubi’",Paragraph
"(Rossetti), tell of a deliberate return to the most primitive attitude in",Paragraph
shaping domestic objects.,Paragraph
"At the time, and also in the years when Red House was furnished",Paragraph
"and the firm founded, Morris’s mode of expression was still somewhat",Paragraph
"different from that of his later, more famous, and more established years.",Paragraph
"His early designs are crisper, lighter, and more daintily stylized, under",Paragraph
some influence no doubt from the teachings of Cole’s Journal and of,Paragraph
"Owen Jones whose Grammar of Ornament he possessed. In the Daisy,",Paragraph
"the second of any wallpapers he designed, 1861 (P1.6), the colours are",Paragraph
"light though restrained, the pattern is pleasantly balanced, without",Paragraph
"recession, and wholly ornamental without ever losing that intense feel-",Paragraph
ing for nature which is so characteristic of Morris and so different from,Paragraph
the imitation of nature as the designers of the Exhibition practised it.,Paragraph
"Later on, Morris’s style becomes broader and statelier and thereby",Paragraph
loses some of its youthful and adventurous charm.* Not that his creative,Paragraph
"vein was less abundant now, His very simplicity of approach led him to",Paragraph
"forms more traditional. When, for example, in 1878, he decided to make",Paragraph
"carpets, he saw that certain Oriental patterns were almost exactly what",Paragraph
he wanted. Hence his Hammersmith carpets (P1.7) are very much like,Paragraph
"Oriental designs, though he emphasized that he wanted them ‘obviously",Paragraph
to be the outcome of modern and Western ideas’.? This is remarkable.,Paragraph
"Morris was so far from inventing decorative forms for invention’s sake,",Paragraph
that if he found models however remote in space or time which met his,Paragraph
"purpose, he made use of them or at least came under their spell, even",Paragraph
if this happened against his own will.,Paragraph
Herein lies the explanation of the dependence of most of Morris’s,Paragraph
later chintzes and wallpapers on models of the sixteenth and seventeenth,Caption
"centuries, We are inclined today to over-rate the importance of this,",Paragraph
"It is sufficient to compare one of his most famous chintzes, the Honey-",Paragraph
"suckle of 1883 (PI. 8), with a specimen of pre-Morris design in textiles",Paragraph
"such as the shawl from the Great Exhibition (PI. 2), in order to recognize",Paragraph
at once the fundamental novelty of Morris’s designs. The contrast,Paragraph
between the two is not only one between inspiration and imitation;,Paragraph
"between valuable imitation inspired by fifteenth-century delicacy, and",Paragraph
bad imitation vulgarizing eighteenth-century licence; it is more.,Paragraph
"Morris’s design is clear and sober, the shawl of 1851 is a messy entwine-",Paragraph
ment of motifs. Its thoughtless concoction of stylization and realism is,Paragraph
opposed to Morris’s logical unity of composition and close study of,Paragraph
growth in nature. The designer of the shawl neglects the decorative law,Paragraph
"of the coherence of surfaces, while Morris without any loss of vitality",Paragraph
spreads out a flat pattern.,Paragraph
We get exactly the same result if we place Morris’s carpet side by,Paragraph
side with the carpet of the Exhibition. Again we find live understanding,Paragraph
"of decorative requirements as opposed to utter neglect of them, and",Paragraph
"again simplicity and economy as opposed to wasteful confusion, And",Paragraph
although it must certainly be admitted that in stained glass designed,Paragraph
by Morris’s firm there is more detail-realism than we would now approve,Paragraph
"of for ornamental purposes, it must not be forgotten that when Morris",Paragraph
"began, stained-glass windows were just illustrations with plenty of",Paragraph
"figures, buildings, and spatial recession, and with a large quantity of",Paragraph
colours and shades. His is the merit of having gone back to simple,Paragraph
"figures, simple attitudes, simple colours, ornamental backgrounds. His",Paragraph
Pre-Raphaelite friends and masters helped him in that. Their style in,Paragraph
painting differed in the same way from mid-Victorian genre-painting,Paragraph
as his from the style of 1851. And if Morris windows do not go further,Paragraph
"in decorative economy, that is due less to Morris than to Burne-Jones,",Paragraph
"who could not help remaining a painter, whereas Morris wanted him",Paragraph
to be nothing but a decorator.}°,Paragraph
The revival of decorative honesty in Morris’s designs counts for,Paragraph
more in the history of the Modern Movement than their connexion,Paragraph
"g. Dresser: Cruet set and tea-kettle, 1877-8.",Caption
with bygone styles. Morris the artist may in the end not have been able,Paragraph
to reach beyond the limitations of his century; Morris the man and,Paragraph
thinker did. This is the reason why his writings and lectures had to be,Paragraph
discussed in this book before his artistic achievements.,Paragraph
"’ The first effect of Morris’s teaching was that several young artists,",Paragraph
"architects, and amateurs decided to devote their lives to the crafts, What",Paragraph
"had been an inferior occupation for more than half a century, became",Paragraph
"once more a recognized task, There is no need to enumerate them all.",Paragraph

great English potter of his age; in glass Powell was foremost; in metal-,Paragraph
"work Benson; in the arts of the book, Emery Walker and Cobden-",Paragraph
"Sanderson, the founders of the Doves Press. It is extremely significant",Paragraph
that between 1880 and 1890 five societies for the promotion of artistic,Paragraph
craftsmanship were started: in 1882 Arthur H. Mackmurdo’s Century,Paragraph
"Guild (the term ‘Guild’ should be noticed), in 1884 the Art Workers’",Paragraph
"Guild, in the same year the Home Arts and Industries Association,",Paragraph
"particularly interested in rural crafts, in 1888 Ashbee’s Guild and School",Paragraph
"of Handicraft, and also in 1888 the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society.",Paragraph
Most of the members of these guilds and associations were a generation,Paragraph
"younger than Morris, but not all. De Morgan, for instance, was born in",Paragraph
"1839, L.F, Day in 1845, Arthur H. Mackmurdo in 1851. The work of",Caption
"these artists, if re-examined today, has remarkable surprises in store.",Paragraph
"Take for instance a cruet set and a tea-kettle (Pl.9), produced in 1877",Paragraph
and 1878 by Hukin & Heath’s of Birmingham to the designs of,Paragraph
"Christopher Dresser (1834-1904).'! Dresser, like Lewis Day, was a",Paragraph
professional designer for industrial production. His inspiration was no,Paragraph
"doubt the Cole circle. He lectured at South Kensington, travelled in",Paragraph
"Japan, and brought much Eastern art back to his London home. He",Paragraph
also designed for Clutha glass and Linthorpe pottery!” and wrote,Paragraph
"several books on the principles of design, sensible but not especially",Paragraph
"original, This makes the two works illustrated all the more astonishing.",Paragraph
"In comparison with the silver of the 1851 Exhibition, and actually with",Paragraph
"most designs for silver and plate done before 1900 or 1905, Dresser’s",Paragraph
simplicity and creative daring are likewise significant. Both cruet set and,Paragraph
"tea-kettle are in every detail reduced to fundamentals, as were Morris’s",Paragraph
own early designs. The base of the cruet set consists of six plain egg-,Paragraph
"shaped holders, lids and stoppers are unadorned, there are hardly any",Paragraph
"mouldings, and the handle is composed of straight lines-and an exact",Paragraph
"10. De Morgan: Plate, 1880s.",Caption
"semicircle, The tea-kettle is globular, legs and spout come out with an",Paragraph
"almost offensive directness, and the handle is again reduced to the",Paragraph
simplest of forms.,Paragraph
"If we now look at a plate with a gazelle (Pl. 10), made by De Morgan",Paragraph
at his Merton Works between 1882 and 1888 and now at the Victoria,Paragraph
"and Albert Museum in London, the same understanding of decorative",Paragraph
"fundamentals appears, only this time in terms of two instead of three",Paragraph
dimensions. There is of course inspiration from Morris and dependence,Paragraph
"on Persia, but the bold and ornamental draughtsmanship of the tree",Paragraph
behind the sharply outlined animal and the symbol of water behind the,Paragraph
fishes are remarkably original.,Paragraph
The same blend of originality and tradition which has proved to,Paragraph
secure life beyond its own period for Morris’s designs characterizes the,Paragraph
best in English domestic architecture during the same period. Compar-,Paragraph
able also was the attitude of opposition among the leading architects,Paragraph
against the accepted standards of design.,Paragraph
All through the development of secular architecture in the principal,Paragraph
"European countries from 1850 to the end of the century, the same",Paragraph
direction can be noticed. The high tide of the Gothic Revival (Houses,Paragraph
"of Parliament: Barry and Pugin, 1835-52) was passing about 1865,",Paragraph
though later and yet pure neo-medieval buildings are of course to be,Paragraph
"found in many places (Town Hall, Manchester: Waterhouse, 1868-77;",Caption

"coming to an end (Reform Club: Barry, designed 1837; Dresden",Caption

"In England the evolution followed precisely the same course; but,",Paragraph
since English architecture had been so different from Continental during,Paragraph

in England was something like this. The overcrowded Elizabethan and,Paragraph
Jacobean Mannerism was superseded in the seventeenth century by,Paragraph
"Inigo Jones’s, and then by Christopher Wren’s stately and dignified",Paragraph

classicism. This grand yet reserved style remained dominant through-,Paragraph

"intimate character. In this, since the Middle Ages, England had de-",Paragraph
"veloped an unobtrusive, dignified, and comfortable style of her own.",Paragraph
"After the accession of William of Orange, even royal palaces (Kensington",Paragraph

character.,Paragraph

"In 1859, Morris asked Philip Webb (1831-1915), his friend and",Paragraph

was built in a spirit contrary to that of the past century. As in his,Paragraph
"decorative designs, Morris refused any connexion with Italy and the",Paragraph
Baroque and aimed at something akin to the style of the Late Middle,Paragraph
Ages. Webb applied certain Gothic details such as pointed arches and,Paragraph
high-pitched roofs; he also adopted the irregularity of the fourteenth-,Paragraph
"and fifteenth-century domestic and especially monastic architecture,",Paragraph
but he never copied. He even admitted the sash-windows of William and,Paragraph
Mary and Queen Anne without ever being afraid of clashes between,Title
the various styles to which he went for inspiration. Red House as a,Paragraph

spacious looking and yet not in the least pretentious (Pl.11). This is,Paragraph
perhaps its most important feature. The architect does not imitate,Paragraph
palaces. In designing he thinks of a middle class comfortably off but not,Paragraph
tich. He shows the red brick of the facades without covering it with,Paragraph
"plaster as Neo-Classical rules prescribed, and takes the outside appear-",Paragraph

In town architecture the counterpart of Red House is the house,Paragraph
"at No. 1 Palace Green in Kensington, London, which Webb designed",Caption
in 1868 (Pl.13). It exhibits fearlessly two Queen Anne windows and,Paragraph
between them a brick pier of obvious Gothic derivation supporting an,Paragraph

entirely pre-Morris in spirit. The most characteristic examples are,Paragraph
"Leys Wood in Sussex (1869), and Grims Dyke near London (1872).",Paragraph

"However successtul this so-called Queen Anne Revival was, Norman",Paragraph
Shaw did not in the long run remain satisfied with it. There was yet,Paragraph
another change in his style - or rather the source of his style; for he,Paragraph
"remained to the end faithful to historicism as such, even if his was a",Paragraph
very cavalier treatment of historical precedent. It was in the late eighties,Paragraph
that he remembered what his former partner Eden Nesfield (1835-88),Paragraph
"had done as far back as 1870, and studied in earnest the style of the",Paragraph
smaller country and town house of the later seventeenth and early,Paragraph
"eighteenth centuries in England, not only for window motifs but for the",Paragraph
"whole of their plain, sensible, well-proportioned, unadorned brick",Paragraph
frontages. Nesfield’s Lodge at Kew Gardens was indeed built in 1866,Paragraph
"and has the short brick pilasters usual in England about 1660 or 1670,",Paragraph
a steep pyramid roof and dormer-windows with segmental pediments.,Caption
Nesfield’s Kinmel Park (Pl.16) was begun only in 1871 but probably,Paragraph
designed earlier. Its slender segment-headed sash-windows and pedi-,Paragraph
mented dormer-windows stand on their own. Shaw turned to Kinmel,Paragraph
"Park for belated inspiration, when he designed No. 170 Queen’s Gate,",Paragraph
"London in 1888 (Pl.17). This house, exceptional in Shaw’s cuvre,",Paragraph
started a fashion which reached its climax only in the twentieth century.,Paragraph
It comes indeed as near to the spirit of the new century as one could,Paragraph
"come without actually breaking with the past, and in this respect it was",Paragraph
more progressive than the work of any of Shaw’s contemporaries at,Paragraph
home and abroad.,Paragraph
Apart from Shaw and Webb only one other English architect must,Paragraph
"here be recorded, Edward Godwin (1833-86), more a designer than an",Paragraph
"architect. He was a friend of William Burges, architect of Neo-Gothic",Paragraph
"churches and secular buildings, and inventor of some fantastic decora~",Paragraph
tion to which we shall have to revert later. Godwin started with,Paragraph

alterations) in 1878.,Paragraph
"successful essays in the civic Gothic (Northampton Town Hall, 1861),",Paragraph

"rugs, a few Japanese prints, a few pieces of antique furniture. If",Paragraph
"Whistler some years later went in for bare walls, plain-coloured,",Paragraph
Godwin’s influence may well be assumed. In 1878 Godwin designed,Paragraph

than Shaw’s contemporary houses. Richardson’s use of shingling and,Paragraph
"of large-scale random rubble, of boulders, one is tempted to say, and of",Paragraph
"picturesque asymmetry shows as much originality as Shaw possessed,",Paragraph
and more vigour. His even more impressive power in the designing of,Paragraph
commercial structures will be mentioned later. Both his town and his,Paragraph
"country styles were at once widely imitated by good, bad, and indifferent",Paragraph
architects. Amongst his best followers was Stanford White (1853-1906),Paragraph
whose Newport Casino’ was built as early as 1881 (Pl.20). he same,Paragraph
qualities are here clearly visible as in the Stoughton house though per-,Paragraph
haps handled a little more elegantly.,Paragraph
"at. White: Germantown Cricket Club, Philadelphia, 1891.",Caption
"Stanford White, less elementary and less hard than Richardson,",Paragraph
could indeed take the same step which Shaw had taken between the,Paragraph
houses of 1875 and of 1888. Only in the case of White the new ideal of,Paragraph
simplicity was not expressed in terms of English Queen Anne but first,Paragraph
in terms of the Central Italian High Renaissance and then of American,Paragraph
Colonial. The examples are well enough known: The Villard houses on,Paragraph
"Madison Avenue, New York, of 1885 and the H.A.C. Taylor house in",Caption

Cézanne despised such a superficial approach. The women in his,Paragraph

mystery. Can they really rest on no more promising ground than Gray’s,Paragraph
Botany? Or can one dimly recognize behind them the cabbagey forms,Paragraph
of Gothic Revival foliage? Another look at Burges’s fireplace might be,Paragraph
"advisable."" By the time Sullivan designed the interiors of the Auditorium",Paragraph

We have already met him as a theorist. As an artist he began by,Paragraph
painting in the style of Barbizon and then of the Neo-Impressionists.,Paragraph

are filled with a tense energy that is quite unlike the luxurious grace of,Paragraph
"Horta’s lines. Behind Horta one can always feel nature, vegetable and",Paragraph
animal nature. Van de Velde’s design is rigidly abstract and — theoretically,Paragraph
at least - meant to illustrate the function of the object or part of the object,Paragraph
"to which it is attached. ‘Dynamographique’ is what he called it later,",Paragraph
and he defined his intent as ‘structurizing’. He postulates an ornamental,Paragraph

"works of about 1900 would hardly lead one to expect.'® And yet, at the",Paragraph
time when his fantastic interior of Haby’s barber shop in Berlin was,Paragraph
"new (1901), the public was greatly scandalized by the frank exposure of",Paragraph
"water pipes, gas pipes, and pipes for electric wiring. ‘You don’t wear",Paragraph
"your guts like a watch-chain across your waistcoat,’ was the comment of",Paragraph
Berliners upon this odd mixture of functionalism and Art Nouveau.,Paragraph
"In the chairs for Uccle, the functional side of van de Velde’s activities",Paragraph
is predominant. The unity of grace and energy in such objects inspired,Paragraph
E. de Goncourt to his excellent and prophetic term ‘Yachting Stvle’,Paragraph
which he coined when van de Velde’s works were first made known to,Paragraph
the Paris public. Van de Velde’s recognition was due to Samuel Bing,Paragraph
"(born 1838), an art dealer from Hamburg who had moved to Paris in",Paragraph

"in Figaro who wrote of ‘? Anglais victeux, la Juive morphinemane ou le",Paragraph
"Belge roublard, ou une agréable salade de ces trois poisons’. More serious",Paragraph
"adversaries warned designers against succumbing to the spell, and",Paragraph
pointed to the excellent commercial position which French industrial,Paragraph
art had attained by remaining faithful to eighteenth-century traditions.,Paragraph
Convinced friends of the new style emphasized the fact that several,Paragraph
French artists had already for some time worked independently on,Paragraph
"similar lines. Emile Gallé (1846-1904) in the art of glassmaking, and",Paragraph

did by means of abstract form. This contrast between van de Velde and,Paragraph

the fact that the Crystal Palace was re-erected in 1854 at Sydenham,Paragraph

"nest, a rat hole, or a railway station’, The opposition against this negative",Paragraph

reformers of design were in some other ways so close to Ruskin. The,Paragraph
voice of the circle in matters of iron architecture was Matthew Digby,Paragraph
"Wyatt, an inferior architect when compared with Pugin, an inferior",Paragraph
"writer when compared with Ruskin, but a highly intelligent critic. He",Paragraph
"wrote in the Journal of Design in 1851:*"" ‘It has become difficult to",Paragraph

it is impossible to disregard the fact that the building for the Exhibition,Paragraph
of 1851 is likely to accelerate the “consummation devoutly to be,Paragraph

Here more than anywhere one may feel inclined to allow the Cole,Paragraph
"circle a seat among the pioneers of twentieth-century design, and one",Paragraph
must make oneself remember how distressingly Wyatt’s performance,Title
"differs from his theory, to send him back to the mid nineteenth century",Paragraph
to which he belongs. Another somewhat similar case is that of Thomas,Paragraph
"Harris who built in the wildest, most nightmarish High Victorian style,",Paragraph
"yet wrote in 1862 that in the Crystal Palace ‘a new style of architecture,",Paragraph

1890. Mr Morrison has pointed out rightly that its fagades do not by,Paragraph

Concrete had been widely used by the Romans and was indeed their,Paragraph

The material was then lost and appears again only in the French building,Paragraph

The beginnings of the iron reinforcement of cement go back to a,Paragraph
"note in Loudon’s Encvelopaedia of Cottage, Farm, and Villa Architecture",Caption
"of 1832,38 where cement floors with an embedded lattice work of iron",Paragraph
"ribs are mentioned, and to a patent of 1844 for cement floors with",Paragraph

of 1856 speaking equally explicitly of the iron members as ‘iirants’ 5°,Paragraph
The next name after Coignet’s which must be remembered is that of,Paragraph
Joseph Monier who perfected flower-pots of reinforced concrete in,Paragraph
1867 and columns and beams of reinforced concrete in 1877. Con-,Caption
currently progress was made in England in shuttering for the pouring,Paragraph
of concrete. Norman Shaw’s name comes into the history of concrete,Paragraph
"too, although only very marginally; for the designs for partly concrete",Paragraph
cottages which he brought out in 1878 are of mass concrete not of,Paragraph
reinforced concrete.,Paragraph
"Reinforced concrete emerged to maturity in the same seventies, when",Paragraph
William E. Ward and Thaddeus Hyatt began to analyse and calculate,Paragraph
the properties of concrete and iron in their combination. A few years,Paragraph
"later the Germans, impressed by Monier’s experiments, followed suit,",Paragraph
"and the names of G.A.Wayss and Koenen, as manufacturer and",Paragraph
"engineer respectively, mark the start of concrete making and concrete",Paragraph
scholarship in the modern sense. They take us to the mid eighties.,Paragraph
Finally their scientific endeavours were paralleled and reinforced by,Paragraph
"the ingenuity and the showmanship of a great French enthusiast,",Paragraph
Francois Hennebique. It was Hennebique who replaced iron by steel,Paragraph
"77. De Baudot: St Jean de Montmartre, Paris, 1894-9.",Caption
"and introduced the bending of the steel reinforcements near the supports,",Paragraph
"His first patents date from 1892 and 1893, and his firm soon became",Paragraph
extremely prosperous. A spinning mill at Tourcoing by Hennebique,Caption
which was built in 1895 has as uncompromisingly functional a fagade,Paragraph
of exposed concrete framing with large glass surfaces between as any of,Paragraph
the buildings of the Chicago architects.,Paragraph
"Two years later concrete graduated, The date is that of Anatole de",Paragraph
Baudot’s church of St Jean de Montmartre (P1.77). Baudot was a pupil,Caption

"the use of iron for reinterpreting Gothic principles, Baudot used",Paragraph

cacies of Mackintosh and Le Corbusier. Between the completion of this,Paragraph
"building and the First World War, France remained the leader of the",Paragraph
development of concrete architecture.,Paragraph
One more remark is necessary before this account of engineering,Paragraph
"architecture can be closed. Ruskin, Morris, and their followers hated",Paragraph
"the machine and consequently the new steel and glass architecture,",Paragraph
"which, according to Ruskin, is ‘eternally separated from all good and",Paragraph
great things by a gulf which not all the tubular bridges nor engineering,Paragraph
of ten thousand nineteenth centuries cast into one great bronze-,Paragraph
"foreheaded century, will ever over-pass one inch of”.*!",Paragraph
Ruskin’s reasons for this frantic scorn were of a primarily aesthetic,Paragraph
"nature, those of Morris were entirely social. Morris was unable to",Paragraph
"appreciate the positive possibilities of the new materials, because he",Paragraph
was too intensely concerned with the negative consequences of the,Paragraph
Industrial Revolution. He saw only what had been destroyed: crafts-,Paragraph
manship and pleasurable work. But no new period in human civilization,Paragraph
has ever arisen without an initial phase in which a complete upheaval,Paragraph
of values took place; and such phases are not specially pleasant for,Paragraph
contemporaries.,Paragraph

"The engineers, on the other hand, were too absorbed in their thrilling",Paragraph
"discoveries to notice the social discontent accumulating around them,",Paragraph
"and to listen to Morris’s warning voice. Owing to this antagonism, the",Paragraph
two most important tendencies in nineteenth-century art and archi-,Paragraph
tecture could not join forces. The Arts and Crafts kept their retro-,Paragraph

The precipitate turned out to be Art Nouveau. So fascinated were,Paragraph
"the designers of Art Nouveau by any novelty, any demonstration against",Paragraph
the traditional and conventional that they could take the innovations,Paragraph
of the engineers in their stride. They were as much convinced of the,Paragraph
"necessity for devoted work in the crafts as Morris and his disciples, but",Paragraph
they were also capable of achieving an occasional synthesis between the,Paragraph

So it is essential ultimately to understand the style of the twentieth,Paragraph

Nineteen-fourteen,Title
WE must first return to English architecture and design. At the end of,Paragraph
"the eighties, as was shown, Morris was the leader in design, Norman",Paragraph
"Shaw in architecture. The deliberate break with tradition, which",Paragraph
characterized the style of Europe’s greatest painters about 1890 and the,Paragraph

English architect had ventured on a new style of an original and highly,Paragraph
"stimulating nature, before Art Nouveau had begun. This was C.F.",Paragraph
Annesley Voysey (1857-1941).! It has already been said that his designs,Paragraph
were a source of inspiration of Art Nouveau. Van de Velde told the,Paragraph
author of the revolutionizing effect of Voysey’s wallpapers on him and,Paragraph
his friends.* His words were: ‘It was as if Spring had come all of a,Paragraph
sudden.’ And indeed we have only to look at one of Voysey’s wallpapers,Paragraph
printed in the nineties (P1.78) and one of his somewhat later printed,Paragraph
"linens (Pl. 79), to see the great difference between him and Morris. Not",Paragraph
"that he aimed at novelty; his modifications and progressiveness, it",Paragraph
"would seem, were almost unconscious. Doctrines and hard-and-fast",Paragraph
rules were not his way. In the controversy between supporters of,Paragraph
"stylized and of naturalistic ornament, he did not take sides. For although,",Paragraph
"in an interview in 1893, he declared realism to be unsuitable for decora~",Paragraph
"tion, he was inclined to admit plants and beasts in patterns on condition",Paragraph
that they be ‘reduced to mere symbols’. This may seem in accord with,Paragraph
"Morris, but there is a distinctly new note in Voysey’s urgent desire to",Paragraph
‘live and work in the present’.?,Paragraph
"So he arrives at patterns which are happily near to nature, and at the",Paragraph

Tt is Known that everywhere in English cultural life a longing for,Paragraph
fresh air and gaiety expressed itself at the end of Queen Victoria’s reign.,Paragraph
The success of Liberty’s about 1890 depended largely on their Eastern,Paragraph
silks in delicate shades and their other Chinese imports. The history of,Paragraph
the part played by China and Japan in European art since 1860 has not,Paragraph
yet been written. It would be very interesting to show the influence of,Paragraph
"the East appearing here in a loose technique of painting, there in the",Paragraph
"greatest finesse of line and contours, there again in clear, soft, and pure",Paragraph
"colour, and in yet other works in flat pattern effects. Owing to the",Paragraph
unique synthesis of ornamental and ‘Impressionist’ qualities in Eastern,Paragraph
"art, both the Impressionists and, at the opposite pole, the originators",Paragraph
"of Art Nouveau, could use what Japanese woodcuts and Chinese pottery",Paragraph
had to teach them. The Impressionist went to Japan for a lightness that,Paragraph
"he took for plein air, for a sketchy handling of the brush, and a flatness",Paragraph
"of surfaces, which he wrongly interpreted as meaning the shadelessness",Paragraph
"of strong sunlight. His adversary, more justly, stressed the high degree",Paragraph
of stylization in every line drawn and every surface decorated by an,Paragraph
Eastern artist. That is why Japanese woodcuts can appear in the back-,Paragraph
grounds of Manet’s Zola and Degas’s Tissot as well as van Gogh’s Pére,Paragraph
Tanguy and Ensor’s Skeleton Studying Eastern Paintings.’ The case of,Paragraph
Whistler is especially instructive; for it proves that in the same painter,Paragraph
at the same time both aspects of the Eastern style might be reflected.,Paragraph
"The influence of Eastern colour, Eastern delicacy, and Eastern com-",Paragraph
position on his yet so clearly Impressionist portraits is evident and has,Paragraph
no need of the Chinese costume in the Princesse du Pays de la Porcelaine,Caption
"to stress it, At the same time, however, Whistler could make this same",Paragraph
"picture the chief accent of a room decorated in a style which, although",Paragraph
not free from traces of Historicism obviously pointed forward to Art,Paragraph
Nouveau.® Moreover Whistler pleaded for rooms with completely plain,Paragraph
walls in light colours. In this he followed a lead given by his friend,Paragraph
Edward Godwin whose house at Bristol has been mentioned in a pre-,Paragraph
vious chapter because of the plain walls and bare floors of its rooms and,Paragraph
". because of its Japanese prints. The date of these interiors, 1862, is",Paragraph
"remarkably early. Whistler’s house in Tite Street, Chelsea, built for",Caption
"him by Godwin, had white and rich yellow walls, Japanese matting on",Paragraph
"the floors, plain curtains in straight folds, some pieces of Chinese",Paragraph
"porcelain, and a few simply framed pictures and etchings.” In trying to",Paragraph
"imagine such rooms, we feel qurselves at once in the early years of the",Paragraph
"twentieth century, no longer in the days of Morris and Ruskin. And",Paragraph
"yet, in theory (if that is not too heavy an expression for his casual",Paragraph
"apergus) and in technique, Whistler was as complete an Impressionist",Paragraph
"as anybody, and therefore an object of passionate hatred to those who",Paragraph
worked for a new outlook on life and art.? There is no need to go again,Paragraph
"into that unpleasant case, Whistler versus Ruskin. Morris was bound",Paragraph
"to follow Ruskin.* This was a matter of principle primarily, but also a",Paragraph
matter of taste. The man who regarded Burne-Jones as the great living,Paragraph
painter of the Late Victorian era could certainly not appreciate Whistler’s,Paragraph
superficial (truly superficial) pictorial impressions.,Paragraph
One would expect to find the same contrast between the disciples of,Paragraph
the Arts and Crafts and the Impressionists as between Morris and,Paragraph
"Whistler. However, it is a fact which has already been mentioned in",Paragraph
"connexion with the exhibitions of Les Vingt, that on the Continent the",Paragraph
"introduction of Impressionism, and of the new decorative style in both",Paragraph
"its forms, as Art and Crafts and as Art Nouveau, took place concurrently",Paragraph
"and were both due to the same persons. Meier-Graefe, who was one of",Paragraph
"the first to discover van de Velde, wrote books on Renoir and Degas,",Paragraph
and also on van Gogh and Gauguin. And even today most people inter-,Paragraph
ested in art are unaware of the irreconcilable difference between,Paragraph
Impressionism as a doctrine and the doctrine of Morris and all his,Title
"followers. Yet, it is obvious that the antithesis, Impressionism versus",Paragraph
"Arts and Crafts, is but the artistic expression of a far more compre-",Paragraph
hensive cultural antithesis between twe generations. On the one side,Paragraph
there is a conception of art as a rapid rendering of momentary surface,Paragraph
"effects, on the other as an expression of what is final and essential; on",Paragraph
"the one side there is the philosophy of Art for Art’s sake, on the other",Paragraph
a renewed faith in a social message of art. The Impressionists stand for,Paragraph
"the exquisite luxuries of late-nineteenth-century Paris, the Arts and",Paragraph
Crafts for ‘roughing it’ in the spirit of that Youth Movement which is,Paragraph
"so significant of the years around 1900 and after, and can be traced in",Paragraph
Bergson as much as in the foundation of the first ‘modern’ public,Paragraph
schools in England: Abbotsholme (1889) and Bedales (1892).,Paragraph
"In design, Voysey is the outstanding but by no means the only",Paragraph
representative of this new joie de vivre. Some of Crane’s late wallpapers,Paragraph
also depart from Morris’s heaviness. Frank Brangwyn’s designs for,Paragraph
"textiles are another example, As long as Continental architects believed",Paragraph
"in Art Nouveau, it was chiefly English designs for wallpapers, printed",Paragraph
"linens, chintzes, and so on which appealed to them. As soon as the new",Paragraph
"desire for Sachlichkeit spread, all the pioneer work done by the English",Paragraph
architects and artists in the shaping (not the decoration) of objects,Paragraph
became topical. It must have been a delightful surprise to those who -,Paragraph
"like Muthesius - came to England, weary not only of Victorian stuffiness",Paragraph
"but also of the licence of Art Nouveau, to see a toast rack or a cruet set",Paragraph
designed by Voysey (Pl. 80). The refreshing simplicity of his wallpapers,Paragraph
is also the keynote of these small things of everyday use. Their charm,Paragraph
lies solely in the cleanness and gracefulness of their shapes.,Paragraph
Of particular importance for the coming Modern Movement was the,Paragraph
expression of this new spirit in furnishing. The entrance hall of Voysey’s,Caption
"house, The Orchard, Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, of 1900 can serve",Caption
"as an example (P].8r), with its lightness; the woodwork painted white,",Paragraph
"a pure intense blue for the tiles, unmitigated contrasts of uprights",Paragraph
"and horizontals, especially in the screen to the staircase (a motif which",Paragraph
"was for a time to become eminently popular), and furniture of bold,",Paragraph
"direct, if a little outré forms.",Paragraph
There is one more thing which must be said about Voysey and which,Paragraph
"places him further from Morris and close to us. He was a designer, not",Paragraph
"a craftsman. He could not in fact, so he told the author, work in any",Paragraph
"craft. Ernest Gimson (1864-1920),® the greatest of the English artist-",Paragraph
"craftsmen, was, as a matter of fact, in not too different a position,",Paragraph
"although not many people realize it. He had been trained, it is true, in",Paragraph
"craftsmanship, but his famous works of cabinetmaking, metal-work,",Paragraph
and so on are only designed and not made by him. The chairs shown,Paragraph
"here (PI. 82) give an impression of his honesty, his feeling for the nature",Paragraph
"of wood, and his unrevolutionary spirit. Few of his works have this",Paragraph
"superb simplicity. As a rule, Gimson was more responsive to English",Paragraph
tradition and did not despise the use of forms invented in the past.,Paragraph
On a really commercial basis good progressive furniture was at the,Paragraph
same time made by Sir Antbrose Heal (1872-1959). The firm of,Paragraph
"Heal & Son had been producing Victorian furniture, until Ambrose",Paragraph
Heal changed its course. A wardrobe which Heal’s showed at the Paris,Paragraph
Exhibition of 1900 (P1.83) has the same brightness which we found in,Paragraph
Voysey’s wallpapers. Plain surfaces of slightly fumed and waxed oak,Caption
contrast with small panels decorated in pewter and ebony. There are no,Paragraph
long curves; the patterns are composed of rectangles and gracefully-,Paragraph
drawn little flowers. The close atmosphere of medievalism has vanished.,Paragraph
"Living amongst such objects, we breathe a fresher air.",Paragraph
Even more important historically than such exhibition pieces of,Paragraph
"Heal’s was their production for the ordinary market. In 1898, the first",Paragraph
catalogue of Heal’s Plain Oak Furniture came out and started the revival,Paragraph
of the simple wooden bedstead in England.'° For more than twenty,Paragraph
years these pleasant bedsteads were popular in the English furniture,Paragraph
"trade, until they were swept away by misguided supporters of modern-",Paragraph
istic forms.,Paragraph
Exactly the same contrast between 1890 and 1900 as in cabinet-,Paragraph
making is to be found in English printing. Morris’s Kelmscott Press -,Paragraph
founded in 1890 - produced pages the effect of which depends largely,Paragraph
on their exquisite medievalist decoration. Cobden-Sanderson’s and,Paragraph
Emery Walker’s Doves Press - founded in 1900 and mentioned in this,Paragraph
book on page 35 - secured for the plain unadorned type face its place,Caption
"in modern book production,",Paragraph
"As far as English architecture is concerned, the historical position is",Paragraph
"not quite so simple as in applicd art. It has been pointed out that, by",Paragraph
"1890, Norman Shaw had attained a style which, based on Queen Anne,",Paragraph
was so ‘modern’ in character and so perfectly suited to English needs,Paragraph
"84. Mackmurdo: 8 Private Road, Enfield, c. 1883.",Caption
"and taste that it could hardly be improved on, as long as no open break",Paragraph
with tradition was attempted. The earliest and most remarkable cases,Paragraph
of independence ~ earlier in fact than that of Horta - are afforded by,Paragraph
some of the early architectural works of Mackmurdo and Voysey.,Paragraph
"Mackmurdo’s house, 8 Private Road, Enfield (P1.84) built about 1883",Caption
is of a surprisingly free carriage. The flat roof and the few horizontal,Paragraph
windows of the upper floor are particularly noteworthy. Although much,Paragraph
"more orderly it forms in its independence of approach a parallel, the",Paragraph
"only European parallel, to Godwin’s house of 1878 for Whistler. In",Paragraph
"1882 Mackmurdo founded the Century Guild, the first of all those",Paragraph
groups of artist-craftsmen-designers who followed the teaching of,Paragraph
William Morris. Of 1883 was his amazing title page which started Art,Paragraph
"Nouveau on its way. In 1886 Mackmurdo put up the stand, for the",Paragraph
"products of his guild at an exhibition at Liverpool, which is illustrated",Paragraph
in Plate 85. The attenuated shafts with their excessive top cornices,Caption
instead of capitals and the repetition of these odd forms on top of the,Paragraph
"85. Mackmurdo: Exhibition stand, Liverpool,",Caption
1886.,Paragraph
"fascia board are even more original, and started a fashion, when Voysey",Paragraph
and then several others took them up. Of Mackmurdo’s strong influence,Paragraph
on Voysey there can be no doubt. He himself said to the author that,Paragraph
when he was very young Mackmurdo had impressed him even more,Paragraph
"than Morris, Yet the first house which Voysey built, the one in The",Paragraph
"Parade at Norman Shaw’s garden suburb, Bedford Park near London",Caption
"(P1,86), is amazingly independent, considering the date, 1891. The",Paragraph
arrangement of the windows is particularly striking. But whereas this,Paragraph
kind of free grouping also prevails in the works of Norman Shaw and,Paragraph
"his school, the whiteness of the walls was an open protest against the",Paragraph
"surrounding red brick of Shaw’s garden suburb, The tower-like tallness",Paragraph
of the house also and the skipping rhythm of bare walls and horizontal,Paragraph
window openings were innovations introduced deliberately and not,Paragraph
without a youthful sense of mischief.,Paragraph
"However, Voysey did not go on in that direction, or else he would have",Paragraph
developed into an architect of Art Nouveau. Already in the tiny studio,Paragraph
"86. Voysey: House in Bedford Park, near London,",Caption

"although the detail is again remarkably novel, above all the massive",Paragraph
"chimney, the batter of the buttresses on the right and also the ironwork",Paragraph
"in front (obviously inspired by Mackmurdo’s woodwork of 1886),",Paragraph
"When Voysey began to get commissions for houses in the country,",Paragraph
"his appreciation of English traditions was decisively strengthened.""!",Paragraph
"A man of intense feeling for nature, as his designs prove him to have",Paragraph
"been, he could not but think of his houses in conjunction with the sur-",Paragraph
"rounding countryside, and so shapes offered themselves which were",Paragraph
more akin to the English manor house and cottage of the past than to,Paragraph
those he had evolved in London. His country-house practice began in the,Paragraph
early nineties and by 1900 had assumed very large dimensions. He never,Paragraph
"built a church, never a public building, and only once a small warehouse.",Paragraph
"87. Voysey: Studio, St Dunstan’s Road, West Kensington, London, 1891.",Caption
"Perrycroft, Colwall, Malvern Hills, dates from 1893 (P1.88). It is",Caption
typical of Voysey’s ideas of what a country house should be like. In spite,Paragraph
of such strikingly modern features as the consistently horizontal,Paragraph
"fenestration and the massive block shapes of the chimney-stacks, it is",Paragraph
"nowhere demonstratively anti-traditional, and it fits perfectly with its",Paragraph
natural surroundings (a garden was planned and planted together with,Paragraph
the house) and the architectural character of the country.,Paragraph
"This is even more evident in another building, the house erected for",Paragraph
"Canon L.Grane at Shackleford in Surrey, in 1897 (P1.89). Today it is",Paragraph
"not easy to appreciate the candour and simplicity of its fagade. For, in",Paragraph
"Britain at least, it has become too much of a standard example ineptly",Paragraph
imitated by hundreds of speculative builders all along the arterial roads,Paragraph
"and all over the suburbs. However, from the historian’s point of view,",Paragraph
it remains no small feat to have created the pattern for the vast majority,Paragraph
"88. Voysey: Perrycroft, Colwall, Malvern Hills, 1893.",Caption
"89. ° Voysey: House at Shackleford, Surrey, 1897.",Caption
of buildings carried out over a period of thirty years and more. What,Paragraph
"was not copied from Voysey, needless to say, was what impresses us",Paragraph
today as his most progressive motifs - the long- drawn-out window,Paragraph
"strips and the completely bare triangles of the gables, broken only in",Paragraph
one place by a charmingly tiny and just a trifle precious window.,Paragraph
This introduction of an occasional effect of Art Nouveau piquancy,Paragraph
helps a great deal to lighten the otherwise puritan honesty of many of,Paragraph
Voysey’s houses. Thus for instance in the lodge of Merishanger on the,Paragraph
"Hog’s Back near Guildford, Surrey, designed in 1896 (PI. 90), the typical",Paragraph
Voysey buttresses and far projecting caves carry a very flat curved,Paragraph
"cupola with a spirelet, needle-thin and ending in a weather-vane. In the",Caption
"same way in one of his most successful country houses, Broadleys on",Paragraph
Lake Windermere (Pl.91) of 1898 the eaves cornice is supported once,Paragraph
again by thin iron brackets and their delicacy adds a touch of lightness,Paragraph
to the whole front.,Paragraph
"But such effects are only a litde light relief in what is otherwise sound,",Paragraph
"balanced, vigorous design without any tendency to demonstrative",Paragraph
novelty. That is what makes the water front of Broadleys so impressive.,Paragraph
"Here, one sees clearly, was a mind equally averse to the picturesque",Paragraph
"go. Voysey: Lodge and stables, Merishanger, near Guildford, Surrey, 1896.",Caption
tricks of the Shaw school and the preciousness of Art Nouveau. From,Paragraph
"this centre bay with its completely unmoulded mullions and transoms,",Paragraph
"from these windows cut clean and sheer into the wall, access to the",Paragraph
"architectural style of today could have been direct, more direct probably",Paragraph
than from the designs of those few in England who in the late nineties,Paragraph
appeared more revolutionary than Voysey. Whom should one count,Paragraph
amongst them? Maybe Baillie Scott (1865-1945) who started a litde,Paragraph
"later than Voysey and very much under his influence,!? and C.R. Ashbee,",Paragraph
whose writings and social activities have been mentioned before and,Paragraph
"whose most original houses, in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London were",Paragraph
designed as early as 1899.!? Even more remarkable historically is,Paragraph
"the Mary Ward Settlement in Tavistock Place, London (Pl. 92), built",Caption
in 1895 by Dunbar Smith (1866-1933) and Cecil Brewer (1871-1918).,Paragraph
Its relation to Norman Shaw (Venetian window) as well as to Voysey,Paragraph
(top parts of the projecting wings) is evident. The rhythm of the blocks,Paragraph
"on the other hand, the proportions of the recessed centre part with its",Paragraph
"91. Voysey: Broadleys on Lake Windermere, 1898.",Caption
"92. Smith and Brewer: Mary Ward Settlement, Tavistock Place, London, 1895.",Caption
"¥ a,",Paragraph
"93. Townsend: Whitechapel Art Gallery,",Caption
"London, 1897-9.",Caption
"blank brick wall and the high bare cornice, the wide projection of the",Paragraph
"roofs, all point distinctly forward to the style of today, and the asym-",Paragraph
metrically projecting porch is freer and more ‘organic’ in treatment,Paragraph
than Voysey ever wanted to be.,Paragraph
This particular feature in its turn must have impressed the older,Paragraph
"C. Harrison Townsend (1852~1928) whose principal work, the White-",Paragraph
"chapel Art Gallery, London, dates from 1897-9 (P1.93). But Townsend’s",Caption
style is of more complex origins. The deliberate lack of symmetry,Paragraph
"between ground floor and upper floor, as well as the long row of sur-",Paragraph
"prisingly low windows and the leaf ornament of the friezes, ultimately",Paragraph
"point no doubt to Voysey, but the heavy arch above the entrance must",Paragraph
reflect some knowledge on Townsend’s part of what Richardson had,Paragraph
"94. Townsend: Horniman Museum, London,",Caption
1900-1902.,Paragraph
done in America for twenty years and more.!? If this assumption is,Paragraph
"correct, we have here the first case of American influence on England,",Paragraph
The two flat friezes above the row of windows also conjure up some,Paragraph
"memories of, say, Richardson’s Brattle Square Church in Boston of",Caption
"1870-72, and the American connexion became more distinct with",Paragraph
"Townsend’s next building, the Horniman Museum in South London",Caption
of 1900~1902 (Pl.94). The robust square tower with its rounded corners,Paragraph
and stumpy top is utterly different from the elegant spirelets which,Paragraph
Voysey and his imitators adored so much. Townsend’s designs during,Paragraph
"these years, in spite of all that it might be possible to say about sources in",Paragraph
"England and abroad, are without question the most remarkable example of",Paragraph
a reckless repudiation of tradition among English architects of the time.,Paragraph
"Among English, not among British architects. For in Glasgow there",Paragraph
worked during these very years a group of artists as original and as,Paragraph
"imaginative as any in Europe. In painting, the Glasgow Boys, Guthrie,",Paragraph
"E.A. Walton, Lavery, Henry, Hornel, and so on are well enough known.",Paragraph
Their first exhibition abroad impressed Europe considerably. But in,Paragraph
design and decoration the first appearance of the Glasgow school at an,Paragraph
exhibition in Vienna in 1900 was a revelation.,Paragraph
The centre of the group was Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868-,Paragraph
1928) with his wife Margaret Macdonald and her sister Mrs McNair. *,Paragraph
"In dealing with him, we are able at last to link up the development in",Paragraph
England with the main tendency of Continental architecture in the,Paragraph
"nineties, with Art Nouveau. Before he was twenty-eight, Mackintosh",Paragraph
"was chosen to design the new building for the Glasgow School of Art,",Paragraph
a remarkably bold choice due largely to the principal Francis H.,Paragraph
Newbery. The designs date from 1897; the first part of the building,Paragraph
was completed in 1899 (Pl.95). Not a single feature here is derived from,Paragraph
"period styles. The fagade is of a strongly personal character and, in",Paragraph
"many ways, leads on to the twentieth century, although the entrance",Paragraph
bay with balcony and short turret is deliberately fantastical and not un-,Paragraph
"like Townsend’s contemporary work, But the rest of the front is ex-",Paragraph
"tremely simple, almost austere in its bold uniform fenestration. In the",Paragraph
horizontal windows to the offices on the ground floor and the high studio,Caption
"windows on the upper floor, no curves are admitted; unbroken upright",Paragraph
"lines prevail even in the railing in front of the building, counteracted",Paragraph
only by a few lighter and more playful Art Nouveau ornaments at the,Paragraph
top. The same contrast exists between the rigidity of the upper-floor,Paragraph
"windows and the strange metal stalks at their base, functionally justified",Paragraph
"for putting planks on to facilitate window cleaning. However, be that",Paragraph
"as it may, this row of metal lines reveals one of Mackintosh’s principal",Paragraph
sources and at the same time one of his most characteristic qualities.,Paragraph
"The source, particularly telling in the strange balls at the top of the",Paragraph
"stalks, with their intertwined tentacles of iron, is clearly the Celtic and",Paragraph
"Viking art of Britain, as it became familiar beyond the circles of scholars",Paragraph
just at this time.’* The quality equally eloquent in the balls and the,Paragraph

"of the Glasgow School of Art, which forms the centre room of the west",Paragraph

aisles and galleries around three sides is so enriched that the resulting,Paragraph
impression is an overwhelmingly full polyphony of abstract form. The,Paragraph

of the few true forerunners of the most ingenious juggler with space,Paragraph
now alive: Le Corbusier. Le Corbusier once confessed that his desire in,Paragraph
building is to create poetry. Mackintosh’s attitude is very similar.,Paragraph
"Building in his hands becomes an abstract art, both musical and",Paragraph
mathematical.,Paragraph
The facade of the west wing of the art school is an instance of this.,Paragraph
Here the abstract artist is primarily concerned with the shaping of,Paragraph
"volume and not of space, of solids, not of voids (P1.98). The aesthetic",Paragraph
"value of the straight, slender shafts into which the windows are inserted",Paragraph
"is entirely independent of their function, The contrasts between fret-",Paragraph
"work and solid ashlar, and between the menacing bareness on the left",Paragraph
"and the complex polyphony on the right, are also effects more com-",Paragraph
parable to abstract relief than to buildings of Voysey’s kind.,Paragraph
A glance at the earlier and the later part of the art school reveals the,Paragraph

development of Mackintosh’s taste between 1897 and 1907. Delicate,Paragraph
metal ornament of linear appeal is no longer used. A squareness and,Paragraph
"robustness prevail which come as a surprise. They are, it seems certain,",Paragraph
Mackintosh’s way of admitting national tradition. His links with the,Paragraph
Scottish baronial past are perhaps more evident in his country houses,Paragraph
than in a public building such as the School of Art. If we look at the,Paragraph

of traditional elements with a remarkable fearlessness in the functional,Paragraph
"distribution of the windows and the weird harshness of its narrow,",Paragraph
"angular, upright forms. From here a direct way leads to that peculiar",Paragraph
and short-lived Expressionism in Continental and especially Dutch,Paragraph
architecture which for a while held up the progress of the main stream,Paragraph
of modern architecture about 1920.'7 Whether the Dutch architects,Caption
had actually taken notice of Mackintosh’s later buildings is not certain.,Paragraph
Their main source in any case was not foreign. It was H.P. Berlage,Paragraph
"(1856-1934). Berlage, regarded in Holland as of greater European",Paragraph
"significance than appears convincing, is essentially a counterpart to",Paragraph
"Voysey rather than to Mackintosh, that is, essentially a believer in the",Paragraph
possibilities of developing native traditions towards modern goals. His,Paragraph
point of departure was the brick architecture of the Dutch Middle Ages,Paragraph
"100. Berlage: House, 42-4 Oude Scheveningsche Weg, The Hague, 1898.",Caption
Stair well.,Paragraph
"and a faith in craftsmanship. That gives his most famous building, the",Paragraph
"Exchange in Amsterdam, begun in 1898, its solid, sane, trustworthy",Paragraph
"character. Yet inside it, and, even more, the house Nos. 42-4 Oude",Paragraph
"Scheveningsche Weg at The Hague (PI.100), there is curious, sharp,",Paragraph

"the period under discussion in this book, made a whole big facade out",Paragraph
"of these Expressionist motifs of Berlage, scattering his fundamental",Paragraph
soundness to the winds. Here architectural Expressionism is attained,Paragraph
five or teu years earlier than anywhere else. The Scheepvaarthuis on,Paragraph
"the one hand, Gaudi’s late works on the other, are the links between",Paragraph
Art Nouveau and Expressionism.,Paragraph
"However, while this may be the connexion between late Mackintosh",Paragraph
"101. Mackintosh: Cranston Tearoom, Buchanan",Caption
"Street, Glasgow, 1897-8.",Caption
"and the Continent, that between early Mackintosh and one particular",Paragraph
"Continental country, Austria, is of much greater historical interest and,",Paragraph
"because it also raises a somewhat intricate question, it demands a rather",Paragraph
more detailed discussion. The obvious similarity between Mackintosh’s,Paragraph
earliest interior designs - or one should rather say the interior designs,Paragraph
of Mackintosh and Margaret Macdonald — and the style of the Viennese,Paragraph
"Sezession, has often been commented on. The Cranston Tearoom in",Paragraph
Buchanan Street of 1897-8 (Pl. 101) should be studied in this con-,Paragraph
nexion — incidentally the first monument of the British tearoom move-,Paragraph
"ment, a movement, in its opposition to the snugness and stuffiness of",Paragraph
"the pub, again typical of the new desire for health and daintiness.",Paragraph
In the Buchanan Street tearoom the walls are decorated with the same,Paragraph
long and graceful lines and the same excessively slim figures which we,Paragraph
find in the works of Klimt and his followers. But the tearoom dates from,Paragraph
"102, Klimt: Tragedy, 1897.",Caption
"1897, and in that year, Klimt’s manner was still dependent on that of",Paragraph
"the earlier draughtsmen of Art’ Nouveau (Pl.102). One year later, in",Paragraph
"1898, when the Sezession started their periodical Ver Sacrum, its pages",Paragraph
were decorated in a style strikingly similar to Mackintosh’s. As the,Paragraph
"Studio had published some designs for the Cranston Tearoom in 1897,",Paragraph
one can safely conclude that the change of taste in the artists of the,Paragraph
Sezession was at least partly caused by impressions received from,Paragraph
Mackintosh’s work.!® This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that in,Paragraph
1900 the Sezession in Vienna chose to invite Mackintosh and his group,Paragraph
"to show work at their annual exhibition in Vienna, and in 1901, as a",Paragraph
"result of this, Mackintosh furnished and decorated the Music Room for",Paragraph
"Fritz Warndorfer who, two years later, gave the money for the founda-",Paragraph
"tion of the Wiener Werkstitte. The motifs of the music room were,",Paragraph
"incidentally, taken from Maeterlinck’s Sep: Princesses. What was so",Paragraph
thrilling to the artists of Vienna in Mackintosh’s style has been formu-,Paragraph
lated very well by Ahlers-Hestermann: ‘Here was indeed the oddest,Paragraph
"mixture of puritanically severe forms designed for use, with a truly",Paragraph
lyrical evaporation of all interest in usefulness. These rooms were like,Paragraph
"dreams, narrow panels, grey silk, very very slender wooden shafts -",Paragraph
verticals everywhere. Little cupboards of rectangular shape and with,Paragraph
"far projecting top cornices, smooth, not of visible frame-and-panel",Caption
"construction; straight, white, and serious-looking, as if they were young",Paragraph
girls ready to go to their first Holy Communion — and yet not really; for,Paragraph
"somewhere there was a piece of decoration like a gem, never interfering",Paragraph
"with the contour, lines of hesitant elegance, like a faint distant echo of",Paragraph
"van de Velde. The fascination of these proportions, the aristocratically",Paragraph
"effortless certainty with which an ornament of enamel, coloured glass,",Paragraph
"semi-precious stone, beaten metal was placed, fascinated the artists of",Paragraph
Vienna who were already a little bored with the eternal solid goodness,Paragraph
"of English interiors. Here was mysticism and asceticism, though by no",Paragraph
"means in a Christian sense, but with much of a scent of heliotrope, with",Paragraph
well-manicured hands and a delicate sensuousness. . . . As against the,Paragraph
"former overcrowding, there was hardly anything in these rooms, except",Paragraph
"that, say, two straight chairs, with backs as tall as a man, stood on a",Paragraph
white carpet and looked silently and spectrally at each other across a,Paragraph
little table . . . “Chambres garnies pour belles dmes” is what Meier-,Paragraph
Graefe wrote.’,Paragraph
Ideal evidence of these intentions was the house which Mackintosh,Paragraph
designed for a competition held by the German publisher Koch in 1901,Caption
(Pl.103). Here everything can be seen that Ahlers-Hestermann is,Paragraph
talking about and it can also be seen clearly enough that Mackintosh’s,Paragraph
"sources are Voysey, Beardsley, Toorop.’® This synthesis of their style",Paragraph
was the legacy of Britain to the coming Modern Movement. No other,Paragraph
British contribution to European architecture before the First World,Title
War carries enough weight to be discussed here.?° For various reasons,Paragraph
England forfeited her leadership in the shaping of the new style just,Paragraph
"about 1900, that is, at the very moment when the work of all the pioneers",Paragraph
began to converge into one universal movement. One reason was given,Paragraph
in Chapter 1:?! the levelling tendency of the coming mass movement —,Paragraph
and a true architectural style zs for every man — was too much against,Paragraph
the grain of the English character. A similar antipathy prevented the,Paragraph
ruthless scrapping of traditions which was essential to the achievement,Paragraph
"of a style fitting our century. So, at the very moment when Continental",Paragraph
architects discovered the elements of a genuine style for the future in,Paragraph
"English building and English crafts, England herself receded into an",Paragraph
"eclectic Neo-Classicism, with hardly any bearing on present-day prob-",Paragraph
lems and needs. For country houses and town houses Neo-Georgian,Caption

tendency at its most demonstrative.,Paragraph
The contention that the sudden fall in the European importance of,Paragraph
English architecture really took place shortly after 1900 is also confirmed,Paragraph
by the development of town planning. England was ahead during the,Paragraph

The idea of the independent garden city was put forward by Ebenezer,Paragraph
Howard in his famous book Tomorrow: a Peaceful Path to Real Reform,Paragraph
(1898). It was taken up by the founders of Letchworth. The plan of this,Paragraph
garden city (begun in 1904) was due to Raymond Unwin and Barry,Paragraph
Parker. The same architects were responsible for the layout of the,Paragraph
Hampstead Garden Suburb (1907).,Caption
These English estates strongly influenced the Continent. Krupp’s,Paragraph
started its first workers’ estate in 1891. The first independent garden,Paragraph

planning whole urban areas that occupied the minds of German town,Paragraph
planners between 1900 and the First World War.,Paragraph
The history of town planning from 1850 to 1914 runs strikingly,Paragraph
parallel to that of contemporary architecture and decoration. Of the,Paragraph
two biggest tasks that were put to architects during the third quarter of,Paragraph
"the century, the Viennese Ringstrasse is a gorgeous chain of individual",Paragraph
"buildings entirely or almost entirely unrelated to each other, whereas",Paragraph
Haussmann’s memorable opening up of large boulevards all through,Paragraph
the centre of Paris is certainly much more architectural in that spatial,Paragraph
"values are not neglected for those of volume. However, in Paris as well",Paragraph
"as in Vienna, the social questions of slum clearance and rehousing re-",Paragraph
"mained untouched, and the same may be said of all town planning in",Paragraph
other European and American cities. Neither did the new tendencies,Paragraph

"against the hollow grandeur of Neo-Baroque squares and roads, and",Paragraph
"proposed a freer, more picturesque planning on medieval lines. Both",Paragraph
Sitte and Burnham still thought in terms of individual pieces of planned,Paragraph
development.,Paragraph
It has been shown that the interpretation of town planning not only,Paragraph
as a display of civic power but as planning for the welfare and comfort,Paragraph
of the whole population originated in England and remained confined,Paragraph
"to England for well over a decade, But, as soon as planning was applied",Paragraph
"to areas larger than the garden estate of a firm, municipal initiative had",Paragraph

witness in Germany seems to be the flat designed by R.A. Schréder,Paragraph
"(1878-1962), a poet and decorator and a founder of the Insel Verlag,",Paragraph
"for his cousin Alfred Walter von Heymel (1878-1914), also a poet",Paragraph
and also a founder of the Insel Verlag. The flat was in Berlin and,Paragraph
dates from 1899 (Pl.131).*! Here for the first time — even if perhaps,Paragraph
not without some inspiration from the hieratic stiffness of some,Paragraph
"Mackintosh furniture - are chairs without curves, and walls, ceilings,",Paragraph
"and fireplaces divided into simple rectangular geometric patterns,",Paragraph
In Behrens’s buildings from 1904 onwards the same new somewhat,Paragraph
classicist spirit is expressed in the exteriors. Take for instance the Art,Paragraph

and the curved cornice have disappeared. The centrepiece and the outer,Paragraph
pavilions have roofs of pyramidal form - a motif incidentally taken,Paragraph
over by Olbrich in his exhibition buildings at Darmstadt in 1907-8,Caption
(Pl. 125) - the rest of the building has flat roofs. Walls without windows,Paragraph
are decorated with delicate lines forming oblong panels and squares.,Paragraph
"The porch has been left completely bare, just two square posts and a",Paragraph
square lintel.??,Paragraph
This indicates the direction in which Behrens was to develop during,Paragraph
the years that followed. His principal buildings before the war he de-,Paragraph

"which the managing director, P. Jordan, had appointed him architect",Paragraph

beautiful industrial building ever erected up to that time (P1.133). The,Paragraph
"steel frame is clearly exhibited ; wide, perfectly spaced glass panes replace",Paragraph
the walls on the side and in the middle of the ends; and if the corners,Paragraph
are still expressed by heavy stone with banded rustication and rounded,Paragraph
"at the angles, the metal frame projecting its sharp corners above these",Paragraph
stone pylons redresses the balance boldly and effectively. This design,Paragraph

"has nothing in common with the ordinary factories of that time, not",Paragraph
even the most functional American ones of Albert Kahn with their ex-,Paragraph
posed steel frames. Here for the first time the imaginative possibilities,Paragraph
of industrial architecture were visualized. The result is a pure work of,Paragraph
"architecture, so finely balanced that the huge dimensions are scarcely",Paragraph
"realized, unless one looks at the people in the street for comparison.",Paragraph
The two-storeyed aisle on the left has the flat roof and the row of,Paragraph
windows which we find in all the most advanced works of that time.,Paragraph
The factory for the production of small electric motors was built in,Paragraph
"1911 ‘Pl, 134). The proportions of that part of the building which is to",Paragraph
"be seen on the left, its rows of rather narrow high windows without",Paragraph

"And while Behrens was employed on such monumental tasks, he",Paragraph
managed to spend the same amount of care and thought on improve-,Paragraph
ments in the design of small things for everyday use and larger things,Paragraph
of so utilitarian a kind that they had never before been regarded as works,Paragraph
of art at all. An example of the first is the excellent tea-kettle brought,Paragraph
"out in 1910 (PI. 135), an example of the second the street lamps of 1907-8",Paragraph
"(Pl. 136). They show the same purity of form, the same sobriety in",Paragraph
"134. Behrens: Factory, Volrastrasse, Berlin, Igtl.",Caption
"limiting the design to simple geometrical forms, and the same beauty",Paragraph
"of proportion which delight us in Behrens’s buildings,",Paragraph
The solidarity of the Deutscher Werkbund with this attitude of,Paragraph
Behrens’s is a matter of course. It has already been reported that the,Paragraph
Werkbund was founded in 1907. Behrens had become adviser to the,Paragraph
"AEG in the same year. One year earlier the Deutsche Werkstatten, as",Paragraph
"we have also seen before, had shown their first machine-made furniture",Paragraph
at an exhibition in Dresden. By the time the Werkbund brought out its,Paragraph
"first Annual, that is by 1912, they could without effort show well over a",Paragraph
hundred illustrations of works of industrial design as well as architecture,Caption
in the style of which they approved. Both the Deutsche Werkstatten,Paragraph
"and the AEG appeared in its pages, and Riemerschmid, and Josef",Paragraph
"Hoffmann, and also Gropius. But before passing on to Gropius’s work,",Paragraph
a few words must be said about some early buildings by two or three,Paragraph
"other German architects, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe®? was born in",Paragraph
"1886, Hans Poelzig** in 1869 (he died in 1948), Max Berg in 1870.",Paragraph
Max Berg (1870-1947) in his Jahrhunderthalie at Breslau in 1910-12,Paragraph
(Pl. 137) did with reinforced concrete what Behrens had done with steel,Paragraph
framing. He created a noble monumentality without concealing the,Paragraph
boldness of his structure. The Jahrhunderthalle covered an area of,Paragraph
"nearly 21,000 square feet with a weight of 4200 tons, whereas for",Paragraph
instance the dome of St Peter’s in Rome has an area of 5250 square feet,Paragraph
"and needs a weight of about 10,000 tons to cover it. Moreover, the",Paragraph
supports have an elegance of span and curvature heralding the achieve-,Paragraph
ments of Pier Luigi Nervi after the Second World War.,Paragraph
Mies van der Rohe and Poelzig represent two opposite modes of self-,Paragraph
expression in terms of the twentieth-century style. Mies van der Rohe’s,Paragraph
design of 1912 for the house of Mrs Krdller-Miiller (Pl. 138) is evidently,Paragraph
"derived from Behrens, but also, though perhaps less evidently, from",Paragraph
"Schinkel, who has had to be mentioned in these pages more than once",Paragraph
"before, and who was just then being rediscovered and reappreciated.?®",Paragraph
"From hina come Mies’s sparseness and extreme precision, from him",Paragraph

clue.?® Chiattone’s designs of about 1914 (P1.144) are as astonishingly,Paragraph
"prophetic of the twenties as Sant’Elia’s, and perhaps a little less",Paragraph
Utopian. Sant’Elia in his sketches shows no interest in plans and the pre-,Paragraph
cise function of a building. They are sheer Expressionism. His passion,Paragraph
for the Great City was no more realistic than Gautier’s for metallic,Paragraph
architecture or Turner’s for steam and speed. From Sant’Elia the way,Paragraph
"of twentieth-century architecture leads once more to Expressionism, in-",Paragraph
cluding Le Corbusier’s first dream city for three million people (1922).,Paragraph
"The real solid achievement had its source not in Sant’Elia, not in",Paragraph
"Poelzig and Mendelsohn, but in Behrens and his great pupil Walter",Paragraph
Gropius (born in 1883). Almost immediately after he had left Behrens’s,Paragraph
"office, in 1911, he was commissioned to build a factory at Alfeld on the",Paragraph
"Leine (Fagus-Fabrik, P1145). His designs go distinctly beyond those",Paragraph
by Behrens for the AEG. Only small details such as the windows on the,Caption
right of the main block show Behrens’s influence. As for the main block,Paragraph
"itself, everything is new and full of stimulating ideas. For the first time",Paragraph
a complete facade is conceived in glass. The supporting piers are re-,Caption
duced to narrow mullions of brick. The corners are left without any,Paragraph
"support, a treatment which has since been imitated over and over again,",Paragraph
The expression of the flat roof has also changed. Only in the building by,Paragraph
"Loos which was done one year before the Fagus Factory, have we seen",Paragraph
the same feeling for the pure cube. Another exceedingly important,Paragraph
"quality of Gropius’s building is that, thanks to the large expanses of",Paragraph
"clear glass, the usual hard separation of exterior and interior is anni-",Paragraph
hilated. Light and air can pass freely through the walls so that the,Paragraph
closed-in space is no longer different in essence from the great universe,Paragraph
"of space outside. This ‘etherealization’ of architecture, as Frank Lloyd",Paragraph
"Wright had called it in 1901,”"" is one of the most characteristic features",Paragraph
of the new style. We have seen it develop in the usual ground plan of,Paragraph
"late-nineteenth-century office buildings, where the supporting steel",Paragraph
"girders made all the partition walls easily removable, and then in",Paragraph
"Wright’s ground plans of private houses, in the arrangement of the",Paragraph
"rooms in Perret’s house of 1903, and in Mackintosh’s entrancing vistas ;",Paragraph
and we may recognize its counterpart in the field of planning in the,Paragraph

"immediately after the First World War (Landesplanung, Ruhr District,",Paragraph
"1920). Here too it is the conquest of space, the spanning of great dis-",Paragraph
"tances, the rational co-ordination of heterogeneous functions that fas~",Paragraph
cinates architects. The profound affinity of this passion for planning,Paragraph
with the characteristics of the twentieth-century style in architecture,Paragraph
and with the eternal concern of Western architecture with the conquest,Paragraph
of space is evident. The new style in the form Gropius gave it takes its,Paragraph
place in the procession which leads from the Romanesque and the,Paragraph
Gothic to the Renaissance of Brunelleschi and Alberti and the Baroque,Title
of Borromini and Neumann. The warmth and directness with which,Paragraph

"147. Gropius and Meyer: Model Factory. Werkbund Exhibition, Cologne,",Caption

by no means lacks grace. There is something sublime in this effortless,Paragraph
mastery of material and weight. Never since the Sainte-Chapelle and,Paragraph

"glass walls are now clear and without mystery, the steel frame is hard,",Paragraph
and its expression discourages all other-worldly speculation. It is the,Paragraph
