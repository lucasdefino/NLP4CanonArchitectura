Introduction,Title
"SINCE THE 1980S, when I began writing the essays that comprise my Makers",Paragraph
"of Modern Architecture, of which this is the third volume, the building art",Paragraph
has undergone such a thoroughgoing transformation that it would be largely,Paragraph
unrecognizable to most of the figures included in this open-ended series of,Paragraph
"career assessments. This should not be surprising, given that the oldest of",Paragraph
"my subjects, Frederick Law Olmsted, was bom nearly two centuries ago",Paragraph
"(one indication that the Modern Movement in architecture, of which he was",Paragraph
"an important precursor, has long become a historical development).",Paragraph
"However, the most extreme changes have occurred during the three decades",Paragraph
when these texts were originally published in The New York Review of,Paragraph
Books. Technological advances that emerged during that period in,Paragraph
architecture are no less remarkable than those from horse-drawn vehicles to,Paragraph
"space travel, handwritten communications to electronic media, or",Paragraph
phrenology to gene therapy.,Paragraph
"For example, although there are striking formal similarities between the",Paragraph
"work of two major figures discussed in this volume, Antoni Gaudi and",Paragraph
"Frank Gehry—both of whom designed idiosyncratic, biomorphic structures",Paragraph
wholly at odds with the predominantly rectilinear rule of Western,Paragraph
architecture since Classical antiquity—the means by which they realized,Paragraph
their heterodox visions could not have been more different. Gaudi drew on,Paragraph
millennia of ingenious fabrication techniques indigenous to his native,Paragraph
"Catalan region, a tradition that began with Roman colonists but remained",Paragraph
localized until the nineteenth century and the international dissemination of,Paragraph
"those techniques by an older compatriot of his, Rafael Guastavino. The",Paragraph
execution of Gaudi’s marvelously bizarre designs also depended on the,Paragraph
"availability of cheap artisanal labor, for although the architect plotted his",Paragraph
innovative structures with an exceptional but largely intuitive knowledge of,Paragraph
"engineering, he still needed the help of skilled craftsmen, who were often",Paragraph
"required to improvise onsite adjustments that no amount of forethought, in",Paragraph
"those low-tech times, could have anticipated.",Paragraph
"Gehry, in contrast, ingeniously co-opted computer software devised for",Paragraph
the aviation industry to plot the increasingly irregular forms of his,Paragraph
"buildings, a conceptual masterstroke that opened a new universe of",Paragraph
architectural design for him and an emergent generation of coprofessionals.,Paragraph
But the technical innovations of the past three decades have not been,Paragraph
limited to the digital realm and include a host of new building materials,Paragraph
"once undreamed of, such as translucent concrete that transmits light through",Paragraph
"load-bearing walls, powerful adhesives that enable the installation of huge",Paragraph
"windows without intrusive mullions, and biodegradable plastics as strong as",Paragraph
aluminum but half its weight. And although natural methods of passive,Paragraph
climate control have been part of vernacular building traditions since time,Paragraph
"immemorial, the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design)",Title
"rating system of the United States Green Building Council—a private,",Paragraph
nonprofit architectural sustainability group founded in 1993—has promoted,Paragraph
a wide array of energy-conservation strategies that have profoundly,Paragraph
changed business-as-usual attitudes toward the issue of climate change.,Paragraph
"As with the two preceding installments of this series, the chapters in this",Paragraph
"volume are arranged more or less chronologically, by the subject’s date of",Paragraph
birth or the approximate order in which she or he rose to prominence. And,Paragraph
although none of these books purports to be a full-fledged narrative of,Paragraph
"modern architecture, taken as a whole they offer a veritable mosaic of the",Paragraph
profession’s major protagonists from the mid-nineteenth century to the,Paragraph
present day. There are several notable reappearances here. Frank Lloyd,Paragraph
"Wright, a figure of fathomless depth to scholars and perennial interest to the",Paragraph
"general public, appears in all three volumes, a sign of his unparalleled place",Paragraph
in the American architectural pantheon. Renzo Piano likewise is included in,Paragraph
"each book, although that has had more to do with his having commanded so",Paragraph
"many of the most coveted cultural commissions of the past thirty years,",Paragraph
when he has reigned as the world’s most prominent designer of performing-,Paragraph
and visual-arts buildings. (Le Corbusier—more important in the global,Paragraph
picture than either Wright or Piano—was in Volumes [ and II.),Paragraph
"Two chapters, in Volume I and the present collection, are devoted to",Paragraph
"Louis Kahn, who, along with Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown",Paragraph
"(discussed in Volume I) and Gehry (Volumes I and IID, can be safely cited",Paragraph
as the most significant American architects in the six decades since,Paragraph
Wright’s demise. Also in both the first and third volumes are estimations of,Paragraph
"the work of David Childs and Santiago Calatrava, whose headline-making",Paragraph
schemes at New York’s Ground Zero gave them extraordinary visibility,Paragraph
during the decade and a half that it took them to execute those projects. As,Paragraph
"with its two predecessors, the components of this book were prompted by a",Paragraph
"variety of topical occurrences, including the completion of culturally",Paragraph
significant public buildings (such as Piano’s addition to Kahn’s Kimbell Art,Paragraph
Museum in Fort Worth and Gehry’s Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris); the,Paragraph
"emergence of new structural forms (the super-tall, super-thin condominium",Paragraph
towers that began to appear in Midtown Manhattan during the second,Paragraph
decade of the new millennium); major museum exhibitions (including,Paragraph
"retrospectives on Wright, the Wiener Werkstatte, and Gehry); and, as",Paragraph
"always at a paper devoted to reviewing books, new architectural",Paragraph
publications.,Paragraph
In recent years many of those have been monographs that focus on,Paragraph
architects of a half-century earlier whose heyday was followed by a period,Paragraph
of posthumous obscurity. This often happens when tastes and fashions,Paragraph
"change, and it falls to a younger generation of scholars to look with fresh",Paragraph
"eyes at buildings that can seem embarrassingly dated. In Volume II, I",Paragraph
"discussed the revival of interest in Eero Saarinen and Edward Durell Stone,",Paragraph
and the renewed enthusiasm for what is now known as Midcentury Modern,Paragraph
"continues in this collection with similar reevaluations of Paul Rudolph,",Paragraph
"Minoru Yamasaki, and their many contemporaries whose tough-looking",Paragraph
concrete structures earned them the label of New Brutalists. Even the,Paragraph
developer-built suburban housing tracts that so altered the postwar character,Paragraph
of middle-class American habitation have lately been the beneficiary of,Paragraph
scholarly analyses referred to in these pages.,Paragraph
Such studies are often undertaken by graduate students in search of,Paragraph
"unclaimed dissertation topics, but apart from that impetus there is always",Paragraph
good reason to reexamine the merits of discredited or neglected architecture,Paragraph
"after contemporary prejudices subside. However, in reconsidering the fifty-",Paragraph
"five chapters of this series, it now seems to me that the most fascinating",Paragraph
rediscoveries are not of postwar male architects but rather of women,Paragraph
architects who managed not only to prevail but to excel in a profession that,Paragraph
remained so adamantly male-dominated and openly misogynistic for most,Paragraph
of the twentieth century. The most notable example of such myopia—to,Paragraph
give this habitual omission its most charitable definition—was the absence,Paragraph
of Lina Bo Bardi from the canon of indispensable twentieth-century,Paragraph
"architects, and even the most cursory overview of her accomplishment",Paragraph
indicates that she would have long enjoyed her current high critical status,Paragraph
were she a man.,Paragraph
"In general, the prospects of women entering architectural practice today",Paragraph
"are much improved in comparison with those thirty years ago, to say",Paragraph
"nothing of sixty, when even the leading female figures in the profession",Paragraph
"were routinely subjected to discrimination and harassment. Natalie de Blois,",Paragraph
"for example, who died in 2013 at the age of ninety-two, was among the few",Paragraph
women of her generation to reach the highest echelons of architectural,Paragraph
"practice in this country. Blois, who as a senior partner at Skidmore, Owings",Paragraph
& Merrill helped design several of the firm’s most noteworthy buildings of,Paragraph
"the 1950s and 1960s, was fired from an earlier job because she rejected a",Paragraph
"male superior’s sexual overtures. But even at SOM, the period’s paradigm",Paragraph
"of corporate architectural culture, she had to endure repeated humiliations,",Paragraph
such as being excluded from meetings with prospective clients and from,Paragraph
group photographs with her male colleagues. When Blois was pregnant,Paragraph
"with one of her three children, Gordon Bunshaft, the firm’s cantankerous",Paragraph
"design principal (“He took all the credit and she did all the work,” as one",Paragraph
"feminist advocate has explained their collaborative dynamic), told her that",Paragraph
she should not attend the opening of a corporate headquarters they’d,Paragraph
worked on together if she had not given birth by then.,Paragraph
"Although social mores may change in the short term, human nature rarely",Paragraph
does in any significant manner. Thus I believe that the specifically personal,Paragraph
"approach I have taken in these essays, far from reinforcing a discredited",Paragraph
"Great Man approach to history, helps to explain the inner workings of an art",Paragraph
that has become increasingly mysterious to the general public since the,Paragraph
professionalization of building design began during the second half of the,Paragraph
"nineteenth century. To be sure, for millennia the construction industry",Paragraph
"remained very much a closed shop, with knowledge of the building art",Paragraph
jealously guarded as a trade secret transmitted by familial dynasties or trade,Paragraph
guilds intent on monopolizing lucrative sources of income. Yet to a far,Paragraph
"greater extent than was possible in the Industrial Age, the lay public in",Paragraph
premodern times could closely observe the building process and gain some,Paragraph
"understanding of its nature, or even, as with the scores of cathedrals erected",Paragraph
"throughout Christendom during the Middle Ages, directly participate in the",Paragraph
creation of a monument used by the entire community.,Paragraph
No wonder that this lost ideal of social integration was invoked by,Paragraph
"Modernist architects in the immediate aftermath of World War I, most",Paragraph
"movingly by the founders of the Bauhaus, the cover of whose founding",Paragraph
manifesto of 1919 was decorated with Lyonel Feininger’s Expressionist,Paragraph
"woodcut Kathedrale. (Indeed, the very name of this multidisciplinary",Paragraph
design school has echoes in the word Bauhtitte—a builder’s lodge adjacent,Paragraph
"to those great medieval churches, the equivalent of the far less",Paragraph
prepossessing job-manager’s trailers we now see on modem construction,Paragraph
"sites.) Overall, though, the social aspects of architecture today are quite",Paragraph
"different from those of earlier epochs, and have depended much more on",Paragraph
"the interpersonal relations between architect and client than, say, those",Paragraph
between master mason and clerical hierarchy.,Paragraph
At the heart of this customary imbalance of architectural power—the,Paragraph
perpetual tug-of-war between economic necessity and artistic desire—lies,Paragraph
the basic fact that nothing can get built unless someone agrees to pay for it.,Paragraph
"Although distinguished architects of the modern period, from the Adam",Paragraph
"brothers in the eighteenth century onward, have been able (given the",Paragraph
financial backing of others) to create structures that can be sold on,Paragraph
speculation—most often residences but also office buildings—the,Paragraph
profession for the most part remains in the thrall of patronage. Except for a,Paragraph
"recent increase in design/build architects, who act as their own contractors",Paragraph
"and developers, there has been no widespread change equivalent to the one",Paragraph
that began with the rise of a middle-class market for paintings in,Paragraph
"seventeenth-century Holland, which removed the creation of art from",Paragraph
complete dependency on princely patronage.,Paragraph
"The ability, indeed the necessity of architects to convince others to",Paragraph
"employ them—whether on the basis of their social insight (Olmsted, Bo",Paragraph
"Bardi), otherworldly spirituality (Gaudi, Kahn), extraordinary charm",Paragraph
"(Calatrava, Rafael Vifioly), political ideology (Albert Speer, Gerdy Troost),",Paragraph
"or technological expertise (Frei Otto, Piano), to name just several of the",Paragraph
practitioners I discuss in this book—cannot be discounted as an integral,Paragraph
component of their exceptional success. Highly developed social skills can,Paragraph
"propel architects of mediocre artistic ability to great heights, as was",Paragraph
"demonstrated by the stellar careers of Philip Johnson and I. M. Pei, neither",Paragraph
of whom was a very talented designer.,Paragraph
"Conversely, a lack of what’s known colloquially as “people skills” can",Paragraph
doom even the most gifted professional. When I served as an adviser on an,Paragraph
"architectural search committee in the early 2000s, I watched in dismay as",Paragraph
the perfect person for the job lost the commission by never once,Paragraph
establishing eye contact with his potential clients as he gave his,Paragraph
"presentation. Instead he talked right over their heads, which one member of",Paragraph
that committee cited as the determining reason not to hire him. In one-on-,Paragraph
"one situations this architect can be delightfully engaging, but his tendency",Paragraph
to seem remote and aloof in more formal settings is at painful odds with,Paragraph
"such virtuosos of the client pitch as Piano, whose lyrical evocations of",Paragraph
architecture as the noblest of human endeavors have likely won him as,Paragraph
many projects as his lengthy roster of superbly executed buildings.,Paragraph
"Yet no matter how high-minded they may be, all architects know that if",Paragraph
"they do not have a client, they do not have a building. (Gaudi coped with",Paragraph
the countless human vicissitudes that hampered the progress of his,Paragraph
"masterwork, the church of the Sagrada Familia, by insisting that “God is my",Paragraph
"client,” while the Lord’s representatives on earth made this saintly master",Paragraph
builder miserable.) But even when it comes to architects whose work I do,Paragraph
"not much admire (Rudolph and Calatrava, to name but two included here),",Paragraph
one cannot question the seriousness with which they addressed their tasks,Paragraph
or the strong confidence their patrons had in them.,Paragraph
As with every other human undertaking there is a dark side to,Paragraph
"architecture, which was exposed most sinisterly during the modern period",Paragraph
"in the Third Reich, whose leader was a frustrated architect and urban",Paragraph
"planner manqué. For decades after World War II, any serious discussion of",Paragraph
"Nazi construction was strictly verboten in academic circles, as if",Paragraph
acknowledging the central part that architecture played in the Fihrer’s,Paragraph
comprehensive takeover of the arts in German culture implied approval of,Paragraph
his malign program for political subjugation through every possible,Paragraph
medium. Once it became permissible to talk about this long-suppressed,Paragraph
"subject, a parallel increase of interest in traditional styles during the 1970s",Paragraph
"and 1980s emboldened some contrarians, most notably the neoconservative",Paragraph
"Postmodernist Léon Krier, to openly admire Nazi architecture. Thus",Paragraph
"encouraged, Hitler’s chief architect, Albert Speer—who survived a postwar",Paragraph
prison term and made a second fortune from best-selling memoirs,Paragraph
unparalleled in their mendacity—expected the critical rehabilitation of his,Paragraph
architectural corpus despite the atrocities he perpetrated as a high-ranking,Paragraph
member of the Nazi regime.,Paragraph
"Apart from the centrality of technological matters, the most salient aspect",Paragraph
of the building art since the millennium has been the exponential growth,Paragraph
"(though “metastasis” might be the better term) of the cult of celebrity,",Paragraph
which has taken the long-standing emphasis on individual inspiration in this,Paragraph
necessarily collaborative medium to grotesque new extremes. Today’s,Paragraph
relentless commercial emphasis on “branding” has been a setback for those,Paragraph
who want to acknowledge that the creation of architecture would be,Paragraph
impossible without the participation of numerous specialists on each,Paragraph
"project. However much a principal architect might drive the process, in the",Paragraph
"same way that a movie director is the auteur of a production, it is hugely",Paragraph
misleading to perpetuate persistent stereotypes of the individual genius.,Paragraph
"To their credit, two of today’s most important architects have insisted that",Paragraph
their firms’ corporate identities stress the collaborative nature of their work:,Paragraph
"the Office for Metropolitan Architecture, of which Rem Koolhaas is the",Paragraph
"most widely recognized principal, and the Renzo Piano Building Workshop,",Paragraph
which even though it highlights the name of its founder implies a more,Paragraph
generous sharing of credit than the customary “and Partners” or “and,Paragraph
Associates.” It might be said that both Koolhaas and Piano are both secure,Paragraph
enough about their own celebrity not to worry about what their offices are,Paragraph
"called, and concerned that the future livelihoods of their coworkers not be",Paragraph
dependent on their firms’ sole identification with one all-too-mortal,Paragraph
individual.,Paragraph
But such nomenclature straddles an earlier tendency to name,Paragraph
"architectural practices after their principalsk—McKim, Mead & White;",Paragraph
"Skidmore, Owings & Merrill—and the recent preference for cryptic titles",Paragraph
believed to efface such personal associations and epitomized by Ennead,Paragraph
"Architects (formerly Polshek Partnership, a change made upon the",Paragraph
"founder’s retirement, and based on a Greek-derived term for a group of",Paragraph
"nine, the number of remaining partners in that practice). But the allure of a",Paragraph
"widely recognized name dies hard, and even though James Polshek’s office",Paragraph
"was renowned for its dependably fine if rarely spectacular work, his",Paragraph
successors preferred a concocted moniker more reminiscent of a sport-,Paragraph
utility vehicle than an architectural atelier.,Paragraph
Today’s mania for constant extrapersonal validation—especially through,Paragraph
our all-pervasive electronic media—threatens the most likely means we,Paragraph
"have, and have always had, for gauging the successful outcome of a",Paragraph
building commission: through some direct understanding by architects of,Paragraph
"what their clients want and, reciprocally, clients who trust that an architect",Paragraph
understands and is willing to act upon their requirements. In rare,Paragraph
circumstances such transactions rise above the level of mere expediency,Paragraph
and enter the realm of art. That condition is never dependent on high,Paragraph
"expenditure, as evidenced in the last chapter of this book by Maya Lin’s",Paragraph
"Riggio-Lynch Chapel, a church humble enough for Saint Francis of Assisi",Caption
but grand enough for Dr. Martin Luther King. In some essential way this,Paragraph
small but powerful sanctuary expresses the “quiet inner voice” I wrote,Paragraph
about in my initial 1999 essay on Piano. That expression of architecture’s,Paragraph
ability to elevate life in countless ways can still be heard from time to time,Paragraph
"in the profession, drowned out though it often is by the distracting modem",Paragraph
"clamor of money, fame, and self-interest. To the heroines and heroes who",Paragraph
"appear in this book and its two forerunners, I give thanks for my fruitful",Paragraph
career in helping to document their struggles and triumphs in this most,Paragraph
"daunting of all art forms, a task I have attempted to fulfill as",Paragraph
sympathetically as possible.,Paragraph
FREDERICK LAW OLMSTED,Title
THE NEARLY UNIVERSAL acclaim that greeted New York City’s High Line—,Paragraph
the linear greenway built between 2006 and 2014 atop an abandoned,Paragraph
elevated railway spur that opened in 1934 on Manhattan’s Lower West Side,Paragraph
—reconfirmed the transformative effect parks can have on the quality of,Paragraph
"urban life. Well before the project’s completion, real estate prices began to",Paragraph
soar in the vicinity of this one-and-a-half-mile-long wonder of adaptive,Paragraph
reuse. The surrounding neighborhood subsequently became among the,Paragraph
"trendiest and costliest in town, and thousands visit it daily, many from",Paragraph
abroad. Yet however much the High Line has enriched the megalopolis,Paragraph
"(economically not least of all), its social effects pale in comparison to the",Paragraph
revolutionary vision of the public park as promulgated by its greatest,Paragraph
"American exponent, the nineteenth-century polymath Frederick Law",Title
Olmsted.,Paragraph
"Besides being an experimental farmer, prolific journalist, crusading",Paragraph
"publisher, military health-care reformer, and insightful social critic,",Paragraph
Olmsted was also the greatest advocate and impresario of the public realm,Paragraph
"this country has ever produced. Now best remembered as the codesigner,",Paragraph
"with the British-born architect Calvert Vaux, of New York’s Central Park of",Paragraph
"1857-1873, he was even more important as the veritable inventor of",Paragraph
landscape architecture as a modern profession (see Illustration 1a). For,Paragraph
apart from Olmsted’s exceptional and apparently innate abilities as a,Paragraph
horticulturist—he had little formal training—he systematically conceived,Paragraph
the large-scale reshaping of the natural terrain to an extent unimaginable to,Paragraph
such illustrious and influential antecedents as Capability Brown in Georgian,Paragraph
England and Andrew Jackson Downing (Olmsted’s beloved mentor) in pre—,Paragraph
Civil War America.,Paragraph
Olmsted can also be said to have Americanized high-style landscape,Paragraph
"design, despite all he learned from British sources about felicitous",Paragraph
composition. He created vistas like a series of Constable paintings with an,Paragraph
almost cinematic revelation of one breathtakingly arranged Arcadian,Paragraph
"tableau after another, but whenever possible he used native species to make",Paragraph
his schemes seem like spontaneous emanations of the ecology rather than,Paragraph
artificial impositions. Though he was hardly averse to transporting the best,Paragraph
"available plant material over long distances, and had mature trees and",Paragraph
"shrubs for Central Park shipped in quantity from England, Olmsted always",Paragraph
closely studied local settings for indigenous characteristics that he,Paragraph
reproduced with astounding fidelity. Likewise he shunned the strenuous,Paragraph
"exoticism of Victorian gardening, with its cedars of Lebanon, Argentinian",Paragraph
"pampas grasses, Mexican agaves, Chilean monkey puzzle trees, and",Paragraph
Norfolk Island pines that flaunted horticulture’s new imperial scope.,Paragraph
Olmsted and his collaborators created scores of parks large and small—in,Paragraph
"Boston and Fall River, Massachusetts; Baltimore; Bridgeport, Hartford,",Paragraph
"New Britain, and New London, Connecticut; Chicago; Detroit; Louisville,",Paragraph
"Kentucky; Milwaukee; Montreal; Buffalo, Newburgh, and Rochester, New",Paragraph
"York; Newport, Rhode Island; Philadelphia; and San Francisco. He also laid",Paragraph
"out campuses for the University of California at Berkeley, Stanford",Caption
"University in Palo Alto, and the University of Chicago; Mountain View",Paragraph
"Cemetery in Oakland, California; as well as one of America’s earliest",Paragraph
"planned suburbs, Riverside, Illinois. He was responsible for the nation’s",Paragraph
"first state park—the Niagara Reservation, which got rid of the commercial",Paragraph
mess that disgraced the famous waterfalls. At his urging the Yosemite,Paragraph
"Valley was put under federal jurisdiction, the first public land to be thus",Paragraph
"protected, and his 1896 report to Congress about the valley is now seen as a",Paragraph
mission statement for the then-nascent National Park movement.,Paragraph
"Central Park, which launched Olmsted’s landscaping career and inspired",Paragraph
"communities across the country to commission similar projects from him,",Paragraph
emerged at a pivotal moment in the recognition of our environmental,Paragraph
treasures and their increasing endangerment. A distinctively American form,Paragraph
of nature worship—exalted through the writings of the Transcendentalists,Paragraph
"Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, the poetry of William",Title
"Cullen Bryant, and the art of Hudson River School painters, including",Paragraph
Thomas Cole and Frederic Edwin Church—grew into a widely accepted,Paragraph
non-sectarian sort of spirituality. This resulted in a significant change in,Paragraph
"public attitudes toward the environment, which for the first two centuries of",Paragraph
European settlement in the Western Hemisphere were more about,Paragraph
despoilment than preservation. Lewis Mumford later called this shift “an,Paragraph
effort to make reparations to nature.”,Paragraph
"The saga of Central Park began in 1844, when Bryant wrote a New York",Paragraph
Post editorial that urged the country’s burgeoning metropolis to establish an,Paragraph
appropriately grand public pleasure ground. The idea languished in the,Paragraph
"politically corrupt city, where no official activity was free from favoritism",Paragraph
"and graft. Under the so-called spoils system, the elected party had absolute",Paragraph
"control over public funds and distribution of municipal jobs, with abrupt",Paragraph
"shifts in allocations and appointments when power changed hands, which it",Paragraph
did with surprising frequency in mid-nineteenth-century New York City.,Paragraph
High among Olmsted’s many accomplishments was his ability to buck this,Paragraph
entrenched self-interest and bring his dream to fruition.,Paragraph
The seed of that vision was planted in 1850 during his trip to Europe to,Paragraph
"study new farming methods, though as always Olmsted’s restless eye",Paragraph
absorbed everything of interest. Soon after debarking in Liverpool he,Paragraph
visited Birkenhead Park of 1841-1847 in the eponymous town across the,Paragraph
River Mersey from the great seaport. Laid out by Joseph Paxton—the,Paragraph
landscape gardener who with the engineer Charles Fox designed the Crystal,Paragraph
Palace of 1850-1851 in London—the 125-acre Birkenhead tract was the,Paragraph
earliest urban park in Britain developed with public funds and open to all,Paragraph
classes.,Paragraph
This represented an enormous advance in the gradual democratization of,Paragraph
civic culture that began during the Enlightenment. Just as the establishment,Paragraph
of the first public museums in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth,Paragraph
"centuries extended the audience for art beyond the aristocracy, so Paxton",Paragraph
"improved upon forerunners such as Green Park and Hyde Park in London,",Paragraph
which were created from former royal hunting preserves but open only to,Paragraph
gentlefolk.,Paragraph
"Olmsted’s perceptive 1851 report on this innovation, “The People’s Park",Paragraph
"at Birkenhead, near Liverpool,” is among the forty-seven essays,",Paragraph
"memoranda, and excerpts from his travel dispatches, along with sixty",Paragraph
"letters, collected in the Library of America’s thoroughly inspiring Frederick",Paragraph
"Law Olmsted: Writings on Landscape, Culture, and Society (2015),",Caption
"authoritatively edited by the preeminent expert on the master, Charles",Paragraph
"Beveridge. Also in 2015, publication of the ninth volume of Olmsted’s",Paragraph
correspondence culminated the heroic project initiated by Johns Hopkins,Paragraph
University Press in 1972. If this collection does not numerically surpass the,Paragraph
forty-six volumes of Adams family papers issued by Harvard University,Caption
"Press since 1954, it nonetheless represents the most ambitious initiative of",Paragraph
"its kind on behalf of an American artist or designer in any medium, and",Paragraph
deservedly so.,Paragraph
Olmsted’s seminal essay on the People’s Park epitomizes not only his,Paragraph
"breezy, conversational, inimitably American voice, but also predicts, in",Paragraph
"startlingly prescient detail, what by the end of the decade would become",Paragraph
Central Park. His text reveals that it was not stylistic considerations that,Paragraph
"took precedence for him, but rather a design’s social implications. As he",Paragraph
wrote of that momentous field trip:,Paragraph
In studying the manner in which art had been employed to obtain from,Paragraph
"nature so much beauty, . . . I was ready to admit that in democratic",Paragraph
"America, there was nothing to be thought of as comparable with this",Paragraph
"People’s Garden. Indeed, I was satisfied that gardening had here",Paragraph
reached a perfection that I had never before dreamed of. . . . We passed,Paragraph
"through winding paths, over acres and acres, with a constant varying",Paragraph
"surface, where on all sides were growing every variety of shrubs and",Paragraph
"flowers, with more than natural grace, all set in borders of greenest,",Paragraph
"closest turf, and all kept with most consummate neatness. At a distance",Paragraph
"of a quarter of a mile from the gate, we came to an open field of clean,",Paragraph
"bright, green-sward, closely mown, on which. . . a party of boys... .",Paragraph
were playing cricket.,Paragraph
"Beyond this was a large meadow with rich groups of trees, under",Paragraph
"which a flock of sheep were reposing, and girls and women with",Paragraph
"children, were playing. While watching the cricketers, we were",Paragraph
"threatened with a shower, and hastened back to look for shelter, which",Paragraph
we found in a pagoda. . . . It was soon filled . . . and I was glad to,Paragraph
observe that the privileges of the garden were enjoyed about equally,Paragraph
"by all classes. There were some who even were attended by servants,",Paragraph
"and sent at once for their carriages, but a large proportion were of the",Paragraph
"common ranks, and a few women with children, or suffering from ill",Paragraph
"health, were evidently the wives of very humble laborers. . . .",Paragraph
"All this magnificent pleasure-ground is entirely, unreservedly, and",Paragraph
forever the People’s own. The poorest British peasant is as free to,Paragraph
"enjoy it in all its parts, as the British Queen.",Paragraph
"During the 1840s, New York City was flooded by somewhere between a",Paragraph
"million and a million and a half immigrants, mainly Irish and German, who",Paragraph
"were largely unaccustomed to living in a dense, heterogeneous urban",Paragraph
setting. Olmsted grasped how a park like Birkenhead could serve New York,Paragraph
"as a vast outdoor classroom for mass acculturation, where uneducated",Paragraph
newcomers would be on an equal footing with the established citizenry and,Paragraph
"observe modes of improving behavior—in dress, deportment, and leisure",Paragraph
pursuits—that they otherwise might not encounter. Also in Olmsted’s article,Paragraph
we find a veritable checklist of features later realized in the 843-acre,Paragraph
"Central Park: the serpentine pathways, the Mall shaded by American elms,",Caption
"the grassy Sheep Meadow, the glades and underbrush of the Rambles, and",Paragraph
"the spacious ball fields of the Great Lawn. Even the Greensward Plan, the",Paragraph
name that Olmsted and Vaux gave their competition-winning New York,Paragraph
"design, is prefigured here.",Paragraph
Central Park was laid out four decades before Manhattan’s first,Paragraph
"automobile fatality in 1899, but urban equine traffic was also often deadly;",Paragraph
in 1900 there were some two hundred horse-related deaths in New York,Paragraph
City. Thus Olmsted and Vaux’s strict division of circulation in the park,Paragraph
acknowledged the ever-present danger of such accidents by consigning,Paragraph
heavy east-west vehicular traffic to crosstown transverses sunk well below,Paragraph
"surface level, while above-grade pedestrian footpaths dipped beneath north—",Paragraph
"south roadways through small bridges and short tunnels. (The partners, who",Paragraph
until they ended their partnership refused individual credit for any specific,Paragraph
"design solution, seem to have gotten this idea from a pedestrian underpass",Paragraph
in John Nash’s Regent’s Park of 1812-1835 in London.),Caption
Their concept of dual circulation soon became an article of faith among,Paragraph
progressive planners in the United States and Europe. Clarence Stein and,Paragraph
"Henry Wright’s much-praised 1929 design for Radburn, New Jersey—",Paragraph
touted as the “New Town for the Motor Age”—so effectively segregates,Paragraph
cars and people that children can walk to local schools and playgrounds,Paragraph
"without crossing a street. Stein, whose Central Park West apartment",Caption
"overlooked the 65th Street Transverse, said that he discovered what became",Paragraph
known as “the Radburn idea” simply by peering out his front window.,Paragraph
"Yet for all the priority Olmsted and Vaux gave to traffic patterns, it",Paragraph
remains hard to believe that almost everything one now sees in Central Park,Paragraph
is man-made (see I]lustration 1b). This impression depends entirely on their,Paragraph
adherence to the naturalistic ethos of the eighteenth-century British,Paragraph
"Romantic landscape movement, which supplanted the strictly formal,",Paragraph
"symmetrical, geometric approach typified by the seventeenth-century",Paragraph
"French master André Le Notre, who in turn drew on earlier Italian",Paragraph
"Renaissance models. In contrast, the softly undulating outlines and gentle",Paragraph
contours of a new British landscape style that came into vogue around 1750,Paragraph
evoked the so-called line of beauty expounded by William Hogarth and,Paragraph
"other aesthetic theorists, who believed that the graceful Rococo S-curve was",Paragraph
the basis for all visual harmony.,Paragraph
"Capability Brown and his principal follower, Humphry Repton, sought to",Paragraph
make their landscapes seem as though they had evolved naturally over time,Paragraph
"rather than being newly formed by the hand of man, exactly what Olmsted",Paragraph
achieved time and again in his work. Renderings and photographs of,Paragraph
Central Park in its early years remind us that it took four decades for it to,Paragraph
grow into the mature form we recognize today. Olmsted’s ability to imagine,Paragraph
how a barren stretch of urban wasteland could be turmmed into an idyllic,Paragraph
glade that looks as if it had been there forever is further demonstrated in,Paragraph
several of his before-and-after sketches of Central Park. These and other,Paragraph
"visual documents make it clear how complicated that task was, with a host",Paragraph
of now invisible infrastructural underpinnings that needed to be put into,Paragraph

occupations—from dry goods clerk to apprentice seaman on a China trade,Title

immerse himself in a new subject and fully master it. To better cultivate his,Paragraph

"plant biology, industrial chemistry, and agricultural machinery. Yet the",Paragraph
"young would-be agronomist had many competing interests, and found that",Paragraph

"as an editor of Putnam’s Magazine, founded in New York in 1853 as an",Paragraph

A Journey in the Seaboard Slave States (1856)—remains a classic on a par,Paragraph
with Alexis de Tocqueville’s endlessly cited American critique of a,Paragraph
"generation earlier. Although Olmsted was not an abolitionist, he supported",Paragraph
the proposal that slave owners should be compensated for the value of their,Paragraph
freed human chattel as the most equitable and practicable means of,Paragraph
avoiding the looming conflict between North and South. That solution—,Paragraph
"which likely would have been far less costly than the Civil War in money,",Paragraph
let alone blood—was of course never implemented.,Paragraph
"The Cotton Kingdom, a compendium of his travel writings published in",Paragraph
"1862 during the Civil War, gave a harsh view of the region’s inhabitants,",Paragraph
and debunked even their much-vaunted southern hospitality:,Paragraph
"The citizens of the cotton States . . . work little, and that little, badly;",Paragraph
"they earn little, they sell little; they buy little, and they have little—",Paragraph
very little—of the common comforts and consolations of civilized life.,Paragraph
Their destitution is not material only; it is intellectual and it is,Paragraph
moral. ... They were neither generous nor hospitable. . . .,Paragraph
When hostilities broke out Olmsted had already completed his principal,Paragraph
"work on Central Park, and was thus able to transfer to the war effort the",Paragraph

of contractors and workmen for a logistically complex job. He became head,Paragraph

Vaux began planning the sequel that some consider an even more exquisite,Paragraph
composition: their 585-acre Prospect Park of 1865-1873 in nearby,Paragraph
Brooklyn. But Olmsted still kept a hand in the literary world as a financial,Paragraph
"backer of The Nation, the liberal political journal founded in 1865, to which",Paragraph
he was an occasional contributor. Olmsted and Vaux dissolved their firm in,Paragraph
"1872 after increasing disagreements, but the Panic of 1873 deterred",Paragraph
Olmsted’s rapid rebound. When economic conditions improved he quickly,Paragraph
reestablished himself with the help of two new partners—his nephew and,Paragraph
"adopted son John Charles Olmsted and his younger biological son,",Paragraph
"Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., who headed the firm until he retired in 1949.",Paragraph
Olmsted Brothers finally went out of business in 1980.,Paragraph
By the first half of the 1890s—the period covered by the ninth volume of,Paragraph
the Olmsted correspondence—the grand old man had become not merely a,Paragraph
"national but a continental eminence, as demand for his services impelled",Paragraph
him to shuttle continually among far-flung projects from Maine to,Paragraph
California and Michigan to Kentucky. Most experimental among them was,Paragraph
his comprehensive planning of the Biltmore Estate in the North Carolina,Paragraph
Blue Ridge Mountains for George Washington Vanderbilt Il. The,Caption
"centerpiece of this 125,000-acre property is Richard Morris Hunt’s Biltmore",Paragraph
"House of 1889-1895, still the largest private residence in America, a French",Paragraph
Renaissance Revival chateau like those favored by Vanderbilt’s plutocratic,Paragraph
"kin and kind on New York’s Fifth Avenue. Olmsted urged his client, who",Paragraph
"had run the Vanderbilt family farm on Staten Island, not far from Olmsted’s",Paragraph
"old property, to rise above the empty ostentation of Gilded Age display and",Paragraph
instead turn the surrounding land into a model of moder sustainable,Paragraph
"forestry, an idea the multimillionaire admirably endorsed. The Biltmore",Paragraph
"Estate, now owned by a family trust, has become a hugely popular tourist",Paragraph
destination and attracts more than a million visitors each year.,Paragraph
Not all of Olmsted’s late projects were so happy. His work at the World’s,Paragraph
Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago fell victim to the rigid formality,Paragraph
"of the fair’s Beaux Arts—inspired layout, in which monumental Classicizing",Paragraph
buildings were surrounded by enormous lagoons that impeded easy,Paragraph
circulation. One critic wrote that although Olmsted’s contribution was,Paragraph
"“unquestionably very fine to look at,” it was “totally unsuited for practical",Paragraph
"purposes.” The designer conceded as much, and wrote that the fair would",Paragraph
have been much better without “perhaps a third of all that was exhibited and,Paragraph
... an innumerable lot of trifling concession coops and shantees with slight,Paragraph
regard to the landscape design.”,Paragraph
But this was a rare flub in an otherwise unbroken sequence of successes,Paragraph
"that gave many American cities their finest civic features, especially",Paragraph
Boston’s dazzling “Emerald Necklace” park system (which comprises the,Paragraph
"Back Bay Fens, the Arnold Arboretum, and Wood Island Park, among other",Paragraph
"things) and the refashioning of Buffalo’s topography through parkways,",Paragraph
"squares, and lakefront improvements. In 1895, the seventy-three-year-old",Paragraph
"Olmsted began to notice short-term memory lapses, and though his letters",Paragraph
"from that year show no sign of cognitive impairment, his sons also",Paragraph
recognized his increasing decline and eased him out of the family business.,Paragraph
"Before long he had full-blown dementia, and he lived out the last five years",Paragraph
"of his life in a cottage at the McLean Hospital near Boston, where he died",Paragraph
in 1903 amid grounds he had laid out long before.,Paragraph
Olmsted’s status as a national figure was confirmed by the invitation in,Paragraph
"1874 to landscape the grounds of the United States Capitol in Washington,",Caption
"D.C., a tricky assignment that gave this sprawling and oddly proportioned",Paragraph
structure—erected in fits and starts to the designs of several different,Paragraph
architects throughout the first half of the nineteenth century—a softening,Paragraph
frame of majestic trees and a virtual pedestal of shrubberies worthy of the,Paragraph
project’s grandeur. This deeply symbolic scheme also paid indirect homage,Paragraph
"to a national heritage of unparalleled natural splendor, which Olmsted, more",Paragraph
than anyone save the pioneering conservationists George Perkins Marsh and,Paragraph
"John Muir, identified, celebrated, enhanced, extended, and preserved. Yet",Paragraph
"even Olmsted, for all his uncanny foresight about how his parks would",Paragraph
"function in a future beyond his possible imagination, could never have",Paragraph
predicted how instructive they would be in our polarized postmillennial,Paragraph
"America, so different from the egalitarian society his unifying designs",Paragraph
vigorously promoted.,Paragraph
ANTONI GAUDI,Title
ALTHOUGH SACRED STRUCTURES Of all sorts have been central to every culture,Paragraph
"throughout history, religious architecture has attained even greater",Paragraph
importance in times of social upheaval. This was certainly true in mid-,Paragraph
"nineteenth-century Barcelona, the ancient Mediterranean seaport that had",Paragraph
lately become an economic powerhouse with the advent of industrialized,Paragraph
textile manufacturing. As the strains caused by this rapid shift from small,Paragraph
"workshop to large factory production worsened, many felt that the Roman",Paragraph
Catholic Church was unresponsive to the travails of increasingly,Paragraph
downtrodden urban laborers. Thus during the 1870s pious (and wealthy),Paragraph
barcelonés conceived a monumental building project for a working-class,Paragraph
neighborhood that they hoped would stem religious disaffection by harking,Paragraph
"back to the devotional fervor, communal brotherhood, and civic pride",Title
fostered by the construction of grand cathedrals during the Middle Ages.,Paragraph
"The result is one of the most celebrated shrines in Christendom, known in",Paragraph
Catalan as the Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Familia (Expiatory Temple,Paragraph
of the Holy Family). It was begun in 1882 using the conventional neo-,Paragraph
"Gothic designs of Francisco de Paula del Villar, who after two years of",Paragraph
persistent quarrels with diocesan supervisors quit and handed the job over,Paragraph
to his largely untested assistant Antoni Gaudi. Over the next four decades,Paragraph
Gaudi worked toward a church that would be both intensely personal yet,Paragraph
"embracingly universal, startlingly unprecedented though rooted in tradition,",Paragraph
and altogether far more rich and strange than anything del Villar ever,Paragraph
dreamed of (see Illustration 2a).,Paragraph
Although many cathedrals feature elaborate ensembles that depict scenes,Paragraph
"from the Gospel, the program of the Sagrada Familia sculptures makes most",Paragraph
"others seem rather subdued. Gaudi’s jam-packed Nativity Facade, executed",Paragraph
"between 1894 and 1930, offers a paradisiacal vision of (holy) family life",Paragraph
"amid a panoply of grottoes dripping with stalactites, dense with leafy",Paragraph
"bocage, and alive with all sorts of fauna and flora. You have to look closely",Paragraph
"to find Jesus, Mary, and Joseph through all the busy detail, a bit like some",Paragraph
divine “Where’s Waldo?” game. One can scarcely imagine what this,Paragraph
"teeming jumble would have looked like had it been painted in polychrome,",Paragraph
as Gaudi wanted to do in the manner of ancient Greek sculpture and,Paragraph
architecture.,Paragraph
Above the sanctuary rise eight elongated sugarloaf spires (four were,Caption
"completed before the Spanish civil war, and another quartet has been added",Paragraph
"since, with another ten yet to come). Their surfaces are multicolored mosaic",Paragraph
and they are surmounted by torqued and faceted pinnacles topped with,Paragraph
marvelous finials like radiant monstrances. Unfurled down the sides of the,Paragraph
"towers, where only angels can read them, are trompe 1’oeil scrolls joyously",Paragraph
"inscribed “Excelsis,” “Hosanna,” and “Sanctus.”",Paragraph
"Contrary to the common misnomer, the Sagrada Familia is not a",Paragraph
"cathedral—site of a bishop’s throne, or cathedra—though it was elevated to",Paragraph
the status of a “minor basilica” when Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the,Paragraph
half-finished church in 2010. Still under construction after more than a,Paragraph
"century and a quarter of financially and politically related fits and starts, it",Paragraph
"is scheduled to conclude in 2026, the centennial of the architect’s death.",Paragraph
(Gaudi succumbed at seventy-three after he was hit by a tram on his way,Paragraph
from the Sagrada Familia to the parish church where he attended vespers,Paragraph
every evening.),Paragraph
"The Sagrada Familia, Barcelona’s top tourist attraction, welcomes some",Paragraph
three million visitors annually—nearly twice the city’s population—and,Paragraph
their admission fees have been the major source of revenue for completing,Paragraph
"the edifice. The architect is a cult figure not only in his native region, where",Paragraph
"he exemplifies the unruly Catalan spirit to political separatists, but as far",Paragraph
away as Japan. There in 2011 the hugely popular manga artist Takehiko,Paragraph
Inoue—whose usual subject is basketball—published a book that seeks to,Paragraph
"pinpoint the source of Gaudi’s inspiration, an ultimately futile task when it",Paragraph
"comes to such a complex, and to some extent inexplicable, figure.",Paragraph
The architectural historian Judith Rohrer has written that the Sagrada,Paragraph
Familia (originally meant to house pharos-like searchlights in its pinnacles),Paragraph
"was intended to “serve as a beacon of faith, proclaiming the revived piety of",Paragraph
"the Spanish people, while atoning for the sins, both public and private, of a",Paragraph
"modernist, materialist age.” The strain of deep conservatism implicit in that",Paragraph
formulation—which brings to mind the militant antimodemism of Pope,Paragraph
"Pius [X, who died shortly before the Sagrada Familia’s inception—makes",Paragraph
one understand why proletarian radicals did not necessarily view this costly,Paragraph
exercise in spiritual advertisement as a social improvement program.,Paragraph
The new church was dedicated to the Holy Family because Saint Joseph,Paragraph
was a Carpenter with whom the city’s laborers might personally identify.,Paragraph
But empathetic feelings among that target audience were perhaps,Paragraph
undermined when the architect’s iconography for the Temptation portal,Paragraph
(one of several thematic groupings that in addition to the Nativity include,Paragraph
"the Rosary, the Way of the Cross, and the Crucifixion) revealed a figure of a",Paragraph
demon proffering a workman a spherical Orsini bomb—the handheld,Paragraph
weapon favored by fin-de-siécle anarchists.,Paragraph
Thus despite the populist appeal of the Sagrada Familia’s exuberant,Paragraph
"forms and idiosyncratic decoration, a severely critical undertone lodged in",Paragraph
some people’s minds. Lingering resentment took a violent turn when in,Paragraph
"1936, during the Spanish civil war, Republican rioters broke into Gaudi’s",Paragraph
"old studio and destroyed his plaster models for the church. Indeed, as late as",Paragraph
"the 1960s, when my wife, Rosemarie Haag Bletter, did research as a",Paragraph
graduate student in Barcelona on Gaudi’s lesser-known contemporary Josep,Paragraph
"Vilaseca, she was habitually quizzed by different factions about her attitude",Paragraph
"toward the completion of Gaudi’s church, a political litmus test under the",Paragraph
"Franco regime, which looked upon gaudisme as a cover for seditious",Paragraph
Catalan dissidents.,Paragraph
"This was a tricky question to answer in any case, because Gaudi certainly",Paragraph
realized that no one designer could live long enough to see such a grandiose,Paragraph
endeavor through to completion. And although he left detailed instructions,Paragraph
"for parts of the structure still unbuilt during his lifetime, he expected (and",Paragraph
"accepted) that other designers would put their own, likely quite different,",Paragraph
"stamp on it, as happened with cathedrals such as Chartres, with its",Paragraph
mismatching early Gothic and Flamboyant spires.,Paragraph
"“Great temples were not the work of one architect,” Gaudi observed, but",Paragraph
those in charge at the Sagrada Familia today have drawn on his work to the,Paragraph
"exclusion of all other possibilities. To be sure, a highly skilled, deeply",Paragraph
"dedicated group of architectural, engineering, and decorative arts",Title
professionals was directed from 2012 onward by the Barcelona architect,Paragraph
Jordi Fauli (who spent the preceding two decades as an associate on the,Paragraph
project). The team hewed as faithfully as possible to the letter of Gaudi’s,Paragraph
"vision, but one wonders about the spirit. As a visit to the Sagrada Familia",Paragraph
"today indicates, there is such a thing as being too conscientious. Employing",Paragraph
"the most advanced computer imaging technology, it has been possible to",Paragraph
reconstitute elements once thought irretrievably lost after Gaudi’s models,Paragraph
were shattered. Yet the newest portions of the Barcelona landmark utterly,Paragraph
lack the tactile quality of the parts of the Sagrada Familia carried out while,Paragraph
Gaudi was alive. The sense of an artist being physically involved is,Paragraph
conspicuously missing from the most recent additions there.,Paragraph
"Gaudi’s conception evolved in three distinct phases—1890, 1913-1915,",Paragraph
and 1921-1926—marked by models that varied significantly from one to,Paragraph
"the next. Rohrer suggests why the version being realized today, based on",Paragraph
"that final revision, seems somehow less Gaudiesque than might have been",Paragraph
expected:,Title
"There is a certain angularity to the forms that emerge in this model,",Paragraph
less fluid in its continuity than Gaudi’s earlier work. While not,Paragraph
abandoning the ruled surfaces of double curvature that were so much a,Paragraph
"part of his structural thinking, he nevertheless tumed in the last phase",Paragraph
of his work toward intersecting and interlocking polyhedral geometries,Paragraph
"that yield an angular, prismatic, crystalline, almost cubist effect.",Paragraph
Although translating Gaudi’s reconstituted designs for the Sagrada,Paragraph
Familia into building components has been made infinitely easier by digital,Paragraph
"scanning programs, there is a world of difference between the sharply",Paragraph
rendered parts that emerge from this process and the far more,Paragraph
"improvisational results Gaudi was able to coax from artisans on site, his",Paragraph
habitual working method. Given the figurative arthritis that set into Gaudi’s,Paragraph
"supple organic forms late in his career, strict fidelity to those last pieces of",Paragraph
"work might not have been the wisest course, either. The completed nave of",Paragraph
"the Sagrada Familia looks disturbingly fake, and in many places jarringly",Paragraph
"slick, especially the grid-patterned, polished stone floor that brings to mind",Paragraph
the lobby of a 1980s corporate headquarters by Philip Johnson. Perhaps in,Paragraph
"the fullness of time all this bright, precision-cut stonework will mellow into",Paragraph
"pleasing decrepitude, but that now seems unlikely.",Paragraph
Few mainstream architects have dared emulate Gaudi directly. Today’s,Paragraph
"most obvious claimant to his mantle as maverick master is Frank Gehry,",Paragraph
whose Olympic Fish pavilion of 1989-1992 in Barcelona (part of the,Paragraph
Olympic Village erected for the 1992 games) exudes the antic energy of his,Paragraph
"antecedent’s biomorphic fantasias. However, the steel-mesh skin of Gehry’s",Paragraph
design is uniformly detailed and tastefully monochromatic in a High,Paragraph
Modernist mode antithetical to Gaudi’s colorful and irregular surface,Paragraph
treatments. Much more Gaudiesque in its decorative flair is Gehry’s A Rose,Paragraph
"for Lilly, a fountain dedicated to the memory of Lillian Disney, widow of",Caption
"the famed animator and film producer, in the garden adjacent to his Walt",Paragraph
Disney Concert Hall of 1989-2003 in Los Angeles. The surfaces of this,Paragraph
"biomorphic sculpture, shaped like the honoree’s favorite flower, are inlaid",Paragraph
with shards of broken china similar to the Catalan architect’s work in,Paragraph
"Barcelona’s Park Giiell. Tellingly, the alacrity with which the civic sponsors",Paragraph
of Gehry’s Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (1991-1997) accepted his wildly,Paragraph
unorthodox scheme says much about the persistence of the adventurous,Paragraph
cultural attitudes Gaudi fostered in Spain a century earlier.,Paragraph
Artists in other mediums have responded to Gaudi’s example with more,Paragraph
abandon. Although it remains unclear how much the Italian-American,Paragraph
"outsider sculptor Simon Rodia knew about him, there is no question that",Paragraph
"Rodia’s Los Angeles landmark, known as the Watts Towers (1921-1954),",Paragraph
bears a striking resemblance to the Sagrada Familia in the outlines of its,Paragraph
spires and its hand-molded mortar surfaces studded with discarded china,Paragraph
"fragments. And from the 1950s onward, the eccentric Austrian artist",Paragraph
"Friedensreich Hundertwasser fabricated a series of oddly shaped, brightly",Paragraph
"colored, and whimsically patterned houses in several European locales that",Paragraph
led to his being dubbed “the Austrian Gaudi.”,Paragraph
"Astonishingly, given his current réclame, Gaudi languished in critical",Paragraph
"limbo for three decades after his death, in part because of the Spanish civil",Paragraph
war and the cultural pariahdom visited on the Franco regime long,Paragraph
"afterward. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner, single-minded in",Paragraph
"his promotion of a Modernist machine aesthetic, focused on Gaudi’s",Paragraph
decorative impulse but largely ignored his considerable structural,Paragraph
"achievements. In his polemical Pioneers of Modern Design (1936), Pevsner",Paragraph
finds Gaudi’s fairy-tale-Gothic episcopal palace at Astorga (1887-1893),Caption
“nightmarish” and his mysteriously organic chapel at the Colénia Giiell,Caption
(1898 and 1909-1915) “horrible.” He discerns in Gaudi’s creations not a,Paragraph
miraculous inventiveness but a “frantic desire for the unprecedented” and a,Paragraph
“delight in the arbitrary curve.”,Paragraph
"However, there was nothing at all capricious about Gaudi’s parabolas and",Paragraph
"catenaries, which he calibrated just as scientifically as his great engineering",Paragraph
"contemporaries did their innovations, and without any of the high-tech aids",Paragraph
architects now routinely rely on. Although he scorned the use of buttresses,Paragraph
as a lazy structural crutch and was determined to find other ways to support,Paragraph
"the Sagrada Familia’s high, thin walls, he also sought to avoid Gothic",Paragraph
horrors like the collapse of the choir of Beauvais cathedral in 1284 or the,Paragraph
tower of Ely cathedral in 1322.,Caption
Gaudi gauged the strength of his arches and vaults with mock-ups from,Paragraph
which he suspended sandbags on ropes to simulate the gravitational forces,Paragraph
"that would bear on the executed masonry, rather than depending solely on",Paragraph
the mathematical formulae through which he arrived at his structural,Paragraph
"configurations. “I am a geometrician,” the architect insisted, a riposte to",Paragraph
those who saw only willfulness in his deceptively arbitrary-looking forms.,Paragraph
"Nonetheless, neurotic menace lurks everywhere in Pevsner’s fretful",Paragraph
surveys. Gaudi’s roofs are “like the backs of dinosaurs” and the ironwork of,Paragraph
his balconies “might stab you at any moment.” Although Pevsner remained,Paragraph
obtusely immune to the sheer bravura that has made Gaudi arguably the,Paragraph
"world’s most beloved architect, he later softened his tone somewhat and",Paragraph
attributed that animus to an excess on his part of pro-Modernist zeal. Yet his,Paragraph
earlier position helps explain why Gaudi’s work was hardly appreciated at,Paragraph
the mid-twentieth century.,Paragraph
Although the Expressionists and Surrealists esteemed Gaudi as a fellow,Paragraph
"visionary, popular attitudes began to change dramatically in the 1960s, a",Paragraph
decade of worldwide social and cultural ferment that made Gaudi’s work,Paragraph
speak to a young generation alert to imaginative and expressive qualities,Paragraph
"long dismissed as pathologically bizarre, especially in architecture. Indeed,",Paragraph
"there is something almost psychedelic in his freewheeling aesthetic,",Paragraph
"characterized by distorted forms, propulsive patterns, kaleidoscopic colors,",Paragraph
and quirky materials. The rediscovery of Art Nouveau during the 1960s,Paragraph
carried Gaudi along with other newfound fin-de-siécle heroes of the,Paragraph
"burgeoning counterculture, including Aubrey Beardsley, Alphonse Mucha,",Paragraph
and Louis Comfort Tiffany. Growing public interest was reflected in shows,Paragraph
of Gaudi’s work held at Richmond’s Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (1964),Caption
and New York’s Museum of Modern Art (1966).,Paragraph
Ulrich Conrads and Hans G. Sperlich’s illustrated history Phantastische,Title
Architektur (1960) contained several Gaudi designs and found an even,Paragraph
"wider audience in its English-language edition, The Architecture of",Paragraph
Fantasy: Utopian Building and Planning in Modern Times (1962).,Paragraph
"Published that same year, Antoni Gaudi, by the Barcelona-born Modernist",Paragraph
architect Josep Lluis Sert and James Johnson Sweeney (then director of the,Paragraph
"Guggenheim Museum), stressed not the architect’s phantasmagoric bent but",Paragraph
instead an unexpected pragmatism. As Sweeney and Sert write:,Paragraph
It is curious to note that Gaudi always designed taking into,Paragraph
consideration the practical methods by which his plans could be,Paragraph
carried out. He chose warped surfaces because model makers and,Paragraph
"masons can construct them easily, as both the hyperboloids and the",Paragraph
hyperbolic paraboloids are ruled surfaces which can be easily,Paragraph
"reinforced by straight steel rods, thus providing a considerable",Paragraph
economy.,Paragraph
"Gaudi has never wanted for admirers among his countrymen, but it was",Paragraph
the American architectural historian George R. Collins (1917-1993) of,Paragraph
Columbia University who made a long-overdue reappraisal that became one,Paragraph
of the most successful attempts to elevate an artist’s critical standing in,Paragraph
"modern times. During a 1959 research trip to Spain, Collins came upon a",Paragraph
"large cache of unpublished Gaudi drawings, and the following year",Paragraph
"published Antonio Gaudi, the first English-language monograph on the",Paragraph
"architect (using the then-prevalent Castilian, not the now preferred Catalan,",Paragraph
"version of the subject’s first name). Although only 136 pages long, this tour",Paragraph
de force of concision and insight definitively verifies Gaudi’s structural,Paragraph
genius and remains an unsurpassed introduction. Collins followed his,Paragraph
breakthrough with further publications (including a pioneering,Paragraph
bibliography) and influential exhibitions.,Paragraph
Gaudi’s emergence followed and paralleled that of Rafael Guastavino,Paragraph
"(1842-1908), a decade-older Catalan contractor-builder who studied at the",Paragraph
"same Barcelona technical college where Gaudi later went, and who worked",Paragraph
"for at least one major Gaudi client, the Batll6 textile manufacturing clan.",Paragraph
"Just as Gaudi drew on a host of age-old local construction traditions,",Paragraph
"including a method for spanning large overhead spaces, Guastavino",Paragraph
"regularized and industrialized the lowtech, cost-efficient Catalan method of",Paragraph
tile vaulting. This technique can be traced back to fourteenth-century Spain,Paragraph
but may have had its origins in similar methods devised by the ancient,Paragraph
Romans who colonized Iberia.,Paragraph
"In search of international markets for his tile-vaulting concept,",Paragraph
Guastavino displayed a proposed scheme for “Improving the Healthfulness,Paragraph
of Industrial Towns” at the 1876 Centennial International Exposition in,Paragraph
"Philadelphia, where it won an honorable mention. This encouraged him to",Paragraph
"immigrate to the United States five years later, when he arrived in New",Paragraph
"York with a $40,000 nest egg but soon lost it in a Manhattan tenement",Paragraph
construction speculation. He recovered financially when in 1885 he filed,Paragraph
the first three of his firm’s two dozen patents (a third of which were for,Paragraph
acoustical improvements to make tiled interiors less noisy) for the Arch,Caption
"System, in which thin, grooved, slightly curved terra-cotta tiles are layered",Paragraph
to form a continuous curved surface with more tensile strength than a single,Paragraph
"thicker stratum, and set with fast-drying plaster. His favored mortar—which",Paragraph
"included Portland cement (an early-nineteenth-century invention, mixing",Paragraph
limestone and clay}—added further strength to vaults that were sometimes a,Paragraph
mere two inches thick.,Paragraph
This allowed a space to be spanned without the full scaffolding needed,Paragraph
"for conventional brick or stone vaulting, which supports itself only after the",Paragraph
central keystone is inserted into the apex of an arch. Guastavino’s system,Caption
was quicker and cheaper than traditional masonry methods because it,Paragraph
"significantly reduced labor time and preparatory materials. Furthermore, the",Paragraph
"result was not only sanitary (impervious to damp and rot, plus easy to",Paragraph
"clean) but, most important, fireproof, a widespread public safety concern",Paragraph
following several catastrophic nineteenth-century urban conflagrations.,Paragraph
"Guastavino’s first big American success was his work on McKim, Mead",Paragraph
& White’s Boston Public Library of 1887-1895. In a tour de force of design,Caption
"variation, he came up with different ceiling patterns for each room in the",Paragraph
"large structure, a veritable three-dimensional catalog for his product’s",Paragraph
"versatility. Significantly, he left the handsome structural tile work fully",Paragraph
"exposed rather than covering it with plaster, an attitude that anticipated the",Paragraph
Modernist practice of celebrating functional elements by letting them show.,Paragraph
Thereafter his thriving company supplied Catalan-style roofs and ceilings to,Paragraph
hundreds of architectural firms over the next eight decades.,Paragraph
"In 1961, a crucial connection occurred to Collins at a memorial service in",Paragraph
I. N. Phelps Stokes’s St. Paul’s Chapel of 1904-1907 on the Columbia,Caption
"campus, when he had an epiphany about how closely the structure’s",Paragraph
exposed Guastavino vaulting resembled the work of Gaudi. This eureka,Paragraph
moment changed how architecture scholars understand a crucial chapter in,Paragraph
the history of modern design and suggested a missing link between,Paragraph
"Catalonia and the Americas. A year later, when the Guastavino family",Paragraph
"business folded and its records were about to be discarded, Collins secured",Paragraph
"them for his school’s Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library, an",Paragraph
invaluable act of cultural salvage. The Guastavino office’s meticulous,Paragraph
working drawings allow a full understanding of a structural methodology,Paragraph
"that would otherwise be lost to us today. In fact, many large architectural",Paragraph
firms for whom the family worked would confidently leave portions of their,Paragraph
own blueprints blank but labeled “Guastavino here” to indicate that vaults,Paragraph
would be skillfully filled in by their trusted collaborator. No wonder the city,Paragraph

"though it remains unclear whether that occurred in the town of Reus, where",Paragraph

ancestral village of Riudoms. The architect attributed his innate sense of,Paragraph
"volumetric enclosure to his antecedents’ skilled craftsmanship of boilers,",Paragraph
"kettles, and other heating devices. Whether or not Gaudi’s virtuosic grasp of",Paragraph
"irregular forms was genetic or acquired through close observation, he",Paragraph
"certainly could visualize space in three dimensions, an attribute far from",Paragraph
common among the general public and not to be taken for granted among,Paragraph
"design professionals, either.",Paragraph
As the art historian Gijs van Hensbergen relates in his absorbing Gaudi:,Paragraph
"A Biography (2001), the future architect from an early age displayed an",Paragraph
"exceptional aptitude for mathematics, and as a teenager he and two friends",Paragraph
dreamed up an imaginative if overreaching scheme to tum a derelict local,Paragraph

"There have been numerous studies of Gaudi’s many sources of influence,",Paragraph
especially the authoritative French architect and theorist Eugéne-Emmanuel,Paragraph
"Viollet-le-Duc, whose combination of eclectic historicizing motifs and",Paragraph
modern industrial materials is everywhere evident in Gaudi’s oeuvre. But,Paragraph
there is also a psychological complexity to the Catalan master’s work that,Paragraph
sets him above and apart from not only other European practitioners of his,Paragraph
time but also from the most talented of his contemporaries in Barcelona.,Paragraph
"For all his stunning ingenuity, Gaudi did not emerge from a cultural",Paragraph
"vacuum, and he was but one—albeit the most extravagantly gifted—among",Paragraph
an extraordinary generation of local architects who espoused the new credo,Paragraph
"of Modernisme, the distinctive Catalan variant of Art Nouveau, which drew",Paragraph
heavily on the Romantic revivalist Renaixenga (renaissance) movement of,Paragraph
mid-nineteenth-century Spain.,Paragraph
This brilliant cohort included Lluis Doménech i Montaner (creator of,Paragraph

"competitive display among Barcelona’s new industrial elite, and they vied",Paragraph
with one another in hiring these and other exponents of the new architecture,Paragraph
to design domestic showplaces of unabashed grandeur.,Paragraph
If a tycoon’s town palace could directly advertise the source of his,Paragraph
"wealth, so much the better, as Gaudi achieved with his first major",Paragraph
"residential commission, Casa Vicens (1878-1880), a multicultural",Paragraph
extravaganza for a brick and tile manufacturer that has been restored and is,Paragraph

"craggy, cliff-like elevation and the flowing horizontal lines of the projecting",Paragraph
"cornices on each story, which evoke the layering of geological strata (see",Paragraph
Illustration 2b).,Paragraph
Another hallmark of Gaudi’s architecture is ceramic embellishment.,Paragraph
Although mosaics had been incorporated into buildings since Classical,Paragraph
"antiquity, he eschewed purpose-made components and instead appropriated",Paragraph
irregular shards of domestic pottery in a Catalan technique called trencadis.,Paragraph
Irregular pieces of broken dishes and teacups are readily identifiable on the,Paragraph
crazy-quilt surfaces of several of the architect’s constructions in the Park,Caption
"Giiell (1900-1914), where a quite unmenacing trencadis-encrusted dragon",Paragraph

to revisit the major masters over and over again while finding fresh reasons,Paragraph
for their relevance.,Paragraph
"Barry Bergdoll, the Columbia professor who served as the Museum of",Paragraph
"Modern Art’s chief curator of architecture and design from 2007 to 2013,",Paragraph
confronted that dilemma when he was asked to curate a show at MoMA in,Paragraph
honor of Frank Lloyd Wright’s sesquicentennial in 2017. The result was,Paragraph
“Frank Lloyd Wright at 150: Unpacking the Archive” (which he organized,Title
"with Jennifer Gray, a project research assistant at MoMA), and it turned out",Paragraph
to be a more hazardous proposition than its universally beloved subject,Paragraph
might have indicated. Despite the seeming effortlessness with which,Paragraph
MoMA has spun out popular Picasso and Matisse shows decade after,Paragraph
"decade, Bergdoll wanted to avoid rehashing its 1994 Wright retrospective or",Paragraph
repeating material covered in more specialized exhibitions on the architect,Paragraph
held in New York at the Whitney in 1997 and the Guggenheim in 2009.,Paragraph
He decided instead to organize this anniversary tribute around a mere,Paragraph
"twelve projects, including rarely discussed unexecuted designs such as",Paragraph
Wright’s Depression-era plans for a self-sufficient agricultural community,Title
and his postwar scheme for the world’s tallest skyscraper. These and others,Paragraph
"were illuminated by some 450 drawings, documents, photographs, models,",Paragraph
and architectural fragments selected from the mountain of objects obtained,Paragraph
by MoMA and Columbia’s Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library when,Paragraph
they took possession of the architect’s archives from the economically,Paragraph
troubled Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation in 2012. Financial details of the,Paragraph
"arrangement were never been revealed, but it was rumored that a transfer of",Paragraph
"money was involved, on terms said to be very favorable for the acquiring",Paragraph
institutions.,Paragraph
The sheer numbers involved in this transcontinental move were,Paragraph
"staggering: 55,000 drawings, 300,000 sheets of correspondence, 125,000",Paragraph
"photographs, 2,700 manuscripts, and a panoply of miscellanea, including",Caption
"architectural details, working and presentation models, documentary films,",Paragraph
"and home movies, all of which had been kept at Taliesin in Spring Green,",Paragraph
"Wisconsin, and Taliesin West, the foundation’s headquarters in Scottsdale,",Paragraph
"Arizona. (The archive is now on the Columbia campus, with conservation",Paragraph
done at the museum.),Paragraph
There is a piquant irony to the final disposition of Wright’s architectural,Paragraph
"estate, for this supreme egotist never forgave MoMA for what he deemed",Paragraph
the slighting treatment he received from Philip Johnson and Henry-Russell,Paragraph
Hitchcock in their epochal “Modern Architecture: International Exhibition”,Title
"of 1932, which he felt should have revolved around him, his characteristic",Paragraph
"worldview. Tellingly enough, “Frank Lloyd Wright at 150” was the",Paragraph
"eleventh MoMA exhibition in which he has been included, and although",Paragraph
"some of those were relatively minor mountings devoted to single projects,",Paragraph
Wright has tallied more cumulative gallery time there than any other,Paragraph
architect (even though Ludwig Mies van der Rohe has been given three solo,Paragraph
"retrospectives, another MoMA architectural record).",Paragraph
"To arrive at the dozen projects featured in the exhibition, Bergdoll asked",Paragraph
each member of a team of scholars to select a single work from the archive,Paragraph
—the less familiar the better—and discuss it in depth. Although MoMA,Paragraph
officials proudly stressed that they engaged a younger generation of,Paragraph
"untapped talent instead of what Bergdoll called “the usual suspects,” only",Paragraph
"two of the catalog’s sixteen authors were in their thirties, with more than",Paragraph
"half older than fifty, and five in their sixties and seventies.",Paragraph
These demographics seem to confirm what academicians wamed of,Paragraph
decades ago: that the restrictive control of the master’s archives for a,Paragraph
"quarter-century after his death in 1959 by his widow, Olgivanna (who died",Paragraph
"in 1985), would set back Wright studies for a full generation, if not longer.",Paragraph
Dissertation advisers prudently steered doctoral candidates away from,Paragraph
Wright topics because of the extortionate research and reproduction fees,Paragraph
"charged at that time by his foundation, as well as the editorial approval it",Paragraph
demanded for publications that used material from the Taliesin archive. The,Paragraph
rise of poststructuralist criticism further eroded younger scholars’ interest in,Paragraph
an architect whose uniquely personal approach to architecture had little to,Paragraph
do with the period’s fascination with linguistic theory.,Paragraph
The detailed attention given in “Wright at 150” to discrete aspects of his,Paragraph
"output rather than its broad outlines risked a certain unevenness, and lesser-",Paragraph
"known work by great artists is often obscure for good reason. Happily,",Paragraph
"despite its many participants, the show cohered better than one had",Paragraph
"expected. It included renderings of many projects well known to the public,",Paragraph
"including Unity Temple of 1905-1908 in Oak Park, Illinois, an inward-",Paragraph

streamlined reconception of the corporate workplace as a light-filled forest,Paragraph
"grove; and Taliesin West of 1936-1959, the architect’s mirage-like desert",Paragraph
home and studio.,Paragraph
A highlight of the exhibition was Bergdoll’s investigation of Wright’s,Paragraph
hypothetical Mile-High Illinois skyscraper of 1956—a 528-story tower,Paragraph
intended for an unspecified site in Chicago and nearly twice as high as the,Paragraph
"tallest building executed since then—which made one wonder why, given",Paragraph
"the postmillennial mania for super-tall, super-thin engineering, it has taken",Paragraph
"so long for this stupendous oddity, more publicity stunt than serious",Paragraph
"proposal, to be reexamined so thoughtfully. Bergdoll interprets the",Paragraph
"architect’s eight-foot-tall, foot-and-a-half-wide presentation drawing, which",Paragraph
"resembles some ancient scroll when opened to its full height, as a revealing",Paragraph
artistic last will and testament prepared for posterity three years before his,Paragraph
death at ninety-one. On it the needle-like visionary structure extends from,Paragraph
the bottom—where its “taproot” foundation burrows into the earth as deep,Paragraph
"as the Empire State Building is tall—to little over the halfway mark, with",Paragraph
lengthy autobiographical inscriptions occupying the uppermost portions.,Paragraph
The two other most engrossing schemes selected for the show,Paragraph
emphasized Wright’s long engagement with several of the most advanced,Paragraph
"currents in American society. This began in infancy when his mother, Anna",Paragraph
"Lloyd Jones Wright, introduced him to the innovative pedagogical practices",Paragraph
of the German education reformer Friedrich Frébel; continued throughout,Paragraph
his youth with exposure to the preaching of his renowned social activist and,Paragraph
"pacifist uncle, the Unitarian minister Jenkin Lloyd Jones; included",Paragraph
"immersion in the early twentieth century’s most advanced feminist ideas,",Paragraph
which were shared by his freethinking companion Mamah Borthwick; and,Paragraph
"extended to ecological preservation, as signified by his being made an",Paragraph
"honorary member of the Friends of Our Native Landscape, an early",Paragraph
environmental advocacy group founded in 1913. (Wright’s subsequent,Paragraph
support for the isolationist America First Committee between the outbreak,Title
of World War I in Europe and Pearl Harbor is often seen as a conservative,Paragraph
"retreat from those formative progressive principles, but he always insisted",Paragraph
that his opposition to US involvement in foreign conflicts was solely,Paragraph
"pacifist, not political.)",Paragraph
Although Wright’s principal response to the Great Depression is,Paragraph
commonly seen as his founding in 1932 of the Taliesin Fellowship—the,Paragraph
idealistic work-study commune that served as both an architecture school,Paragraph
and his architectural office—between the world wars he accepted two,Paragraph
commissions that displayed his ability to imaginatively rethink social,Paragraph
issues. The Little Farms Unit project of 1932-1933 was intended for a,Paragraph
back-to-the-land initiative on Long Island that would have fostered small,Paragraph
regional agriculture as a means of making people self-sufficient at a time of,Paragraph
widespread economic collapse and catastrophic unemployment (see,Title
"Illustration 3b). The low-rise, streamlined, multipurpose food-processing",Paragraph
and marketing facility that Wright devised as a replicable prototype for this,Paragraph
experiment in moder subsistence farming was underwritten by the,Paragraph
businessman Walter V. Davidson.,Paragraph
"A former advertising executive for the Larkin Soap Company, whose",Paragraph
"monumental Buffalo headquarters of 1903-1906 Wright designed,",Caption
Davidson commissioned a Prairie House from the architect in 1908 (as did,Paragraph
"Darwin D. Martin, another Larkin executive whose Buffalo residence of",Paragraph
1903-1905 is now open to the public). Decades later Davidson returned to,Paragraph
"Wright to help realize this utopian rural rescue mission, which never moved",Paragraph
beyond the planning stage despite Davidson’s obsessive projections.,Paragraph
Wright’s sleekly Modernist concept looks more like the contemporaneous,Paragraph
"work of the Dutch De Stijl architect J. J. P. Oud, and both the jaunty model",Paragraph
unearthed for the show and the inspiring story behind it made this a major,Paragraph
rediscovery.,Paragraph
Of equal significance as socially motivated design is Wright’s unrealized,Paragraph
Rosenwald School of 1928 for the Hampton Normal and Agricultural,Title
Institute in Virginia (see Illustration 3a). Sponsored by the Chicago,Paragraph
"philanthropist Julius Rosenwald—president and later chairman of Sears,",Paragraph
"Roebuck and Company, then the world’s largest catalog retailer—the",Paragraph
project was meant to give architectural distinction to a charitable vocational,Paragraph
education program dedicated to freeing poor rural blacks from an,Paragraph
intractable cycle of poverty. Wright’s scheme departed from the neo-,Paragraph
Colonial daintiness of previous designs that had been pursued under the,Paragraph
"widely admired “Hampton Ideal,” and proposed a cloister-like unit",Paragraph
"dominated by a dramatic central structure, with twin-peaked roofs as if two",Paragraph
"A-frame houses had been laterally conjoined, quite unlike the earth-hugging",Paragraph
structures generally associated with him. In her probing analysis of this,Paragraph
"long-lost scheme for the MoMA catalog, Mabel O. Wilson, a professor at",Paragraph
"the Columbia architecture school, does not rationalize the paternalistic",Paragraph
undertone of racial condescension inescapable in Wright’s hope that,Paragraph
through his design “the Darkies would have something that belonged to,Paragraph
them. Something exterior of their own lively interior color and charm.”,Paragraph
"Indeed, to say that Wright—born just two years after the death of",Paragraph
Abraham Lincoln (and originally named Frank Lincoln Wright in memory,Title
of the martyred president}h—was simply echoing the prevalent racial,Paragraph
attitudes of his time might seem like special pleading. But others who knew,Paragraph
"him well, including his longtime official photographer, the Mexican-",Paragraph
"American Pedro E. Guerrero, who himself was subjected to bigotry in the",Paragraph
"pre-war Southwest, have averred that amid the racism of mid-twentieth-",Paragraph
"century America, Wright was at heart among the least prejudiced men they",Paragraph
had ever known.,Paragraph
Although Wright was a born draftsman—as proven by his intricate yet,Paragraph
"ethereal early drawings, such as his 1892 depiction of a bronze gate for the",Paragraph
"Wainwright Tomb in St. Louis, designed by his boss Louis Sullivan—from",Caption
the very start of his independent practice the following year he hired,Paragraph
talented renderers to create presentation drawings of his projects. The 2017,Paragraph
exhibition went to great lengths to stress this fact by identifying specific,Paragraph
"hands at various points in his career, especially one of Wright’s earliest",Paragraph
"collaborators, Marion Mahony.",Caption
"Like Wright, Mahony was entranced by the woodblock prints of Japanese",Paragraph
masters that had become all the rage among Western artists during the,Paragraph
second half of the nineteenth century. Her delicately toned rendering of one,Paragraph
lesser-known Prairie House—his DeRhodes residence of 1906 in South,Paragraph
"Bend, Indiana—mimics the flattened planes, strong outlines, and suggestive",Paragraph
"voids typical of the ukiyo-e style. Lest this point be lost on us, beneath her",Paragraph
"signature she added, “After FLLW and Hiroshige.” Wright, who had a",Paragraph
deeply acquisitive streak that impelled him to buy beautiful things even,Paragraph
"when he could not pay his grocer’s bills, amassed such a large hoard of",Paragraph
Japanese graphics that like many other compulsive but impecunious,Paragraph
"collectors he perforce became a dealer, both to balance his books and to",Paragraph
further feed his habit.,Paragraph
"In 1913, when Wright’s architectural practice had come to a veritable halt",Paragraph
because of the public outrage he caused by leaving the mother of his six,Paragraph
"children and setting up housekeeping with Mamah Borthwick, a client’s",Paragraph
"wife, he traveled to Japan with the express purpose of raising cash by",Paragraph
"buying and selling prints. Bankrolled by two rich Boston aesthetes, the",Paragraph
"Spaulding brothers, the out-of-work architect, as he later wrote,",Paragraph
established a considerable buying power and anything available in the,Paragraph
ordinary channels came first to me . . . until I had spent about one,Paragraph
hundred and twenty-five thousand Spaulding dollars for about a,Paragraph
million dollars’ worth of prints.,Paragraph
Proof of Wright’s discriminating eye was evident in another,Paragraph
"sesquicentennial exhibition, small but exquisite, “The Formation of the",Paragraph

"Wright and the Prairie School,” at the museum where the architect arranged",Paragraph
"a show with some of the same pieces in 1908, not least to create a local",Paragraph
market for his lucrative sideline.,Paragraph
Because of further personal scandals (the murder of Borthwick and her,Paragraph
children at Taliesin in 1914; a sordid divorce from his second wife; and the,Paragraph
"birth of a final child, out of wedlock), as well as changing architectural",Paragraph
"tastes—which encompassed the demise of the Arts and Crafts Movement, a",Paragraph
"resurgent Classical revival in the US, and the emergence of more radical",Paragraph
forms of Modernism in Europe—Wright saw his job prospects go dormant,Paragraph
for a crucial midlife decade when architects customarily receive their most,Paragraph
important commissions. It was only the sheer force of his titanic will and,Paragraph
capacity to constantly readapt his protean talents to new conditions—for,Paragraph
example by taking up the new technique of concrete-block construction in,Paragraph
Southern California during the 1920s and devising affordable “Usonian”,Paragraph
houses for middle-class Americans in the 1930s—that gave him a,Paragraph
"triumphant second career during his final quarter-century, wholly different",Paragraph
from but comparable in inventiveness to his Prairie School period of 1900-,Paragraph
"1914,",Title
Once he at long last shifted into that unbroken two-decade professional,Paragraph
"upswing after the late 1930s, he spent even more time exploiting his public",Paragraph
persona. The degree to which he became America’s most recognizable,Paragraph
architect between Stanford White and Philip Johnson through his skillful,Paragraph
manipulation of mass media—two film clips record his disarmingly deft,Paragraph
"star turns on 1950s TV talk and quiz shows, with deadpan timing worthy of",Paragraph
Jack Benny—speaks to his acute understanding of celebrity culture in this,Paragraph
"country. Yet for all his serial self-reinventions, Wright never lost sight of his",Paragraph
core mission of reshaping architecture into a wholly consistent reflection of,Paragraph
democratic American values as he understood them.,Paragraph
"The care, audacity, and originality with which Wright orchestrated the",Paragraph
public presentation of his revolutionary architecture from start to finish—,Paragraph
thereby finessing its positive critical reception—is laid out with exceptional,Paragraph
thoroughness in Kathryn Smith’s Wright on Exhibit: Frank Lloyd Wright’s,Paragraph
Architectural Exhibitions (2017). Despite its apparently circumscribed,Paragraph
"subject matter, the book widens into an intriguing treatise on career",Paragraph
development and is so illuminatingly detailed that it gives a richer portrait,Paragraph
"of Wright than many full-length biographies. It would be hard, for example,",Paragraph
"to find a clearer, more concise, and yet poetic summation of Wright’s",Paragraph
quantum leap at the dawn of the twentieth century than Smith’s description,Paragraph
of the typical Prairie House and Wright’s concomitant introduction of the,Paragraph
"open plan, a pivotal moment in the history of modern architecture:",Paragraph
A major conceptual breakthrough that he made early on was the,Paragraph
realization that mechanical heating made it no longer necessary to,Paragraph
close rooms off from each other to conserve heat. This discovery led to,Paragraph
"the open plan in public spaces—for instance, where the living room",Paragraph
opened to the dining room on a diagonal—while maintaining,Paragraph
compartmentalized rooms for services. With the hearth no longer used,Paragraph
"as the major source of heat, Wright was free to use it as a freestanding",Paragraph
vertical plane in space.,Paragraph
The other major advance represented by the Prairie House was the,Paragraph
rejection of the wall as the traditional solid barrier between inside and,Paragraph
outside. . . . He broke the wall down into a series of elements such as,Paragraph
"piers, flat planes, and window bands—all geometrically organized by",Paragraph
dark wood strips. The wall was now defined as an enclosure of space.,Paragraph
"Windows were no longer holes punched through a mass, but a light",Paragraph
screen filtering sunlight into the interior. The movement out toward the,Paragraph
"landscape was amplified by the addition of porches, terraces, flower",Paragraph
"boxes, and planter urns. .. .",Paragraph
"The straight line of the horizon became the low sheltering roof, trees",Paragraph
and flowers were abstracted as geometric patterns in the art glass,Paragraph
"windows, and leaves contributed their autumnal palette to the plaster",Paragraph
surfaces.,Paragraph
Confirmation of Wright’s incomparable and enduring popularity is,Paragraph
inescapable when one goes to any of the more than 140 buildings by him,Paragraph
open to visitors in the United States and Japan (about one third of his total,Paragraph
"executed output). In contrast to most modem architectural venues, his",Paragraph
buildings attract a broad cross section of nonspecialists who may not even,Paragraph
be regular museum visitors. Clearly something about Wright speaks to the,Paragraph
general public in a way that the work of no other architect does. Drawing,Paragraph
the highest attendance figures of any of the master’s buildings is the,Paragraph

The most curious publication to appear during his sesquicentennial year,Paragraph
"was The Life of Olgivanna Lloyd Wright, a biography of the architect’s third",Paragraph
"and last wife, whom he married in 1928. It was compiled by Bruce Brooks",Paragraph
"Pfeiffer, a former Wright apprentice who went on to become the longtime",Paragraph

"out this incomplete story, Pfeiffer and Fawcett-Yeske augmented it with",Paragraph
"large excerpts from her several autobiographical books, and the result is",Paragraph
most tactfully characterized by the coeditors’ own description of it as a,Paragraph
“labor of love.”,Paragraph
During the dark years of Wright scholarship before Olgivanna Wright’s,Paragraph
"death, Pfeiffer worked valiantly behind the scenes to be of as much help as",Paragraph
possible to writers—this one included—without incurring the wrath of the,Paragraph
"volatile woman he had come to regard as a surrogate mother. Pfeiffer, who",Paragraph
died on the very last day of Wright’s sesquicentennial year at the age of,Paragraph
"eighty-seven, arrived at the Taliesin Fellowship as a worshipful nineteen-",Paragraph
"year-old, and like the outlook of most of the other young people drawn to",Paragraph
"the master’s presence, his was formed by the powerful communal spirit of",Paragraph
"the organization, which hovered somewhere between that of a supportive",Paragraph
"extended family, an intrigue-ridden royal court, and a quasi-religious cult.",Paragraph

Much of Olgivanna Wright’s reminiscences deal with how she and her,Paragraph

delights of his cultural stardom. Contrary to her dour image as his ferocious,Paragraph
"protector, the chatelaine of Taliesin was not without humor, some of it",Paragraph
"unintentional, as is evident in her account of the architect’s attempt to",Paragraph
persuade Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas to visit the couple at Taliesin,Paragraph
"after a reading given by Stein in Madison, Wisconsin. Though his northern",Paragraph
"headquarters was within easy driving distance, the Parisian ladies demurred.",Paragraph
Mrs. Wright recalled:,Paragraph
"[Stein] smiled while Alice Toklas kept repeating in Steinian style, “No,",Paragraph
"thank you. Thank you, no. We are flying to Minneapolis tonight. We",Paragraph

Frank still held to his faith and pursued his course: “Taliesin is,Paragraph
"beautiful,” he said. “We have a group of talented young people who",Paragraph
will be interested to meet you. They can drive you to Minneapolis.”,Paragraph
"Miss Toklas answered, “Oh, but we love to fly.”",Paragraph
"Then Gertrude Stein spoke, “We do really. Really we do like to fly.",Paragraph
We always fly everywhere because we like to fly.”,Paragraph
"The gorgon-like Olgivanna Wright could not, however, resist one final",Paragraph

"realms, including the music of Gustav Mahler and Amold Schoenberg, the",Paragraph
"painting of Gustav Klimt and Oskar Kokoschka, and the writings of Arthur",Paragraph
Schnitzler and Sigmund Freud. Yet the singular contributions to the visual,Paragraph
arts that the Viennese made during this epoch have never loomed large,Paragraph
enough in general chronicles of Modernism.,Paragraph
The constant rewriting of art history is not solely the province of critics,Paragraph
and scholars; cultural institutions exert enormous influence on the way the,Paragraph
past is perceived. This has been demonstrated most forcefully by the strong,Paragraph
"Francophile bias of New York’s Museum of Modern Art, whose founding",Paragraph
"director, Alfred H. Barr Jr., set out a Gallocentric narrative of Modernism—",Paragraph
a begat-begat-begat genealogy that began with Cézanne and posited Cubism,Paragraph
as the central development of twentieth-century art. Barr’s highly selective,Paragraph
"account deeply affected received opinion for many decades. However, even",Paragraph
some loyal supporters of MoMA became aware of how much has been,Paragraph
"neglected because of Barr’s preferences. Among them is Ronald Lauder, the",Paragraph
"New York cosmetics heir, art collector, and longtime trustee of the Modern,",Paragraph
who served as its board chairman from 1995 to 2005 and cofounded the,Paragraph
"Neue Galerie, a privately funded Manhattan museum devoted to Austrian",Paragraph
"and German Modernism, in 2001.",Paragraph
"The idea for the Neue Galerie began with Serge Sabarsky, a Vienna-born,",Paragraph
New York-based dealer in Expressionist art who in 1993 bought a Beaux,Paragraph
Arts mansion on the corner of Fifth Avenue and East 86th Street and started,Paragraph
a foundation devoted to advancing awareness of that underrepresented,Paragraph
"work. After Sabarsky’s death in 1996, his friend and client Lauder took",Paragraph
over the as-yet-unrealized project and created what has become an,Paragraph
"indispensable part of the city’s cultural life, not least because the Neue",Paragraph
Galerie’s high standards of programming and presentation have almost,Paragraph
single-handedly redressed MoMA’s systematic overemphasis on the School,Paragraph
of Paris. This upstart institution’s importance was never more clearly,Paragraph
"demonstrated than with its 2017 exhibition “Wiener Werkstatte, 1903-1932:",Paragraph
"The Luxury of Beauty,” a comprehensive survey of the applied arts",Paragraph
"collective founded in Vienna by the architect Josef Hoffmann, the artist",Paragraph
"Koloman Moser, and the patron and collector Fritz Waerndorfer.",Paragraph
The Wiener Werkstaétte (Viennese Workshops) was a direct offshoot of,Paragraph
"the Vienna Secession, the maverick faction of avant-garde painters,",Paragraph
"sculptors, and architects established in 1897 by Hoffmann, Klimt, Moser,",Paragraph
"and the architect Joseph Maria Olbrich, when they seceded from the",Paragraph
stultifyingly conservative Union of Austrian Artists in search of more,Paragraph
adventurous creative opportunities. (Olbrich designed its Vienna,Paragraph
"headquarters and exhibition hall, the Secession Building of 1897-1898, a",Caption
mysteriously windowless structure topped with an openwork dome,Caption
"composed of three thousand gilded bronze laurel leaves, which wags",Paragraph
"instantly dubbed das goldene Krauthappel—the golden cabbage head, in",Paragraph
local slang.) This breakaway confraternity in turn led to the establishment,Paragraph
of the Wiener Werkstdtte six years afterward. And although Hoffmann,Paragraph
broke with the Secession in 1905 because of internecine conflicts about,Paragraph
exactly how they should pursue their avowed common goal of the,Paragraph
"Gesamtkunstwerk (total work of art), these young revolutionaries all shared",Paragraph
values that were at the very heart of the Austrian avant-garde.,Paragraph
The Neue Galerie exhibition made a wholly convincing case for the,Paragraph
Wiener Werkstatte’s brief efflorescence of incomparably exquisite high-,Paragraph
"style design, which included furniture, glassware, ceramics, metalwork both",Paragraph
"precious and base, jewelry, wallpaper, fabrics, graphic design, and the",Paragraph
charming artists’ postcards with which the art alliance inexpensively,Paragraph
propagandized its ambitious agenda. With particularly piquancy it,Paragraph
juxtaposed many works by Dagobert Peche —the Wiener Werkstatte,Paragraph
stalwart who might be seen as the organization’s id because of his,Paragraph
"untrammeled and often disruptive inventiveness—with those of Hoffmann,",Paragraph
the group’s rational superego. And although several scholars have already,Paragraph
"proposed this notion, the show and its magisterial catalog, now the basic",Paragraph
"reference on the subject, confirmed that the Wiener Werkstatte was no less",Paragraph
than the missing link between Art Nouveau and Art Deco.,Paragraph
Stereotypical notions of the group and its clientele have perpetuated,Paragraph
clichés of a decadent imperial society obliviously waltzing on the rim of a,Paragraph
"political volcano. To be sure, the rarefied objects produced by this",Paragraph
decorative-arts consortium now seem characteristic of a pre-Great War,Paragraph
culture of plutocratic privilege—in stark contrast to the output of the,Paragraph
"Bauhaus, which was founded the year after that devastating conflict ended.",Paragraph
But because the Wiener Werkstatte managed to persist beyond the downfall,Paragraph
of the Austro-Hungarian Empire for more than a decade—a period no less,Paragraph
economically difficult for greatly diminished Austria than for its co-,Paragraph
combatant Germany—it is incorrect to see it as a cultural hothouse flower.,Paragraph
The Wiener Werkstatte went through several successive phases to survive,Paragraph
"financially, and if one of its many product lines was not selling, there was",Paragraph
no philosophical compunction against coming up with something,Title
"completely different to please consumers, at least within its expansive",Paragraph
stylistic parameters. This noble experiment in radical design was nothing,Paragraph
"less than a conduit for a richly multicultural, if politically untenable, society",Paragraph
that was coming apart at the seams bit by bit. Although there are strong,Paragraph
underpinnings of Classicism in many of its designs—such as Hoffmann’s,Paragraph
"famous brass centerpiece (circa 1924), a fluted, footed bowl with",Paragraph
extravagant curlicue handles that spiral wildly outward with irresistible,Paragraph
insouciance—this tension between tight control and wild abandon gives the,Paragraph
Wiener Werkstatte’s creations a contradictory quality so much in tune with,Paragraph
"that time, and ours as well.",Paragraph
Apart from the duality of so many individual Wiener Werkstatte designs,Paragraph
"—which often juxtaposed urban sophistication and peasant vitality, as in",Paragraph
Vally Wieselthier’s ceramic sculptures of women who seem equal part,Paragraph
jaded showgirl and feckless milkmaid—the group’s broad range defies easy,Paragraph
definition. In its more folkloristic manifestations one can detect an affinity,Paragraph
"for the Magyar side of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, while evocations of a",Paragraph
far older empire—the Byzantine—are evident in jewelry designs such as,Paragraph
"Hoffmann’s rectilinear brooches, so densely encrusted with multicolored",Paragraph
semiprecious stones that they recall the jewels of the empress Theodora as,Paragraph
depicted in the Ravenna mosaics. It now seems incredible that one company,Paragraph
could turn out both Bertold Léffler’s anorexic stoneware bud vases (circa,Paragraph
1906) and then a year later Michael Powolny’s chubby ceramic putti,Paragraph
representing the four seasons (high-style precursors of the kitschig Hummel,Paragraph
"figurines first made in 1935). Moser’s silver-and-niello sugar box of 1903, a",Paragraph
cubic form further reinforced by its all-over black-and-silver-checked,Paragraph
"surface, is as severe as a Donald Judd sculpture. Conversely, Peche’s",Paragraph
bombastic walnut writing desk of 1922 is so massive and overwrought that,Paragraph
it could be best described as Babylonian Baroque. Yet they all bore the,Paragraph
superimposed double-W label devised for the firm by Moser (who also,Paragraph
"came up with distinctive initialed logos for each of its participating artists),",Paragraph
and one cannot say that any single aesthetic represents the Wiener,Paragraph
"Werkstatte, which can only be understood in all its bewildering complexity.",Paragraph
The group faced the same basic problem that bedeviled several of its,Paragraph
"earlier counterparts in the British Arts and Crafts Movement, including the",Paragraph
"Century Guild of Artists, established by Arthur Mackmurdo in 1883; the",Paragraph
"Art Workers’ Guild, founded in 1884 by the architect William Lethaby and",Paragraph
others; and C. R. Ashbee’s Guild and School of Handicraft (1888). Each of,Paragraph
them was self-consciously modeled after medieval craftsmen’s guilds,Paragraph
"(though with less emphasis on exclusionary job protection, a central",Paragraph
element of those precursors of modern labor unions). They all espoused a,Paragraph
return to preindustrial fabrication methods and a commitment to bringing,Paragraph
good design to the masses. Yet they wound up producing objects—even,Paragraph
those not made from intrinsically precious materials—that were so labor-,Paragraph
intensive that they could never compete with machine-made items that the,Paragraph
"working class could afford, and thus became luxury goods for the rich.",Paragraph
Design reform groups that were established along conventional business,Paragraph
models fared better financially than their utopian counterparts. William,Paragraph
"Morris’s London-based home furnishings concern, Morris & Co. (as it was",Paragraph
"renamed in 1875 to capitalize on its mastermind’s increasing renown),",Paragraph
"weathered successive changes in popular taste and lasted until 1940, forced",Paragraph
out of business only by the Blitz.,Paragraph
"Interestingly, it was not the earnest Morris, a crusading socialist, to",Paragraph
"whom the Vienna avant-garde gravitated among British designers, but",Paragraph
"rather the Scottish architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh, whose work was",Paragraph
darker and more emotionally complex than the heartily straightforward,Paragraph
ethos of the Arts and Crafts Movement. Not for nothing was Mackintosh’s,Paragraph
"Glasgow circle called “The Spook School,” in response to the wraithlike",Paragraph
"quality and spiritual subtext of its decorative schemes. Indeed, one of the",Paragraph
Wiener Werkstatte’s signature motifs—repetitive right-angled grids in wood,Paragraph
"or metalwork—came directly from Mackintosh, and the group’s prime",Paragraph
mover was nicknamed “Quadrat-Hoffmann” because of his extreme,Paragraph
fondness for square patterns. Mackintosh’s designs were extensively,Paragraph
published in the new half-tone-illustrated international applied art journals,Paragraph
"(especially The Studio, founded in London in 1893, and Deutsche Kunst",Paragraph
"und Dekoration, established in Darmstadt in 1897) that allowed a rapid and",Paragraph
reciprocal exchange of design ideas across great distances. He also met,Paragraph
several of his Viennese admirers in 1902 at the First International,Paragraph
"Exposition of Modern Decorative Arts in Turin, which led the Wiener",Paragraph
"Werkstatte’s greatest early benefactor, Fritz Waerndorfer, to commission a",Paragraph
music room for his suburban Vienna villa from Mackintosh despite the,Paragraph
abundance of local talent available to him. This otherworldly environment,Paragraph
"was completed in 1903, the year that the Wiener Werkstaétte opened for",Paragraph
business.,Paragraph
The economic premise of early design reform groups was always shaky.,Paragraph
"The Bauhaus was a rare exception, thanks to its being a state-sponsored",Paragraph
"school (hence its official name, Staatliches Bauhaus) and thus free from the",Paragraph
financial pressures of a commercial enterprise. In due course its numerous,Paragraph
design patents and licensing agreements (especially the hugely popular,Paragraph
"Bauhaus wallpaper lines) brought in a steady if not enormous income that,",Paragraph
"with admirable equity, was parceled out to students who devised the",Paragraph
"product prototypes in their workshop classes. The Wiener Werkstatte, in",Paragraph
"contrast, was a money pit from its inception. This has long been known, but",Paragraph
the most comprehensive account yet of the group’s parlous finances is laid,Paragraph
out in disheartening detail by Ernst Ploil in the 2017 Neue Galerie,Paragraph
exhibition catalog. Ploil sums up the Wiener Werkstatte’s economic,Paragraph
dilemma by quoting a letter from Hoffmann to the Belgian engineer and,Paragraph
financier Adolphe Stoclet—patron of the architect’s Gesamtkunstwerk,Paragraph
"masterpiece, the Palais Stoclet of 1905-1911 in Brussels (see Illustration",Caption
4b). As Hoffmann wrote:,Paragraph
The lady [Miss Wittgenstein] wanted (for months now) two,Paragraph
"candelabra, each two meters tall, of gilded wood. Finally the drawings",Paragraph
"were finished and correct, and a cost estimate was drawn up in my",Paragraph
"absence. That alone is madness, since it is simply impossible to",Paragraph
produce a cost estimate for an object you haven’t yet made... .,Paragraph
"Fortunately, Miss Wittgenstein came and said the estimate was too",Paragraph
high. And at that moment I already told her that we were freed of any,Paragraph
obligation because she did not accept the estimate and that now we,Paragraph
"will not make the candelabras at any price, because we no longer make",Paragraph
unique objects. ...,Paragraph
"“Strange,” said Miss Wittgenstein, “and we always thought you",Paragraph
were getting extremely rich from these commissions.” And I said to,Paragraph
her: “You can best see just how much such commissions can enrich us,Paragraph
(she wanted to pay eight thousand crowns [equal to more than,Paragraph
"$100,000 today] for the candelabras) from the fact that now we simply",Paragraph
no longer accept such commissions.”,Paragraph
"Miss Wittgenstein (an unspecified sister of Ludwig’s, perhaps the future",Paragraph
"Margaret Stonborough-Wittgenstein, who was painted by Klimt in 1905)",Paragraph
was a member of a steel-manufacturing dynasty that had converted from,Paragraph
"Judaism to Protestantism and was the second richest in Austria, after the",Paragraph
Rothschilds. And as Christian Witt-Dorring explains in the catalog:,Paragraph
The Werkstatte was supported by a small group of artists and primarily,Paragraph
Jewish wealthy families that were relatives or friends or were,Paragraph
connected by economic interests and backed the project of Vienna’s,Paragraph
artistic springtime with their commissions. The members of the Jewish,Paragraph
families had generally assimilated into Vienna’s Christian culture in,Paragraph
the second generation after Austria-Hungary’s Jewish population,Title
obtained full civil rights from around 1860. Their desire to integrate fit,Paragraph
well with . . . [the] search for a modern Austrian style . . . which,Paragraph
"gained acceptance in the international market as the “Vienna style,”",Paragraph
[and] offered the assimilated Jewish population the potential of a,Paragraph
feeling of belonging that was not defined in terms of nation.,Paragraph
"Another mainstay of the Wiener Werskstatte was the Primavesi family,",Paragraph
descended from Italian Jewish bankers who during the eighteenth century,Paragraph
emigrated from Lombardy to Moravia (now part of the Czech Republic but,Paragraph
ruled by the Austrians from 1809 to 1918). Hoffmann designed two large,Paragraph
residential schemes for members of that clan. He carried out a complete,Paragraph
interior remodeling of the baronial Primavesi Country House near the,Caption
Moravian town of Winkelsdorf (1913-1914) for the entrepreneur and,Paragraph
parliament member Otto Primavesi. And for Otto’s younger cousin and,Paragraph
"brother-in-law, the banker and industrialist Robert Primavesi, and his wife,",Paragraph
"Josefine Skywa, he created the neo-Classical Villa Skywa-Primavesi in",Paragraph
"Vienna (1913-1915), which includes a large formal garden (as does the",Paragraph
Palais Stoclet). Otto Primavesi took over Waerndorfer’s role as the,Paragraph
"commercial director of the Wiener Werkstatte in 1915, and he and Robert",Paragraph
became its principal underwriters after Waerndorfer’s financial collapse.,Paragraph
The idealistic but impractical Waerndorfer came from yet another rich,Paragraph
"Jewish family, whose profitable cotton mills allowed him to realize his",Paragraph
aesthetic dreams. Yet this true believer’s unstinting support of the Wiener,Paragraph
Werkstatte soon had disastrous economic consequences. As Witt-Dérring,Paragraph
"writes, “Waerndorfer’s absolute faith in Hoffmann’s genius oscillated",Paragraph
between the extremes of ‘Can I afford it?’ and ‘I owe it to the world to,Paragraph
"afford it,’” but the latter attitude invariably won out. This Maecenas’s",Paragraph
"willful lack of caution eventually impoverished him, to the extent that he",Paragraph
"immigrated to the US, became an artist, and during the Great Depression",Paragraph
"took up farming in a Philadelphia suburb, where he died a month before the",Paragraph
outbreak of World War IL.,Paragraph
"Josef Franz Maria Hoffmann, the beneficiary of Waerndorfer’s unstinting",Paragraph
"if perhaps foolhardy support, was born in 1870 in a small Moravian town",Paragraph
where his father was mayor. The Hoffmanns were Catholic and,Paragraph
"Deutschmdhrer (German Moravians), an ethnic and linguistic minority",Paragraph
(about one third of the predominantly Czech region’s population) better,Paragraph
"known by the 1930s as Sudeten Germans, whom Hitler used as his pretext",Paragraph
for breaking up the two-decade-old Czechoslovak Republic when he,Paragraph
occupied the German-majority Sudetenland in 1938. Hoffmann first,Paragraph
"attended a state-sponsored crafts school in Brno, Moravia’s largest city, but",Paragraph
"then moved on to Vienna’s far more prestigious Academy of Fine Arts,",Paragraph
where he studied under Otto Wagner (and after his graduation in 1895 went,Paragraph
"to work in his architectural office, where he befriended Olbrich).",Paragraph
Wagner was not only the foremost Austrian master builder of the period,Paragraph
but also a force of such wide-ranging influence that his stature is difficult to,Paragraph
"appreciate these days, when architects rarely wield such broad cultural",Paragraph
"power. In our own time Philip Johnson perhaps came closest, although he",Paragraph
possessed neither Wagner’s high professorial credentials nor critical regard.,Paragraph
The so-called Wagnerschule (Wagner School) of the master’s many,Paragraph
disciples dominated Central European architecture for decades; there was,Paragraph
"never a Johnson School, except perhaps for his eager acolyte Robert A. M.",Paragraph
"Stern, who patterned his busy but vacuous design career all too closely on",Paragraph
the surface-over-substance ethos of his power-broker paragon.,Paragraph
"Hoffmann was weirdly secretive, especially as the impresario of a",Paragraph
"business enterprise so dependent on social interactions. For example, he had",Paragraph
an aversion to being touched and refused to eat food prepared by any cook,Paragraph
"whose hands repelled him. He kept two apartments in Vienna, one where he",Paragraph
received people he could not otherwise put off and a second for a wife and,Paragraph
child whose existence he kept secret even from his employees. They were,Paragraph
"later startled to discover that he had a grown son, Wolfgang, who went on to",Paragraph
"become an architect, though one of little consequence, and immigrated to",Paragraph
"the US, where he died in 1969.",Paragraph
Even after Hoffmann became preoccupied with the Wiener Werkstatte he,Paragraph
"pursued an independent architectural career, based mainly on residential",Paragraph
"commissions, many of them for supporters and clients of his design",Paragraph
"consortium. But he also received significant institutional commissions,",Paragraph
"including his Sanatorium Purkersdorf of 1903-1905 (see Illustration 4a), an",Paragraph
addition to the Westend Sanatorium in the Lower Austrian Luftkurort (air,Paragraph
"spa) of Purkersdorf. This three-story, rectangular, flat-roofed, bilaterally",Paragraph
symmetrical structure was exceptional at the time for its absence of,Paragraph
"projecting ornament of any sort, with windows set flush into the smooth",Paragraph
"white stucco walls, a Minimalism that would point to the later, even more",Paragraph
"severe work of Adolf Loos, the turn-of-the-century Austrian architect now",Paragraph
"most readily identified with such simplicity. (Loos, who was five days older",Paragraph
"than Hoffmann, is best remembered for something he never said",Paragraph
— “Ornament is a crime”—a distortion of the title of his 1910 book-length,Paragraph
"essay Ornament and Crime, in which he noted a parallel between primitive",Paragraph
"societies’ love of ornament and modern criminals’ propensity for tattoos,",Paragraph
and argued that “freedom from ornament is a sign of spiritual strength.”),Paragraph
With its comprehensively customized design coordinated down to the,Paragraph
"smallest detail, the Sanatorium Purkersdorf was every bit as much a",Paragraph
"Gesamtkunstwerk as the Palais Stoclet, although infinitely less opulent, in",Paragraph
"keeping with the emergent Modernist belief that calm, neutral surroundings",Paragraph
were conducive to both physical and mental health. Although this facility,Paragraph
specialized in curative baths and physical therapy rather than the treatment,Paragraph
of tuberculosis—the focus of such later architectural landmarks as Jan,Paragraph
Duiker and Bernard Bijvoet’s Sanatorium Zonnestraal in Holland and Alvar,Caption
Aalto’s Paimio Sanatorium in Finland—it signaled that health-care design,Paragraph
would become a major focus of the Modern Movement’s comprehensive,Paragraph
attitude toward social reform.,Paragraph
"Throughout the twentieth century, international expositions were",Paragraph
important showcases for a nation’s cultural identity as expressed through,Paragraph
"architecture, and it was a sign of Hoffmann’s increasing stature in his",Paragraph
homeland that he was chosen to design the Austrian pavilion at four of,Paragraph
them: the International Fine Arts Exhibition of 1911 in Rome; the,Paragraph
Werkbund Exhibition of 1914 in Cologne; the Exposition internationale des,Paragraph
arts décoratifs et industriels modernes of 1925 in Paris (which famously,Paragraph
gave its name to Art Deco design); and the Venice Biennale of 1934. The,Paragraph
first two of these temporary buildings were fairly similar Stripped Classical,Paragraph
"compositions, replete with stylized pediments, colonnades, and pilasters",Paragraph
like the Villa Skywa-Primavesi. An altogether more unusual scheme was,Paragraph
"his Paris pavilion, one of the fair’s architectural highlights and appreciated",Paragraph
"as such at the time, enough to earn the architect a Légion d’Honneur.",Paragraph
"Asymmetrical in layout unlike its two predecessors, the 1925 Austrian",Paragraph
Pavilion was a further departure from his earlier work thanks to its,Paragraph
"distinctive stucco exterior, which featured broad horizontal bands that",Paragraph
"undulated in curving profile like supersized Classical molding, an effect",Paragraph
"that gave the walls a sensuous rhythm. Inside, one decorative-arts gallery",Paragraph
comprised a veritable Wiener Werkstatte showroom. Hoffmann reverted to,Paragraph
"a symmetrical format in his Venice Biennale pavilion, which is centered by",Paragraph
a monumental ground-to-roof portal that bisects the horizontally grooved,Caption
stucco facade and is wrapped with a glass clerestory strip. This is the only,Paragraph
one of his exhibition buildings to survive.,Caption
"Even before the Wiener Werkstatte went under in 1932, Hoffmann turned",Paragraph
to the design of social housing sponsored by the municipal authorities of,Paragraph
"Austria’s capital city, which at the time was termed das Rote Wien (Red",Paragraph
Vienna) for its far-left sympathies. Avowedly apolitical—“I don’t know,Paragraph
"anything about it,’ he demurred when questioned about the issues of the",Paragraph
day—like countless other Gentiles he apparently felt no compunction about,Paragraph
remaining in Austria after Hitler annexed it in March 1938. As Eduard,Paragraph
"Sekler writes in the standard monograph, Josef Hoffmann: The",Paragraph
"Architectural Work (1985), “Hoffmann welcomed the new regime because",Paragraph
"it promised economic progress and, above all, revived his architectural",Paragraph
"practice,” despite his close and longstanding connections to Jews who",Paragraph
suddenly found themselves in grave danger.,Paragraph
"Indeed, he quickly accepted a commission from his country’s new rulers.",Paragraph
"Now that Germany had absorbed Austria, it no longer needed its embassy in",Paragraph
"Vienna, which Hoffmann was asked to remodel into the headquarters for the",Paragraph
"occupying armed forces, the Haus der Wehrmacht. Furthermore, he",Paragraph
accepted a high bureaucratic appointment from the notorious Baldur von,Paragraph
"Schirach, the Nazi gauleiter of Vienna who was sentenced at Nuremberg to",Paragraph
twenty years in prison. The architect’s collaboration seems not to have,Paragraph
"harmed him greatly during the decade he had left after the war ended, and",Paragraph
"although during that final phase he built almost nothing, it had more to do",Paragraph
with his seeming to be old-fashioned rather than politically tainted. He died,Paragraph
in relative obscurity in 1956 at the age of eighty-five.,Paragraph
"Another major figure in the Wiener Werkstatte saga was Joseph Urban,",Paragraph
the Vienna-born architect who immigrated to the US in 1911 and was,Paragraph
instrumental in bringing the group’s concepts to the attention of an,Paragraph
unprecedentedly large public. Although Urban designed one of Manhattan’s,Paragraph
early Modemist gems—the crisp gray-brick and strip-windowed New,Paragraph
"School for Social Research of 1929-1931, as fresh-looking now as the day",Paragraph
it was completed—his lucrative and highly publicized career as a stage,Paragraph
"decorator for the interwar years’ quintessential Broadway extravaganza, the",Paragraph
"Ziegfeld Follies, has overshadowed his other achievements. Much less",Paragraph
"remembered today is his design work for Cosmopolitan Productions, the",Paragraph
movie studio bankrolled by the newspaper magnate William Randolph,Paragraph
"Hearst, in large part to advance the career of his mistress, Marion Davies,",Paragraph
an erstwhile Ziegfeld girl. As the art director on more than thirty,Paragraph
"Cosmopolitan films and with Hearst’s lush budgets at his disposal, Urban",Paragraph
created settings that were either directly based on Wiener Werkstatte,Paragraph
interiors or incorporated actual pieces made by the design cooperative.,Paragraph
"Urban was particularly fond of the assertive designs of Peche, which",Paragraph
"veritably popped off the screen even in black-and-white, including his",Paragraph
"boldly patterned white-turquoise-and-black Daphnis wallpaper, which",Paragraph
Urban used for E. Mason Hopper’s The Great White Way (1924). And in E.,Paragraph
"H. Griffith’s Unseeing Eyes (1923), a cameo appearance is made by Peche’s",Paragraph
silver-gilt and coral jewel box of 1920. Fifteen inches high and topped by a,Caption
"sprightly three-dimensional doe munching on grapes overhead, this bizarre",Paragraph
but endearing caprice is now in the permanent collection of the,Paragraph
"Metropolitan Museum, which has always been far less puritanical than",Paragraph
MoMA about what constitutes modern design. Urban’s commitment to the,Paragraph
Wiener Werkstdtte went even further when he decided to establish a New,Paragraph
York showroom for the organization in order to help its artists survive,Paragraph
"during a decade when America was prospering but Austria, like Germany,",Paragraph
was mired in the economic depression that followed their defeat. In 1922 he,Paragraph
"opened a stupendous shop at 581 Fifth Avenue, and America had never seen",Paragraph
"anything like it, starting with the octagonal, silk-paneled reception room",Paragraph
"dominated by Gustav Klimt’s nearly six-foot-tall canvas The Dancer, with a",Paragraph
Klimt landscape and an Egon Schiele Madonna hung elsewhere on the,Caption
premises.,Paragraph
But the same impracticalities that had dogged the Wiener Werkstatte for,Paragraph
"the two preceding decades in Vienna persisted at its Manhattan satellite,",Paragraph
where Urban perversely made it as difficult as possible for anyone to,Paragraph
actually buy anything. Were they in a private home or a museum rather than,Paragraph
"a store, even well-disposed visitors wondered? As Urban’s daughter, Gretl,",Paragraph
"reminisced years later, “It was funny to see father upset when one of his",Paragraph
favorite pieces was being looked at by a potential purchaser.” No wonder,Paragraph
the store lasted less than two years. Luxury products bought at the short-,Paragraph
lived American outlet often disappeared into well-appointed haut-bourgeois,Paragraph
households and lingered there as they slowly morphed from fashionable,Paragraph
novelties into historical treasures. The New York Art Deco architect Ely,Caption
"Jacques Kahn, who knew the sociable Urban well, acquired at his friend’s",Paragraph
Manhattan shop a footed-and-fluted silver bowl] designed by Hoffmann in,Paragraph
"1917, used it for decades as a dining-table centerpiece in his sprawling Park",Paragraph
"Avenue apartment, and gave it to the Cooper Hewitt Museum in 1962. And",Paragraph
most of the pieces offered at a landmark Wiener Werkstatte show held four,Paragraph
years after that at New York’s Galerie St. Etienne—the first exhibition of,Paragraph
the group’s designs in the United States since the Fifth Avenue outpost,Paragraph
closed in 1923—came from the Urban family’s considerable stock of,Paragraph
unsold merchandise.,Paragraph
Interest in the nearly forgotten Wiener Werkstatte grew steadily during,Paragraph
the 1960s as part of a widespread Art Nouveau revival. But whereas the,Paragraph
more psychedelic aspects of Art Nouveau that so captivated the Sixties,Paragraph
"counterculture were soon deemed passé, the work of the fin-de-siécle",Paragraph
Viennese avant-garde became even more highly prized during the 1980s,Paragraph
with the rise of Postmodernism. The proponents of that neotraditional style,Paragraph
"were eager for a return to pattern and omament, which had been anathema",Paragraph
"during the half-century ascendance of the International Style, and they felt a",Paragraph
strong kinship with the Wiener Werkstatte’s suave melding of Classical and,Paragraph
early Modernist elements. Among the younger American architects most,Paragraph
beguiled by Hoffmann and his coterie were Richard Meier (who during the,Paragraph
1970s began to collect tum-of-the-century Austrian design objects) and,Paragraph
"Charles Gwathmey. Both of them created china and metalwork, much of it",Paragraph
"based on the Wiener Werkstatte’s familiar quadratic motifs, for the Swid",Paragraph
"Powell company, which during the 1980s catered to the new vogue for",Paragraph
objects designed by celebrated architects. But the Postmodernist most taken,Paragraph
"with Hoffmann was Michael Graves, who eagerly tumed out furniture,",Paragraph
"products, and interior designs for numerous clients and modeled his practice",Paragraph
after that of the multitalented Viennese master in an attempt to broaden the,Paragraph
writ of the architect.,Paragraph
Being able to control all aspects of a large commission had immense,Paragraph
"appeal for architects who, after the interchangeable-parts ethos of postwar",Paragraph
"modernism, wanted to achieve a cohesive look that would express a more",Paragraph
grounded sense of place and be distinctively different from prevalent taste.,Paragraph
Graves envisioned a return to the Gesamtkunstwerk as sought by many,Paragraph
"artists around the turn of twentieth century, including Frank Lloyd Wright,",Paragraph
"the greatest American exponent of that concept, whose unified approach to",Paragraph
all details of a scheme perpetually resonates with the public. But Graves,Paragraph
soon faced the same dilemma that thwarted his many predecessors in the,Paragraph
"design-reform movements: luxury objects, no matter how high the retail",Title
"markup, are unlikely ever to be as profitable as plentiful machine-made",Paragraph
goods. He ultimately concentrated on moderately priced consumer items,Paragraph
"(for Alessi, Target, and other household product companies), while his",Paragraph
architecture came to resemble supersized kitchen gadgets. He got rich on,Paragraph
"royalties from his bird-topped Alessi teakettle (1.5 million units sold), but",Paragraph
grew increasingly embittered as he dropped off the radar of the architectural,Paragraph
press. Though he blamed his shift of critical fortune on a prejudice against,Paragraph
"those who don’t focus on buildings, many thought the fault lay in the",Paragraph
quality of his work rather than in the genres he pursued.,Paragraph
Another distant echo of the Wiener Werkstatte now spikes the skyline of,Paragraph
"midtown Manhattan. The real estate mogul Harry Macklowe, the developer",Caption
of Rafael Vifioly’s 432 Park Avenue condominium tower of 2011-2015 (see,Caption
"Illustration 18b), revealed that while the building was under construction, a",Paragraph
white-painted gridded-metal wastepaper basket designed by Hoffmann in,Caption
1905 served as an “important touchstone” for the design. As Macklowe,Paragraph
explained:,Title
"If you look at it very carefully you see a rhythm, you see a pattern, you",Paragraph
see what we call push-pull between negative and positive. So that was,Paragraph
very inspirational to Rafael Vinoly and I.,Paragraph

highest residential structure—make it more closely resemble Hoffmann’s,Paragraph
"white-painted metal vases, tall but narrow, which employ the same",Paragraph
Gitterwerk (lattice-work) technique. (This design and its numerous variants,Paragraph
became one of the Wiener Werkstatte’s most notable commercial,Paragraph
successes.) But because a $225 reproduction of Hoffman’s trash can was at,Paragraph
"the time on sale in the Neue Galerie’s gift shop, few commentators could",Paragraph
"resist citing it as a source for the $1.3 billion skyscraper. All the same, any",Paragraph
object devised for one purpose but grossly transmogrified both in scale,Paragraph
(whether bigger or smaller) and function meets the textbook definition of,Paragraph
"kitsch, even if its aesthetic is minimalist rather than naturalistic.",Paragraph
Further evidence of the Wiener Werkstatte’s obsessive perfectionism but,Paragraph
hopeless business model could be found in another Gitterwerk piece,Paragraph
"included in the 2017 Neue Galerie show. At first glance, Moser’s silver",Paragraph
breadbasket of 1904 would seem to be identical to Hoffmann’s better-,Paragraph

this approximately oval one—ten and a half inches long by two and a half,Paragraph

reminder of the playful eighteenth-century impulse that lay beneath so,Paragraph

"However, when you look more closely at Moser’s apparently identical",Paragraph
"perforations, you begin to realize that although every square seems to be",Paragraph
"equal, each turns out to be very slightly calibrated to compensate for the",Paragraph
billowing curvature. This effortful sleight of hand conveys an impression of,Paragraph
uniformity that would not exist without exacting and costly attention to,Paragraph
detail. Moser’s almost imperceptible and uneconomical deception helps,Paragraph
explain why the grand illusion of the Wiener Werkstatte continues to,Paragraph
enchant us a century after its frenetic heyday.,Paragraph
EDWIN LUTYENS,Title
IN 1970 IT would have seemed preposterous to assert that the two greatest,Paragraph
architects of the twentieth century were Le Corbusier and Edwin Lutyens.,Paragraph
Although each during his lifetime was considered supreme in his respective,Paragraph
"sphere—Le Corbusier among modernists, Lutyens among traditionalists—",Paragraph
their comparative influence differed tremendously. Whereas Le Corbusier’s,Paragraph
"precepts became the predominant lingua franca of world architecture,",Paragraph
"Lutyens embodied the final effulgence of Classicism, which the Modern",Paragraph
Movement had supposedly rendered irrelevant. Unequal as _ these,Paragraph
"antithetical figures may still seem to some, their complementary",Paragraph
preeminence was acknowledged as early as the 1920s.,Paragraph
The concurrence during that decade of Lutyens’s British imperial capital,Paragraph
of New Delhi and Le Corbusier’s visionary proposals for drastically,Paragraph
rebuilding Paris prompted Indian urbanists to ask both men to devise plans,Paragraph
for a new subcontinental city. Lutyens demurred: “With Corbusier I think,Paragraph
your friends would be far happier and his flow of language would carry,Paragraph
them all.” Le Corbusier finally got to build such a city with his Punjabi,Paragraph
regional capital at Chandigarh of 1951-1964. Lutyens was respectful if,Paragraph
"skeptical of the Swiss-French radical, and in a 1928 review of his Towards a",Paragraph
New Architecture rightly faulted Le Corbusier’s illogical transposition of,Paragraph
Mediterranean materials and forms to northern climates.,Paragraph
Today’s more inclusive view of the building art makes it easier to,Paragraph
"contend that although Lutyens was by no means a Modernist, he was most",Paragraph
"definitely a modern architect, and a very great one at that. While he largely",Paragraph
"disdained innovative construction methods, he responded to the new needs",Paragraph
"of the twentieth century with restless imagination, as demonstrated by his",Paragraph
"up-to-date corporate headquarters, admirable workers’ housing, and",Paragraph
incomparable memorials to  Britain’s victims of unprecedented,Paragraph
industrialized combat during World War I.,Paragraph
Lutyens worked in four successive but frequently overlapping (and,Paragraph
"sometimes recurrent) stylistic modes: Arts and Crafts, Art Nouveau, Neo-",Paragraph
"Georgian, and High Classical. To all of them he brought an unruly vivacity",Paragraph
that was his most noteworthy quality. His vernacular version of Arts and,Paragraph
"Crafts, familiarly known as the Surrey Style, featured traditional regional",Paragraph
"motifs, including prominent redbrick chimneys, large multiple gables,",Paragraph
"overhanging red tile roofs, small-paned casement windows, and elevations",Caption
"clad in varying combinations of brick, stucco, tile, clapboard, half-",Paragraph
"timbering, or sandstone. Asymmetrical massing suggested additions",Paragraph
"accreted over time, a characteristic of old country houses.",Paragraph
Always attuned to shifts in taste and eager to give clients what they,Paragraph
"wanted, Lutyens was more accommodating than his hugely talented",Paragraph
"contemporaries C. F. A. Voysey and C. R. Ashbee, whose careers foundered",Paragraph
as they clung to Arts and Crafts principles long after they’d gone out of,Paragraph
"fashion. Lutyens next had a brief Art Nouveau phase, seen in houses such",Paragraph
"as the Bois des Moutiers of 1898 in Normandy, with its exaggeratedly steep",Paragraph
roofs and elongated oriel windows in the manner of Charles Rennie,Caption
"Mackintosh. But he was intrinsically wary of the new free style, as he wrote",Paragraph
of an extremely stylized Mackintosh tearoom in Glasgow: “The result is,Paragraph
"gorgeous! and a wee bit vulgar! . . . All just a little outré, a thing we must",Paragraph
"avoid, and shall too.”",Paragraph
"With the demise of Art Nouveau during the new century’s first decade,",Paragraph
Lutyens reimagined Queen Anne and early Georgian architecture in a series,Paragraph
"of designs inspired by his idol Christopher Wren, a shift that Lutyens, an",Paragraph
"inveterate punster, called his “Wrenaissance.” Moving on from that phase,",Paragraph
"his first full-blown essay in Classicism was Heathcote of 1905-1907, an",Paragraph
imposing stone villa for a rich Yorkshire businessman. This vigorous,Paragraph
symmetrical composition channels the quirky designs of the early-,Paragraph
eighteenth-century Mannerist Nicholas Hawksmoor and announces that,Paragraph
Lutyens will not be playing Classicism by the cautious Adam Revival,Paragraph
rulebook that then predominated. For him Classicism was the absolute,Paragraph
"summit of the building art. “In architecture Palladio is the game,” he wrote.",Paragraph
"“Tt is a big game, a high game.”",Paragraph
"Astoundingly prolific, Lutyens completed some seven hundred",Paragraph
"commissions, and his range was comprehensive. His designs included the",Paragraph
stage sets for his friend J. M. Barrie’s hit plays Quality Street (1902) and,Paragraph
"Peter Pan (1904); the sumptuous Queen Mary’s Dolls’ House (1920-1924),",Paragraph
still on view at Windsor Castle; the Hampton Court Bridge (1928) spanning,Caption
the Thames south of London; and the twin fountains in London’s Trafalgar,Paragraph
Square (1937-1939). He erected three dramatically sited castles—,Paragraph
"Lindisfarne (1903), on Holy Island in Northumbria; Lambay (1905-1920),",Paragraph
"on an island near Dublin; and Drogo (1910-1930), on a Devon hilltop—as",Paragraph
well as the thatch-roofed Drum Inn (1934) in the picturesque village of,Paragraph
"Cockington, also in Devon.",Paragraph
This specialist in country houses (he built some three dozen) also,Paragraph
"executed several socially conscious schemes, and contrary to his reputation",Paragraph
as a spendthrift worked effectively with modest materials and limited,Paragraph
budgets. His Arts and Crafts—style building called Goddards of 1898-1899,Paragraph

style public dwellings contradict the cliché of soulless modern housing for,Paragraph
the masses.,Paragraph
Like other architects with Arts and Crafts roots—especially his two-,Paragraph
years-older American counterpart Frank Lloyd Wright—Lutyens preferred,Title
to design a building down to its smallest details. He abhorred both Victorian,Paragraph
"clutter and Edwardian luxe, and instead emulated the rigorously austere",Paragraph
interiors of the seventeenth-century Dutch painter Pieter de Hooch. The,Paragraph
rooms Lutyens decorated were often short on comfort. He banished,Paragraph
overstuffed slipcovered divans in favor of more austere high-backed sofas,Paragraph
"(based on a seventeenth-century design used at Knole, the stately home of",Paragraph

that county after the advent of railways into a residential region for nouveau,Paragraph
"riche Londoners, young Lutyens was among the many antiquarian",Paragraph
enthusiasts who scoured the surrounding terrain for quaint buildings to,Paragraph
sketch before they vanished.,Paragraph
Although Lutyens later regretted not having gone to public school—more,Paragraph
for the aristocratic contacts it would have brought him than for any great,Paragraph
love of formal learning—he also liked to boast that he was largely self-,Paragraph
"taught. “I got the architectural idea about fifteen or so,” he recalled, and in",Paragraph
1885 entered London’s South Kensington School of Art to study that,Paragraph
discipline. After two years he began an apprenticeship with the firm of,Paragraph
"Emest George and Harold Peto, called the Eton of architecture for its",Paragraph
distinguished and well-connected alumni. Little more than a year later,Paragraph
Lutyens decided he’d learned enough and at twenty set up independent,Paragraph
practice in London.,Paragraph
"In 1889, while working on his first house in Surrey, he encountered",Paragraph
"Gertrude Jekyll, a South Kensington alumna more than twenty-five years",Paragraph
"his senior, whose four hundred garden designs, thousand articles, and dozen",Paragraph
popular books helped revolutionize modern horticulture. Jekyll moved,Paragraph
prevailing taste away from stiffly regimented Victorian flower beds with,Paragraph
garishly colored exotics and toward spontaneous-looking (though carefully,Paragraph
composed) drifts of native species deployed like brushwork in an,Paragraph
Impressionist painting. Our image of the classic English garden derives,Paragraph
directly and almost entirely from her.,Paragraph
What Jekyll needed most was an educable architectural associate—,Paragraph
someone to bring structural coherence to large landscape layouts and to,Paragraph
"build houses that needed her gardens. She found him in Lutyens, and it was",Paragraph
a professional match that benefited them both enormously. Together they,Paragraph
"championed the outdoor room, a roofless geometric space enclosed by",Paragraph
"masonry walls or hedges of yew or box. Their grandest collaboration, the",Paragraph

Classical multilevel Italian gardens that completely upstages the adjacent,Paragraph

"Alluringly photographed and uncritically described, Lutyens’s houses were",Paragraph

"At twenty-seven, Lutyens met and was instantly infatuated with the",Paragraph
"twenty-one-year-old Lady Emily Lytton, daughter of the first Earl of Lytton",Caption
(who had been ennobled after serving as viceroy of India under Disraeli),Paragraph
"and granddaughter of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, author of The Last Days of",Paragraph
Pompeii and other best-selling historical novels. The ambitious architect,Paragraph
"was likely dazzled by Emily’s high status, but despite his ardor and",Paragraph
"professional prospects, Lutyens’s lack of a fortune (even more of an",Paragraph
impediment than his comparatively lowly birth) precluded an immediate,Paragraph
"engagement. After protracted negotiations with her family, he made Emily",Paragraph
the beneficiary of a life insurance policy worth the current equivalent of,Paragraph
"$1.67 million, and they married in 1897. The high premiums for what was",Paragraph
"tantamount to a reverse dowry drained the architect’s resources for years,",Paragraph
but his bartered bride remained incorrigibly spoiled. She pulled rank on him,Paragraph
constantly and complained that it was impossible to run their London house,Paragraph
with fewer than ten servants.,Paragraph
"Despite their early protestations of everlasting love, Lutyens and Lytton",Paragraph
were disastrously mismatched. She worshiped his talent but craved an,Paragraph
intimacy undermined by the architect’s single-minded devotion to his work.,Paragraph
At home he’d immerse himself in endless games of solitaire during which,Paragraph
he’d unconsciously puzzle out pending designs. He’d hoped that her,Paragraph
"aristocratic connections would bring him prestigious jobs, but he received",Paragraph
"far more referrals from Gertrude Jekyll. Worse yet, she found their sex life",Paragraph
unbearable (as detailed in her letters to him and confidences to her,Paragraph

"Emily had meanwhile become a fanatical adept of Theosophy, the",Paragraph

"money, a rejection particularly painful to Lutyens because it reiterated the",Paragraph
emotional neglect of him by his religiously obsessed mother. He found,Paragraph
some comfort in an amitié amoureuse with the likewise unhappily wed,Paragraph

"houses, over which they quarreled to an apparently enjoyable degree. The",Paragraph
Lutyenses remained wed until his death from lung cancer at age seventy-,Paragraph
four on New Year’s Day in 1944.,Paragraph
"The architect was painfully shy and nervously inarticulate, serious",Paragraph
deficiencies in a field so dependent on personal interaction. He attempted to,Paragraph
mask his verbal and social un-ease with a strenuously jocular demeanor,Paragraph
marked by non-stop chatter and a torrent of puns. He averred that “India,Paragraph
"expects every man to do his dhoti,” and observed of a fish course, “This",Paragraph
piece of cod passeth understanding.” His notion of appropriateness could be,Paragraph
"astoundingly faulty, as when he told the formidable Queen Mary that the",Paragraph
tiny pillows monogrammed MG and GM in the dollhouse he designed for,Paragraph
"her signified “May George?” and “George May,” the latter a play on her",Paragraph
"private family nickname. She reacted, he reported, like a “frightened mare.”",Paragraph
Yet many others found his irrepressible bonhomie and boundless sense of,Paragraph
"fun entrancing, and after Lutyens stopped going about at night with his",Paragraph
downer of a wife—to the great relief of countless hostesses who loved him,Paragraph
and hated her—he became one of London’s most sought-after dinner guests.,Paragraph
Lutyens’s expansion into international practice paralleled the British,Paragraph
Empire’s global reach. He designed his nation’s pavilion at expositions in,Paragraph
"Paris (1900), Rome (1911), and Antwerp (1930) in a succession of different",Paragraph
"styles—tespectively Elizabethan, Classical, and the Mughal-Classical",Paragraph
hybrid he devised for New Delhi. After he was awarded the American,Paragraph
"Institute of Architects’ Gold Medal in 1924, the British government",Caption
returned the compliment and asked him to design its new embassy complex,Paragraph

Wren. Because the hilly site near Washington Cathedral had to,Paragraph

The arrival sequence is thrilling. One gets out of a car under the porte,Paragraph

spacious ballroom (used for investitures and other ceremonies) faces three,Paragraph
"French doors that open onto a two-story stone-columned portico, which in",Paragraph
turn leads to the terraced garden. This splendidly orchestrated spatial,Paragraph
progression never fails to impress. Architectural jests abound throughout.,Paragraph
"For example, column capitals are carved with swags and a scallop shell that",Paragraph
"mimic eyes, nose, and open mouth, while the circular patterns on a curving",Paragraph
wrought-iron stairway bannister were inspired by bubbles in a glass of,Paragraph
champagne. Lutyens’s biographer Jane Ridley perfectly summarizes the,Paragraph
"overall effect as “light-heartedly subversive, like a Noél Coward lyric.”",Paragraph
When the newly crowned King George V and Queen Mary journeyed to,Paragraph
"India to receive the homage of maharajahs at the Delhi Durbar of 1911, the",Paragraph
monarch surprised the assembly by announcing that the capital of the Raj,Paragraph
would be moved there from Calcutta. Lutyens’s newly minted city-planning,Paragraph
credentials—he had laid out the town center for Hampstead Garden Suburb,Paragraph
in North London in 1908—won him the commission of a lifetime to design,Paragraph
this new British administrative center of India. He immediately,Paragraph
comprehended that no one man could act as both urban design chief and,Paragraph
"project architect for New Delhi’s numerous government structures, and thus",Paragraph
"chose as his collaborator an old colleague from the George and Peto office,",Paragraph
"Herbert Baker, whose Union Buildings of 1910-1912 in Pretoria, capital of",Paragraph
"the newly formed Union of South Africa, offered comparable scale and",Paragraph
experience no other British architect could match. It was a decision Lutyens,Paragraph
would come to regret bitterly.,Paragraph
Although Lutyens’s radial city plan for New Delhi followed French,Paragraph
"Baroque prototypes, including Pierre-Charles L’Enfant’s Washington, D.C.,",Paragraph
there was consensus that the official architecture of the new capital should,Paragraph
incorporate Indian references. But Lutyens was at first openly dismissive of,Paragraph
historical construction on the subcontinent. “I do not believe there is any,Paragraph
"real Indian architecture at all, or any great tradition,” he declared. Even the",Paragraph
"universally beloved Taj Mahal he found wanting, and insisted that when",Paragraph
viewed from any angle other than the front it was “untidy.” His initial,Paragraph
contemptuousness of this rich architectural heritage makes it all the more,Paragraph
remarkable that in the end he tuned New Delhi’s centerpiece and his own,Paragraph
masterpiece—the Viceroy’s House of 1912—1930—into a brilliant fusion of,Paragraph
"Hindu, Buddhist, and Mughal motifs seamlessly subsumed and",Paragraph
superimposed onto an unapologetically Classical plan. Somewhat larger,Paragraph
"than the Palace of Versailles, it is crowned by Lutyens’s distinctive",Paragraph
"sandstone dome modeled after a bell-shaped Buddhist stupa, rather than his",Paragraph
less felicitous initial plan to reinterpret the cupola of St. Paul’s Cathedral by,Paragraph
Wren (which was also the prototype for Thomas U. Walter’s United States,Paragraph
Capitol dome of 1855-1866). The architect’s multicultural stylistic,Paragraph
synthesis allowed the Viceroy’s House to be renamed Rashtrapati Bhavan,Paragraph
(President’s House) with complete credibility after India won independence,Paragraph
from Britain.,Paragraph
"Understandably, a two-decade undertaking of this magnitude was fraught",Paragraph
"with problems, a saga grippingly told in Robert Grant Irving’s definitive",Paragraph
"account, Indian Summer: Lutyens, Baker, and Imperial Delhi (1981).",Caption
Financial strains twice threatened to cancel the project: at the outset during,Paragraph
the Great War and again near the end during the Great Depression. Lutyens,Paragraph
and Baker were at loggerheads from the very beginning. Their rivalry came,Paragraph
to a climax when Baker’s mirror-image secretariat buildings—each with an,Paragraph
"incongruous Italian Baroque dome and tower, flanking King’s Way (now",Caption
"Rajpath), the grand central avenue leading to the Viceroy’s House—were",Paragraph
"repositioned, which required altering the upward gradient of the roadway.",Paragraph
An overworked and distracted Lutyens had approved the level change,Paragraph
without realizing that his dome would now be obscured during part of the,Paragraph
approach. This exacting perfectionist was thenceforth obsessed with,Paragraph
"correcting his oversight, but regrading the avenue proved too costly. That",Paragraph
the dome’s brief disappearance and return actually heighten the drama of,Paragraph
"his conception was immaterial to Lutyens because he had not intended it,",Paragraph
"unlike the many other architects, even great ones, who are willing to take",Paragraph
credit for some serendipitous circumstance and claim it as intentional.,Paragraph
The work that made him a national hero was his Cenotaph of 1919-1920,Paragraph
"in London. To give focus to peace celebrations in London, Prime Minister",Paragraph
David Lloyd George—a master of public stagecraft who concocted the,Paragraph
Prince of Wales’s investiture ceremony at Caernarfon Castle in 1911 as a,Paragraph
mini-coronation to appeal to his Welsh constituents—commissioned,Paragraph
Lutyens to design a temporary commemorative set piece on a traffic island,Paragraph
"in Whitehall, the thoroughfare that connects Trafalgar Square and the",Paragraph
Palace of Westminster. This exquisitely proportioned but severely restrained,Paragraph
plywood structure—in the implicit form of a sarcophagus raised thirty-five,Paragraph
feet above street level atop a narrow plinth—immediately struck such a,Paragraph
responsive chord with the public that the architect was asked to render it,Paragraph
permanent in stone as Britain’s principal war memorial.,Paragraph
"This deceptively simple scheme is in fact extraordinarily complex, a",Paragraph
quality typical of Lutyens at his best. What seem like straight lines are,Paragraph
"actually very subtle arcs in the Greek tradition of entasis, a slight narrowing",Paragraph
of verticals to prevent an upright structure from appearing to bulge at the,Paragraph
"top. Even more than its Classical references, the Cenotaph (the Greek word",Paragraph
for an empty tomb) atavistically connects with prehistoric monoliths that,Paragraph
"remain unsurpassed as cynosures of collective memory. Moreover, the",Paragraph
exceptional level of abstraction Lutyens achieves here allows viewers to,Paragraph
project their own emotions onto a design unencumbered by intrusive,Paragraph
"representational elements, a condition that makes Maya Lin’s Vietnam",Paragraph
"Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., and Michael Arad’s National",Caption
September 11 Memorial in New York City commensurately powerful.,Caption
"Even before hostilities ended, Lutyens was asked to serve, along with",Paragraph
"Baker and Reginald Blomfield, as an architectural adviser to the newly",Paragraph
organized Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) for planning military,Paragraph
cemeteries in France and Belgium. The war’s horrendous death toll—about,Paragraph
one million British Empire soldiers were killed—resulted in 967,Paragraph
"cemeteries. Lutyens designed 140 of them, ranging in size from 25 to",Paragraph
"10,773 graves. His first major contribution was to propose that each burial",Paragraph
"field contain a War Stone, a twelve-foot-long horizontal monolith",Paragraph
reminiscent of both an altar and a sarcophagus but devoid of overt religious,Paragraph
"symbols. Rudyard Kipling, whose words THE GLORIOUS DEAD are inscribed",Caption
"on the Cenotaph, also composed the epitaph for the War Stones: THEIR NAME",Paragraph
"LIVETH FOR EVERMORE. His only son had died in action in France in 1915,",Paragraph
aged eighteen.,Paragraph
Although more than a dozen other architects took part in this immense,Paragraph
"project (including many who had served in the war), certain organizing",Paragraph
principles were followed by all of them in order to confer visual unity and,Paragraph
comradely equality on the entire effort. Yet the general outlines also,Paragraph
allowed for individual responses to specific locales and differing historical,Paragraph
"circumstances. However, even a cursory overview of the program makes",Paragraph
clear that Lutyens’s cemeteries are the commission’s finest. His experience,Paragraph
with Gertrude Jekyll afforded him a firm grasp in siting and landscaping,Paragraph
each graveyard. The small shelters he designed to give visitors a place to sit,Paragraph
"or take refuge from the elements, as well as to enshrine a register inscribed",Paragraph
"with the names of all those interred there, are at once as dignified as",Paragraph
Classical temples and as inviting as English garden gazebos. Planted with,Paragraph
"trees, shrubs, and flowers reminiscent of a Home County garden, the",Paragraph
graveyards—which to this day are impeccably maintained thanks to the,Paragraph
"vigilance of grateful British, French, and Belgian governments as well as",Paragraph
private volunteers—fulfill Rupert Brooke’s famous vision of “a foreign,Paragraph
field / That is for ever England.”,Paragraph
But unquestionably Lutyens’s most affecting military monument is his,Paragraph
"Memorial to the Missing of the Somme of 1927-1932 at Thiepval, France",Caption
(see Illustration 5b). Rising the equivalent of fourteen stories over open,Paragraph
"countryside near the site of one of the Great War’s bloodiest massacres, this",Paragraph
brick-and-stone structure is composed of a series of intersecting arches set,Paragraph
at right angles to each other. They increase in height as they move inward,Paragraph
"from the periphery and culminate in the tallest, central arch, an arrangement",Paragraph
"that creates sufficient wall space for the engraved names of the 73,357",Paragraph
British Empire soldiers who went missing there in 1916.,Paragraph
"As one moves around this enigmatic construct—part cathedral, part",Paragraph
"watchtower, part sphinx—its apparent massiveness is continually subverted",Paragraph
by the many apertures cut straight through it. The age-old triumphal arch,Paragraph
"motif has never felt more hollow, the void left by death never more gaping.",Paragraph
"While paying all honor to the fallen, this masterpiece of funereal art does",Paragraph
"not console, and in its realistic address of the horrors that prompted it",Paragraph
reveals the life-enhancing genius of Edwin Lutyens at its most urgent and,Paragraph
timeless.,Paragraph

uncommonly precocious talent began working at age fifteen on small,Paragraph
decorative design tasks for his Finnish émigré father Eliel (who was then,Paragraph

Netherlands between the two world wars encompassed some of the most,Paragraph
"densely settled areas in Europe, with a population of around seven million",Paragraph

freewheeling reinterpretations of traditional Dutch building forms with an,Paragraph
Expressionistic edge (as did Duiker himself at the outset of his career).,Paragraph
"Because Holland was a noncombatant in World War I, civic construction",Paragraph

"Earlier in that decade, avant-garde developments elsewhere in Europe",Paragraph
inspired an emergent generation of Dutch architects to turn from the,Paragraph
predominant redbrick mode of their homeland and adopt the minimalist,Paragraph
machine aesthetic now commonly—if inaccurately—known as the Bauhaus,Paragraph
"style. In Holland the equivalent tendency was dubbed De Stijl (the style),",Paragraph
which placed a particular emphasis on aesthetically pleasing surface,Paragraph
compositions that Duiker deemed too superficial to be the basis for an,Paragraph
"architectural philosophy. His opinion was shared by Le Corbusier, who",Paragraph
dismissed the De Stijl exhibition held at the Paris gallery L’Effort Moderne,Paragraph
"in 1923. Duiker’s published criticisms of De Stijl—a circle that included,",Paragraph
"among others, Oud, Rietveld, and the architect Robert van ’t Hoff, as well",Paragraph
as the painters Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg—understandably,Paragraph
"aroused their enmity. Van Doesburg, who published De Stijl, the group’s",Paragraph
hugely influential journal (now considered an essential document of early,Paragraph
"Modernism), effectively banned Duiker’s work from its pages, a major",Paragraph
reason why his posthumous reputation has languished. Yet there was even,Paragraph
"dissent among De Stijl members, evident in 1926 when Oud declared that",Paragraph
van Doesburg lacked even “the slightest notion of building.”,Paragraph
Duiker instead aligned himself with yet another progressive Dutch,Paragraph
"faction, De 8, which was founded in 1927 by six young architects (now",Paragraph
known only among architectural experts) who believed in a more,Paragraph
"pragmatic, structurally based approach than the De Stijl group. The name",Paragraph
De 8 did not derive from the number of founders but instead came from the,Paragraph
"Dutch word acht, a homonym that can mean either “attention” or “eight.”",Paragraph

"the profession, the Delft University of Technology, where he met a fellow",Paragraph

The predominant architectural influence in early-twentieth-century,Paragraph
"Holland was Hendrik Petrus Berlage (1856-1934), a generational father",Paragraph
figure akin to his older Viennese contemporary Otto Wagner in his powerful,Paragraph
influence on countless followers. Berlage’s vigorous redbrick structures,Paragraph
conveyed much the same strength and gravitas as those of his older,Paragraph
America counterpart H. H. Richardson. But when young Dutch architects of,Paragraph
"the early twentieth century looked abroad for inspiration, they were",Paragraph
"particularly responsive to the works of Frank Lloyd Wright, who might be",Paragraph
called Richardson’s spiritual grandson because his early mentor Louis,Paragraph
Sullivan in his own youth worked for and was influenced by Richardson.,Paragraph
Wright’s particular popularity among Dutch architects was due in large,Paragraph
"part to to the spirited advocacy of his foremost champion in Europe,",Paragraph
"Hendrikus Theodorus Wijdeveld (1885-1989), yet another very long-lived",Paragraph

was looking closely at the output of this American innovator.,Paragraph
"Later on, Duiker and his cohort paid closer attention to Russian",Paragraph
"Constructivism, which emerged well before the October Revolution but",Paragraph
quickly became the built embodiment of the radical new regime that,Paragraph
"promised a complete reshaping of society in all its aspects, not least",Paragraph
architecturally (until the new style fell out of favor with Communist Party,Paragraph
functionaries in the early 1930s and was superseded by the sub-Classicism,Paragraph
preferred by Stalin). Constructivism stressed its departure from,Paragraph
conventional approaches to building through its emphasis not just on the,Paragraph
"frank exposure of a building’s function but also its actual structure, based",Paragraph
on a belief that it was dishonest to hide the inner workings of architecture,Paragraph
beneath an opaque exterior. What better conjunction of theory and practice,Paragraph
in this regard than to apply this idea to the healing powers of modern,Paragraph
medicine?,Title
The life and death of buildings is more than mere metaphor when it,Paragraph
comes to one category of architecture closely identified with the Modern,Paragraph
Movement: the sanatorium. These facilities for the treatment of tuberculosis,Paragraph
have been as emblematic of changing attitudes toward architecture as of,Paragraph
shifting views on contagion. Whereas Romantics saw consumption (as TB,Paragraph
was long popularly known) as an expression of personal tragedy—,Paragraph
exemplified by Alexandre Dumas’s La Dame aux camélias—Thomas Mann,Paragraph
signaled a wider shift in societal perceptions by drawing an analogy,Paragraph
between tuberculosis and the ills of the modern world; two of his most,Paragraph
memorable works (Tristan and The Magic Mountain) are set in Alpine,Paragraph
sanatoriums.,Paragraph
The design of European health-care facilities in the twentieth century got,Paragraph
off to a strong start with Josef Hoffmann’s Sanatorium Purkersdorf of,Paragraph
"1903-1905 in Austria, whose severely simple exterior—flat-roofed and",Paragraph
devoid of projecting ornament—anticipated the flat surfaces of the,Paragraph
International Style by two decades (see Illustration 4a). But the modern,Paragraph
clinic attained transcendent qualities with Duiker and Bijvoet’s Sanatorium,Paragraph
Zonnestraal of 1926-1931 near Hilversum (see Illustration 6a). Built on a,Caption
"hillside in an idyllic country setting, this white-framed assemblage of low-",Paragraph
"slung, flat-roofed pavilions seems to be (as is famously said of the",Paragraph
"Elizabethan stately home Hardwick Hall) “more glass than wall,” and",Paragraph
exemplifies the most daring structural advances of Modernism. Yet its sleek,Paragraph
"efficiency and lack of sentimentality did not inhibit a comforting aura, and",Paragraph
the facility conveyed a feeling far different from the antiseptic anonymity of,Paragraph
conventional hospitals. As the architectural historian Barry Bergdoll writes,Paragraph
in the monograph Sanatorium Zonnestraal: History and Restoration of a,Paragraph
"Modern Monument, this pathbreaking scheme elided “the hopes for",Paragraph
restoring tuberculosis victims through sun and ventilation and the utopian,Title
hopes of the modern movement that architecture might be socially,Paragraph
transformative.”,Paragraph
"This new approach, rationalized and reductive, was ideally suited to the",Paragraph
requirements of sanatoriums. The nearly invisible window-walls of this,Paragraph
"revolutionary building format, taken to an unprecedented extreme by",Paragraph
"Duiker and Bijvoet, provided generous access to sunlight and fresh air,",Paragraph
believed to be cures for tuberculosis. The International Style’s proscription,Paragraph
against applied ornament and dust-catching decorative details further served,Paragraph
the sanatorium’s requirements for the hygienic easy-to-clean surfaces,Paragraph
deemed essential to the containment of this highly contagious ailment.,Paragraph
"These ideas caught on quickly, as evidenced by Alvar Aalto’s Paimio",Paragraph
"Sanatorium of 1929-1932 in southern Finland, an International Style high-",Paragraph
rise that took several organizational cues from Duiker and Bijvoet’s,Paragraph
scheme.,Paragraph
Zonnestraal (“sunbeam” in Dutch) began as a commission from an,Paragraph
"Amsterdam diamond workers’ health-care cooperative in 1919, in response",Paragraph
to the alarming rate of tuberculosis among cutters and polishers who could,Paragraph
not help but inhale dangerous amounts of diamond dust. Because,Paragraph
"sanatoriums were usually sited in rural areas with low air pollution levels,",Paragraph
Zonnestraal’s sponsors bought a 286-acre estate—a varied terrain of,Paragraph
woodland and heath—on the outskirts of Hilversum (which would soon,Paragraph
become the center of Holland’s radio broadcasting industry).,Paragraph
But funding for the sanatorium stalled and the design partners drifted,Paragraph
"apart. In 1925 Bijvoet relocated to Paris, where he worked with Pierre",Paragraph
"Chareau on the celebrated Maison de Verre of 1928-1932, a glass-walled",Paragraph
private house—cum—medical office on the Left Bank that ingeniously,Paragraph
combined both functions through a host of inventive structural strategies.,Paragraph
When Dutch government subsidies at last allowed final plans for,Paragraph
"Zonnestraal to be drawn up in 1926, Duiker was primarily responsible, with",Paragraph
"considerable help from the structural engineer Jan Wiebenga, whose",Paragraph
technical expertise is reflected in the building’s poured-concrete framework.,Paragraph
"The unusually lightweight, almost immaterial feeling Duiker and",Paragraph
"Wiebenga gave to this sprawling, two-story complex—attributable to a",Paragraph
cantilever-support system that enabled floor and ceiling slabs to be,Paragraph
extended far beyond the core and obviated the need for solid outer walls—,Paragraph
"was likened by one Dutch critic to “a small town in Japan, or . . . white-",Paragraph
"painted ocean-liners with tall smokestacks, bridges, and crow’s nests.” Such",Paragraph
nautical imagery was apt. In his revolutionary manifesto Vers une,Paragraph
"architecture (1923), Le Corbusier cited the no-nonsense functionalism of",Paragraph
"modern transatlantic ships as a major source for his Purist aesthetic, which",Paragraph
was quickly adopted by his admirers in Holland’s Nieuwe Bouwen (new,Paragraph
"building) movement, a catchall term for the many Dutch avant-garde",Paragraph
factions working toward the same general goals.,Paragraph
Duiker’s spacious arrangement of Zonnestraal’s five free-standing,Paragraph
"structures—a central administration building at the north end, with four",Paragraph
"long, narrow residential wings splayed in pairs below it to maximize",Paragraph
"southern exposure—approximated the outline of a butterfly. Furthermore,",Paragraph
"the grouping seems to hover above the ground, a floating quality enhanced",Paragraph
"by continuous rows of deep balconies outside each patient’s room, where",Paragraph
beds could be moved into the open air as weather permitted. The,Paragraph
"sanatorium’s clientele was at first intended to be all male, limited to low-",Paragraph
"wage diamond cutters, with a special emphasis on occupational therapy to",Paragraph
get those family breadwinners back on their feet financially as well as,Paragraph
physically. But when public funds were needed to bring the faltering,Paragraph
"scheme to completion at the onset of the Great Depression, government",Paragraph
"officials insisted that the facility treat patients of all backgrounds, and",Paragraph
"individual dormitories were dedicated to men, women, and children.",Paragraph
"Though Zonnestraal was hailed internationally upon completion, it",Paragraph
"lacked classic (and collectable) furniture made specifically for the project,",Paragraph
as opposed to Hoffmann’s reclining Purkersdorf Sitzmaschine or Aalto’s,Paragraph
"bent-plywood Paimio armchair, and in time the Hilversum complex slipped",Paragraph
from the canon. That decline paralleled the abatement of the “white plague”,Paragraph
"after the advent of antibiotics in the 1940s, which led to the virtual",Paragraph
eradication of tuberculosis; by 1970 Zonnestraal was abandoned and,Paragraph
"demolition loomed. Luckily, enlightened municipal authorities of",Paragraph
"Hilversum, which arguably has more distinguished early Modern",Paragraph
"architecture than almost any other comparably sized European community,",Paragraph
wisely forestalled the decrepit sanatorium’s destruction. After numerous,Paragraph
"feasibility studies, a full-scale restoration was begun in 2001 by Hubert-Jan",Paragraph
"Henket and Wessel de Jonge, best known as the founders of Docomomo,",Paragraph
the Modernist historic preservation society they launched in 1988.,Paragraph
Henket and de Jonge (who won the 2010 World Monuments Fund/Knoll,Paragraph
Modernism Prize for their work on Zonnestraal) here set new standards of,Paragraph
authenticity in recreating details and finishes in accord with period,Paragraph
techniques. To make a self-financing enterprise out of the former,Paragraph
"sanatorium, the architects designed a four-building assisted-living facility",Paragraph
for the property in an appropriately neo-Corbusian mode and placed it at a,Paragraph
respectful remove from the landmark ensemble. The sanatorium itself has,Paragraph
been adapted for present-day health issues by including obesity and sports-,Paragraph
"injury clinics, and can be visited at times that do not interfere with its",Paragraph
operations. (The former administration building can now be rented for,Paragraph
weddings and other parties.),Paragraph
"In 1928, Christian Zervos, the influential publisher of Cahiers d’Art and",Paragraph
now best remembered for his multivolume catalogue raisonné on the works,Paragraph
"of Picasso, faulted Zonnestraal for its lack of “either monumentality or",Paragraph
"charm.” But in its happily restored state, this structurally ingenious,",Paragraph
"gracefully composed, playfully turreted scheme fairly radiates a charisma",Paragraph
equal to any of the finest architecture of the interwar years. Zonnestraal’s,Paragraph
embracing intimacy and palpable humility make the postmillennial,Paragraph
resurrection of Duiker and Bijvoet’s architectural gem no less than a,Paragraph
modern miracle.,Paragraph
Duiker’s most conspicuous post-Zonnestraal design was for the,Paragraph
"Openlucht school of 1929-1930 in Amsterdam, which embodied one of the",Paragraph
period’s prevalent notions of education reform—that children would learn,Paragraph
better if they were not cooped up in conventional classrooms but afforded,Paragraph
the physically and mentally bracing effects of fresh air (see Illustration 6b).,Paragraph
"To be sure, the chronic inattentiveness of primary and secondary school",Paragraph
"students has plagued educators for centuries, but the fairly recent realization",Paragraph
that adequate sleep and proper diet might have more to do with pupils’,Paragraph
concentration than brisk ventilation seems not to have been a priority,Paragraph
"among proponents of the fresh-air theory, and a vogue for outdoor",Paragraph
education swept Europe during the early twentieth century.,Paragraph
This commission suited Duiker’s specific architectural aims perfectly.,Paragraph
Buildings generally stand up in one of two ways: either through the support,Paragraph
of load-bearing exterior walls (such as Duiker used for the massive brick,Paragraph
exterior of the Karenhuis in Alkmaar) or through an inner structure that,Paragraph
carries the weight of floors from within. The higher a load-bearing-wall,Paragraph
"building, the thicker its periphery needs to be at its base; the tallest structure",Paragraph
"of this kind ever erected, Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root’s",Paragraph
"seventeen-story Monadnock Block of 1891-1893 in Chicago, has six-foot-",Caption
"thick ground-floor masonry to support it, more like a fortified Florentine",Paragraph
Renaissance palazzo than a modern office building.,Paragraph
But this wasteful use of materials was recognized as unnecessary once,Paragraph
the economy and adaptability of reinforced concrete skeletons were fully,Paragraph
"understood by architects, engineers, and their clients as the twentieth",Paragraph
century progressed. Duiker exploited his rapidly expanding technical know-,Paragraph
how to free the exterior of the four-story Openlucht school (on which,Caption
Bijvoet came back to consult as well) so that its outer walls could be,Paragraph
composed of sliding floor-to-ceiling planes of glass that roll back to create a,Paragraph
veritable outdoor environment for the pupils inside. Though this was not,Paragraph
"always a feasible option in the North Sea climate of Holland, Duiker went",Paragraph
on to use the same structural format in his Nirwana apartment house of,Paragraph
"1930 in The Hague, a block of luxury apartments that differed from the",Paragraph
Amsterdam prototype in that its periphery was not entirely retractable.,Paragraph
The Duiker building that most clearly displays the influence of Russian,Paragraph
"Constructivism is the Handelsblad Cineac Cinema of 1934, a small",Paragraph
screening room on a busy central Amsterdam commercial street. It stands,Paragraph
"directly across from the city’s most flamboyant interwar movie palace,",Paragraph
"Hijman Louis de Jong’s Theater Tuschinski of 1919-1921, a vibrant mash-",Paragraph
"up of late Art Nouveau, early Art Deco, and Amsterdam School stylistic",Paragraph
motifs. In contrast to this sumptuous showcase for first-run commercial,Paragraph
"films, the Cineac Cinema (owned by the Dutch business newspaper NRC",Paragraph
Handelsblad) was conceived as a self-consciously utilitarian outlet for the,Paragraph
"nonstop presentation of newsreels, a relatively recent development in mass",Paragraph
communications. Duiker felt that the immediacy of such documentary films,Paragraph
demanded a more forthright aesthetic than the seductive showbiz glitz,Paragraph
epitomized by the escapist fantasy of the Tushcinski.,Paragraph
A basic concern for Duiker was how to make his little theater visible,Paragraph
amid its cluttered surroundings. Apart from his disinterest in lush,Paragraph
ornamentation of the sort that distinguishes the Tuschinski’s elaborately,Paragraph
"articulated terra-cotta fagade, he was given a tight budget. Newsreels were a",Paragraph
"new form of entertainment whose profitability was far from guaranteed, but",Paragraph
as it turned out the fast-moving political and social developments of the,Paragraph
1930s made it a medium very much in touch with the hectic tenor of those,Paragraph
"unsettled times, well before television became widely available. In order to",Paragraph
"make the Cineac Cinema stand out among its neighbors, the architect",Paragraph
"reduced it to a billboard-like essence, with a diagonally angled rooftop",Paragraph
framework that displays the theater’s name spelled out in large neon letters,Paragraph
and repeated on a vertical banner perpendicular to the street for maximum,Paragraph
legibility from near and afar.,Paragraph
Duiker was clearly taking major cues from one of the Russian,Paragraph
"Constructivists’ hallmark inventions, the propaganda kiosk for",Paragraph
dissemination of news in various formats. This might be either a fixed,Paragraph
installation or even a vehicle such as a truck or railroad car that was,Paragraph
retrofitted to its new function and transported to outlying destinations to,Paragraph
inform local inhabitants of the revolution’s latest developments. Propaganda,Paragraph
kiosks were akin to three-dimensional billboards in their bold graphic,Paragraph
"legibility, and they often incorporated electronic sound amplification to",Paragraph
attract further attention from passersby; some even enclosed small,Paragraph
screening rooms for the projection of short film clips. Further characteristic,Paragraph
"of the Constructivist ethos, Duiker designed the fagade of the Cineac with a",Paragraph
transparent strip window that allowed the workings of its projection room to,Paragraph
"be seen from the street, a veritable teaser for what was going on inside.",Paragraph
(This same basic idea was expressed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro with their,Paragraph
"2003-2010 remodeling of New York’s Juilliard School of Music, in which",Caption
they revealed the institution’s dance studios to the full view of passersby on,Paragraph
Broadway.),Paragraph
Commercial buildings of great architectural distinction are often more,Paragraph
"prone to destruction than other landmarks, for once they cease to make",Paragraph
money for their owners they are frequently demolished unless a new,Paragraph
function can be found for them—the reason why so many of the grand,Paragraph
cinema palaces of the interwar years have disappeared. When film,Paragraph
newsreels were made obsolete by the wider availability of television news,Paragraph
"in the 1960s, the Cineac became a grind-house for second-run movies, and",Paragraph
the rise of home video put an end even to that reprieve in 1995. Thereafter,Paragraph
Duiker’s hardy little survivor briefly became a Planet Hollywood theme,Paragraph
"restaurant, but when that venture failed the structure was carved up into",Paragraph
apartments with yet another restaurant space on the street front. Through all,Paragraph
"these changes the exterior has remained remarkably intact, including the all-",Paragraph
important Cineac signage. Duiker himself lived for only a few months after,Paragraph
"his final small masterwork was finished. His far too early death, from",Paragraph
"leukemia, was an ironic end for a man who set so much store in the healing",Paragraph
powers—both physical and psychic—of the new form of architecture he did,Paragraph
so much to advance.,Paragraph

Though the Modern Movement in architecture reflected many advanced,Paragraph
"ideals of social-reform groups, its attitudes toward women were often",Paragraph
stubbornly retrograde. Female students at otherwise progressive art and,Paragraph
"design schools, including the Bauhaus, were routinely steered away from",Paragraph
architecture—traditionally deemed a “masculine” pursuit—and toward,Paragraph
"weaving, embroidery, ceramics, interior decoration, and other more",Paragraph
"“feminine” occupations. Nonetheless, several strong-minded young women",Paragraph
resisted gender stereotyping and became architect-designers of great,Paragraph
"distinction, including Margarete Schiitte-Lihotzky and Charlotte Perriand,",Paragraph
whose singular contributions were long attributed to the more famous men,Paragraph
"they collaborated with (Ernst May and Le Corbusier, respectively).",Paragraph
"Yet another member of this penumbral sisterhood was Gerdy Troost, born",Paragraph

advanced Modernism—what we now call Bauhaus design—and kitschy,Paragraph
"historical revivalism, but still wanted an up-to-date look. The two married",Paragraph
"in 1925, and Gerdy, who had no formal architectural training, later",Paragraph
maintained that they were full artistic partners. In a characteristic division,Paragraph
of labor—like that between Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and his longtime,Paragraph
collaborator (and mistress) Lilly Reich—Paul Troost concentrated on,Paragraph
architectural design and construction while his wife attended to interiors.,Paragraph
Admirers of Paul Troost’s costly domestic furniture included the author,Paragraph
of Mein Kampf. Newly flush with royalties from his runaway best seller—,Paragraph

"discovered the greatest architect of the age, a veritable modem-day",Paragraph
"Schinkel. The Troosts were reciprocally enchanted by the Nazi chief, who,",Paragraph
"Gerdy wrote, “behaves like a truly splendid, serious, cultivated, modest",Paragraph

architecture.” In 1930 he asked Paul Troost to refurbish the Nazi Party,Paragraph
"headquarters in Munich, and five years later had Atelier Troost redo his",Paragraph
"nearby apartment, which cost the equivalent of $5.2 million today (nearly as",Paragraph

Gerdy Troost’s place in Hitler’s inner circle was cemented by her interior,Paragraph

Obersalzberg region of southern Bavaria. In 1928 he began renting a,Paragraph

Numerous illustrated articles about the Berghof were published in,Paragraph

himself as a warmonger seeking world domination.,Paragraph
The centerpiece of the aggrandized house was the forty-two-by-seventy-,Paragraph

said Frau Troost wanted to insist on having three windows.,Paragraph
The rest of the Berghof was much less dramatic. Troost’s decor included,Paragraph

chilling degree considering the activities that transpired there.,Paragraph
Troost’s firm received no further large-scale architectural commissions,Paragraph

"advocate in Léon Krier, the Luxembourg-bom Classical-revival architect",Paragraph
"best known for designing Poundbury, the neo-traditional new town in",Paragraph

which he asserts that his subject would have been esteemed as one of the,Paragraph
twentieth century’s greatest architects and urban planners were it not for his,Paragraph
regrettable political associations—a notion as aesthetically preposterous as,Paragraph
it is morally indefensible.,Paragraph
"Apart from Krier’s fellow ultraconservative contrarians, few have",Paragraph
endorsed his revisionist reassessment. A more kindly view of Speer’s,Paragraph
accomplishments is unlikely ever to prevail thanks to the British-Canadian,Paragraph
historian Martin Kitchen’s brilliant and devastating biography of this,Title

his codefendants were hanged for their misdeeds (some arguably on a,Paragraph

the son of an architect who made no pretense of his love for money and a,Paragraph
"grasping, social-climbing mother. It is indicative of Kitchen’s painstaking",Paragraph
scholarship that he accepts nothing his tenaciously mendacious subject said,Paragraph
"at face value, not even Speer’s account of his own birth. Although he",Paragraph
claimed it took place amid the dramatic conjunction of a thunderstorm and,Paragraph
"noonday bells pealing from an adjacent church, his biographer found that",Paragraph
"the sanctuary in question was not built until the boy was six, and",Paragraph
furthermore that it rained in Mannheim that day only later in the afternoon.,Paragraph
"Thereafter Kitchen catches him in dozens of lies, big and small, throughout",Paragraph
this harrowing account.,Paragraph
Speer studied architecture at what is now the Technical University in,Paragraph
"Berlin under Heinrich Tessenow, whose architecture was characterized by",Paragraph
"what Eduard Sekler called an “unassuming, rather charming simplicity . . .",Paragraph
[that] had its roots in the same soil where folklore and classicism grew side,Paragraph
by side.” Tempting as it may be to see Speer’s Third Reich fever dreams as,Paragraph
"inflated versions of Tessenow’s pared-down Classicism, he utterly lacked",Paragraph
"his teacher’s delicate touch, gift for faultless proportions, and sense of",Paragraph
"humane scale. An architectural third-rater by any measure, Speer would",Paragraph
have languished at some back-office drafting table had he not joined the,Paragraph
Nazi Party in 1931. Such were his networking skills that a year later he was,Paragraph
asked to refurbish the party’s Berlin headquarters.,Paragraph
Within months of Hitler’s takeover he improvised a stunning scheme that,Paragraph
secured his place in the Nazi hierarchy. The annual National Socialist,Paragraph
"convocation in Nuremberg, held on campgrounds outside the city, took on",Paragraph
added importance once Hitler gained political legitimacy. But before Speer,Paragraph
"was able to execute his Brobdingnagian stadium of 1935-1937, he had to",Paragraph
come up with a suitably impressive interim solution. In 1933 he,Paragraph
"requisitioned 152 antiaircraft searchlights from the Luftwaffe, placed them",Paragraph
"around the perimeter of the assembly grounds, pointed them upward, and",Paragraph
"after nightfall created the Lichtdom (cathedral of light), a mesmerizing",Paragraph
"spectacle in which columns of icy illumination seemed to rise into infinity,",Paragraph
"or, alternatively, formed the bars of a gargantuan virtual cage. This coup de",Paragraph
théatre was such a triumph that the kliegs remained after the stadium was,Paragraph
"completed. (New York City’s Tribute in Light, the yearly commemoration",Paragraph
"of the 2001 attack on the Twin Towers, has employed beacons trained",Paragraph
"skyward in an identical manner, though few have emphasized the concept’s",Paragraph
unfortunate provenance.),Paragraph
Speer first attracted international attention with his German pavilion at,Paragraph
"the 1937 World’s Fair in Paris, where the exposition’s officials limited the",Paragraph
height of his building—a granite shoebox with a squared-off frontal tower,Paragraph
"—at 177 feet so as not to overpower the USSR pavilion, designed by",Paragraph
"Stalin’s favorite architect, Boris Iofan, directly across the exposition’s",Paragraph
central esplanade (see rear endpapers). Not to be outdone by the,Paragraph
"Bolsheviks, Speer added a thirty-foot-high gilded eagle atop his",Paragraph
"composition, which, juxtaposed against the Soviet building’s seventy-eight-",Paragraph
foot-high stainless-steel roof sculpture of workers brandishing a hammer,Caption
"and a sickle, presented a prophetic architectural preview of the coming",Paragraph
world cataclysm.,Paragraph
Hitler planned to rename Berlin “Germania” after he won the war and,Paragraph
"wanted, by 1950, to carry out Speer’s mammoth design to transform the city",Paragraph
and make it the capital not only of the Third Reich but of the world itself.,Paragraph
Any doubts about the architect’s irredeemable vileness are countered by,Paragraph
Kitchen’s methodical exposition of precisely how Speer persisted with this,Paragraph
insane project even after the war started. The quick prosecution of the,Paragraph
"blitzkrieg against Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and France",Title
"prompted euphoric Nazi expectations that this would be a short campaign,",Paragraph
whereupon Speer began Germania in earnest. He would brook no,Paragraph
"opposition, and when the subordinates of a top Hitler henchman annoyed",Paragraph
"him he threatened, “If your three protégés can’t shut their traps, I’ll order",Paragraph
"their houses to be demolished,” hardly the harshest punishment he meted",Paragraph
out.,Paragraph
Previously Speer had been constrained by law from evicting tenants in,Paragraph
Berlin apartment houses that would have to be torn down to make way for,Paragraph
"his grand axes of triumphal avenues terminating at his colossal Great Hall,",Paragraph
"which if built would have been the world’s largest domed structure, equal to",Paragraph
"a seventy-two-story skyscraper (see Illustration 7a). (Krier, in one of his",Paragraph
"most astounding passages, writes of this monstrosity that “a dome, however",Paragraph
"large, is never oppressive; it has something of the archetypally benevolent.",Paragraph
"Speer’s Great Hall would have been a monument of promise, not of",Paragraph
oppression.”),Paragraph
"Legal niceties were now dispensed with, despite objections from a few",Paragraph
"brave civic officials, and as Kitchen documents, Jews were evicted from",Paragraph
their homes and sent to concentration camps specifically to free real estate,Paragraph
"for Speer’s requirements, a process entrusted to Adolf Eichmann before he",Paragraph
"hit his fully murderous stride elsewhere. Furthermore, so insatiable was",Paragraph
Speer’s need for gigatons of stone to encase Germania’s new buildings that,Paragraph
he abetted the enslavement of Jews and foreign captives to mine quarries,Paragraph
until they dropped. When Speer was confronted by those brave enough to,Paragraph
"speak up about the cruelty of this and other deadly servitude, he breezily",Paragraph
"replied, “The Yids got used to making bricks while in Egyptian captivity.”",Paragraph
"As the war went on, Speer was given huge responsibilities for",Paragraph
"supervising the German war machine, for which he astonishingly evaded",Paragraph
responsibility at Nuremberg. Kitchen writes:,Paragraph
He was very fortunate that it was not brought to the court’s attention,Paragraph
"that Mittelbau-Dora, the notorious underground factory where the V2",Paragraph
rockets were built and where thousands died due to the appalling,Paragraph
"conditions, was part of Speer’s armaments empire. Nor was any",Paragraph
mention made of his complicity with Himmler’s policy of deliberately,Paragraph
working prisoners to death.,Paragraph
The fiasco of Operation Barbarossa—the disastrous German invasion of,Paragraph
the Soviet Union named after the conqueror supposedly waiting to be,Paragraph
awakened within view of Hitler’s Berchtesgaden picture window—forced,Paragraph
Speer to abandon his work on Germania and redirect his organizational,Paragraph
"talents as minister of armaments and war production, a position that",Paragraph
allowed him to prosper obscenely through all sorts of corrupt schemes. At,Paragraph
"the Nuremberg trials, one of the rare officials not taken in by his insidious",Paragraph

the family name signified quality to consumers—were completed in 1947,Paragraph

enough by a generation long inured to overcrowding at home during the,Paragraph

"the Midwest, and Southern California—and analyzed the period’s typical",Paragraph
"Cape Cods, ranches, and split-levels with the serious formal analysis once",Paragraph

more impressive because she assembled documentation akin to that,Paragraph
previously available on the residential work of important postwar figures,Paragraph
"such as Richard Neutra, William Wurster, and Marcel Breuer but largely",Paragraph
overlooked for builders other than the Levitts. Her vivid evocation of the,Paragraph
postwar suburban building boom recalls a hopeful time when a popular,Paragraph
American middle-class weekend pastime was to pile the kids and in-laws,Paragraph
"into the family car and drive around looking at model houses, whether or",Paragraph
not you were actively shopping for a new place.,Paragraph
Lane found newspaper advertisements and promotional materials for,Paragraph
subdivisions that were clearly aimed at wives (who wielded huge influence,Paragraph
about housing decisions even though their husbands were the breadwinners),Paragraph
and stressed the transformational nature of life in these up-to-the-minute,Paragraph
dwellings. A revealing example of that direct emotional appeal to women,Paragraph
"can be found in a 1955-1957 sales brochure for Cinderella Homes, a new",Paragraph
"Anaheim, California, subdivision not far from the recently completed",Paragraph

books as the newspaperman John Keats’s The Crack in the Picture Window,Caption
(1956) and a dubious pop psychological report by the physician Richard E.,Paragraph
"Gordon, his wife Katherine K. Gordon, and the journalist Max Gunther",Paragraph
"titled The Split-Level Trap (1960), which claimed that the new suburbs",Paragraph
made people physically and mentally ill. In due course several,Paragraph
methodologically sound (and now classic) studies—led by the sociologist,Paragraph
Herbert Gans’s The Levittowners: Ways of Life and Politics in a New,Title
Suburban Community (1967) and the urban historian Kenneth Jackson’s,Paragraph
Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States (1985)—,Title
presented more nuanced interpretations. So did The Suburban Myth (1969),Paragraph
"by the historian (and future literary biographer) Scott Donaldson, who",Paragraph
argued that mass-produced postwar housing had less to do with the malaise,Paragraph
of corporate conformity than the persistence of the Jeffersonian ideal (“the,Paragraph
"champion American myth of all time”), which a century and a half earlier",Paragraph
established patterns of individual exurban living that worked against the,Paragraph
development of cohesive communities.,Paragraph
Lane attempts to make a case for the architectural virtues of midcentury,Paragraph
"tract houses, and traces the origins of their organizational formats to",Paragraph
specific parts of the country where they originated before spreading,Paragraph
"nationwide. Thus we learn that the once-trendy split-level, which typically",Paragraph
combined three strata within a two-story shell—,Paragraph
"a basement level on a slab, containing the garage, a utility enclosure,",Paragraph
"and sometimes a small “den”; then, half a level up, the living room and",Paragraph
"kitchen; then, another half level up, the bedrooms and bath (usually",Paragraph
over the garage),Title
—emerged in hilly areas where the semi-submerged garage could be dug,Paragraph
"into a sloping site, and were particularly suited to the terrain of New Jersey.",Paragraph
She also points out that because the interior volumes of the split-level were,Paragraph
"stacked, the “footprint” could be half as large as that needed for a single-",Paragraph
"story ranch, which saved on land costs.",Paragraph
"Furthermore, Lane minimizes the damage caused by racial segregation,",Paragraph
which systematically banned blacks from buying into new suburban,Paragraph
developments for two decades. She writes:,Paragraph
There was a very significant melting-pot experience in the new,Paragraph
"postwar communities. Italians, Jews, Catholics, Irish, Polish, and",Paragraph
others who had been segregated in American cities and excluded from,Paragraph
"earlier American suburbs now mingled freely, forming new kinds of",Paragraph
communities that they valued intensely. I think that this experience,Paragraph
"may have helped Americans to become more accepting of diversity,",Paragraph
"even where color lines were initially maintained. In fact, suburbs",Paragraph
"became integrated more quickly than cities: by the 1970s, barriers",Paragraph
were broken down nearly everywhere.,Paragraph
"However, an entire generation of African-Americans was unable to",Paragraph
participate in the grand social experiment of post-war suburbanization. As,Paragraph
"James Jacobs writes in Detached America, this gross injustice was",Paragraph
committed by the federal government:,Title
"The FHA did not, as is commonly held, develop racially neutral",Paragraph
"policies that were then applied in a racist manner. Rather, FHA policy",Paragraph
itself was purposefully written in a way to exclude nonwhite,Paragraph
"Americans, using the abstract notion of “market demands” as blanket",Paragraph
justification for discrimination in sales. A prejudiced appraisal system,Paragraph
for mortgages passed over existing houses that were believed by,Paragraph
officials to pose a risk for devaluation—those in mixed-race,Paragraph
"subdivisions, for example, or properties in older urban neighborhoods",Paragraph
—which further reduced access to the financial windfall that became,Paragraph
available to white veterans and their families.,Paragraph
"To be sure, many blacks did make it to suburbia, though not easily. By",Paragraph
1960 there were an estimated 2.5 million African-Americans living in,Paragraph
"suburbs; a decade later, after passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, that",Paragraph
"number almost doubled, to 4.6 million. But Jacobs observes that blacks",Paragraph
moved into older inner-ring suburbs vacated by cynically manipulated,Paragraph
“white flight”:,Title
Such neighborhoods frequently became available for black ownership,Paragraph
"through blockbusting, a process structured by the purposeful use of",Paragraph
"racial anxiety and panic to undermine the residential housing market,",Paragraph
ultimately for the profit of real estate brokers. These agents convinced,Paragraph
white residents that they should sell their properties at below-market,Paragraph
"values because blacks were beginning to buy in the neighborhood, and",Paragraph
their property values were bound to fall even more. Agents then turned,Paragraph
around and sold the properties to black buyers at inflated prices . . .,Paragraph
[and] departing white families often ended up in a new house on the,Paragraph
suburban periphery.,Paragraph
There were hardly any mid-twentieth-century equivalents in design,Paragraph
quality of the exemplary Greek Revival house plans that were widely,Paragraph
disseminated through carpenters’ pattern books for many decades after the,Paragraph
American Revolution—the main reason vernacular construction in this,Paragraph
"country maintained such a high general standard, even in rural regions, until",Paragraph
"the Civil War. Instead, the semi-modern yet quasi-traditional forms devised",Paragraph
by most 1950s and 1960s American developers were fundamentally,Paragraph
"derivative and debased, no matter how evocative they may now seem of",Paragraph
"their period. None of the houses documented by Lane, for example,",Paragraph
displays the nearly faultless proportional logic—especially the pleasing,Paragraph
relation of the part to the whole—that distinguished even run-of-the-mill,Paragraph
construction by itinerant early-nineteenth-century craftsmen in this country.,Paragraph
Thus the New Urbanists—revisionist planners who since the 1980s have,Paragraph
promoted American housing developments with a stronger sense of,Paragraph
"community values, which they feel can be fostered by traditional design",Paragraph
"elements, including front porches and sidewalks—have looked not to",Paragraph
"postwar suburbia but to premodern prototypes, including pattern book",Paragraph
designs. Yet the higher density of dwellings espoused by the New Urbanists,Paragraph
"is not in itself a solution, especially since few such enclaves have",Paragraph
effectively addressed the continually vexing place of the automobile in a,Paragraph
society slow to pursue more ecologically responsible transportation options.,Paragraph
Because midcentury tract houses tended to be built very close together,Paragraph
"(units were usually no more than twenty-five feet apart), their side",Paragraph
elevations were often left as windowless blanks. Another accommodation to,Paragraph
"privacy was the strip window, inserted high on bedroom walls to admit light",Paragraph
but prevent neighbors from looking in. This lack of direct visual connection,Paragraph
"with the outdoors could recall a jail cell, and although tract houses were",Paragraph
"physically proximate, they often felt emotionally isolated.",Paragraph
Another problem with postwar suburban developments was their dull,Paragraph
"uniformity, determined by lot lines more than any other factor. Though",Paragraph
some builders tried to vary streetscapes by shifting and flipping similar,Paragraph
"layouts this way and that, there were limits to what could be achieved in",Paragraph
such tightly packed settings. The major problem was that these designs,Paragraph
were insufficiently conceived in all three dimensions. The backs of even,Paragraph
"architect-designed houses can sometimes seem like afterthoughts, but the",Paragraph
minimally detailed rear elevations of typical 1950s and 1960s American,Caption
"subdivision schemes were perfunctory in the extreme, and presented a bleak",Paragraph
"aspect until landscaping could soften their stark appearance, though most",Paragraph
suburban backyards typically contained an unsightly jumble of recreational,Paragraph
paraphernalia.,Paragraph
Developers focused almost solely on the street fagade to make an,Paragraph
"arresting first impression on prospective buyers, a quality known in the real",Paragraph
estate trade as “curb appeal.” Thus onto the front of these generic boxes,Paragraph
they added an array of more-or-less traditional appliqués—touches of brick,Paragraph
or field-stone to give greater heft to the predominant asbestos shingles or,Paragraph
wood (and occasionally aluminum) siding; nonfunctioning window,Paragraph
shutters; wrought-iron railings and Colonial-inspired lighting fixtures; and,Paragraph
"that ubiquitous symbol of the postwar suburban home, the picture window.",Paragraph
But because such flourishes were typically treated as marketing devices,Paragraph
"rather than emanations of an integrated design, detailing tended to have a",Paragraph
tacked-on quality that inadvertently underscored the thin character of mass-,Paragraph
produced construction.,Paragraph
There were some notable exceptions to this lack of architectural,Paragraph
"distinction, particularly on the West Coast, where the public was more",Paragraph
receptive to popularized forms of modern architecture and eagerly,Paragraph
embraced the prevailing new style—updated reinterpretations of the,Paragraph
traditional California ranch house. One of its most vigorous champions was,Paragraph
"the architect/builder Cliff May (1909-1989), whose flair for self-promotion",Paragraph
—evident in such best-selling books as his Western Ranch Houses (1956)—,Paragraph
"was equaled by strong design skills that have made his sprawling, light-",Paragraph
"filled, well-crafted structures a byword for pleasurable, informal indoor-",Paragraph
outdoor living and desirable properties on the resale market to this day. The,Paragraph
"same is true of the developer Joseph Eichler (1900-1974), whose houses",Paragraph
(mostly in the San Francisco Bay Area) were more fully informed by High,Paragraph
Modermism than May’s but now are similarly prized as among the best of,Paragraph
their kind.,Paragraph
Interesting though it is to see midcentury tract houses treated with,Paragraph
"scholarly gravitas, for the most part these are not designs particularly",Paragraph
worthy of preservation or emulation. They paid little attention to,Paragraph
"sustainability or energy conservation, were predicated on a restrictively",Paragraph
traditional model of family life that seems outdated if not oppressive to,Paragraph
"many Americans today, and few of these structures were so solidly built",Paragraph
that they can do without substantial retrofitting as they enter their sixth or,Paragraph
seventh decades. They now seem more important in sociological than,Paragraph
architectural terms.,Paragraph
"In 1940, only about 40 percent of Americans were homeowners; by 1965",Paragraph
that figure had soared to almost 63 percent. The extraordinary social,Paragraph
mobility indicated by these numbers seems all the more poignant when one,Paragraph
considers a reverse development in the United States recently. In 2007—,Paragraph
"2009, before the full impact of the Great Recession was felt, 66.4 percent of",Paragraph
housing units were owned by their occupants. By 2014 that figure had,Paragraph
"dropped to 64.7 percent, the lowest since 1995.",Paragraph
Rather than glamorizing the white-bread world of Eisenhower-era,Paragraph
"cookie-cutter suburbia, I prefer to think of more socially admirable efforts",Paragraph
"such as Reston, Virginia, twenty miles west of Washington, D.C., which",Paragraph
was founded in 1964 by the developer Robert E. Simon. (His initials,Paragraph
formed the first three letters of this start-from-scratch community’s name.),Paragraph
"With its sensible and salable mix of housing formats, including clustered",Paragraph
"town houses and high-rise condominiums, and encouragement of businesses",Paragraph
"that provided jobs for its residents, Reston more closely resembled",Paragraph
European New Towns than postwar American suburbs. As Simon’s 2015,Paragraph
New York Times obituary noted:,Paragraph
"He laid out a town of open spaces, homes and apartments that would",Paragraph
"be affordable to almost anyone, racially integrated, economically self-",Paragraph
"sustaining, pollution-free and rich in cultural and _ educational",Paragraph
opportunities.,Paragraph
That is something to be nostalgic about. You’d have to look very hard in,Paragraph
the suburbs of America today to find a single builder following his high,Paragraph
example.,Paragraph
"As for the Levitt brothers, their central part in making affordable single-",Paragraph
family houses more widely available than ever before in our country’s,Paragraph
history seems attributable to a conjunction of circumstances unlikely to ever,Paragraph
"occur again here, most importantly a huge demographic demand supported",Paragraph
"by generous government subsidies, the very opposite of the inequality in",Paragraph
income and social advancement that has become a_ hallmark of,Paragraph
postmillennial America. Thus it was perhaps not entirely surprising when in,Paragraph
"a 2017 speech at, of all things, a Boy Scout summer jamboree, President",Paragraph
"Donald Trump delivered a bizarre denunciation of William Levitt, a real",Paragraph
estate developer of far greater import than either himself or his father.,Paragraph
"Although Trump began by citing Levitt’s “unbelievable success,” he went",Paragraph
on to claim:,Title
In the end he failed and he failed badly. Lost all of his money. He went,Paragraph
personally bankrupt. And he was now much older. And I saw him at a,Paragraph
cocktail party. And it was very sad because the hottest people in New,Paragraph
York were at this party... .,Paragraph
"And I see, sitting in the comer, was a little old man who was all by",Paragraph
himself. Nobody was talking to him. I immediately recognized that,Paragraph
that man was the once-great William Levitt of Levittown.,Paragraph
"According to The New York Times, “After asking Mr. Levitt what went",Paragraph
"wrong with his business, Mr. Trump recalled his response: ‘Donald, I lost",Paragraph
"my momentum. I lost my momentum.’” James Levitt, a son of the",Paragraph
"legendary builder, reacted with justifiable anger:",Paragraph
I find that Donald Trump’s use of a story regarding my dad in a,Paragraph
"somewhat negative light is, at best, pure hypocrisy. Donald Trump",Paragraph
couldn’t hold a candle to my dad’s achievements. My dad worked very,Paragraph
hard to earn his money. He paid his contractors and suppliers for their,Paragraph
work and efforts. He believed in integrity as a business ethic. . . .,Paragraph
Trump may have chosen that word [momentum] to use as an,Paragraph
inadvertent admission that he too has lost momentum on both the,Paragraph
"political and business fronts. In his comments, Trump uses the word",Paragraph
... then acknowledges that it can be lost. Perhaps he’s telegraphing his,Paragraph
own feelings.,Paragraph
"Indeed, as one resident of Levittown pointed out to a Times reporter, “How",Paragraph
many times has Trump declared bankruptcy?”,Paragraph

English translation was used for the first time in the British journal,Paragraph

"“no finishes at all internally, the building being a combination of shelter and",Paragraph
"environment. Bare brick, concrete, and wood. . . . Had this been built, it",Paragraph
would have been the first exponent of the New Brutalism in England.”,Paragraph
In addition to its echoes of art brut—Jean Dubuffet’s name for outsider,Paragraph
"art—New Brutalism was also an oblique riposte to New Humanism, a set of",Paragraph
beliefs inspired by Geoffrey Scott’s influential book The Architecture of,Paragraph
Humanism (1914). But Scott’s call for a return to Arts and Crafts design,Paragraph
principles in the year that the Great War broke out was scorned as escapist,Paragraph

Yet it was not a utopian nineteenth-century dreamland that Brutalism,Paragraph
"countered as much as the thin, commercialized version of the International",Paragraph
Style that after World War II gained ascendance through economic,Paragraph

Executive Wing in Wellington (1964-1977) by Basil Spence—and Rinaldo,Paragraph
"Olivieri’s La Pyramide (1968-1973), a mixed-used ziggurat in Abidjan,",Paragraph
Ivory Coast. That global diffusion is further confirmed in byways such as,Paragraph
"Skopje, the Macedonian city so extensively (and firmly) rebuilt in dramatic",Paragraph
concrete forms after a devastating 1963 earthquake that some have,Paragraph
suggested that this out-of-the-way destination be promoted to architectural,Paragraph

prompted overeager enthusiasts to take the broadest conceivable definition,Paragraph

"building has to meet three criteria, namely the clear exhibition of structure,",Paragraph
"the valuation of materials ‘as found’ and memorability as image.” Banham,",Paragraph
"fixated on materials and engineering, asserted that New Brutalism at last",Paragraph
fulfilled a central philosophical aim of the Modern Movement. Praising the,Paragraph

"Secondary Modern School in Norfolk (1950-1954), he wrote in his seminal",Paragraph
1955 Architectural Review essay “The New Brutalism”:,Title
"Whatever has been said about honest use of materials, most modern",Paragraph

when they are made of concrete or steel. Hunstanton appears to be,Paragraph
"made of glass, brick, steel and concrete, and in fact is made of glass,",Paragraph
"brick, steel and concrete. Water and electricity do not come out of",Paragraph

the play of spaces.,Paragraph
Yet this restrictive attitude about “truth to materials’—a_ principal,Paragraph
Modernist shibboleth that began among moralizing Victorian theorists and,Paragraph
has persisted ever since—was in essence little different from the judgmental,Paragraph
admonitions of Arts and Crafts adherents about the inherent soullessness of,Paragraph
the machine. Banham went on to expand his argument at book length in The,Paragraph
"New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic? (1966), which inexplicably has been out",Paragraph
of print for years and deserves republication as a revealing document of,Paragraph
architectural historiography by a first-rate polemicist.,Paragraph
There are several reasons for the postmillennial change in perceptions,Paragraph
"about Brutalism, which remained in fashion for only about twenty years",Paragraph
during the 1960s and 1970s. As the landmarks preservation movement has,Paragraph
"repeatedly demonstrated, what was once underappreciated or even despised",Paragraph
"in architecture often attains new value when its existence is threatened,",Paragraph
whether one personally likes a currently démodé style or not. The most,Paragraph
"immediate concern about Brutalism now is its conservation, as many of",Paragraph
"these seemingly invulnerable, fortresslike edifices are beginning to fall",Paragraph
"apart. Like other experimental architects of the modern age, the Brutalists",Paragraph
were more intent on getting their innovative designs built than worrying,Paragraph
"about how well they would last for the ages, and their command of new",Paragraph
materials and construction techniques often lagged behind their visions. But,Paragraph
the debate over whether these purposefully unlovely creations should be,Paragraph
restored to their original state or left to decay remains largely unresolved.,Paragraph
Another major factor in the reexamination of Brutalism is the part that,Paragraph
postgraduate academicians play in methodically advancing topics that have,Paragraph
yet to be fully investigated. While there will always be doctoral,Paragraph
"dissertations on unexamined facets of the great architectural masters, Ph.D.",Paragraph
"advisers often guide their students toward neglected or discounted subjects,",Paragraph
with the hope that fresh analysis will yield worthwhile results. Thus we,Paragraph
have seen the scholarly literature steadily progress far into the twentieth,Paragraph
"century, and it was only a matter of time until we reached Brutalism.",Paragraph
That there is a definite element of fandom in the Brutalist revival there,Paragraph
can be no doubt. In the introduction to his paean Raw Concrete: The Beauty,Paragraph
of Brutalism (2016) the British architectural historian Barnabas Calder,Caption
passionately declares his infatuation:,Paragraph
I am a lover of concrete. The great outburst of large concrete buildings,Paragraph
"in the 1960s and ’70s, the style known as Brutalism, thrills me. I love",Paragraph
"the unapologetic strength of these buildings, and the dazzling",Paragraph
confidence of their designers in making their substantial mark. I love,Paragraph
"the optimism they seem to embody, their architecture promising",Paragraph
bullishly that new technologies can improve almost every corner of,Paragraph
"human life. Most of all, I love the way the buildings look: rough, raw",Paragraph
"concrete, streaked by rain and dirt, forming punchy, abstract shapes;",Paragraph
soaring cliffs of tower block or entire cities within cities.,Paragraph
But it might also be argued that this aggressively Neoprimitive ethos,Paragraph
represented an outright rejection of High Modernism’s belief in the,Paragraph
"perfectibility of mankind through advanced technology, a rejection",Paragraph
expressed in intentionally crude finishes that hardly improve with age.,Paragraph
"Brutalism, which reflected the bleak worldview of existentialism so",Paragraph
"pervasive in the 1950s, reveled in its flagrant uncouthness and lack of",Paragraph
finesse in much the same way that the Angry Young Men of postwar British,Paragraph
"literature, drama, and filmmaking flaunted their contempt for anything that",Paragraph
"hinted at poshness, polish, or privilege. Where Barnabas Calder sees",Paragraph
"Brutalism’s confidence and optimism, others perceive a palpable angst and",Paragraph
inward-tuming defensiveness that make many of these designs seem more,Paragraph
"like penal institutions or military em-placements than housing estates, arts",Paragraph
"centers, or schools sponsored by an egalitarian and beneficent welfare state.",Paragraph
"In yet another familiar progression, subsequent building modes often",Paragraph
"foster dissatisfactions that make earlier, diametrically different approaches",Paragraph
"look appealing by comparison, which helps account for major reversals of",Paragraph
taste. The wholly uningratiating nature of Brutalism perversely appeals to,Paragraph
"dystopian undercurrents in modern society, and pessimists both envious of",Paragraph
and sickened by today’s all-pervasive consumer culture might find this grim,Paragraph
aesthetic better suited to the ongoing decline of the postindustrial West—,Paragraph
and especially Europe—than a prettified approach to public architecture.,Paragraph
"Even taking a more positive point of view, after the flimsy cartoon-",Paragraph
"Classical pastiches of Postmodernism in the 1980s, the nervously",Paragraph
"fragmented angularity of Deconstructivism in the 1990s, and the",Paragraph
"postmillennial proliferation of computer-generated Blobitecture, the",Paragraph
undeniable material heft and protective aura of Brutalism can seem,Paragraph
reassuring to those threatened by an increasingly multivalent and menacing,Paragraph
world.,Paragraph
The most substantial study of New Brutalism since Banham’s can be,Paragraph
"found in Space, Hope, and Brutalism: English Architecture, 1945-1975",Title
(2015) by the British architectural historian Elain Harwood. Although,Paragraph
"Brutalism became a worldwide trend, its greatest concentration was in",Paragraph
"Britain, where public building authorities gave overwhelming support to",Paragraph
this new direction. A detailed account of that remarkable architectural,Paragraph
program is given by John Grindrod in his Concretopia: A Journey Around,Paragraph
"the Rebuilding of Postwar Britain (2013), which lucidly evokes the political",Paragraph
and social climate that enabled this style to flourish in a country that before,Paragraph
World War IL had not embraced Modernism—except for its industrial,Paragraph
"manifestations—as fully as Germany, France, the Netherlands, the Soviet",Paragraph
"Union, Czechoslovakia, and Scandinavia.",Paragraph
"Like so many other aspects of twentieth-century architecture, the origins",Paragraph
"of Brutalism can be traced directly back to Le Corbusier, whose",Paragraph
"pronouncement that “l’architecture, c’est avec des matiéres brutes établir",Paragraph
des rapports émouvants” (architecture is the establishing of moving,Paragraph
relationships with raw materials) became the veritable gospel of the,Paragraph
Brutalists. After he and Pierre Jeanneret completed their stunning series of,Paragraph
"machinelike Purist villas of the 1920s and early 1930s, the Swiss-French",Paragraph
architect became deeply disillusioned with the creative limitations of,Paragraph
rationalism and began a decisive tum toward rougher materials and,Paragraph
biomorphic forms. These were first seen in his expressive use of concrete at,Paragraph
the Pavillon Suisse student housing at the Cité Internationale Universitaire,Paragraph
"in Paris (1930-1931), and then even more evidently in his Villa Le Sextant",Paragraph
"(1935) in Les Mathes, France, with its rough stone rubble walls that point",Paragraph
directly to the self-consciously primitive aesthetic of Brutalism.,Paragraph
"Le Corbusier’s long-standing fascination with vernacular culture, amply",Paragraph
"displayed in his 1911 diary of travels through Southern, Central, and",Paragraph
"Eastern Europe (posthumously published as Le Voyage d’Orient), was",Paragraph
"further strengthened by his friendship with Fernand Léger, who likewise",Paragraph
"idealized folk traditions and sought a similar vitality in his own art as he,",Paragraph
"too, moved away from an earlier technological aesthetic and toward a",Paragraph
"vigorous, less refined late style. Although Le Corbusier’s theories had a",Paragraph
profound influence on the thinking of several generations of British,Paragraph
"architects, their built works seldom rose to the master’s level, unlike their",Paragraph
"contemporary counterparts in South America, especially the Brazilians",Paragraph
"Ltcio Costa, Oscar Niemeyer, and Lina Bo Bardi, who used raw concrete",Paragraph
with a joyous bravado and sensual abandon rarely seen in British Brutalism.,Paragraph
"At times, Brutalism could bring out the best in lesser architects whose",Paragraph
"work before and after that phase does not seem as interesting, perhaps most",Paragraph
notably I. M. Pei. His firm’s early jobs for the real estate developer William,Paragraph
"Zeckendorf Sr. were rather dull sub-Miesian efforts, while his late-career",Paragraph
dependence on cautiously segmented and genteely manipulated geometries,Paragraph
exhibited considerable technical suavity but little conceptual inventiveness.,Paragraph
"However, during the 1960s the Pei office produced three of his strongest",Paragraph
"designs, all in a Brutalist mode: the multitowered National Center for",Paragraph
"Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado (1961-1967), which owes a",Paragraph
clear debt to Kahn’s highly publicized Richards labs; the monolithic,Paragraph
"Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, New York (1965-1968), influenced",Paragraph
by then-prevalent trends in American Minimalist sculpture; and the,Paragraph
shadowbox-like Sculpture Wing of the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa,Caption
"(1966-1968), late-Corbusian in its heavily outlined and deeply recessed",Paragraph
framing. With this trio of relatively small but monumentally scaled,Paragraph
"structures, Pei achieved a rare and surprising balance between powerful",Paragraph
expression and humane feeling largely unseen elsewhere in his extensive,Paragraph
oeuvre.,Paragraph
"Contrary to the grungy, pockmarked, damp-stained concrete surfaces",Paragraph
"typical of most Brutalist buildings, the exteriors of these three Pei structures",Paragraph
"are all smoothly rendered, the difference owing to the careful craftsmanship",Paragraph
of wooden casting molds much more finely finished than usual and often,Paragraph
"approaching the quality of furniture. Furthermore, the concrete for the",Paragraph
Boulder laboratory was mixed with finely ground local red sandstone to,Paragraph
"harmonize with the surrounding mountainous terrain, whereas that for the",Paragraph
Syracuse gallery was similarly augmented with particles of the region’s,Paragraph
native gray granite. This exacting construction would remain a hallmark of,Paragraph
the Pei office and is epitomized by its Grand Louvre expansion of 1983—,Paragraph
"1993 in Paris, where the perfectionist concrete is indistinguishable from",Paragraph
tightly grained limestone. Such grace notes strengthen compositional clarity,Paragraph
"without seeming overly precious, not unlike the work of Tadao Ando,",Paragraph
"today’s foremost adept of elegant concrete construction, who is often,",Paragraph
"though incorrectly, regarded as a neo-Brutalist.",Paragraph
The reasons why particular building styles are so prevalent in certain,Paragraph
"cities—such as Byzantine in Ravenna, Gothic in Bruges, or Modernisme",Paragraph
(the Catalan variant of Art Nouveau) in Barcelona—are always rooted in,Paragraph
economics and politics. When stability and prosperity attract growing,Paragraph
"populations and necessitate much new construction within short periods,",Paragraph
uncommon architectural coherence emerges. In post-World War II,Paragraph
"America, the dynamic was rather the opposite, as rapid suburbanization",Paragraph
"pushed several big cities, financially hard hit since the Great Depression,",Paragraph
"further into decline. To stem the erosion of their tax base, municipalities",Paragraph
"such as Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Boston embarked on comprehensive",Paragraph
plans to transform their run-down central districts.,Paragraph
"The new Boston initiative of the 1960s—led by John F. Collins, the city’s",Paragraph
"mayor for most of that decade, and implemented by Edward J. Logue,",Paragraph
prime mover of the Boston Redevelopment Authority—coincided with the,Paragraph
apogee of Brutalism and explains why that city became this country’s,Paragraph
foremost repository of this short-lived style. The roster of designers enlisted,Paragraph
to recast the creaking Hub of the Universe as an up-to-date metropolis,Paragraph
included several of the biggest names in twentieth-century architecture: Le,Paragraph
"Corbusier, Walter Gropius (then chief partner in the Cambridge,",Paragraph
"Massachusetts, firm the Architects Collaborative), Josep Lluis Sert, Breuer,",Caption
"Pei, and Rudolph. By and large, though, the results were less than",Paragraph
"wonderful. The nexus of this undertaking was Government Center, a fifty-",Paragraph
six-acre site just to the west of the Colonial-era Faneuil Hall and the,Paragraph
nineteenth-century Quincy Market. This tripartite modern forum comprised,Paragraph
the John F. Kennedy Federal Building by the Architects Collaborative,Caption
"(1961-1966); Boston City Hall by Kallmann, McKinnell & Knowles",Caption
(1962-1969); and the concrete superblock of Rudolph’s Government,Paragraph
Service Center (1962-1971).,Paragraph
The semi-enclosed street-level spaces beneath Rudolph’s ponderous and,Paragraph
overbearing ensemble—its public concourse recalls Piranesi’s imaginary,Paragraph
prisons without his sense of fantasy—provide an object lesson in how,Paragraph
seemingly infinite volumes can nonetheless feel alarmingly claustrophobic.,Paragraph
As much as a new generation of Rudolph zealots may hope for a wider,Paragraph
"reappreciation of his designs, his posthumous upgrading seems unlikely to",Paragraph
"be helped by the Government Service Center’s depressing hulk, with its",Paragraph
"jumbled undercarriage of sequoia-like columns, bulging balconies, and",Paragraph
"undulating stairways, all rendered in vertically corrugated textures of the",Paragraph
bush-hammered concrete that became his trademark. (The center’s,Paragraph
proposed twenty-three-story office tower and a series of surrounding,Paragraph
terraces were never executed because of funding cutbacks as the Great,Paragraph
Society gave way to the Vietnam War.),Paragraph
The high-rise Kennedy Federal Building was a wan performance by the,Paragraph
"Gropius firm, which had just inflicted the dreadful Pan Am Building (1960—",Paragraph
1963) on New York City. None of the new Boston projects won as much,Paragraph
"critical praise as Boston City Hall, which was widely hailed upon its",Paragraph
completion as the finest American public building of the postwar period.,Paragraph
"But this top-heavy citadel, on the former site of the raffish Scollay Square",Paragraph
"nightlife quarter, came to be seen by the public as forbidding and indeed",Paragraph
"hostile, and there have been repeated calls for its demolition and",Paragraph
replacement with a more welcoming and transparent symbol of civic,Paragraph
engagement.,Paragraph
The best of the new Boston designs was a little gem commissioned by a,Paragraph
private institution: Le Corbusier’s Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts on,Title
the Harvard campus in Cambridge (1958-1963). One of only two works he,Paragraph
executed in the Western Hemisphere (the other was a house in postwar,Paragraph
"Argentina), the Carpenter Center shows just how rich and attractive the",Paragraph
"Brutalist vocabulary could be in the right hands. This five-story structure,",Paragraph
"squeezed into a narrow site, juxtaposes grid-like masses (which contain art",Paragraph
studios) against sinuous ondulatures (walkways that slice through the,Paragraph
exterior) and a dramatically cranked ramp that rises from the sidewalk to,Paragraph
the entrance on the building’s second level. Both in its piquant ground plan,Paragraph
"and in its lively elevations, this marvelously collaged composition’s play of",Paragraph
linear and curving elements brings to mind Picasso’s guitar sculptures of,Paragraph
"1912-1914, while the brisk marche Le Corbusier leads through these",Paragraph
powerful concrete volumes is akin to the kinetic internal circulation patterns,Paragraph
"of Alvar Aalto, unsurpassed in his intuitive understanding of how to convey",Paragraph
delight by movement through space.,Paragraph
"The postmillennial comeback of Brutalism is not surprising, given a",Paragraph
worldwide vogue for strenuously exhibitionistic architecture enabled by,Paragraph
"computer design, which has resulted in grotesque behemoths far stranger",Paragraph
than anything achievable through the relatively low-tech means of concrete,Paragraph
construction. Some older observers will see this fascination with,Paragraph
"grandiosity and ugliness as the return of the repressed, a reminder of why",Paragraph
Brutalism fell into disfavor and disrepute in the first place. This was never a,Paragraph
"style that attempted to convey warmth, comfort, intimacy, or other qualities",Paragraph
"we tend to associate with an enjoyable way of life, and thus it never won",Paragraph
much love except from architectural specialists. Brutalism posited an,Paragraph
"unsentimental, not to say harsh, view of the modern world, and however",Paragraph
"heroic its unflinching embodiment of hard realities may have been, most",Paragraph
"people do not enjoy a daily diet of architectural anxiety and alienation,",Paragraph
especially in northern climates under cloudy skies.,Paragraph
One of the first signs of rejection came in J. G. Ballard’s dystopian novel,Paragraph
"High-Rise (1975), which is set in a thinly fictionalized version of Emé",Paragraph
"Goldfinger’s Trellick Tower of 1968-1972, in London’s North Kensington",Caption
"(not far from an earlier Brutalist residential high-rise, Clifford Wearden and",Paragraph
"Associates’ twenty-four-story Grenfell Tower of 1967, which caught fire in",Paragraph
"2017, resulting in the death of seventy-one residents). Goldfinger’s thirty-",Paragraph
"one-story concrete-framed apartment block, commissioned by the Greater",Caption
"London Council, was based on Le Corbusier’s original Unité in Marseilles,",Paragraph
although Goldfinger’s scheme is nearly twice as high as its prototype (see,Paragraph
"Illustration 9a). Trellick Tower was well received by its first inhabitants, but",Paragraph
as was also true of contemporaneous public housing projects in the United,Paragraph
States—especially Minoru Yamasaki’s unfairly demonized Pruitt-Igoe,Paragraph
housing of 1950-1955 in St. Louis—it quickly descended into crime and,Paragraph
squalor as funds for its upkeep and security were slashed.,Paragraph
Neoconservative critics blamed the newfangled architecture rather than,Paragraph
"larger forces of discriminatory economics, but as sociological studies have",Paragraph
"since proven, the claim that tall residential complexes breed social malaise",Paragraph
"is groundless. After Trellick Tower was privatized in the 1980s, when",Paragraph
Margaret Thatcher took the British government out of the public housing,Title
"business, the building’s owner-residents increased protection from intruders",Paragraph
and paid for long-delayed repairs; it is now a highly desirable property,Paragraph
"rightly appreciated for its design quality. Ironically enough, it stands as",Paragraph
Thatcher’s unwitting contribution to preserving the built legacy of the,Paragraph
munificent welfare state she worked so hard to destroy through her own,Paragraph
"distinctive brand of brutalism. And its near contemporary, Grenfell Tower,",Paragraph
will long remain a symbol of what can happen when government abdicates,Paragraph
"its regulatory—and moral—responsibilities in the realm of public welfare,",Paragraph

LOUIS KAHN,Title
HOW ODD THAT the towering genius of architecture during the third quarter of,Paragraph
the twentieth century—when his most conventionally successful colleagues,Paragraph
"prized innovation over tradition, analysis over intuition, and logic over",Paragraph
emotion—was a mystically inclined savant who sought to reconnect his,Paragraph
"medium with its spiritual roots. Indeed, he ran wholly counter to prevailing",Paragraph
images of the modern architect. Rather than casting himself as a,Paragraph
technocratic superman along the lines of the young Le Corbusier or a,Paragraph
"conduit between man and nature like the twinkling Frank Lloyd Wright, he",Paragraph
"made his name with an architectural gran rifiuto, rejecting the commercial",Paragraph
blandishments of an increasingly corporate culture in favor of a quixotic,Paragraph
quest to recapture the archaic power of shelter at its most elemental.,Paragraph
"This charismatic anachronism was Louis Kahn, who by the time he died",Paragraph
in 1974 at the age of seventy-three was widely and correctly considered,Paragraph
"America’s foremost master builder, even though his mature career spanned",Paragraph
little more than two decades and he executed only about a dozen important,Paragraph
buildings. Posthumous revelations of Kahn’s messy personal history have,Paragraph
"threatened to overshadow his immense professional accomplishments, yet",Paragraph
"his aura has grown steadily, not just for what he achieved but also because",Paragraph
of what has taken place in the built environment since his death. After he,Paragraph
"almost single-handedly restored architecture’s age-old status as an art form,",Paragraph
his legacy was quickly squandered by younger coprofessionals. From the,Paragraph
"mid-1970s onward they have careened from one extreme, short-lived",Paragraph
"stylistic fad to the next—Postmodernism, Deconstructivism, Blobitecture—",Paragraph
"and lost sight of the profound values Kahn wanted to convey: timelessness,",Paragraph
"solidity, nobility, and repose.",Paragraph
Although a great number of books on Kahn’s architecture were published,Paragraph
"in the years immediately following his death, it took more than three",Paragraph
decades for a full-length biography to appear—Carter Wiseman’s Louis I.,Paragraph
Kahn: Beyond Time and Style: A Life in Architecture (2007). Another,Paragraph
decade would pass until a far more intimate account of his personal and,Paragraph
professional activities was presented by Wendy Lesser in You Say to Brick:,Paragraph
The Life of Louis Kahn (2017). Whereas Wiseman examines eight of the,Paragraph
"architect’s principal buildings in depth, Lesser focuses on five of the same",Paragraph
"works, what might be termed the Kahn Quintet: his Salk Institute for",Paragraph
"Biological Studies of 1959-1965 in La Jolla, California; the Kimbell Art",Paragraph
"Museum of 1966-1972 in Fort Worth, Texas; the Phillips Exeter Academy",Caption
"Library of 1965-1971 in Exeter, New Hampshire; the Indian Institute of",Caption
"Management of 1962-1974 in Ahmedabad, India; and the Sher-e-Bangla",Paragraph
"Nagar, or National Assembly Building, of 1962-1983 in Dhaka,",Caption
Bangladesh (see front endpapers).,Paragraph
"Each of those designs is a masterpiece, but all are also in some ways",Paragraph
"imperfect, even the universally beloved Kimbell, with its mastery of the use",Paragraph
of light to show works of art against stone walls. Its big failure is the,Paragraph
parking lot that fronts the main entrance and brings to mind a suburban strip,Paragraph
"mall, even though Kahn intended visitors to enter via the recessed courtyard",Paragraph
"on the opposite side of the building, beautifully landscaped by Harriet",Caption
"Pattison. Happily, what by default became the Kimbell’s rear fagade was",Paragraph
given new life after the opening of the freestanding Renzo Piano Pavilion of,Paragraph
2008-2013 directly across from it.,Paragraph
Problems with some of Kahn’s other buildings have been more,Paragraph
numerous. The crushing monumentality he sometimes imposed on,Paragraph
functions more suited to intimacy is epitomized by the cubic Central Hall of,Paragraph
"the Exeter library, which is dominated on each of its four sides by circular",Paragraph
concrete-framed openings thirty feet in diameter (see [llustration 10b).,Caption
"Exonians call the nearby dining hall, also designed by Kahn, “the",Paragraph
"crematorium” because of the four tall, ominous chimneys that loom over",Paragraph
the single-story structure. Yet that nickname could also apply to the,Paragraph
"yawning round maws of the library atrium. No amount of nitpicking,",Paragraph
"however, can diminish his overall contribution, which was nothing less than",Paragraph
a complete realignment of architecture’s deepest priorities.,Paragraph
That would not seem to be the expected agenda of an architect who (apart,Paragraph
from his fine government-sponsored housing projects in southeastern,Paragraph
Pennsylvania with Oscar Stonorov during the 1930s and 1940s) didn’t,Paragraph
"identify strongly with reformist social causes later on, even when they",Paragraph
became an urgent matter for many of his colleagues amid the upheavals of,Paragraph
"the 1960s. However, once Kahn began to attain critical prominence, he",Paragraph
stuck to his determination to work solely for high-minded clients. Beyond,Paragraph
the patrons of the Kahn Quintet these included universities (Bryn Mawr,Paragraph
"College, where he built his Erdman Hall Dormitories of 1960-1965);",Paragraph
museums (the Yale University Art Gallery of 1951-1953 and the Yale,Title
Center for British Art of 1966-1977); scientific institutions (the Richards,Paragraph
Medical Research Laboratories of 1957-1960 at the University of,Title
Pennsylvania); and religious groups (the First Unitarian Church and School,Paragraph
"of 1959-1969 in Rochester, New York, and Temple Beth-El Synagogue of",Paragraph
"1966-1972 in Chappaqua, New York). How often does any architect get so",Paragraph
"many prestigious opportunities, and, even more rarely, respond to them with",Paragraph
the high sense of purpose Kahn commanded?,Paragraph
"His mature designs share a remarkable formal consistency, but without",Paragraph
"the formulaic repetitiveness one sees, for example, in late-career Ludwig",Paragraph
"Mies van der Rohe. After much trial and error, Kahn at last learned how to",Paragraph
make the grand gesture with simplicity and power. He drew on the gutsy,Paragraph
ethos of the Greco-Roman tradition with volumetric heft but no hint of,Paragraph
slavish imitation. His urge to create contemporary architecture that would,Paragraph
endure through the ages was clearly announced in his essay,Paragraph
"“Monumentality” (1944), which began with the assertion: “Monumentality",Paragraph
"in architecture may be defined as a quality, a spiritual quality inherent in a",Paragraph
"structure which conveys the feeling of its eternity, that it cannot be added to",Paragraph
or changed.” Kahn’s design philosophy was based on a Platonic notion,Paragraph
similar to Michelangelo’s conviction that all forms are embedded within,Paragraph
materials and merely await the artist’s touch to be freed. The sculptor,Paragraph
believed that he needed only to chip away any parts of a marble block that,Paragraph
were not the David or the Pietd in order to discover those works within. In,Paragraph
"tum, Kahn pared down his schemes to their most irreducible essentials—",Paragraph
"monumental mass, pure geometry, numinous natural light—and jettisoned",Paragraph
the extraneous trimmings of Classicism without any loss of intensity.,Paragraph
Through his training at Penn under the French-born Beaux Arts—trained,Paragraph
"architect Paul Philippe Cret, Kahn learned all the compositional elements of",Paragraph
"the Classical vocabulary, which are evident in the grand, colonnaded,",Paragraph
temporary buildings he worked on during his first big job as principal,Paragraph
draftsman for the Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition of 1926 in,Caption
"Philadelphia, for which Cret was the master planner. Cret’s particular",Paragraph
emphasis on Beaux Arts principles such as bilateral symmetry and the,Paragraph
marche (the central processional route through a building) recurred with,Paragraph
particular force in Kahn’s late work. These are most evident at the Salk,Paragraph
"Institute, with its mirror-image, serrated concrete wings flanking a central",Paragraph
"plaza that sweeps toward the Pacific (see Illustration 10a), and at the",Paragraph
"National Assembly Building in Dhaka, with its pairs of gigantic cubes and",Paragraph
"cylinders perforated with colossal circular or triangular openings, all ringed",Caption
around a central rotunda.,Paragraph
Yet Kahn avoided what the architectural historian Sigfried Giedion,Paragraph
criticized as the besetting sin of American Beaux Arts design: “Simply and,Paragraph
mechanically transferring emotional luxury-forms from earlier periods to,Paragraph
"our own.” However heavily the past weighed on Kahn’s thinking, he was no",Paragraph
"historical revivalist, and his abstraction and transposition of ancient forms",Paragraph
to modern circumstances was on a par with that of such earlier giants as,Paragraph
"John Soane and Edwin Lutyens, though he went much further than either in",Paragraph
dispensing with applied ornament. Less apparent was his enormous debt to,Paragraph
"Le Corbusier, especially the Swiss-French master’s consecration of concrete",Paragraph
"as worthy of high-style architecture and mysterious modulation of light,",Paragraph
"above all in the Ronchamp chapel, which he revered. Kahn was early to",Paragraph
"identify Ronchamp as a hugely significant work, even while some of his",Paragraph
coprofessionals did not initially know what to make of this strange,Paragraph
biomorphic departure from its designer’s earlier machine aesthetic.,Paragraph
"When he was about to begin construction on the Salk Institute, his first",Paragraph
"major project in concrete, Kahn asked a new employee in his office, Fred",Paragraph
"Langford, how much he knew about that material. When the young man",Paragraph
"admitted, “Nothing,” his boss replied, “That makes two of us,” whereupon",Paragraph
Langford embarked on a crash course of self-education on the subject. With,Paragraph
amazing alacrity he mastered the fine points of a craft that until then had,Paragraph
"not been executed at a very high level in the United States, and thereby",Paragraph
became one of the master’s most crucial technical collaborators.,Paragraph
The infelicitous title of Lesser’s biography refers to a typically gnomic,Paragraph
"Kahnism about the inherent nature of materials: “You say to brick, ‘What",Paragraph
"do you want brick?’ Brick says to you, ‘I like an arch.’” This imaginary",Paragraph
dialogue highlights Kahn’s surprisingly old-fashioned attitude toward,Paragraph
materials and their supposed imperatives—a utilitarian notion so at odds,Paragraph
with his insistent spirituality—derived from nineteenth-century British,Paragraph
"sources, primarily John Ruskin. He indirectly absorbed Ruskin’s ideas from",Paragraph
"an art teacher at Philadelphia’s excellent Central High School, a trained",Paragraph
architect who inspired the boy to pursue his future profession. As Kahn,Paragraph
"recalled this adolescent revelation, “Architecture combined my love and",Paragraph
"desire for artistic creation, painting, and being able to express and stand",Paragraph
"out,” a neat summation of both his soaring artistic aspirations and",Paragraph
irrepressible egotism.,Paragraph
That latter quality was perversely reflected in his lifelong attitude toward,Paragraph
money. Although Kahn is always portrayed as a hopelessly inept,Paragraph
"businessman, his disdain for filthy lucre was purposeful, and he remained",Paragraph
openly contemptuous of financial go-getters. As he told his longtime,Paragraph
"engineer, August Komendant, who devised ingenious structural solutions",Paragraph
"that were beyond Kahn’s ken, including the famous vaulted skylight",Paragraph
ceilings at the Kimbell:,Caption
"If you are in the profession of architecture, it is likely that you are not",Paragraph
"an architect. If you are an architect without thinking of the profession,",Paragraph
you might be one. The profession kills your incentive. . . .,Paragraph
"You get yourself a good business character, you can really play golf",Paragraph
all day and your buildings will be built anyway. But what the devil is,Paragraph
that?,Paragraph
"From the outset, Kahn was wary of accepting work that he feared would",Paragraph
cheapen his image as a great artist-architect. He boasted that “I have refused,Paragraph
"thousands of dollars that were tainted,” and he died nearly half a million",Paragraph
"dollars in debt. Two years after his death, the state of Pennsylvania rescued",Paragraph
"his wife, Esther Israeli Kahn, from penury by buying his papers for",Paragraph
"$450,000. (They are on deposit at Penn.) The architect depended on her",Paragraph
income as a medical researcher during most of their forty-three-year,Paragraph
"marriage, and averred that his undying gratitude prevented him from",Paragraph
leaving her for either of the younger women he impregnated. He gave little,Paragraph
"more than token amounts toward the upkeep of those satellite families, and",Paragraph
his widow angrily (if understandably) rejected pleas that she help out his,Paragraph
"illegitimate children. “They’re bastards,” she declared. “They’re not entitled",Paragraph
to anything of Lou’s.”,Paragraph
"During the 1940s and 1950s he took teaching positions at Yale, MIT, and",Paragraph
Princeton (to which he commuted while maintaining his architectural,Paragraph
"practice in Philadelphia), and then ultimately at Penn, for the same reason",Paragraph
most other avant-garde architects do: to guarantee a steady income until,Paragraph
client fees were able to cover the costs of running an office. A large part of,Paragraph
"Kahn’s legend rests on his fame as a pedagogue, and even though his",Paragraph
"parallel teaching career was driven by financial necessity, he became",Paragraph
renowned for his ability to inspire students with a more elevated vision of,Paragraph
professional practice than the technically advanced but psychically stunted,Paragraph
approach characteristic of postwar American architectural education.,Paragraph
Although there are several published collections of the architect’s,Paragraph
"lectures, Kahn at Penn: Transformative Teacher of Architecture (2015)",Caption
provided the first in-depth account of his activities as an educator. Its,Paragraph
"author, James Williamson, was among the students from forty-three",Paragraph
countries who received degrees in the architect’s fabled master classes at,Paragraph
"Penn between 1956 to 1974, testimony to Kahn’s global pull during his",Paragraph
final decades. That there were only sixteen women—including Denise Scott,Paragraph
Brown—among the course’s 427 graduates is an index of the gender,Paragraph
"disparity that still persisted in architecture schools. (In recent years, upward",Paragraph
of 40 percent of architecture graduates have been women.) Many of Kahn’s,Paragraph
master class students reckoned the course to have been among the most,Paragraph
"extraordinary experiences in their lives, but several of them harbored",Paragraph
reservations. As Williamson writes:,Paragraph
"He seemed to discourage personal relationships with his students, and",Paragraph
my main impression of his personality was its combination of strength,Paragraph
"and remoteness. Although he was usually kind enough, I recall few",Paragraph
"overt expressions of concern for his students. Kahn’s idealism,",Paragraph
"although inspiring, often seemed unrealistic, and in my later",Paragraph
professional practice I have continued to struggle to reconcile his lofty,Paragraph
ideals with the realities of the marketplace.,Paragraph
"Another master class student, John Tyler Sidener Jr, known to the",Paragraph
"professor as “you from California,” felt excluded by the studio’s abstruse",Paragraph
discourse and worshipful atmosphere:,Title
"[Kahn] talked about the house as a sanctuary, a chapel, with a central",Paragraph
space ringed with columns like a small Pantheon. I wasn’t ready for,Paragraph
"that. I’d spent too long on publicly funded school buildings, low-cost",Paragraph
"housing, and other straight-forward projects. More difficult was this",Paragraph
abstract conversation; the hard-core students seemed like they were,Paragraph
"clustered around a guru under a banyan tree, with conversations only",Paragraph
among Kahn... and a few chosen students.,Paragraph
"But as others discerned, the most valuable lesson to be learned there was",Paragraph
less direct. John Raymond Griffin understood that Kahn’s intention was to,Paragraph
make his students,Title
critically examine our underlying thoughts about design . . . to begin,Paragraph
developing our own individual approaches—and not so much just,Paragraph
about architectural design—but also about the larger humanistic,Paragraph
principles and purposes which design could or should seek to reveal.,Paragraph
"As the historical record amply indicates, Kahn was wildly conflicted",Paragraph
within himself: intellectually ambitious yet insufficiently educated save in,Paragraph
his specialty; seemingly warm and generous but often aloof and,Paragraph
monstrously selfish; endlessly loquacious yet maddeningly obscurantist; at,Paragraph
"once a wise man and a spoiled child. Although an avid world traveler, he",Paragraph
never learned to drive a car. A keyboard virtuoso who helped pay for his,Paragraph
"education with jobs as a movie-house organist, he could not read musical",Paragraph
notation. Physically he presented a similar bundle of contradictions. Though,Paragraph
"he was short, often rumpled, and facially disfigured, with a high-pitched",Paragraph
voice and glasses so thick that he mockingly called himself Mr. Magoo after,Paragraph
"the purblind cartoon character, he was catnip to the ladies. Kahn’s numerous",Paragraph
erotic intrigues confirm Henry Kissinger’s oft-quoted observation that,Paragraph
power is the ultimate aphrodisiac (though here it was a matter of cultural,Paragraph
cachet rather than political clout).,Paragraph
"The deficiencies of Kahn’s appearance notwithstanding, many women",Paragraph
"found him irresistibly attractive, including his longtime collaborator and",Paragraph
"lover, Anne Griswold Tyng. Nearly twenty years his junior, she recalled",Paragraph
how “on swelteringly hot summer weekend charettes when Lou,Title
"occasionally worked shirtless, it was hard not to notice how unusually",Paragraph
broad his lightly freckled shoulders were in proportion to his slim hips.”,Paragraph
"Vincent Scully, the Yale architectural historian who did more than anyone",Paragraph
"else to establish and burnish Kahn’s critical reputation, lauded his looks in",Paragraph
almost mythic terms:,Paragraph
"The impression was of deep warmth and force, compact physical",Paragraph
"strength, a printless, cat-like walk, glistening Tartar’s eyes—only",Paragraph
"bright blue—a disordered aureole of whitening hair, once red: black",Paragraph
"suit, loose tie, pencil-sized cigar. It was at this time that he began to",Paragraph
unfold into the rather unearthly beauty and command of a Phoenix,Paragraph
risen from the fire.,Paragraph
Scully here alludes to the accident that left the future architect with,Paragraph
"horrific scars on his face and hands. In his native Estonia, the three-year-old",Paragraph
Leiser-Itze Schmulowsky (as Kahn was known until he arrived in,Paragraph
Philadelphia in 1906) was so mesmerized by the hypnotic glow of lighted,Paragraph
coals that he tried to gather them up and suffered burns so severe that they,Paragraph
nearly killed him. Though it might be facile to interpret Kahn’s strenuous,Paragraph
womanizing as overcompensation for his irrevocably damaged,Paragraph
"countenance, many people seemed not to notice it at all, such was the",Paragraph
distracting force of his magnetic personality.,Paragraph
"Kahn was unusually promiscuous by the standards of his time and place,",Paragraph
fathering three children by three women. The long-concealed chaos of his,Paragraph
private life was first revealed in 1997 with the publication of Louis Kahn to,Paragraph
"Anne Tyng: The Rome Letters, 1953-1954, edited by their recipient. Tyng, a",Caption
glacially beautiful blond WASP who had been one of the first female,Paragraph
"graduates at Harvard’s architecture school, was the golden shiksa goddess",Paragraph
of a Jewish architect’s dreams. When she became pregnant by Kahn and,Paragraph
"decided to keep their child, she went to Italy, where her older brother lived,",Paragraph
which allowed her to give birth to Alexandra Tyng (who became a realist,Paragraph
painter and the spitting image of her father) far from the prying eyes of,Paragraph
proper Philadelphians.,Paragraph
Lesser identified yet another Kahn mistress previously un-mentioned in,Paragraph
the literature. Marie Kuo was a Chinese-born architect who worked in,Paragraph
Kahn’s firm and began a sexual relationship with him while Tyng was away,Paragraph
in Italy. By the end of the 1950s he was involved in overlapping affairs with,Paragraph
"Kuo, Tyng, and Harriet Pattison, his landscape architect. In a scene worthy",Paragraph
"of Les Liaisons dangereuses, Lesser tells how Tyng overheard an office",Paragraph
telephone call in which Kuo assured her mother that she was using birth,Paragraph
"control and didn’t need to worry about an unwanted pregnancy. (Kahn, we",Paragraph
"learn, would not use condoms, and didn’t like his women to take",Paragraph
"precautions, either.) Although Kuo spoke Mandarin for privacy, she did not",Paragraph
"realize that Tyng, who was born to Episcopal missionaries in China and",Paragraph
"raised there, understood her every word.",Paragraph
"The architect hardly limited himself to three mistresses, however. One",Paragraph
colleague recalled how at parties Kahn “would glom onto some younger,Paragraph
"woman or other and just press them to the wall—very attractive women,",Paragraph
"too. And some of them fell for it,” though this would be considered sexual",Paragraph
harassment or even assault today. Lesser also disclosed Esther Kahn’s long-,Paragraph
"running affair with an acquaintance of her husband’s, an unnamed married",Paragraph
research scientist who taught at Penn and was blond and Gentile like Tyng.,Paragraph
"According to the Kahns’ daughter, Sue Ann, the architect was “so",Paragraph
engrossed in his own world that he probably never even thought about it.”,Paragraph
But nothing exposed Kahn’s unorthodox family relations more than,Paragraph
"Nathaniel Kahn’s documentary My Architect: A Son’s Journey (2003),",Paragraph
which was nominated for an Academy Award and became a sleeper box-,Paragraph
office hit. In it the director—whose mother is Pattison—joins his two older,Paragraph
"half sisters (Sue Ann is his senior by twenty-two years, Alexandra by eight)",Paragraph
in a touching demonstration of how loving families can be forged under the,Paragraph
"unlikeliest of circumstances. Alas, what they appeared to have most in",Paragraph
common was seeking the attention of an affectionate but ruthlessly self-,Paragraph
absorbed father who put his work before everything else. Whatever spiritual,Paragraph
"transcendence Louis Kahn found in his architecture, much emotional",Paragraph
wreckage followed in the heedless egotist’s wake.,Paragraph
Whereas Wiseman’s biography follows a standard cradle-to-grave,Paragraph
"chronology, Lesser inverts the narrative and begins with Kahn’s death, a",Paragraph
"device often used when a demise is particularly unusual, dramatic, or",Paragraph
notorious. Her impressive research skills are on full display as she gives the,Paragraph
most complete account yet of the architect’s end in a men’s room at,Caption
"Manhattan’s Pennsylvania Station on St. Patrick’s Day in 1974, after which",Paragraph
a perfect storm of procedural foul-ups resulted in his distraught families not,Paragraph
being notified until two days later. The author debunks several persistent,Paragraph
"but erroneous notions about the episode, some held by his closest survivors,",Paragraph
and gives plausible explanations for what went wrong and why.,Paragraph
"Posthumous medical diagnoses are impossible to verify, yet it does seem",Paragraph
likely that Kahn was a victim of excessive long-haul air voyages. To be,Paragraph
"sure, architectural practice was an international affair well before modern",Paragraph
"aviation, with masters from Bernini to Wright traveling to far-off lands in",Paragraph
search of work. But the advent of regular commercial jet service in the late,Paragraph
1950s put unprecedented pressure on architects to routinely transverse vast,Paragraph
"distances to secure commissions, supervise construction, participate in",Paragraph
"conferences, give lectures, fulfill visiting professorships, and accept awards,",Paragraph
all deemed desirable components of a major international career.,Paragraph
Cardiologists have since identified frequent and lengthy plane journeys,Paragraph
"as a major risk factor for those with heart disease, and a cause of deep-vein",Paragraph
"thrombosis, a clot that can now be prevented with advanced blood thinners.",Paragraph
"Kahn—who in his final year complained of “indigestion,” a common",Paragraph
misunderstanding of a classic cardiac symptom—was felled by a fatal,Paragraph
"coronary attack on the last leg of a grueling trek from Ahmedabad, his",Paragraph
"eighth international trip in four months, several of them halfway around the",Paragraph
"world. Such a marathon would have been hard on a younger, fitter man, but",Paragraph
the toll it took on this workaholic septuagenarian was catastrophic. Because,Paragraph

PAUL RUDOLPH,Title
"A FALL FROM Critical grace is not uncommon in the arts, but somehow it",Paragraph
"seems more surprising in architecture than in literature, music, or painting.",Paragraph
Buildings tend to remain in the public realm much longer and more,Paragraph
"conspicuously than books that go out of print, operas that languish",Paragraph
"unperformed, or paintings relegated to storage. By and large, architecture is",Paragraph
simply too expensive to destroy for mere matters of taste. There is no such,Paragraph
"thing as “out of sight, out of mind” when it comes to an ugly building,",Paragraph
"whatever the standards for judging one might be. Indeed, the benign neglect",Paragraph
of un-fashionable architecture in economically marginal areas has long been,Paragraph
an inestimable boon to historic preservation.,Paragraph
"Among the most acclaimed mid-twentieth-century American architects,",Paragraph
none experienced a more precipitous reversal of fortune than Paul Rudolph.,Paragraph
"During the late 1940s and early 1950s, Rudolph attracted well-deserved",Paragraph
attention for the more than two dozen houses he built on the west coast of,Paragraph
"Florida. These small, sprightly structures displayed what the architectural",Paragraph
historian Robin Middleton aptly termed “a very bright-young-boyish,Paragraph
"charm.” Rudolph’s informal, lightweight houses demonstrated his dynamic",Paragraph
"manipulation of space, inventive use of new materials, and rejection of rote",Paragraph
domestic conventions. It was thrilling to imagine what he might do on a,Paragraph
larger scale with bigger budgets.,Paragraph
"At the peak of his career, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Rudolph was",Paragraph
widely deemed destined for greatness. With the death in 1961 of Eero,Paragraph
"Saarinen, then the preeminent architect of his generation, Rudolph appeared",Paragraph
"ready to lead the American architectural avant-garde. (Louis Kahn, who",Paragraph
"was considerably older than both men, began to be perceived as this",Paragraph
country’s most important contemporary architect only in the late 1960s.) As,Paragraph
"Rudolph’s renown grew, he became preoccupied with two concerns—self-",Paragraph
expression and monumentality—that were fundamentally at odds with the,Paragraph
empathetic touch and humane feel of his early works.,Paragraph
The extent to which modem architecture had become formulaic by,Paragraph
midcentury led Rudolph to ponder how he could stand out from the crowd.,Paragraph
His quest for a distinctive stylistic manner led him to adopt the tough,Paragraph
"vocabulary of New Brutalism, with its vigorously sculptural compositions",Paragraph
that made the modular steel-and-glass grids of the Miesian school look,Paragraph
somewhat anemic and routine. Rudolph’s distinctively American version of,Paragraph
Brutalism diverged from that of his foreign peers in his attraction to,Paragraph
scenographic design—architecture that begins with a preconceived idea of,Paragraph
"how a building should look from a specific vantage point, in contrast to the",Paragraph
Modernist belief that the internal functions of a structure should determine,Paragraph
"its external form. However, despite the arresting profiles scenographic",Paragraph
design could engender—perhaps most famously in modem architecture the,Paragraph
sail-like rooflines of Jorn Utzon’s harborfront Sydney Opera House of,Caption
1957-1973—the practice struck some as a throwback to nineteenth-century,Paragraph
Romanticism.,Paragraph
Another major difference in Rudolph’s approach was that instead of,Paragraph
"using poured concrete like his counterparts abroad, he chose a less",Paragraph
demanding and more economical altemnative—the rough-finished precast,Paragraph
concrete blocks that became his hallmark. Poured-in-place concrete requires,Paragraph
"costly wooden forms to contain the material until it hardens, whereas",Paragraph
precast blocks eliminate that expense and can be used like bricks. Because,Paragraph
he wanted to create more voluptuous volumes and richer surface textures,Paragraph
"than was possible with standard concrete blocks, Rudolph designed a range",Paragraph
of precast components with rounded surfaces that could be combined to,Paragraph
make a variety of curving forms. These pieces were fabricated with vertical,Paragraph
ribs or flutes that mimicked the look of more labor-intensive bush-,Paragraph
"hammered concrete, which is mechanically distressed to achieve a",Paragraph
corrugated surface (and which he used for his Yale Art and Architecture,Paragraph
"Building). Whether handcrafted or prefabricated, these components gave",Paragraph
the exteriors of Rudolph’s buildings a fuzzy striped effect often likened to,Paragraph
"corduroy, although of course not in any way soft.",Paragraph
Such was his publicity juggernaut that the press reflexively lauded,Paragraph
"Rudolph’s bombastic institutional schemes, epitomized by his eerily",Paragraph
"cavernous, crushingly heavy Government Service Center in Boston of",Paragraph
"1962-1971—a fortresslike complex with a swirling, multilevel interior that",Paragraph
brings to mind the inner ear of some Brobdingnagian creature. The lack of,Paragraph
critical analysis such overbearing works received at the time is doubtless,Paragraph
attributable to the friendships Rudolph assiduously cultivated with editors,Paragraph
"and critics in both the professional and general-interest press. Furthermore,",Paragraph
his striking black-and-white renderings—meticulous networks of tiny lines,Paragraph
that convey three-dimensional depth and look terrific in print—made him a,Paragraph
favorite of art directors eager to achieve layouts with powerful impact.,Paragraph
Perhaps prompted by the historian Sigfried Giedion’s influential 1944,Paragraph
essay “The Need for a New Monumentality”’—which argued that modern,Paragraph
architecture lacked the imposing presence of earlier building styles—,Paragraph
Rudolph sought to make his designs more monumental. Like many other,Paragraph
"architects, he equated size with significance and attempted to turn even",Paragraph
lesser public commissions into major statements. A case in point is his,Paragraph
"Orange County Government Center of 1963-1971 in Goshen, New York, a",Paragraph
grandiose pileup of boxy concrete forms that seems pompously,Paragraph
overreaching for a small-town office building.,Paragraph
When Rudolph stepped down as the dean of the Yale School of,Paragraph
"Architecture in 1965, he grandly announced that he was moving to New",Paragraph
"York to become a skyscraper architect, a macho ambition that few true",Paragraph
"artist-architects would harbor, let alone openly express. As it turned out, he",Paragraph
"got to execute tall buildings only late in his career, but that did not stop him",Paragraph
from fantasizing about mammoth high-rise projects until he had the chance,Paragraph
to build them. Responding to the visionary megastructures proposed in the,Paragraph
1950s by the international collaborative Team 10 and in the 1960s by the,Paragraph
"Metabolist group in Japan and the Archigram group in Britain, Rudolph in",Paragraph
the late 1960s and early 1970s devised hypothetical Manhattan schemes for,Paragraph
gigantic agglomerations of mixed-use “plug-in” units that were to be,Paragraph
inserted into elongated and towering frameworks reminiscent of children’s,Paragraph
"building kits like Lego bricks, Erector Sets, and Tinkertoys. (Imagining",Paragraph
"such visionary projects was hardly confined to architects, as demonstrated",Paragraph
"by Norman Mailer’s model for his “Mile High City,” some seven feet tall",Paragraph
"and comprising more than 20,000 Lego pieces, which was used to illustrate",Paragraph
the dust jacket of his 1966 book Cannibals and Christians.),Paragraph
Though fortunately none of Rudolph’s New York City megastructures,Paragraph
"was ever built, he applied a low-rise version of the same concept to one of",Paragraph
"the more imaginative American multiunit housing schemes of the period,",Paragraph
Oriental Masonic Gardens of 1968-1971 in New Haven (the exotic name of,Paragraph
which referred not to some fanciful real estate marketing concept but to the,Paragraph
fraternal organization that sponsored it). Here 148 prefabricated shoebox-,Paragraph
shaped units akin to mobile homes—which Rudolph dubbed “the twentieth-,Paragraph
century brick”—were grouped in right-angled clusters around courtyards,Paragraph
and stacked no higher than two stories. The barrel-vaulted roof of each,Paragraph
“brick” gave a lovely rippling rhythm to the slightly inclined twelve-and-a-,Paragraph
"half-acre site. Yet as Rudolph later admitted, residents hated the place: their",Paragraph
"dwellings leaked, some felt the development was as déclassé as a trailer",Paragraph
"park, and only a decade after its completion this noble experiment was",Paragraph
demolished.,Paragraph
In his 2014 monograph on this complex and sometimes confounding,Paragraph
"figure, the architectural historian Timothy M. Rohan emerged as the",Paragraph
foremost posthumous advocate of Rudolph’s works. Even though Rohan is,Paragraph
"wholly sympathetic to his subject, he is far from uncritical about the factors",Paragraph
that contributed to Rudolph’s career decline. Rohan offers credible insights,Paragraph
into how Rudolph’s homosexuality was reflected in his work and suggests,Paragraph
"that his characteristic juxtaposition of defensive, often concrete exteriors",Paragraph
and sensuous interiors parallels the dichotomy between his carefully,Paragraph
maintained straight public image and his concealed gay private life.,Paragraph
"However, like several vanguard American artists of the 1960s—including",Paragraph
"Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, and Andy Warhol—Rudolph (as well",Paragraph
as his architectural contemporaries Philip Johnson and Charles Moore) did,Paragraph
"not deny his homosexuality, although none of them openly proclaimed it,",Paragraph
either.,Paragraph
Paul Marvin Rudolph was born in 1918 in southwestern Kentucky. His,Paragraph
"father was an itinerant Methodist minister, and as Rudolph observed when",Paragraph
"he was eighteen, “moving around and being a preacher’s son has been",Paragraph
"hard,” although doubtless not nearly as difficult as his emerging awareness",Paragraph
"of his sexuality given his family, geographic, and generational",Paragraph
circumstances. Yet the Rudolphs’ fourteen changes of address during his,Paragraph
peripatetic childhood also helped him develop an encyclopedic eye for,Paragraph
"indigenous southern architectural forms. Sensitive and introverted, he took",Paragraph
"refuge in art and music, and became such an accomplished pianist that he",Paragraph
contemplated a concert career until he placed second in a national,Paragraph
competition. His need to be number one suddenly emerged as such a strong,Paragraph
personal imperative that he there and then shifted his career ambition to the,Paragraph
building art.,Paragraph
Rudolph studied architecture at the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (now,Paragraph
"Auburn University), where at the precocious age of twenty-one he executed",Paragraph
"his first building, for a professor at the school—the redbrick ranch-style",Paragraph
Atkinson house of 1940. His next project was his initial collaboration with,Paragraph
"Ralph Twitchell, in whose Sarasota architectural office he worked during a",Paragraph
gap year before starting a graduate degree. The Twitchell house of 1941 in,Paragraph
"Siesta Key, Florida, shows the clear influence of Frank Lloyd Wright, a",Paragraph
prime example of whose residential work—the Rosenbaum house of 1939,Paragraph
"in Florence, Alabama—Rudolph had visited and admired. The Twitchell",Paragraph
house closely follows the economical formula Wright called Usonian—,Paragraph
usually featuring low roofs and open living areas. The Twitchell house had,Paragraph
"low-slung massing, an overhanging roof, and concrete-block construction,",Paragraph
along with horizontal stained-wood siding and a compact kitchen.,Caption
Three months after Rudolph entered the Harvard Graduate School of,Paragraph
"Design in 1941, the US entered World War II and he enlisted in the navy.",Paragraph
"After taking maritime architecture courses at MIT, he was stationed at the",Paragraph
Brooklyn Navy Yard and put in charge of ship repair. The hands-on,Paragraph
"knowledge he gained there had a direct effect on his later work, and",Paragraph
Rudolph’s mastery of low-cost techniques for lightweight framing for,Paragraph
houses and new materials such as Cocoon (a spray-on plastic used to,Paragraph
mothball disused ship components) resurfaced in his ingenious postwar,Paragraph
designs. This was yet another example of how countless young architects,Paragraph
transformed their improvisatory wartime experiments into practices that,Paragraph
later entered the professional mainstream.,Paragraph
"When peace came, Rudolph returned to the Twitchell office and then",Paragraph
"completed his degree at Harvard, where he won a traveling fellowship that",Paragraph
allowed him to witness firsthand the building boom in Europe. He was,Paragraph
particularly taken by Le Corbusier’s Unité d’Habitation of 1947-1952 in,Paragraph
"Marseille, with its monumental scale and expressive use of béton brut.",Paragraph
"Although Twitchell made him a partner in 1950, Rudolph later insisted that",Paragraph
the designs credited to both men were entirely his own work. Never the,Paragraph
"most collegial of collaborators, he broke with his early mentor in 1952 and",Paragraph
set up his own practice.,Paragraph
"Eager to make a name for himself, avoid being typecast as a regional",Paragraph
"residential specialist, and establish useful contacts nationwide, the hugely",Paragraph
ambitious Rudolph accepted teaching positions at architecture schools all,Paragraph
"across the country, including Comell, Harvard, MIT, Penn, Tulane, UCLA,",Paragraph
"and Yale, sometimes overlapping in impractical ways. With considerable",Paragraph
"effort he juggled his dual design and educational career, and during the",Paragraph
academic year ran his small Sarasota practice via telephone and mail. In,Paragraph
short order he was awarded such high-profile jobs as the installation for the,Paragraph
Museum of Modern Art’s wildly popular 1955 photography exhibition “The,Paragraph
Family of Man”; the Jewett Arts Center of 1955-1958 at Wellesley College,Caption
"in Massachusetts, a redbrick complex with moderized Gothic overtones",Paragraph
reminiscent of Basil Spence’s concurrent work in Britain; and several,Paragraph
"building projects in New Haven, where he became dean of the Yale School",Paragraph
of Architecture in 1958. It was a heady ascent for the shy but striving,Paragraph
preacher’s boy.,Paragraph
"Ironically enough, the project that halted Rudolph’s rapid career",Paragraph
"advancement was the Yale Art and Architecture Building of 1958-1963, the",Paragraph
plum commission he received soon after arriving in New Haven (see,Paragraph
Illustration 11a). This was the latest in university president A. Whitney,Paragraph
Griswold’s admirable program to bring the best of contemporary,Paragraph
"architecture to the campus, which included works by Kahn, Saarinen,",Paragraph
"Johnson, and Gordon Bunshaft. As a series of Rudolph’s preparatory",Paragraph
"renderings show, he gradually but relentlessly inflated the A&A Building",Paragraph
(as it was known) from a relatively modest colonnaded structure in his,Paragraph
initial version into the Brutalist behemoth that was erected—a nearly cubic,Paragraph
core surrounded by a phalanx of windowless towers as forbidding as those,Paragraph
of a medieval castle.,Paragraph
The building’s many functional flaws soon became unavoidable—thirty-,Paragraph
"seven different levels were crammed into its seven stories, a preposterous",Paragraph
overelaboration of space—and as the social upheavals of the 1960s,Paragraph
"unfolded, the heroic ethos Rudolph tried to evoke came across to rebellious",Paragraph
"students as authoritarian posturing. His successor as dean, the scholarly",Paragraph
"postmodernist Charles Moore, held a view of architecture diametrically",Paragraph
"opposed to Rudolph’s, and had far greater knowledge of and respect for",Paragraph
"both historical and vernacular traditions. As Moore slyly proclaimed, “I",Paragraph
disapprove of the Art and Architecture Building whole-heartedly because it,Paragraph
"is such a personal manifestation for non-personal use. However, I enjoy",Paragraph
very much being in it.”,Paragraph
"To improve the structure’s ill-resolved spatial organization, Moore",Paragraph
encouraged students to take matters into their own hands and reconfigure,Paragraph
"studio spaces as they saw fit. He turned Rudolph’s stately penthouse, which",Paragraph
"had been used for entertaining and as guest quarters for eminent visitors,",Paragraph
"into a student coffeehouse. Haphazardly altered and poorly maintained, the",Paragraph
A&A Building under Moore’s deanship became a countercultural mess.,Paragraph
"Then, in June 1969, a mysterious fire gutted the structure. Although the",Paragraph
"cause was never determined, Rudolph went to his grave convinced that",Paragraph
Moore had somehow incited the destruction of his misunderstood,Paragraph
"masterpiece. (The building was salvaged, unsympathetically rehabbed, and",Paragraph
then finally restored by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates in 2007-2008.),Paragraph
With his reputation in decline as architectural tastes shifted to more user-,Paragraph
"friendly schemes, Rudolph pinned his hopes for a comeback on his largest-",Paragraph
"ever residential scheme, the Bass house of 1970-1972 in Fort Worth,",Paragraph
"commissioned by the Texas oil heir Sid R. Bass and his first wife, Anne.",Paragraph
The A&A Building went up while Bass was a Yale undergraduate and he,Paragraph
deeply admired its architect. The admiration between Bass and Rudolph,Paragraph
"was mutual, and the architect referred to his patron as “my Renaissance",Paragraph
"prince.” Rudolph saw the Bass residence as his equivalent of Fallingwater,",Paragraph
"Frank Lloyd Wright’s most famous house, which helped revive the master’s",Paragraph
career after a long dry spell. Rudolph’s scheme took many cues from that,Paragraph
"legendary prototype, most notably its tiered arrangement of balconies",Paragraph
thrusting outward from a central mast like huge domino tiles set at right,Paragraph
angles to one another.,Paragraph
"However, the Basses’ site lacked the inherent drama of the Appalachian",Paragraph
ravine where Wright found a waterfall from which all blessings flowed.,Paragraph
Even the addition of an artificial pond by the landscape architect Robert,Paragraph
"Zion didn’t do the trick in Fort Worth. However, thanks to the clients’",Paragraph
"ample funding, Rudolph was able to use costlier materials and attain a much",Paragraph
higher level of execution than ever before. The white-painted steel,Paragraph
"framework of the Bass house is as precisely crafted as that of its model,",Paragraph
"Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s Farnsworth house of 1946-1951 in Plano,",Caption
"Illinois. And instead of the painted wood siding of Rudolph’s early houses,",Paragraph
"here he used white porcelain-coated aluminum panels, a deluxe cladding",Paragraph
component favored by the then-rising star Richard Meier.,Paragraph
While the expansive (and expensive) Bass house is a far more pleasing,Paragraph
"composition than Rudolph’s Brutalist public works, it offers another",Paragraph
"example of his deep-seated urge to overcomplicate things, not least in his",Paragraph
dragging out the entry sequence to a tedious extreme. He calculated that a,Paragraph
visitor would make eight turns and ascend fifteen feet in traveling from the,Paragraph
"front door to the living room. In contrast, at Alvar Aalto’s incomparable",Paragraph
"Villa Mairea of 1935-1938 in Noormarkku, Finland, visitors move directly",Paragraph
from the entry to the heart of this extensive layout in a matter of seconds.,Paragraph
"Sadly for Rudolph, the Basses did not want images of their house to be",Paragraph
published because of security concerns. Without being splashed over the,Paragraph
pages of glossy shelter magazines it did not have the restorative effect on,Paragraph
"his reputation that its architect had so fervently wished for, and his critical",Paragraph
rehabilitation never materialized.,Paragraph
Although the critic Michael Sorkin praised Rudolph’s own Manhattan,Paragraph
penthouse of 1977-1997 as “one of the most amazing pieces of modern,Paragraph
"urban domestic architecture produced in this country,” I had quite a",Paragraph
different experience when Rudolph invited me and my wife to a buffet,Paragraph
"dinner there in 1986, after an opening of his drawings at the Max Protetch",Paragraph
Gallery. Throughout that multistory apartment (built atop an existing,Paragraph
"Beekman Place town house, the lower portions of which the owner rented",Paragraph
"out for extra income), surface finishes and details were astonishingly",Paragraph
"shoddy. For example, railings that in photographs seemed to be made of",Paragraph
polished chrome were actually covered in peeling Mylar. Floor levels,Paragraph
"shifted up or down every few feet for no apparent reason, and narrow",Paragraph
Plexiglas catwalks spanned chasms open to the stories below. There was so,Paragraph
little continuous floor space amid the cavernous volumes that guests that,Paragraph
evening huddled on the small carpeted platforms like Little Eva on the ice,Paragraph
floes.,Paragraph
Odd sources of dim illumination—underneath stair treads and behind,Paragraph
"floating wall panels—made navigation treacherous, especially for such",Paragraph
older luminaries as the designer Ray Eames and the architectural historian,Paragraph
Vincent Scully. There was much stumbling and tripping as we tried to,Paragraph
"negotiate the labyrinthine circulation paths to and from the food and drinks,",Paragraph
and even when we were seated mishaps continued. A large modular coffee,Paragraph
table appeared to be composed of alternating cubes of reflective and matte,Paragraph
black Lucite. But when someone set a drink down on one of the matte,Paragraph
"squares, it turned out to be a void and the glass crashed to the story below.",Paragraph
"The architect and his longtime, much younger Swiss companion, Ernst",Paragraph
"Wagner, proudly conducted a house tour, which included such unanticipated",Paragraph
sights as a clear Plexiglas bathtub that was fully visible from the level,Paragraph
below. This voyeuristic detail seemed a latter-day equivalent of the architect,Paragraph
"Stanford White’s notorious red velvet swing, beneath which he would stand",Paragraph
and look up the skirts of young girls he fancied. Whatever erotic allure,Paragraph
Rudolph’s exhibitionist showpiece might have possessed was subverted by,Paragraph
deposits of unidentifiable green matter in the tub’s corners.,Paragraph
"Understandably, the Rudolph penthouse has become a source of",Paragraph
comment among queer theorists. The owner’s jaw-dropping bedroom,Paragraph
featured floor-to-ceiling mirrors that reflected a white marble Roman male,Caption
"torso and, mounted on the wall behind the white-fur-covered bed, a",Paragraph
"superscale advertising billboard image of a shirtless, hirsute young man",Paragraph
being pawed by a passel of adoring young women. When a story on this,Paragraph
"startling interior was published in The New York Times Magazine in 1967,",Paragraph
some saw it as the architect’s inadvertent coming out. By the time of our,Paragraph
visit the white-fur bedspread had been replaced by one of white leather,Paragraph
"perforated with metal grommets, which prompted another guest, the",Paragraph
"longtime MoMA trustee Barbara Jakobson, to ask our host, “What do you",Paragraph
"call this, Paul, the Stud Room?,” which caused him to blush deeply.",Paragraph
"But as Rohan notes, “Though highly self-aware and self-critical, Rudolph",Paragraph
"had several psychological or cognitive blind spots, such as believing that",Paragraph
his homosexuality was not apparent to others.” He was of course entitled to,Paragraph
"create for himself whatever fantasy environment he liked, but the penthouse",Paragraph
"was dangerous for some visitors. As we bid good night to our host, Scully",Paragraph
"spoke for several of us when he said, “Thanks, Paul, it’s been a terrifying",Paragraph
evening.”,Paragraph
It is one thing to be uncomfortable in someone else’s house but quite,Paragraph
"another to feel not at home in your own. Alexander Hirsch, who",Paragraph
commissioned a town house on Manhattan’s Upper East Side from Rudolph,Caption
"in 1966-1967, never fully acclimated to that twenty-five-foot-wide",Paragraph
"structure, which he shared with his companion, Lewis Turner. To be sure, it",Paragraph
"is a handsome design, fronted by a brown glass facade framed in a",Paragraph
"monochromatic, Mondrian-like pattern of brown-painted steel I-beams.",Paragraph
Visitors enter through a low-ceilinged vestibule and thence into a dramatic,Paragraph
double-height living room with a balcony that surrounds its upper,Caption
periphery. This raised level is reachable only by a flight of floating stair,Paragraph
treads that jut out from the side wall without risers or a bannister. The two,Paragraph
"original inhabitants, then in their sixties, felt this was an accident waiting to",Paragraph
happen and tended to stay away from that part of the interior.,Paragraph
"Soon after the couple moved in, Rudolph took it upon himself to add a",Paragraph

of advanced engineering prevented the second from being an even worse,Paragraph
"catastrophe—his critical standing has never risen from the ashes, and he is",Paragraph
"now regarded, if at all, as a period curiosity.",Paragraph
My disillusionment with Yamasaki began with an eye-opening,Paragraph
undergraduate survey course on moder architecture given at Columbia in,Paragraph
"the late 1960s by Eugene Santomasso, a charismatic young instructor who",Paragraph
had studied at Yale with the legendary architectural historian Vincent,Paragraph

wage jobs Americans did not want. A similar reaction against the Japanese,Paragraph
"later resulted in the Immigration Act of 1924, which banned all Asians from",Paragraph

Yamasaki. Late in life he still harbored bitter feelings about the racial,Paragraph
"prejudice he faced while growing up, which persisted for decades even as",Paragraph
he found the financial success that had eluded his shoe-salesman father.,Paragraph
"However, it was a case not only of race but of class, and there was a",Paragraph

"ambassador, a bank president, and assorted literati are in the couple’s",Paragraph
genealogies—and they were smoothly accepted into the highest echelons of,Paragraph

"Unlike many future architects, Yamasaki did not have artistic leanings as",Paragraph

"Upon graduation Yamasaki headed straight for New York City, where he",Paragraph
felt he could escape the discrimination he suffered in Seattle. But like many,Paragraph
"of his coprofessionals, during the slump he could not find full-time work,",Paragraph
"and survived on odd jobs until he was hired in 1938 by Shreve, Lamb &",Paragraph

buildings widely spaced among parklike grounds to supplant densely settled,Paragraph
mid-rise neighborhoods.,Paragraph
"During World War II, Yamasaki oversaw construction of the firm’s huge",Paragraph
"naval training station on Lake Seneca in up-state New York, which gave",Paragraph
him the organizational skills needed to manage large-scale schemes. While,Paragraph
"occupied with this patriotic work, he had to rescue his parents from being",Paragraph
put into an internment camp on the West Coast and brought them to New,Paragraph
"York, where they were crammed together with the architect, his new wife,",Paragraph
and his medical-student brother in a one-bedroom apartment.,Paragraph
"When civilian construction resumed after the war, he was recruited by",Paragraph
"Detroit’s foremost architecture office, Smith, Hinchman & Grylls, to",Paragraph
become its chief designer and take the firm in a more Modernist direction.,Paragraph
"Despite his increase in status and income, Yamasaki still had not escaped",Paragraph
racism. Although now well able to afford a house in the upscale Detroit,Paragraph
"suburbs of Birmingham, Bloomfield Hills, and Grosse Pointe, he found it",Paragraph
impossible for an Asian-American to breach those all-white enclaves and,Paragraph
eventually bought a nineteenth-century farmhouse in an unincorporated,Paragraph
township twenty miles from his office.,Paragraph
Although Yamasaki was already well aware of the priorities of,Paragraph
"commercial architectural practice—at Shreve, Lamb & Harmon, one",Caption
"partner’s mantra was “Finance dictates fenestration, rent rolls rule the parti",Paragraph
[the organizational concept of a  building]”—he quickly became,Paragraph
"disillusioned in his new position. As he later observed, “The makeup of a",Paragraph
large (several hundred men) office is such that its primary concern has to be,Paragraph
"to make as much money as possible, forcing it to take almost any kind of",Paragraph
"work.” In such firms, “the turnover . . . works against the creation of",Paragraph
"sensitive, responsive architecture.” Furthermore, he recalled, “I was never",Paragraph
"permitted to meet with the client” if design changes were called for, and",Paragraph
"although this might be attributed to corporate bureaucracy, it is hard not to",Paragraph
wonder if there was a racial component to his exclusion.,Paragraph
"In 1949 Yamasaki and two office colleagues, Joseph Leinweber and",Paragraph
"George Hellmuth, set up their own partnership in Detroit, and because of",Paragraph
"important contacts that the St. Louis—born Hellmuth had in his hometown,",Paragraph
"they opened a second branch there. (Hellmuth went on to found Hellmuth,",Paragraph
"Obata + Kassabaum, now known as HOK, the largest architecture firm in",Paragraph
the US.) The combination of Hellmuth’s local connections and Yamasaki’s,Paragraph
Parkchester credentials quickly won them big commissions for public,Paragraph
"housing in St. Louis, which at the time was in the throes of a thoroughgoing",Paragraph
slum clearance and urban renewal campaign.,Paragraph
But if Yamasaki had already been frustrated by the economic incentives,Paragraph
"of large commercial architecture firms, such constraints were nothing",Paragraph
"compared to those imposed by the Federal Public Housing Authority, the",Paragraph
"New Deal agency that regulated the planning, design, and construction of",Paragraph
what became known as “the projects.” It has been correctly noted that,Paragraph
architects of speculative skyscrapers are so limited by economic factors that,Paragraph
they can do little more than decorate the exterior of a bulk predetermined by,Paragraph
cost accountants. Yamasaki found himself in much the same position when,Paragraph
"he planned his most controversial work, the Pruitt-[goe Apartments of",Paragraph
1950-1956 in St. Louis.,Caption
"Although he kept abreast of recent trends in social housing in Europe, he",Paragraph
was stymied in applying those new ideas in this commission because every,Paragraph
design decision was subject to a plethora of bureaucratic regulations. The,Paragraph
countless mandated requirements—from the minimum size of rooms to the,Paragraph
"disposition of windows, closets, and appliances—make one wonder how",Paragraph
"any architect could juggle so many competing demands, stick to the",Paragraph
"prohibitively low budget prescribed for each unit (under $1,750 per",Paragraph
"apartment, or around $18,000 today), and still come up with a coherent, let",Paragraph
"alone beautiful, design.",Paragraph
Whatever small grace notes Yamasaki was able to eke out under these,Paragraph
restrictive circumstances were further undermined by budget cuts during the,Paragraph
"Korean War, which began in 1950 just as his plans were being completed.",Paragraph
"Nonetheless, the final results, however compromised, were met with",Paragraph
grateful enthusiasm by the first inhabitants of Pruitt-lgoe—African-,Paragraph
Americans who found the racially segregated development to be a vast,Paragraph
improvement over the degrading living conditions they had been inured to.,Paragraph
This was confirmed by original residents of the complex who were,Paragraph
interviewed by the filmmaker Chad Freidrichs for his corrective 2011,Paragraph
"documentary, The Pruitt-Igoe Myth. Their appreciative testimony refuted",Paragraph
the persistent canard that the alleged debacle of postwar public housing in,Paragraph
America—to say nothing of modern architecture as a whole—could be,Paragraph
"summed up by this noble St. Louis experiment, which ended when the",Paragraph
"dilapidated, crime-ridden project was demolished, a victim of not so benign",Paragraph
"neglect, only eighteen years after it opened.",Paragraph
The misconception that high-rise public housing was responsible for,Paragraph
social malaise because of its design attributes has been promoted by many,Paragraph
"opponents of Modernist architecture, most notably the critic Charles Jencks,",Paragraph
who began his 1977 polemic The Language of Post-Modern Architecture by,Paragraph
writing:,Title
"Modern architecture died in St. Louis, Missouri on July 15, 1972 at",Paragraph
"3.32 pm (or thereabouts) when the infamous Pruitt-Igoe scheme, or",Paragraph
"rather several of its slab blocks, were given the final coup de grace by",Paragraph
"dynamite. Previously it had been vandalised, mutilated and defaced by",Paragraph
"its black inhabitants, and although millions of dollars were pumped",Paragraph
"back, trying to keep it alive (fixing the broken elevators, repairing",Paragraph
"smashed windows, repainting), it was finally put out of its misery.",Paragraph
"However, as has been amply confirmed by well-informed sociologists,",Paragraph
"including the housing specialist Herbert Gans, the problems that were",Paragraph
allowed to get so unmanageably out of control at Pruitt-[goe were not,Paragraph
"architectural in origin. Rather, they had mainly to do with reductions in",Paragraph
basic maintenance and social services as government funding for Great,Title
Society programs was shifted to the Vietnam War.,Paragraph
"Nonetheless, Jencks’s assertion has remained indelibly fixed in the public",Paragraph
"imagination, as indicated by the Victoria and Albert Museum’s 2011 design",Paragraph
"exhibition “Postmodernism: Style and Subversion, 1970-1990,” which",Paragraph
opened with an enormous photomural of the Pruitt-Igoe towers collapsing,Paragraph
"amid clouds of dust, like some lurid Victorian tableau of Samson pulling",Paragraph
"down the pillars of the temple. No architect likes to see his work destroyed,",Paragraph
"but Yamasaki felt deeply humiliated by the ignominious end of Pruitt-Igoe,",Paragraph
and a few years afterward he wrote that “of the buildings we have been,Paragraph
involved with over the years [ hate this one the most.”,Paragraph
None of this could have been foretold at the time of Pruitt-Igoe’s,Paragraph
"completion, and during the 1950s Yamasaki racked up one enviable",Paragraph
commission after another. His Lambert-St. Louis Airport Terminal of,Paragraph
"1951-1956, with its sequence of four triple-vaulted concrete canopies,",Paragraph
although not quite as audacious as Saarinen’s TWA Terminal of 1956-1962,Paragraph
"in New York City, nonetheless conveys a similarly evocative image of Jet",Paragraph
Age dynamism. Yamasaki was esteemed enough to be chosen for the State,Paragraph
Department’s embassy architecture program—an initiative meant to,Paragraph
advertise the Modernist supremacy of the US—and designed the US,Paragraph
"Consulate of 1954-1956 in Kobe, Japan.",Paragraph
There he came up with a low-rise grouping of three flat-roofed,Paragraph
rectangular structures set around a traditional Japanese landscape garden. In,Paragraph
"a nod to the local vernacular, he suspended a contemporary metal",Paragraph
adaptation of bamboo sudare blinds—which although immobile work well,Paragraph
to filter daylight—from the projecting upper perimeter of each story. During,Paragraph
this commission the architect’s exploration of his ancestral homeland,Paragraph
"intensified a growing desire to bring a more spiritual element—“serenity,",Paragraph
"surprise, and delight,” as he put it—to his work.",Paragraph
"In purely formalist terms, however, it is often hard to distinguish",Paragraph
Yamasaki’s designs from those of his even more celebrated rival Edward,Paragraph
"Durell Stone, who likewise espoused an approach meant to be more",Paragraph
visually enticing than the glass-walled boxes of the debased commercial,Paragraph
version of the late International Style. The main difference between the two,Paragraph
"architects, it now seems, is that Stone wrapped his travertine-clad",Paragraph
"shoeboxes in pierced screens of vaguely Mughal derivation, whereas",Paragraph
"Yamasaki preferred outer scrims of faux-Gothic appliqués and, later on,",Paragraph
stylized classical colonnades more familiar to Beverly Hills than to the,Paragraph
seven hills of Rome. In due course a confusing repetitiveness set in to,Paragraph
"Yamasaki’s work, and it was hard to tell from their exaggerated but",Paragraph
superficial surface effects whether the building underneath was a synagogue,Paragraph
"on Chicago’s North Shore or an airport in Dhahran, given how closely the",Paragraph
Islamo-Gothic facades of those two buildings resembled each other.,Paragraph
In 1962 Yamasaki completed his most prestigious commission yet: the,Paragraph
"United States Science Pavilion at the Century 21 Exposition, more",Caption
commonly known as the Seattle World’s Fair. This interconnected cluster of,Paragraph
six rectangular white pavilions (now called the Pacific Science Center) is,Paragraph
surfaced with stylized Gothic tracery and hovers above a series of fountain-,Paragraph
studded reflecting pools interspersed with plazas. Over the ensemble soars a,Paragraph
freestanding group of five schematic Gothic arches meant to reinforce the,Paragraph
quasi-religious symbolism of what one commentator has called this “virtual,Paragraph
cathedral of science.” Yet the architectural hit of the exposition was the,Paragraph
"Space Needle, Edward E. Carlson and John Graham Jr.’s Jetsons-like",Paragraph
"observation tower, then the tallest structure west of the Mississippi. With its",Paragraph
hipster-futuristic styling—like a flying saucer perched atop a,Paragraph
hyperelongated tripod—the Space Needle remains a perennial tourist,Paragraph
"attraction, while Yamasaki’s time-warp design evokes a stage set on a 1960s",Paragraph
Ed Sullivan Show excerpt from Camelot.,Caption
"The acclaim that greeted his Seattle World’s Fair designs, however, led to",Paragraph
two major high-rise commissions in that city—the IBM Building of 1962-,Paragraph
1964 (which proved that even the simplest architectural box can be,Paragraph
"awkwardly proportioned) and the Rainier Bank Tower of 1972-1977, both",Paragraph
"of which, with white exteriors of narrowly spaced vertical ribbing, look",Paragraph
"much like the skyscrapers Stone was producing at the same time, including",Paragraph
his General Motors Building of 1963-1968 in New York City. Leaving,Paragraph
aside such oddities as Yamasaki’s US Pavilion of 1958-1959 at the World,Paragraph
Agricultural Fair in New Delhi—with a sea of gilded onion domes worthy,Paragraph
of Las Vegas’s Aladdin Hotel—the most bizarre thing he ever created was,Paragraph
the Rainier Bank Tower. This twenty-nine-story office block is hoisted atop,Paragraph
"an upwardly flaring, windowless eleven-story concrete pedestal that at its",Paragraph
base is only half the width of the superstructure it supports. Although a tour,Paragraph
"de force of engineering, the precarious-looking building remains deeply",Paragraph
"unsettling, especially in the earthquake-prone Pacific Northwest.",Paragraph
Thanks to his burgeoning reputation as a skyscraper architect with an,Paragraph
"artistic aura, Yamasaki was an obvious candidate for the most ambitious",Paragraph
American urban design initiative of the 1960s—the World Trade Center in,Paragraph
"New York City. This was the pet project of David Rockefeller, the president",Paragraph
"of Chase Manhattan Bank, who wanted to shore up the faltering value of his",Paragraph
family’s Lower Manhattan real estate holdings as financial services firms,Title
moved from the Wall Street area to midtown or the suburbs. He pursued this,Paragraph
"grandiose scheme, which never had a sound economic rationale, with the",Paragraph
"backing of his older brother, New York governor Nelson Rockefeller, whose",Paragraph
long tenure in Albany overlapped with most of this fourteen-year,Paragraph
undertaking (see frontispiece). The state’s chief executive used every power,Paragraph
"at his disposal to push the quixotic endeavor to completion, including the",Paragraph
"involvement of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the bistate",Paragraph
agency under his political control. The Port Authority had not previously,Paragraph
"been involved in such an enormous real estate speculation, which",Paragraph
comprised ten million square feet of office space that landed on the market,Paragraph
with a thud during the worst recession in decades.,Paragraph
The terrible truth is that Yamasaki’s posthumous reputation would still be,Paragraph
"languishing in obscurity were it not for the disaster of September 11, 2001,",Paragraph
which propelled him back into the public consciousness for the worst,Paragraph
possible reason. Whatever one might think about the aesthetics of his,Paragraph
"poorly received World Trade Center project, there is no question that the",Paragraph
loss of life in the terrorist attack was greatly reduced because of the,Paragraph
innovative engineering he employed for the Twin Towers. Notwithstanding,Paragraph
widespread shock that the skyscrapers collapsed with such swiftness—the,Paragraph
"South Tower, the second to be hit, fell after fifty-six minutes, while it took",Paragraph
102 minutes for the North Tower to go down—the real miracle was that,Paragraph
these severely damaged hulks remained standing for as long as they did.,Paragraph
"This allowed an estimated 14,000 to 17,000 people to escape, although",Paragraph
"many were trapped above the stories hit by the planes, where death was",Paragraph
inevitable because emergency stairways were severed.,Paragraph
An unavoidable problem of skyscraper design is that the higher a,Paragraph
"structure, the more elevators are needed, thus reducing rentable floor space.",Paragraph
"And in the case of standard steel- or concrete-frame construction, the",Paragraph
number of extra inner columns needed to strengthen super-tall towers adds,Paragraph
to the problem. In order to increase the World Trade Center’s cost-,Paragraph
effectiveness by keeping each story of the towers as free as possible from,Paragraph
"internal barriers—a necessity in commercial real estate by the 1960s, when",Paragraph
the open-office concept began to take hold—Yamasaki decided on a,Paragraph
structural system (devised by the Seattle-based engineer John Skilling),Paragraph
"whereby the buildings’ external walls, made of colossal, hollow steel tubes,",Paragraph
"became the principal load-bearing support, allowing for unusually open",Paragraph
interiors.,Paragraph
Had Yamasaki conformed to conventional internal  steel-frame,Paragraph
"techniques, experts concur, the buildings would have snapped upon the",Paragraph
planes’ collision and collapsed much sooner and farther afield than they,Paragraph
"did, with a significantly higher death toll. Indeed, as James Glanz and Eric",Paragraph
Lipton write in their authoritative City in the Sky: The Rise and Fall of the,Paragraph
"World Trade Center (2003), an aviation impact study conducted in 1964 to",Paragraph
gauge how the structures would withstand being crashed into by a Boeing,Paragraph
707 had concluded:,Paragraph
The Skilling firm’s “total concept” would not just give the twin towers,Paragraph
a huge margin of reserve strength to help them survive the initial,Paragraph
impact; the peculiarities of their design would let them act almost like,Paragraph
a living being to resist overall failure and collapse even when,Paragraph
grievously damaged by the plane.,Paragraph
"In the end, what destroyed the buildings was the conflagration fed by tens",Paragraph
"of thousands of gallons of jet fuel, as was fiendishly projected by the plot’s",Paragraph
"mastermind, Osama bin Laden, who had a degree in civil engineering.",Paragraph
Although the World Trade Center fully conformed to fire-safety,Paragraph
"standards at the time of its completion, there were misgivings during the",Paragraph
planning phase about whether the super-wide Vierendeel trusses that,Paragraph
"enabled the open-floor spaces, a new concept at the time, were sufficiently",Paragraph
fireproofed to withstand such an eventuality. It was the weakening of those,Paragraph
"elegantly elongated supports, which sagged as fire rapidly spread across the",Paragraph
"uncompartmentalized interiors, that caused the Twin Towers’ concrete",Paragraph
"floors to collapse onto one another, after which the outer perimeter gave",Paragraph

spared a loss that surely would have been infinitely more painful to him,Paragraph

"lionization of the Italian-Brazilian architect Lina Bo Bardi, who was born in",Paragraph
Rome in 1914 and died in 1992 in her adopted South American home-land,Paragraph
at the age of seventy-seven. Bo Bardi’s two most important realized,Paragraph

"Pompeia, a leisure and cultural center (1977-1986). They are of such",Paragraph
exceptional quality that one can readily understand why their designer was,Paragraph

"Intriguingly contradictory but intelligently resolved, Bo Bardi’s designs",Paragraph
"are structurally audacious yet uncommonly comfortable, unapologetically",Paragraph
"untidy yet conceptually rigorous, and confidently dynamic yet suggestively",Paragraph
"hybrid. Although her architecture stands squarely in the Modernist tradition,",Paragraph
she rejected the aggressively machinelike aesthetic favored by many of her,Paragraph
"male contemporaries, preferring a more relaxed and nuanced vernacular",Paragraph

authentic manifestations and make them invitingly human. This is high-tech,Paragraph
that responds to everyday needs and uses modern technical advances to,Paragraph

structural showmanship ahead of all other concerns.,Paragraph
Some commentators have interpreted Bo Bardi’s belated popularity as a,Paragraph

architecture. Small wonder that the architect Kazuyo Sejima of the Japanese,Paragraph

unfashionable text is typical of her contrarian but principled nature.,Paragraph
"Throughout her writings, Bo Bardi’s sardonic wit and argumentative",Paragraph
"personality repeatedly surface, imparting a worldly-wise tone that makes",Paragraph
Stones Against Diamonds anything but a dry educational treatise. In a,Paragraph
profession where personal appearance and public presentation matter a,Paragraph
"great deal, Bo Bardi (as her photographs show) might be seen as the Anna",Paragraph
"Magnani of architecture—an earthy, passionate, careworn, chain-smoking,",Paragraph
impulsively outspoken character fed up with the hypocrisy of polite society.,Paragraph
"One perceptive friend, the publisher and playwright Valentino Bompiani,",Paragraph
tellingly dubbed her la dea stanca (the tired goddess). A defiant outsider,Paragraph
sensibility emerges from the architect’s prickly but heartfelt,Paragraph
"pronouncements on the place of architecture in modern society, suffused",Paragraph
with a certain resignation quite unlike the utopian optimism of the first-,Paragraph
generation Modernists. Yet even Bo Bardi at her most cynical could not,Paragraph
have imagined the postmillennial worldwide epidemic of freakishly,Paragraph
"exhibitionistic construction, marketed as advanced artistic vision but often",Paragraph
devoid of the most basic concern for communal life and environmental,Paragraph
impact.,Paragraph
Also clear is her belief that design pedagogy ought to discourage what,Paragraph
she called “the complex of the individualistic architect”—not as a means of,Paragraph
stifling personal creativity but “to create a collective consciousness of,Paragraph
"architecture in schools, the opposite of an arrogant individualism.” This",Paragraph
"might well be taken as an instinctively feminist stance, given women’s",Paragraph
known ability to work more cooperatively in professional groups than their,Paragraph
male counterparts.,Paragraph
"On the other hand, she stubbornly refused to recant her Communist",Paragraph
"affiliations, even after the horrors of the Gulag had been revealed, and like",Paragraph
many pioneering women in her profession she believed more in personal,Paragraph
"advancement than in solidarity in sisterhood. Thus, in a 1989 lecture, she",Paragraph
could deliver the pugnacious and off-putting pronouncement that “I am,Paragraph
"Stalinist and anti-feminist.” In fact, her vision of architecture and her actual",Paragraph
work were anything but Stalinist.,Paragraph
Why Bo Bardi had been denied her rightful prominence for so long is not,Paragraph
difficult to explain. Ingrained prejudice against women in the building art,Paragraph
prevailed throughout most of the twentieth century and still has not been,Paragraph
fully eradicated. Even the best-remembered female Modernist architects,Paragraph
who came of professional age during the decade after World War I and just,Paragraph
"before Bo Bardi—Margarete Schiitte-Lihotzky, Lilly Reich, and Charlotte",Paragraph
Perriand—were customarily assigned interior-design tasks by architectural,Paragraph
offices headed and largely staffed by men.,Paragraph
This enforced male/female division of labor remained the norm until the,Paragraph
"end of World War II, when women finally became principals in",Paragraph
"architectural firms, though they were not always acknowledged as such.",Paragraph

The historian and urban planner Gustavo Giovannoni was a strong,Paragraph
advocate of ambientismo (contextualism)—designing buildings to fit in,Paragraph
with their immediate surroundings in scale and material—as well as a,Paragraph
"staunch preservationist. Her other early mentor, Marcello Piacentini, the",Paragraph
"president of the National Fascist Union of Architects, undertook huge",Paragraph
Stripped Classical commissions for the Mussolini regime that included a,Paragraph
new campus for the University of Rome and the city’s EUR district,Caption
(planned for the subsequently aborted 1942 World’s Fair). Especially strong,Paragraph
was Piacentini’s emphasis on being an architetto totale—a complete,Paragraph
"architect, equally conversant with new construction, restoration of old",Paragraph
"buildings, and city planning (a range Bo Bardi extended even further to",Paragraph
"include the design of interiors, furniture, and jewelry).",Paragraph
"She received her degree in 1939 and then moved to Milan, where the",Paragraph
progressive design scene was much more drawn to the rationalist ideas of,Paragraph
the Bauhaus and Le Corbusier than to Mussolini Modernism. Two months,Paragraph
"after her arrival, Italy entered World War II, a time “when nothing was",Paragraph
"built, only destroyed,” as she put it. Bo supported herself during the conflict",Paragraph
"with graphic design and illustration jobs, especially for Lo Stile, a design",Paragraph
magazine spun off by the architect and industrial designer Gio Ponti from,Paragraph
"his influential journal Domus. In 1946 she married Pietro Maria Bardi, a",Paragraph
"journalist and art dealer fourteen years her senior, who had cultivated strong",Paragraph
"ties to Mussolini. As Zeuler Lima points out, there is no evidence to support",Paragraph
"her claim that she had worked with the anti-Fascist resistance, and although",Paragraph
"she aligned herself with the Communist Party after 1943, her close",Paragraph
association with Ponti—whose early support for Mussolini has been,Paragraph
rationalized by apologists as more patriotic than ideological—impelled the,Paragraph
newly married couple to quit Italy when the Communists gained,Paragraph
ascendance in the first post-war elections.,Paragraph
"Pietro Bardi already had connections in Brazil, where he traveled in 1934",Paragraph
to sell art to prosperous Italian expatriates. With his dismal postwar,Paragraph
"prospects in Italy, friends in Rome’s Brazilian embassy set up a series of",Paragraph
commercial exhibitions for him in Rio de Janeiro. There he attracted the,Paragraph
attention of the culturally ambitious press magnate Assis Chateaubriand,Paragraph
"(known as Chatd), who wanted to foster a Brazilian arts scene",Paragraph
commensurate with the country’s increasing international identity as a,Paragraph
"major center of modern architecture, an emergence signaled by “Brazil",Paragraph
"Builds: Architecture New and Old, 1652-1942,” a popular exhibition held",Paragraph
at New York’s Museum of Modern Art in 1943.,Caption
"Bo Bardi, who had yet to build anything, received a chilly reception from",Paragraph
the leading figures of the country’s architectural avant-garde. Lucio Costa,Paragraph
"told her, “You’re so dull, so many drawings,” while his colleague Oscar",Paragraph
Niemeyer averred that “Europeans make things seem too complicated.” Yet,Paragraph
she contradicted both those competitive put-downs with her first completed,Paragraph
"work, the Casa de Vidro (Glass House), the sublimely simple yet",Paragraph
uncommonly elegant residence she created for herself and her husband in,Paragraph
Sdo Paulo. Not the least interesting aspect of this rectangular Minimalist,Paragraph
structure with transparent peripheral walls is its close relation to two more,Paragraph
renowned contemporaneous domestic designs: Mies van der Rohe’s,Paragraph
"Farnsworth house of 1945-1951 in Plano, Illinois, and Philip Johnson’s",Caption
"Glass House of 1949-1950 in New Canaan, Connecticut. Yet the",Paragraph
considerable differences among this trio of glass houses tell us a great deal,Paragraph
about why Bo Bardi has gained such an ardent postmillennial following.,Paragraph
The much-vaunted intention of Mies’s and Johnson’s inhabitable glass,Paragraph
vitrines was to make interiors at one with nature. Johnson referred to the,Paragraph
sylvan views from his Glass House as “the world’s most expensive,Paragraph
"wallpaper,” but as often happened with this self-critical nihilist, his",Paragraph
wisecrack contained a kernel of harsh truth. Both his and Mies’s shoebox-,Paragraph
"shaped structures present themselves as industrially made objects, but they",Paragraph
were in fact exquisitely custom-crafted villas for the rich. The Casa de,Paragraph
Vidro is much like the Mies and Johnson houses (all are more or less flat-,Paragraph
"topped, though the roof of the Brazilian version inclines slightly downward",Paragraph
"from a center ridge for rain run-off). However, Bo Bardi’s house differs",Paragraph
"from the others in being sited on a steep hillside, to say nothing of being",Paragraph
considerably more economical than its expensively detailed American,Paragraph
analogs. And the underlying concrete slab of the Sao Paulo residence is,Paragraph
"elevated on a series of tall, thin aluminum poles, with the structure fully",Paragraph
"touching the earth only at the uppermost, rear portion of the slope.",Paragraph
This was the first building to be erected in a newly developed residential,Paragraph
"neighborhood, and completion photos depict a rather barren setting",Paragraph
"reminiscent of the Hollywood Hills. Indeed, Bo Bardi’s lightweight, open-",Paragraph
"to-the-outdoors design, framed in thin members of white-painted metal,",Paragraph
brings to mind the experimental Case Study Houses of the late 1940s and,Paragraph
early 1950s in Southern California. Yet just a few years after its,Paragraph
"construction, the Casa de Vidro was engulfed in a lush tangle of greenery,",Paragraph
and it now feels like a subtropical tree house.,Paragraph
Bo Bardi’s populist outlook was antithetical to the grandiose vision,Paragraph
realized in the Brazilian heartland by Costa and Niemeyer—the former’s,Paragraph
"urban plan and the latter’s principal structures for Brasilia, the start-from-",Paragraph
scratch capital city decreed by President Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira,Paragraph
in 1956 and essentially completed within his five-year term of office.,Paragraph
Whereas Bo Bardi was immediately taken by her new country’s,Paragraph
"multicultural folkloric traditions and multiracial vernacular culture, her",Paragraph
best-known Brazilian coprofessionals were much more concerned with how,Paragraph
to recast an essentially European Baroque monumentality in High,Paragraph
Modernist terms.,Paragraph
"Furthermore, the creators of Brasilia paid scant attention to the housing",Paragraph
and transportation needs of the sizable labor force needed to serve the,Paragraph
capital city’s bureaucracy. These omissions resulted in a host of messy ad,Paragraph
hoc stopgaps by local residents to correct Costa and Niemeyer’s enormous,Paragraph
functional lapses. Bo Bardi was one of the few contemporary critics of,Paragraph
"these architectural stars, and certainly the most insightful. In 1958, just as",Paragraph
"construction of Brasilia was getting underway, she wrote “architecture or",Paragraph
"Architecture’—a short, urgent warning about the disturbing direction",Paragraph
"Niemeyer’s schemes were taking, away from his smaller early works (today",Paragraph
his most admired designs) and toward the megalomaniacal scale typified by,Paragraph
the new city’s flying saucer—like parliament building:,Paragraph
"More than the buildings of Brasilia—which, according to Niemeyer",Paragraph
"himself, are irreproachable in their conception and purity—we like the",Paragraph
"church in Pampulha and the house in Vassouras, which have attracted",Paragraph
"international attention on account of their simplicity, their human",Paragraph
"proportions, the modest and poetic expression of a life that rejects that",Paragraph
"very despondency, that struggle between social needs and architecture",Paragraph
"—the struggle that Niemeyer claims to have overcome by setting out,",Paragraph
"as the aim of his architecture, a formal position that denies all human",Paragraph
values. ...,Paragraph
"In contrast, Bo Bardi found ways to combine the large dimensions",Paragraph
appropriate to the public sphere with an intimate scale that gives the users,Paragraph
of her buildings a sense of both individual presence and group connection,Paragraph
that Niemeyer was generally unable to achieve in his works from Brasilia,Paragraph
"onward, when colossal geometric formalism became his overriding",Paragraph
"principle. An unlikely, but in her hands fully integrated balance between the",Paragraph
monumental and the personal was achieved with striking imagination in the,Paragraph
"Museum of Art of SAo Paulo (MASP), an institution founded in 1947 by",Paragraph
"Chat6, directed by Pietro Bardi, and during its first decade housed in",Paragraph
temporary display spaces designed by his wife within existing structures.,Paragraph
Among the Bardis’ beliefs was that pictures ought not to be hung on a,Paragraph
wall like bourgeois decorative elements but instead displayed on,Paragraph
freestanding easels that give a closer idea of their means of production.,Paragraph
Thanks to Chatd’s strong-arm acquisition tactics—the unscrupulous,Paragraph
"publisher, who has been called the Brazilian Citizen Kane, blackmailed",Paragraph
prominent figures with threats of newspaper exposés in returm for,Paragraph
“donations” of cash and art to his new museum—Pietro Bardi was able to,Paragraph
quickly assemble what at that time was the most important public art,Paragraph
"collection in South America with works, for example, by Manet, Cézanne,",Paragraph
and Van Gogh.,Paragraph
MASP offered a revolutionary rethinking of the art museum and was the,Paragraph
embodiment of the Bardis’ belief in architecture as a prime agent for social,Paragraph
cohesion rather than aesthetic self-indulgence or a benefactor’s status. Their,Paragraph
innovative ideas about the museum as an educational institution responsive,Paragraph
to the public and not just a repository of precious objects were reflected in,Paragraph
"Bo Bardi’s equally inventive design solutions for welcoming entry areas,",Paragraph
"flexible exhibition spaces, and a casual atmosphere that emphasized art as a",Paragraph
"pleasure for everyone, not just an informed elite. To be sure, Edward Durell",Paragraph
Stone and Philip L. Goodwin’s Museum of Modern Art of 1936-1939 in,Paragraph
New York had already made a notable departure from the formality and,Paragraph
monumentality of traditional Beaux Arts gallery design and toward a,Paragraph
relaxed domestic scale that reminded twentieth-century New Yorkers more,Paragraph
of their apartments than of princely palaces. But MASP took such,Paragraph
"democratic notions even further, though its architectonic presence is",Paragraph
anything but recessive.,Paragraph
In an unexecuted 1952 scheme for a museum at the seashore (illustrated,Paragraph
"on the cover of Habitat, the influential art-and-design magazine the Bardis",Caption
"founded), Bo Bardi devised an elongated shoebox form that would have",Paragraph
"been hoisted one story above the ground by four inverted, squared-off U-",Paragraph
shaped trusses of red-painted steel clamped across the gallery enclosure’s,Paragraph
"narrower dimension. In a further refinement of that unusual format, MASP",Paragraph
"is an even bolder feat of engineering, with just two gigantic red-painted",Paragraph
steel trusses that span and support the two-story glass-walled gallery,Caption
container longitudinally rather than laterally (see Illustration 13a). The,Paragraph
configuration provides two urbanistic benefits: it elevates the museum,Paragraph
"above the busy vehicular traffic streets that flank it to the north and south,",Paragraph
and the underside of the building creates a roof for the open-sided gathering,Paragraph
"place at ground level. This large outdoor space, protected from sudden",Paragraph
"tropical downpours, is used for public events of all sorts, and remains one",Paragraph
of Séo Paulo’s most memorable modern civic venues.,Paragraph
The open-plan exhibition areas suspended above this plaza were,Paragraph
"conceived to be optimally adaptable for various kinds of art, with",Paragraph
interchangeable partitions and freestanding display elements. Curators were,Paragraph
"thereby encouraged to rethink visitors’ progression through exhibitions,",Paragraph
which in conventional institutions with fixed walls allows little or no,Paragraph
deviation from a strictly imposed route. The wide-ranging possibilities here,Paragraph
"give an entirely different character to the art-viewing experience, and the",Paragraph
"MASP approach is now standard practice at contemporary art institutions,",Paragraph
especially because the unpredictable display requirements for today’s large,Paragraph
"installation pieces, video art, and other nontraditional mediums—so",Paragraph
different from even the most advanced painting and sculpture of the Bardis’,Paragraph
heyday—have made easily transformable interiors mandatory.,Paragraph
Although the ground-level public space of MASP functions wonderfully,Paragraph
"as a social condenser, it is surpassed in that respect by Bo Bardi’s final",Paragraph
"major work, the SESC Pompeia leisure center. Many early Modernists,",Paragraph
"most conspicuously Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, admired the no-",Paragraph
nonsense functionalist aesthetic of late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-,Paragraph
"century industrial structures. In homage, they designed schools, cultural",Paragraph
"institutions, and residences that closely resembled utilitarian construction",Paragraph
(signified by Le Corbusier’s famous definition of the house as “a machine,Paragraph
for living in”). By the 1970s this practice had become so accepted that,Paragraph
forward-thinking architects and their patrons decided to convert actual,Paragraph
"factories and warehouses into museums, theaters, and other arts facilities",Paragraph
rather than trying to replicate the industrial look from scratch.,Paragraph
"In 1971, Brazil’s Servigo Social de Comércio (SESC, the public outreach",Paragraph
"arm of the country’s trade organizations, established to quell unrest among",Paragraph
laborers) acquired an obsolete 1938 steel-barrel factory in a working-class,Paragraph
Sdo Paulo quarter for a community center (see Illustration 13b). SESC,Paragraph
"originally planned to tear down the prefabricated, reinforced-concrete",Paragraph
structure to make way for a new building. But the recent and much-,Paragraph
publicized success of San Francisco’s Ghirardelli Square of 1962—1965—an,Paragraph
abandoned chocolate factory that the architect William Wurster and the,Paragraph
landscape architect Lawrence Halprin reconceived as a retail-and-restaurant,Paragraph
complex and became a major tourist attraction—prompted the decision to,Paragraph
retain the existing Sdo Paulo structure.,Paragraph
Because it had already been temporarily retrofitted and clearly worked,Paragraph
"well as a neighborhood gathering place, Bo Bardi advised that this fine",Paragraph
example of industrial architecture (based on the pioneering structural,Paragraph
concepts of the French engineer Francois Hennebique) merely be tidied up,Paragraph
and preserved. Into that imposing shell—dominated by soaring concrete,Paragraph
volumes that bring to mind the monumental Brutalism of Louis Kahn—she,Paragraph
"inserted her comprehensive series of domestically scaled innovations, each",Paragraph
fulfilling a specific function.,Paragraph
These included everything from her colorful and tactile interior and,Paragraph
furniture designs to her programming for exhibitions and performances. In,Paragraph
"her egalitarian view of art, both high art and popular culture were presented",Paragraph
without hierarchical distinctions in the center’s flexible display galleries. A,Paragraph
wide range of educational and vocational activities are still offered in,Paragraph
"classrooms and a library, but there is also a full array of sports facilities",Paragraph
"(including a swimming pool), areas where people can play games, meet",Paragraph
"friends, and socialize in a variety of ways, as well as a theater and a",Paragraph
community lunch restaurant that at night becomes a beer garden. As Zeuler,Paragraph
Lima writes:,Paragraph
SESC Pompeia offered a concrete example of one of Bo Bardi’s main,Paragraph
"pursuits: to show that “culture is a fact of everyday reality,’ not a",Paragraph
special event or even the domain of the educated elite... . [She],Paragraph
"imagined it, as many in the center’s staff still do, as an antidote to",Paragraph
consumer society and a space for human imagination and shared,Title
participation.,Paragraph
"With the Pompeia commission, Bo Bardi cut out the middleman, as it",Paragraph
"were, by adapting an old factory while preserving its gritty character. This",Paragraph
remarkable advance in architectural thinking anticipated the widespread,Paragraph
"vogue for recycling former industrial facilities into exhibition galleries,",Paragraph
epitomized by Richard Gluckman’s transformation of a warehouse into the,Paragraph
Dia Center for the Arts in New York (1987) and Jacques Herzog and Pierre,Paragraph
de Meuron’s conversion of London’s Bankside Power Station into the Tate,Title
"Modern (1995-2000). Furthermore, Bo Bardi’s celebration of her design’s",Paragraph
workaday origins and its overwhelmingly warm reception make it a direct,Paragraph
"antecedent of New York City’s post-millennial public-works wonder, the",Paragraph
"High Line (2003-2014), which likewise turned derelict infrastructure into",Paragraph
an instantly beloved community treasure.,Paragraph
On the cover of Zeuler Lima’s splendid study is an image that perfectly,Paragraph
sums up what might be called the Bo Bardi Touch. This black-and-white,Paragraph
photographic detail shows an irregular opening cut into a concrete wall of,Paragraph
the architect’s Teatro Gregério de Matos of 1986-1987 in the Brazilian city,Paragraph
of Salvador (one of nine theaters she designed). Instead of the geometric,Paragraph
"precision associated with the Bauhaus, this amoeboid aperture—which she",Paragraph
"called a fustella (perforation punch, in Italian)—brings to mind a rougher",Paragraph
version of the free-form outlines of Alvar Aalto’s biomorphic Savoy Vase,Caption
"(1936). Executed with the nonchalant facture typical of Bo Bardi, this",Paragraph
unruly form reminds us that she much preferred to focus on how,Paragraph
architecture feels rather than the way it looks. Robert Venturi famously,Paragraph
"wrote, “I am for messy vitality over obvious unity,” and in that same spirit",Paragraph
the designs of Lina Bo Bardi exert a vivifying and unifying effect that,Paragraph
architecture can impart only when the need for a better social life is,Paragraph
genuinely important to the architect’s imagination.,Paragraph

FREI OTTO,Title
FEW ARTISTS CAN be said to have fundamentally reshaped the basic nature of,Paragraph
"their medium, as did James Joyce by supplanting the linear narrative of the",Paragraph
"conventional novel with a swirling stream of consciousness, or Wassily",Paragraph
Kandinsky by expanding painting from the depiction of realistic scenes to,Paragraph
"an abstract evocation of inward emotions, or Alexander Calder by",Paragraph
transforming sculpture from a static earthbound mass into a kinetic object,Paragraph
floating through space. Thus although twentieth-century architecture was,Paragraph
"replete with countless innovations in structure and materials, none of its",Paragraph
practitioners rethought the very basics of construction and presented an,Paragraph
alternative to millennia of received design concepts more successfully than,Paragraph
the German architect and engineer Frei Otto.,Paragraph
"During his heyday in the 1960s and 1970s, Otto had an enormous",Paragraph
influence on younger architects who followed his example and thought,Paragraph
beyond the repetitive shoebox forms that dominated postwar commercial,Paragraph
"design. Otto’s great contribution was the modern tensile tent, its exterior",Paragraph
"made from synthetic materials reinforced with metal mesh, unlike its cloth",Paragraph
antecedents. Perfected in the 1950s and brought to worldwide attention,Paragraph
"during the next two decades, Otto’s ideas have since become so pervasive",Paragraph
that the advances he pioneered are now perceived as a generic development,Paragraph
"rather than attributable to a single person, which has contributed to amnesia",Paragraph
about his central place in twentieth-century architectural history.,Paragraph
Otto’s hallmark inventions—lightweight tensile and membrane canopies,Paragraph
that can shelter large areas both economically and beautifully—were no pie-,Paragraph
in-the-sky visionary proposals like those of so many of his avant-garde,Paragraph
"contemporaries. Instead, these eminently practical schemes offered",Paragraph
"imaginative solutions to real problems, but also pointed the way to freer",Paragraph
"attitudes that would flourish, though with very mixed results, toward the",Paragraph
"end of the millennium. In his 1996 essay “Architektur Natur,” Otto",Paragraph
provocatively asserted that all architects can be assigned to one of three,Paragraph
"categories: “Arrangeur, Diebe und Erfinder” (arrangers, thieves, and",Paragraph
inventors). By arrangers he clearly meant those who merely manipulate,Paragraph
"known forms into other configurations, while of course the thieves even",Paragraph
more expeditiously steal the ideas of others. And given the countless,Paragraph
uncredited knockoffs of his designs he surely must have considered the,Paragraph
second group as the most numerous.,Paragraph
Yet to the end of his life Otto remained remarkably modest about his own,Paragraph
"achievements, and when he was informed that he was about to be given the",Paragraph
"Pritzker Architecture Prize at the age of eighty-nine, he averred that “I have",Paragraph
"never done anything to gain this prize.” Others demurred, and if he would",Paragraph
"not explicitly describe himself as an inventor, his most knowledgeable and",Paragraph
accomplished colleagues certainly would. He was known to be,Paragraph
exceptionally generous in stressing the broadly collaborative nature of the,Paragraph
architectural process in a profession where many design principals arrogate,Paragraph
a disproportionate amount of credit for themselves. The brilliant Irish,Paragraph
structural engineer Peter Rice (1935—-1992)—who worked closely with Otto,Paragraph
but is now perhaps best remembered for his louvered ceiling light-filtering,Paragraph
system at Renzo Piano’s Menil Collection of 1982-1986 in Houston—,Paragraph
placed Otto firmly among the Erfinder when in his book An Engineer,Paragraph
Imagines (1994) he likened him to the British Victorian mechanical and,Paragraph
"civil engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the innovative builder of bridges,",Paragraph
"tunnels, railways, and ships at the apogee of the Industrial Revolution:",Paragraph
"Think of the way Brunel worked and the kind of things he did, the",Paragraph
broad range of activities he covered. He must have worked similarly to,Paragraph
Frei. Frei uses intuition backed up by physics rather than mathematics.,Paragraph
He has a strong physical sense. . .. We should call him an inventor.,Paragraph
"Unlike Brunel, however, Otto’s commissions were not always prompted",Paragraph
"by social movements of the highest import, which may have something to",Paragraph
"do with why his reputation is not stronger today. For example, in 1977 he",Paragraph
"devised a system of upwardly flaring, umbrellalike stage canopies of white",Paragraph
fabric for the British rock band Pink Floyd’s In the Flesh international,Caption
concert tour. Easily dismantled and moved from one performance venue to,Paragraph
"the next, Otto’s sheltering design gave the impression of a field of Art",Paragraph
Nouveau flowers and represented a degree of visual artistic seriousness,Paragraph
"rarely equaled in the world of rock and roll, but still, it was only rock and",Paragraph
roll.,Paragraph
"By the time Otto died, in 2017, less than three months shy of his ninetieth",Paragraph
"birthday, he had become a virtually forgotten figure among the general",Paragraph
"public, and even architectural devotees could be forgiven for thinking that",Paragraph
he had expired years earlier. This was largely owed to his having executed,Paragraph
"very few projects during his last decades, and his path-breaking schemes",Paragraph
had long been eclipsed by far more dramatic structures made possible by,Paragraph
"computer-aided design, which was in its infancy during his creative prime.",Paragraph
Otto’s most conspicuous late-career effort was his collaboration with the,Paragraph
much-younger Shigeru Ban (a major exponent of variations on the,Paragraph
"German’s lightweight structures, though often made of more low-tech",Paragraph
materials) for the Japanese pavilion of 1997-1999 at Expo 2000 in,Paragraph
"Hannover, Germany. This approximately oblong, clear-span exhibition hall",Caption
was overarched by an undulating latticed roof composed of reinforced,Paragraph
cardboard tubes (a Ban signature). It swelled upward in three equal,Paragraph
segments and evoked the buoyant biomporphic spirit of Otto’s work of a,Paragraph
"half-century before, while reconfirming his strong effect on successive",Paragraph
generations of followers.,Paragraph
Frei Paul Otto was born in 1925 near Chemnitz in Saxony but grew up in,Paragraph
Berlin. His uncommon first name—which means “free” in German and was,Paragraph
his mother’s personal motto—reflected the liberal values of his idealistic,Paragraph
"parents, members of the Deutscher Werkbund (German Work Federation), a",Paragraph
"social reform group that promoted, among other causes, decent modem",Paragraph
"housing for all, educating the public in principles of good design, and closer",Paragraph
collaboration between craftsmen and industry. Otto’s father and grandfather,Paragraph
"were both sculptors engaged primarily in carving gravestones, and it was",Paragraph
expected that young Frei would follow them in the family business. A,Paragraph
teacher at his vocational school introduced the teenaged Otto to sail gliding,Paragraph
"—then a popular sport in the flat, lake-studded terrain around Berlin—",Paragraph
which shaped his fascination for lightweight structures. He also showed an,Paragraph
"unusual aptitude for making models, and it was decided that he was talented",Paragraph
enough to merit training as a master builder.,Paragraph
He commenced his architectural studies at the Technische Hochschule,Paragraph
"Berlin in 1943, but soon afterward he was conscripted into the Luftwaffe",Paragraph
"because of his expertise in amateur aviation, a fortunate assignment at a",Paragraph
time when German ground forces were being decimated on the Eastern,Paragraph
"Front. Captured by the Allies, he was incarcerated for two years in France",Paragraph
"near Chartres, during which he served as a prison-camp architect, a position",Paragraph
that forced him to address the most basic function of architecture—cover,Paragraph
from the elements—which under wartime circumstances had to be provided,Paragraph
"quickly, economically, and improvisationally, requirements that would",Paragraph
establish Otto’s principal priorities and define them thereafter. He later,Paragraph
explained that the daily sight of the spires of Chartres Cathedral inspired,Paragraph
him to devise the tented structures that offered the most immediate solution,Paragraph
to the need for shelter in the camp.,Paragraph
"After his release, he resumed his education at his old school (which had",Paragraph
been renamed the Technische Universitat Berlin) and confronted the central,Paragraph
challenge of his emergent generation of German architects: how to create,Title
"large-scale buildings that avoided any taint of Nazi design, which was",Paragraph
"typified by a ponderous, ornamentally stripped Classicism rendered in",Paragraph
"heavy materials, particularly stone. Otto’s familiarity with aeronautical",Paragraph
engineering led him to devise a diametric alternative to that forbidden,Paragraph
monumentality. He began to experiment with ultralightweight forms that,Paragraph
"derived from thin-membrane airplane parts made from reinforced fabric, the",Paragraph
antithesis of the crushing mass favored by Hitler and his chief architectural,Paragraph
"henchman, Albert Speer.",Caption
In 1950 Otto won a travel stipend that allowed him to visit the United,Paragraph
"States for six months, where with remarkable self-confidence for a twenty-",Paragraph
five-year-old he gained introductions to several of the loftiest pioneers of,Paragraph
"modern architecture, then in the final phases of their careers, including",Paragraph
"Frank Lloyd Wright, Erich Mendelsohn, Richard Neutra, and Ludwig Mies",Title
"van der Rohe. In due course he became particularly close to Mies, to the",Paragraph
extent that when the aged master was building his Neue Nationalgalerie of,Paragraph
"1965-1968 in Berlin, he turned to Otto for advice on the museum’s",Paragraph
"unusually large free-span roof, whereupon the younger architecture",Paragraph
suggested an elegant correction to calculations that allowed for fewer and,Paragraph
less-conspicuous interior supports. This successful recommendation,Paragraph
"reflected Otto’s equal authority as both an engineer and an architect, a rare",Paragraph
combination in that many master builders must collaborate with structural,Paragraph
"consultants to determine if what they have designed will actually stand up,",Paragraph
"as did Louis Kahn with his indispensable engineering adviser, August",Paragraph
Komendant.,Paragraph
One of Otto’s earliest public successes was the gossamer-light dance,Paragraph
"pavilion he designed in 1957 for the Federal Garden Exhibition in Cologne,",Paragraph
"a five-peaked, mast-supported, white-fabric canopy in the highly stylized",Caption
"shape of an exotic bloom, which nicely evoked the botanical theme of the",Paragraph
event. This scheme was in effect a sketch for his much larger essays in this,Paragraph
"same mode over the years to come, for although not all architectural ideas",Paragraph
"first essayed in small dimensions can be successfully enlarged, Otto’s could,",Paragraph
"almost without exception. Furthermore, in contrast to many of his",Paragraph
"contemporaries, he rejected the Neoprimitive Brutalist aesthetic favored by",Paragraph
"Le Corbusier after World War II, as well as the widespread New Brutalism",Paragraph
that followed it. Otto’s organic approach was much more like that of Antoni,Paragraph
"Gaudi, whose extensive research into naturally occurring structures was",Paragraph
likewise the basis for startlingly new architectural forms that appear,Paragraph
deceptively delicate yet possess the power of industrial elements. Otto took,Paragraph
his cues from phenomena such as the way soap film spans a gap with,Paragraph
maximum efficiency or the extraordinary tensile strength displayed by,Paragraph
fragile-looking but in fact quite resilient spiderwebs.,Paragraph
In order to advance his theories and apply them to a wider variety of,Paragraph
"uses, in 1964 Otto founded his think tank-cum-studio, the Institut ftir leichte",Paragraph
"Flachentragwerke (Institute for Lightweight Structures), at the University of",Paragraph
"Stuttgart. It, and his professional office, Atelier Frei Otto, located in the",Paragraph
small town of Warmbronn west of Stuttgart—became the central vehicles,Paragraph
for developing his ideas and the training grounds for several generations of,Paragraph
followers who disseminated his concepts internationally. Among the latter,Paragraph
"is Otto’s frequent collaborator Mahmoud Bodo Rasch, who developed a",Paragraph
"thriving practice in the Middle East, where his tented coverings and large",Paragraph
retractable umbrellas have been widely used for shading outdoor public,Paragraph
"spaces, especially at religious pilgrimage sites.",Paragraph
Otto felt a special kinship with his three-decade-older American,Paragraph
"counterpart R. Buckminster Fuller, a fellow enthusiast of lightweight",Paragraph
"structures and the father of the geodesic dome, his greatest structural",Paragraph
innovation. The self-aggrandizing fabulist Fuller and the self-effacing,Paragraph
"moralist Otto could not have been more different personally, but their",Paragraph
ingenious designs shared similar limitations. Though both were widely,Paragraph
"promoted as panaceas for a host of architectural tasks, Fuller’s domes and",Paragraph
Otto’s tents were essentially roofing systems. Despite those structures’,Paragraph
"ability to economically shelter an interior, it was much trickier to subdivide",Paragraph
"their internal volumes for specific functional purposes, a drawback that",Paragraph
inhibited their wider acceptance.,Paragraph
The curvature of a geodesic structure renders space around its inner,Paragraph
"periphery almost useless for at least several feet as it meets the ground,",Paragraph
while the center of a dome of substantial size is often higher than required,Paragraph
"except for purely structural reasons. Similarly, a large tensile tent must be",Paragraph
"suspended from vertical supports that can disrupt an internal expanse, and",Paragraph
the problem of how the roof turns into a wall was often inadequately,Paragraph
resolved.,Paragraph
"During the 1960s, after a decade of designing increasingly large, more",Paragraph
complex tents for trade shows and outdoor stages in several German and,Paragraph
"Swiss cities, Otto received two high-profile, career-defining commissions.",Paragraph
Perhaps aware that no German architect of the postwar period had yet,Paragraph
achieved the international renown achieved by such celebrated figures as,Paragraph
"Mies, Mendelsohn, and Walter Gropius, the West German government",Title
"asked him to design both its display at Expo 67, the Montreal world’s fair",Paragraph
"(see Illustration 14a), and a vast multistructure complex for the 1972",Paragraph
"Olympics in Munich. Together, Otto’s eye-catching experiments made his",Paragraph
"international reputation, as well as that of his engineering associate Jérg",Paragraph
Schlaich. What appears even more impressive in hindsight is that until the,Paragraph
"early 1970s, Otto created his structures without the benefit of today’s",Paragraph
"sophisticated software, and instead worked out the complicated dynamics of",Paragraph
"each effort with costly, labor-intensive study models.",Paragraph
"His German Pavilion at the Montreal exposition caused a sensation, not",Paragraph
"least because its swooping profile had a decidedly Romantic air to it, quite",Paragraph
"different from the undisputed architectural hit of the fair, Habitat 67, by the",Paragraph
"Israeli-born Canadian Moshe Safdie. This 146-unit housing complex, which",Paragraph
"resembles a pileup of Lego blocks, was rightly praised for its refreshing",Paragraph
combination of sculptural power (the result of the architect’s skillful,Paragraph
"composition of 348 identical prefabricated concrete modules), his",Paragraph
"commitment to humane scale, and his welcome departure from the",Paragraph
predominance of the monolithic high-rise postwar apartment block as,Paragraph
defined by Le Corbusier’s Unité d’ Habitation. In contrast to this pragmatic,Paragraph
"paradigm of multiunit housing, Otto’s ethereal, high-masted, peak-roofed",Paragraph
German Pavilion was the stuff of fairy-tale visions. One can thus,Paragraph
"understand his disclaimer, delivered when he was honored with an",Paragraph
"exhibition in Munich on the occasion of his eightieth birthday, that “Ich",Paragraph
habe wenig gebaut. Ich habe viele Luftschlésser ersonnen.” (I have built,Paragraph
little. | have dreamed up many castles in the air.),Paragraph
That same feeling permeated his Olympic scheme five years later. I was,Paragraph
in Munich during the 1972 games and still recall the thrilling effect of,Paragraph
dappled sunlight that filtered through the translucent fabric overhead as one,Paragraph
walked through the curving sequence of exhibition and refreshment tents,Paragraph
"that snaked around the Olympic Stadium. (For this commission, Schlaich",Paragraph
"invented a new set of computer analysis tools to execute Otto’s design, a",Paragraph
historic first in the profession.) Otto’s next major commission—which,Paragraph
along with Montreal and Munich comprise his three most significant,Paragraph
"projects—was the Manheim Multihalle of 1970-1975, an exhibition center",Paragraph
most notable for its sinuous wood-lath latticed roof. The American,Paragraph
"structural engineer Guy Nordenson, peerless in his ability to clearly explain",Paragraph
"the work of his coprofessionals to a lay audience, described Otto’s great trio",Paragraph
in almost poetic terms in this excerpt from his obituary of the German,Paragraph
master for Artforum:,Title
Despite their rational origin in the minimal surfaces of mathematics,Paragraph
"(famously explored through soap-film models) the Montreal, Munich,",Paragraph
and Mannheim roofs are exquisite forms that hover somewhere,Paragraph
"between landscape and cloud, their airy, immaterial structures belying",Paragraph
their size. ...,Paragraph
"The composition of these structures—the tilt of the masts, the varied",Paragraph
sizes and extent of the webs of cable or wood lath—have the inevitable,Paragraph
quality of the most carefully contrived landscapes. While the,Paragraph
authorship of each of the three projects is spread between [sic] the,Paragraph
"many collaborators, the language is clearly one invented by Otto.",Paragraph
Where we should correctly place Otto in the history of modern,Paragraph
architecture remains an open question. The work of Frank Gehry has shown,Paragraph
how digital programming tools that were unavailable to Otto—who was,Paragraph
nonetheless the very first to use computer-generated data to plan his,Paragraph
"Munich stadium scheme, three decades before Gehry’s epochal",Paragraph
Guggenheim Museum Bilbao—could advance an audacious recasting of,Paragraph
architecture from rectilinear convention to free-form exuberance. Many,Paragraph
"earlier precursors to these developments have been suggested, from the",Paragraph
German Expressionist Hermann Finsterlin to the Danish modernist Jorn,Title
"Utzon, for whose Sydney Opera House of 1957-1973 Otto served as a",Paragraph
structural consultant after the building’s completion had ground to a halt,Paragraph
until the means to execute this unconventional design were finally worked,Paragraph
out.,Paragraph
Yet Otto—whose extremely early use of aeronautic prototypes was,Paragraph
paralleled decades later by Gehry’s brilliant adaptation of CATIA software,Paragraph
(devised for the design of irregularly shaped airplane components) to,Paragraph
architectural applications—now seems the most convincing forerunner of,Paragraph
today’s boundless biomorphism. However directly these connections are,Paragraph
"reckoned, there can be no doubt that Otto helped lift his homeland out of",Paragraph
the darkest period in its political and cultural history through his,Paragraph
"marvelously wrought designs, which conveyed not only stunning technical",Paragraph
"finesse but, more importantly, a spiritual lightness of being.",Paragraph
"On March 9, 2015—two months after being informed confidentially that",Paragraph
he’d been named the fortieth recipient of the Pritzker Architecture Prize—,Paragraph
"Otto died, and just under the wire, as the award’s rather nebulous and",Paragraph
occasionally malleable bylaws stipulate that it cannot be given,Paragraph
posthumously. By again reaching into what might be termed the back,Paragraph
"catalog of twentieth-century architecture, the jury’s decision to honor Otto",Paragraph
recalled the joint bestowal of the 1988 prize on Oscar Niemeyer and,Paragraph
"Gordon Bunshaft, who were then eighty and seventy-nine respectively.",Paragraph
"Though long past their creative prime, they personified a meridian moment",Paragraph
"of High Modernism, and the same might be inferred about the selection of",Paragraph
Otto at a time of irresolute architectural values.,Paragraph
"In his late-life mediation “Architektur Natur,” Otto had harked back to",Paragraph
one of the most familiar (if also most frequently misunderstood) dictums of,Paragraph
"Modernism, “weniger ist mehr” (less is more), which is now most closely",Paragraph
associated with Mies (who apparently first invoked it only as late as 1947),Paragraph
but was used in various similar forms by several artists and writers during,Paragraph
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Yet Otto obviously was intrigued,Paragraph
by this formulation in quite another way from the stylistic reductivism it,Paragraph
represented to the Minimalist Mies:,Paragraph
"“Less is more,” this phrase fascinates me: fewer houses, less material,",Paragraph
"less concrete, less energy but for use with that which is available for",Paragraph
humanistic uses. .. . To build in concert with nature and to make much,Paragraph
out of little. Better to build nothing at all than to build too much!,Paragraph
Those were old and new goals.,Paragraph
If Otto were some medieval master intent on putting his indelible mark,Paragraph
on Baukunst—the building art—one can fully imagine him making a,Paragraph
personal motto from four German words in that declaration of principles:,Paragraph
“Aus wenig viel machen” (To make much out of little). This is a rare,Paragraph
"sentiment to be embraced by an architect, since most of them are driven to",Paragraph
"make even more out of much, and thus Otto’s selfless embrace of the exact",Paragraph
opposite remains all the more extraordinary and moving.,Paragraph

"least because of his firm’s software, which has given countless others the",Paragraph

The Gehry office’s breakthrough application to architecture of the,Paragraph
aeronautical computer-design program CATIA enabled the construction of,Paragraph

"The rapturous reception of that building led to the so-called Bilbao Effect, a",Paragraph
salubrious influence on the city’s economy that in tum has spurred,Paragraph
countless other municipalities to fund grandiose architectural schemes to,Paragraph

eccentric buildings economically feasible for clients who once would have,Paragraph
rejected deviations from the cost-efficient regularity of Mies’s rectilinear,Paragraph

"become an intrinsic part of present-day practice, which makes it easy to",Paragraph
"take his revolutionary advances for granted, in the same way that Mies’s",Paragraph

Recognition of Gehry’s singular place in contemporary architecture was,Paragraph
particularly evident in Paris during the fall of 2014 with the opening of his,Paragraph
Fondation Louis Vuitton of 2005-2014 (see Illustration 15b) and a,Paragraph
simultaneous Centre Pompidou retrospective of his six-decade career. This,Paragraph
"large show, which comprised 255 drawings and 67 models covering 60",Paragraph

the most important American architect since Louis Kahn. It was at least a,Paragraph
thrice-told tale (if one counts the Walker Art Center’s reputation-making,Paragraph
"1986 Gehry survey organized by Mildred Friedman, who also curated the",Paragraph
"Guggenheim Museum overview in 2001) but one well worth reiterating,",Paragraph
considering his immense impact on the redirection of modern architecture.,Paragraph
Gehry spent the first twenty years of his career as a very creditable,Paragraph
commercial architect for figures as divergent as Victor Gruen (the Los,Paragraph
Angeles—based Viennese émigré often called the father of the American,Paragraph
shopping mall) and the more socially conscious James Rouse (who,Paragraph
promoted racially integrated communities such as the Rouse Company’s,Paragraph

"buildings). As his artistic ambitions came to the fore, Gehry set up his own",Paragraph

"an essential and quite touching humility, a quality present even in such",Paragraph
"radical proposals as his unexecuted Familian house of 1977-1978, a",Paragraph
multiangular design for a Santa Monica site that evokes a veritable,Paragraph
"avalanche of lumber. But even though that client got cold feet, the project",Paragraph

technological novelty with conceptual audacity and drew tout le monde to,Paragraph
come out and gawk at the latest sensation in the city that for centuries has,Paragraph

The Pompidou’s exhibition subliminally suggested that if there has been,Paragraph
a climactic year for Gehry it may well have come with the completion of,Paragraph
"the Walt Disney Concert Hall of 1989-2003 in Los Angeles, which proved",Paragraph
that he could maintain his extraordinary level of success after Bilbao.,Paragraph
"Between Disney and Vuitton he executed some twenty-three commissions,",Paragraph

Disney efforts are likely to be counted among the highlights of Gehry’s,Paragraph
oeuvre.,Paragraph

was Gehry’s most generous client. The architect has termed his unbuilt,Paragraph

because the $5 million in fees it earned him (on a budget that ballooned to,Paragraph
an incomprehensible $82 million) subsidized a crucial phase in his creative,Paragraph
growth. The seventy-six-story Lower Manhattan apartment tower,Caption
unfortunately named New York by Gehry at Eight Spruce Street (2003-,Caption
2011) fulfilled the architect’s long-cherished dream of erecting a skyscraper,Paragraph
(see Illustration 15a). But rather than an extruded version of his cohesively,Paragraph
"biomorphic compositions, this stainless-steel-clad high-rise is voluptuously",Paragraph
modeled with wavelike surfaces on only three of its four sides. The flat,Paragraph

sequence of Walt Disney’s Fantasia (a resemblance once cited by the,Paragraph

which seems even more apt here).,Paragraph
Gehry claimed in one of his annoyingly kvetchy interviews that his,Paragraph

that watershed commission he carried out a boisterous 2004—2008,Paragraph

restrained is his 2014 master plan for reconfiguring and expanding the,Paragraph

game.,Paragraph

overoptimistic client spent too much on it. (The building was finally taken,Paragraph

By adopting such a costly and effortful dual structural system—there,Paragraph
"seem to be two buildings in one here, just as Santiago Calatrava’s overly",Paragraph
complicated bridges are said to duplicate their task—Gehry was able to,Paragraph
combine a sensuously sculptural carapace of glass with workable display,Paragraph
spaces within (a format he earlier employed for a very different function at,Paragraph
his Hotel Marqués de Riscal of 1999-2006 in Spain). He was stung by,Paragraph
criticism that his most famous structure is inimical to art—“Every museum,Paragraph

THE SINGULAR POSITION held by Renzo Piano—among the most respected,Paragraph

"first century, when he seemed to have a veritable monopoly on the most",Paragraph
prestigious cultural commissions—owed much to a pervasive (if seldom,Paragraph
articulated) fear among benefactors of cultural institutions that the building,Paragraph
art in some essential sense had moved beyond their comprehension. The,Paragraph
unexpected emergence of Frank Gehry as his generation’s most celebrated,Paragraph

"Bilbao, created a slipstream of rapid acceptance for such younger",Paragraph
"practitioners as Zaha Hadid, Daniel Libeskind, and Santiago Calatrava, all",Paragraph

"yet another Texas commission, one of the utmost sensitivity: an addition to",Paragraph
"Louis Kahn’s revered Kimbell Art Museum of 1966-1972 in Fort Worth, by",Caption
general consensus the greatest gallery building of the modern era.,Paragraph
The announcement that Piano had been chosen for this delicate task was,Paragraph
"greeted with widespread relief among architectural aficionados, for clearly",Paragraph
the job was in safe hands. It also prevented some from raising the indelicate,Paragraph
question of why this project was being undertaken in the first place. For if,Paragraph
the Kimbell’s undeniable magic derives from its being about as perfect as,Paragraph
"any art museum could possibly be, why mess with success? Yet even this",Paragraph
most gemlike and personal of institutions—an oasis of intimacy in a period,Paragraph
when both the physical size and attendance figures of museums are,Paragraph
aggressively aggrandized to the detriment of viewing art—could not escape,Paragraph
the plutocratic peer-group pressure that demands that museums expand in,Paragraph
every respect.,Paragraph
"Happily, the addition to the Kimbell—chivalrously named the Renzo",Paragraph
Piano Pavilion to honor its designer and emphasize it as a separate,Paragraph
architectural entity instead of an appendage of Kahn’s original structure—,Paragraph
turned out to be far from the desecration some feared (see Illustration 16a).,Paragraph
About the worst one could say about it is that the $135 million building is,Paragraph
"not very distinguished, especially in light of the Nasher only thirty-two",Paragraph
miles away in Dallas. When I revisited the Nasher at the time of the Piano,Paragraph
"addition’s opening, the older building struck me as its designer’s equivalent",Paragraph

that seems increasingly remarkable each time one returns. It defies precise,Paragraph
"definition of exactly why it is so wonderful, that elusive quality of all truly",Paragraph

"To be sure, matters would be much improved had the freestanding Renzo",Paragraph

specifically a vacant lot just across Van Cliburn Way to the east of the Kahn,Paragraph
"galleries, used as an auxiliary parking lot for Tadao Ando’s Modem Art",Paragraph
Museum of Fort Worth (1997-2002). Piano devised a promising initial plan,Paragraph
"for that unobtrusive location, but the Modern Art Museum wanted to keep",Paragraph

a different scheme was prepared for the site to the west of the Kahn,Paragraph

"hoped to avoid conflict with Anne Windfohr Marion, a Modern Art",Paragraph
"Museum trustee and local social powerhouse, and thus did not press her",Paragraph

sometimes hinges.,Paragraph
The new pavilion’s design reiterates the format Piano has used in several,Paragraph
other museum buildings: a low-rise rectangle with a flat overhanging roof,Paragraph
"supported by a modern version of the Classical colonnade, a single",Paragraph
continuous row of columns set out from the structure’s outer walls and,Paragraph
"supporting the extended roof above the configuration, first seen at the Menil",Caption
"Collection. However, here there is an odd disjunction between the",Paragraph
somewhat vacant three-hundred-foot-long entry fagade—from which you,Paragraph
see the Kahn building across a broad grassy lawn—and the busy one-,Paragraph
"hundred-foot-long side elevations, which overlook streets to the north and",Paragraph
south.,Paragraph
The Piano addition is connected to the Kahn building by an underground,Paragraph
parking garage and by a walkway across the lawn between them. Most,Paragraph
visitors will leave their cars in the garage and ascend by stairs or elevator to,Paragraph
the new structure; there is no direct access for the public to the Kahn,Paragraph
"building from the garage, though those using the original aboveground",Paragraph
parking lot will enter the old galleries through the east door as before. A,Paragraph
subterranean tunnel between the two can be used upon request by people in,Paragraph
wheelchairs.,Paragraph
The pavilion’s tripartite front is bland beyond the worst norms of,Paragraph
"Minimalism, with a pair of blank concrete walls that frame a central",Paragraph
"segment of ground-to-roof glass panels and portals, the detailing of which is",Paragraph
routine at best. As one stands in the west-facing courtyard of the Kahn,Paragraph
building—with its famous grove of yaupon hollies designed by Harriet,Paragraph
"Pattison, the architect’s landscape architect and mother of his son, Nathaniel",Paragraph
"Kahn—the Piano addition nearly fades away. Alas, the same cannot be said",Paragraph
"of its overwrought north and south ends, which seem ill-proportioned",Paragraph
"thanks to the massive, hundred-foot-long, gray-stained, laminated Douglas",Paragraph

composition a top-heavy quality reminiscent of 1970s Brutalism.,Paragraph
"Supporting those narrower elevations, a row of eleven squared-off concrete",Paragraph
columns (echoing the corner supports of the Kahn gallery’s porticoes) are,Paragraph
spaced a mere ten feet apart and thus make the building appear to be,Paragraph
sinking under its own weight.,Paragraph
The Renzo Piano Pavilion is actually two separate structures conjoined:,Paragraph
"an entry-and-gallery pavilion, behind which, half-buried beneath a green-",Paragraph
"roof earth berm, is a subterranean component that contains a double-height,",Paragraph
"298-seat auditorium; a handsome library; various education facilities,",Paragraph
including classrooms and children’s art studios; and a cave-like gallery,Paragraph
dedicated to works of Asian art. The main virtue of this crepuscular space is,Paragraph
that it allows fragile works with stringent light-control requirements—such,Paragraph
"as scrolls, screens, and textiles—to be displayed together. Despite",Paragraph
"deferential gestures to the Kahn building, the addition blocks the once",Paragraph
westward-sweeping vista toward another comerstone of Fort Worth’s,Paragraph

"Kahn’s Kimbell, the Amon Carter when seen from a distance did possess a",Paragraph
certain campy charm akin to a folly at the terminus of a Baroque garden,Paragraph
"axis. However, that view is now obscured behind an ungainly concrete",Paragraph
retaining wall that props up the submerged portions of the Renzo Piano,Paragraph

"In an initial miscalculation, the Kimbell decided to temporarily display",Paragraph
its permanent collection in the Piano Pavilion while it housed a 2013,Paragraph

became available when the problem-plagued third floor of his Modern,Paragraph
Wing of 2001-2009 at the Art Institute was closed for seven months of,Paragraph
repair work only four years after the addition’s completion. The switch,Paragraph
"invited some unfortunate comparisons. Kahn’s interiors, with their",Paragraph
celebrated skylit concrete ceiling vaults and use of creamy travertine on the,Caption
"walls, virtually caress pictures shown within them, in an almost uncanny",Paragraph
melding of sensitively proportioned volume and mysteriously modulated,Paragraph
"light. Not surprisingly, the Art Institute’s finest modern pictures looked",Paragraph
better in the original Kimbell than they ever have at home.,Paragraph
Although the Kimbell’s Old Master paintings could be adequately viewed,Paragraph
"when temporarily installed in Piano’s new galleries, they unquestionably",Paragraph
"seemed less magical there than they customarily do in Kahn’s spaces, where",Paragraph
they fairly glow. The works that fare best in the Piano Pavilion’s three,Paragraph
major display areas are the non-European sculptures mounted in the,Paragraph
"pellucidly lit north gallery (illuminated, as is the south gallery, by a",Paragraph
combination of natural and artificial overhead lighting). Among them are,Paragraph
the museum’s choice pre-Columbian artifacts and superb African tribal,Paragraph
"objects, the latter exemplified by an Ife terra-cotta head, circa 1100-1300",Paragraph
"CE, one of the finest treasures from that continent in this hemisphere. The",Paragraph

"by the Dottor Group, an Italian architectural restoration firm—which were",Paragraph
poured in unusually large and smoothly finished wooden formworks to,Paragraph
minimize the seams and circular indentations that can be so distracting,Paragraph
when viewing art against conventionally made concrete surfaces. The,Paragraph
material exudes a low-key silvery sheen thanks to a 2 percent addition of,Paragraph

The Fort Worth pavilion is but one of the architect’s twenty-five museum,Paragraph
"buildings, and he cannot be expected to produce a hit every time. One can",Paragraph
easily imagine an outcome at the Kimbell better in several respects—a,Paragraph
"structure lighter, more ethereal, and livelier than this dull affair. Yet we",Paragraph
should also be grateful that the designer and his client were so cautious. The,Paragraph
most important requirement they faced vis-a-vis Kahn’s masterpiece could,Paragraph
"be summed up in the opening words of the Hippocratic oath—‘“First, do no",Paragraph
harm”—and in that respect they undoubtedly succeeded. The extreme,Paragraph
preoccupation over the success or failure of the Renzo Piano Pavilion is,Paragraph
indicative of the dominance that architecture has disproportionately,Paragraph
assumed in the evaluation of art institutions since Gehry’s Guggenheim,Paragraph
Bilbao. This is not to say that the buildings in which works of art are,Paragraph
"housed should be beside the point, but great architecture alone does not",Paragraph

through a glass wall at the rear of the site. Stairs lead down to a,Paragraph

Choosing Piano for this project was somewhat of a family affair. The,Paragraph
"building was commissioned by Pathé’s CEO, the billionaire Jéréme",Paragraph
"Seydoux, whose relatives have had a notable association with the architect",Paragraph
dating back to his early career. Seydoux’s mother was a member of the,Paragraph
"hugely rich Schlumberger clan, whose oil equipment firm is headquartered",Paragraph

"Dominique de Menil, née Schlumberger, the legendary Franco-American",Paragraph
"art collector and aesthete who with her husband, John, commissioned the",Paragraph
Menil Collection.,Paragraph
In certain respects the Fondation Jér6me Seydoux-Pathé brings to mind,Paragraph
"the DZ Bank Building of 1995-2001 in Berlin by Gehry, who similarly",Paragraph

also a great disparity in size between the two structures: Gehry’s rises fifty-,Paragraph
six feet higher and is a hundred thousand square feet larger. But the real,Paragraph
dichotomy is not just architectural but spiritual. The splendid Fondation,Paragraph

"frenzy that surrounded the opening of the Vuitton gallery, is all the more a",Paragraph
"pity since it far surpasses other, much higher-profile museum projects by",Paragraph

corporate-looking additions to the Morgan Library and Museum and,Paragraph
Boston’s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of 2005-2012 have,Paragraph
disappointed many admirers of those venerable institutions.,Paragraph
The fall of 2014 also saw the opening of the Piano firm’s renovation and,Paragraph
expansion of the Harvard Art Museums—a project that consolidated the,Paragraph
"university’s Fogg Art Museum, Busch-Reisinger Museum, and Arthur M.",Paragraph
Sackler Museum. This scheme drew sharp criticism for the way it connects,Paragraph
the new ensemble to Le Corbusier’s adjacent Carpenter Center for the,Paragraph
Visual Arts of 1959-1962. The Princeton architectural historian Beatriz,Caption
Colomina went so far as to denounce it as “a crime against humanity” for,Paragraph
the damage she claims it does to the “mythical” Le Corbusier building. Yet,Paragraph
"the following May, RPBW’s Whitney Museum of American Art of 2009-",Paragraph

most critics and was an instant hit with the public after the museum moved,Paragraph

he organized a special issue of The New York Times Magazine that,Paragraph
"presented his notions of how the site ought to be reconfigured, which was",Paragraph
published the Sunday before the first anniversary of September 11.,Paragraph
Muschamp had been dismayed that several months earlier the LMDC and,Paragraph
the Port Authority had selected the architectural and planning office Beyer,Paragraph
Blinder Belle (BBB) to develop a master plan. Although that partnership,Paragraph
had won universal praise for its exemplary restoration of Grand Central,Paragraph
"Station that began in 1990, the Times critic deemed BBB insufficiently",Paragraph
adventurous for this assignment. Accordingly he invited many of his,Paragraph
"favorite practitioners, older figures of the New York avant-garde as well as",Paragraph
"younger trendsetters, to submit their own ideas and assigned parts of the",Paragraph
project to them. The fact that these hypothetical schemes lacked even the,Paragraph
most basic information that architects need to draw up design proposals—a,Paragraph
"budget and a functional program beyond vague designations (school, arts",Title
"center, and the like}—seemed not to bother either Muschamp or his",Paragraph
nominees. As Sagalyn writes in one of her rare overt expressions of,Paragraph
disapproval:,Title
This was not city building. Architecture may be art and city building,Paragraph
"calls for artlike understanding of the fabric of a place, but a city is not",Paragraph
a blank canvas to paint at will as Muschamp was advocating with his,Paragraph
"study project, most unrealistically. . . .",Paragraph

opinion of what was likely to result before BBB had even drawn a,Paragraph

Yet this self-appointed planner was scarcely oblivious to urban design,Paragraph

"newspaper, was nothing compared to the nonstop machinations of the",Paragraph
"pivotal figure in this tawdry drama, Silverstein, who before September 11",Paragraph
had been considered a fairly minor player and something of a bottom-fisher,Paragraph
among the big-deal machers of the New York real estate establishment.,Paragraph
Although Sagalyn’s portrait of Silverstein accords with the general outlines,Paragraph
"of previously published reports, here he emerges even more unfavorably as",Paragraph
"his actions are recounted in greater detail than ever before, thanks to the",Paragraph
author’s extensive interviews and her informants’ willingness to speak,Paragraph
candidly about him (an indication of how much rancor he aroused). At the,Paragraph

"demographic needs of this part of the city, Doctoroff said, “were swept",Paragraph
under the rug in the wake of 9/11 by this kind of nostalgia for the World,Paragraph

The Bloomberg administration favored a varied mix of components with,Paragraph
"less emphasis on offices and more housing units, in line with the growing",Paragraph
"residential character of the Financial District, where many old commercial",Paragraph
buildings that are no longer suitable for today’s high-tech businesses had,Paragraph

"Trade Center. The complex was built during a recessionary period, and it",Paragraph
took until the 1980s for it to finally turn a profit; it did so only because of,Paragraph
the artificial life support of state government agencies that had been,Paragraph

"a brother of that quixotic scheme’s mastermind, David Rockefeller, who",Paragraph
held top positions at the Chase Manhattan Bank from 1957 to 1981.,Paragraph
Bloomberg and his advisers repeatedly tried to gain control of the,Paragraph

"Silverstein’s lease, and be done with him. Although the Times praised this",Paragraph
as “the most creative idea to arise from the Lower Manhattan,Paragraph

the tangled economics of how evaluations for the respective assets would be,Paragraph
calculated but also because it was stymied by officials who foresaw,Paragraph
themselves losing power if the deal went through.,Paragraph

the end it was a political decision—for Governor Pataki.” At that time,Paragraph
Pataki harbored presidential ambitions and felt that his continuing,Paragraph
involvement in rebuilding Ground Zero would elevate his national,Paragraph
"reputation. As a result of these and other complications, the swap died in",Paragraph
June 2003.,Paragraph
Whatever one might think of Bloomberg’s often high-handed approach to,Paragraph

"would be buried near where they fell. However, modern science has",Paragraph
"encouraged a broad belief that the retrieval of physical matter, no matter",Paragraph

of contemporary grieving.,Paragraph
"Fifteen years after the catastrophe, remains of 1,113 of the disaster’s",Paragraph
victims—or some 40 percent of the death toll—were still unidentified. At,Paragraph
"several points during the slow, painstaking, dignified, and respectful",Paragraph
"recovery process, officials announced that the search had been concluded,",Paragraph
but family members who had not yet been given definitive physical proof,Paragraph
"demanded further forensic analysis. As it turned out, though, spot checks",Paragraph
confirmed that minute amounts of residue from the victims were still,Paragraph
"discernible in the surrounding area, a finding that prompted an even more",Paragraph

clings to a passé Postmodernism—his Manhattan jobs are drenched in a,Paragraph

Modernism.,Paragraph

focused hotspots of up to 243 degrees Fahrenheit on its immediate,Paragraph
surroundings. A similar problem also occurred at the architect’s Vdara,Paragraph

uninterrupted ascent was made possible by city regulations that waive,Paragraph
upper-story “wedding cake” setback requirements—instituted in 1916 to,Paragraph
"prevent overbuilt Lower Manhattan streets from turning into lightless,",Paragraph
airless canyons—but only if a building occupies no more than one quarter,Paragraph
of its lot. Yet when prices for Manhattan residences in prime locations,Paragraph
"started going through the roof, it hardly seemed wasteful to leave 75 percent",Paragraph
of a plot empty on a $1.25 billion speculation like 432 Park.,Paragraph
Among these proportionally attenuated but financially overloaded,Paragraph
"towers, design elements not directly tied to profit were often downgraded or",Paragraph
"eliminated as overall costs climbed. For example, Portzamparc poetically",Paragraph
predicted that the rippling glass exterior he initially planned for One57,Paragraph
"would evoke a cascading waterfall. As executed, however, the flat surface",Paragraph

blur even from a short distance. With these mathematically generated super-,Paragraph
"spires, it’s best to paraphrase Mae West: “Architecture has nothing to do",Paragraph
with it.”,Paragraph
"Architectural prestige, however, had a great deal to do with why",Paragraph
"Portzamparc was chosen for this assignment in the first place, specifically",Paragraph
"his being awarded the the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1994, just before",Paragraph
"his fiftieth birthday, reportedly thanks to the strenuous electioneering of",Paragraph
"Ada Louise Huxtable, the longtime New York Times architecture critic and",Paragraph
Pritzker juror. Portzamparc’s selection was surprising given his relative lack,Paragraph
"of built works, and was based largely on the City of Music of 1984-1995 in",Paragraph
"Paris, a lesser component of President Francois Mitterrand’s Grands Projets,",Paragraph
the series of eight major public works that more famously include I. M.,Paragraph
Pei’s Louvre Pyramid and Gae Aulenti’s Musée d’Orsay.,Paragraph
"Portzamparc was born in Casablanca in 1944, the son of a peripatetic",Paragraph
French army officer. He began studying architecture at the Ecole des,Paragraph
"Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1962, amid what his countrymen now nostalgically",Paragraph
call les trente glorieuses—the thirty glorious years from 1945 to 1975,Title
"bracketed by the end of World War II and the OPEC oil embargo, a period",Paragraph
of economic growth that saw France recoup much of the international,Paragraph
prestige it lost with its humiliating defeat and occupation by Nazi Germany.,Paragraph
"Despite that general post-war optimism, the young Portzamparc questioned",Paragraph
"whether he wanted to become an architect at all, and it took him seven years",Paragraph
to receive his degree.,Paragraph
Upon graduation he did not work as a design architect but became,Paragraph
involved with sociologically oriented research groups that investigated,Paragraph
urban housing patterns and practices. He applied ideas that he learned,Paragraph
"through direct contact with residents to his first major built project, Les",Paragraph
"Hautes Formes of 1975-1979, a six-building, 209-unit cluster of social",Paragraph

illuminating exhibition held in 2013 at the Skyscraper Museum in New,Paragraph

awareness that a singular departure was upon us. As she wrote for the,Paragraph
exhibition’s wall texts:,Title
"Beginning around 2012, sales of condos in ultra-luxury buildings",Paragraph
"reached $8,000-$10,000 per sq.ft. and in some cases even higher.",Paragraph

development costs for a project are good business strategy if they can,Paragraph
produce extraordinary profits. .. .,Paragraph
"Expensive land and air rights, “starchitect” design fees, special",Paragraph

justify... .,Paragraph
Sophisticated engineering and advances in material strengths have,Paragraph
"made these spindles possible, but it is the excited market for premium",Paragraph
Manhattan real estate that is driving both heights and prices skyward.,Paragraph
"Predicated on Central Park views and other exceptional vistas, these",Paragraph
aeries appeal to a distinct clientele to whom developers direct their,Paragraph
marketing psychology.,Paragraph
Willis is not the only analyst to draw direct connections between the,Paragraph
sudden emergence of this construction binge and the workings of high,Paragraph
finance. Now more New York real estate than ever is held by absentee,Paragraph
"owners, and in at least five large Manhattan condominiums most units are",Paragraph
not primary residences. Although many such pieds-a-terre are doubtless,Paragraph
"used by Americans, they are most attractive to foreign nationals eager to",Paragraph
secure a foothold in the US in the event of trouble in their homelands.,Paragraph
International capital flight has thus been the decisive impetus in this,Paragraph
"booming sector of the New York property market, as people from all over",Paragraph
the world seek a relatively stable haven for themselves and their assets.,Paragraph
"In February 2015, The New York Times published “Towers of Secrecy,” a",Paragraph
five-part investigative series by Louise Story and Stephanie Saul that,Paragraph
"focused on condominium buyers from four countries (India, Malaysia,",Paragraph
"Mexico, and Russia). They revealed how clandestine ownership of",Paragraph
apartments in the city’s most expensive buildings is often abetted through,Paragraph
"shell companies, to say nothing of a veritable industry of New York City",Paragraph
"facilitators. For example, the reporters found that a majority of apartments",Paragraph
in a half-dozen luxury condos were nominally owned through entities that,Paragraph
"are often obscure, including One57 (77 percent), Time Warmer Center (64",Paragraph
"percent), and 15 Central Park West (58 percent). And 58 percent of New",Paragraph
"York City condominiums are paid for entirely in cash, which makes buyers",Paragraph
more untraceable because no mortgage documentation is involved. As Story,Paragraph
and Saul write:,Paragraph
An entire chain of people involved in high-end real estate sales—,Paragraph
"lawyers, accountants, title brokers, escrow agents, real estate agents,",Paragraph
condo boards and building workers—often operate with blinders on.,Paragraph
"As Rudy Tauscher, a former manager of condos at Time Warner, said:",Paragraph
“The building doesn’t know where the money is coming from. We’re,Paragraph
not interested.”,Paragraph
A report jointly issued in February 2015 by Wealth-X (a self-described,Paragraph
“private wealth consultancy”) and Sotheby’s International Real Estate,Title
confirmed that New York had become the world’s favorite refuge for,Paragraph
"second-home buyers from abroad (London was number two, though that",Paragraph
status is now uncertain because of Brexit). The largest proportion of non-,Paragraph
"American purchasers of residential real estate in the city were British,",Paragraph
contradicting conventional wisdom that Russians and Chinese were,Paragraph
dominant. Although The New York Times reported that in the year ending in,Paragraph
March 2014 Chinese buyers accounted for $22 billion in real estate sales in,Paragraph
the US—almost a quarter of all purchases by foreigners—they prefer,Paragraph
suburban houses to metropolitan apartments. According to one Sotheby’s,Paragraph
"broker, “New York City is the concrete jungle, much like Beijing or",Paragraph
"Shanghai. Long Island offers fresh air, no pollution, the waterfront.”",Paragraph
Whether such strong foreign interest can be sustained given the xenophobic,Paragraph
worldview of the Trump administration and its imposition of travel bans,Title
remains to be seen.,Paragraph
The stratospheric amounts at stake in these Manhattan towers perhaps,Paragraph
can best be understood by comparison with today’s contemporary art,Paragraph
"market, where multimillion-dollar paintings and sculptures have become",Paragraph
favored instruments in the global transfer of vast and largely unregulated,Paragraph
"sums. The more expensive the object, the more money can be shifted",Paragraph
"internationally in one transaction, with the artworks themselves—mere",Paragraph
"markers to some degree—making a useful stopover at the Geneva Freeport,",Paragraph
the tax-free air entrepdt in Switzerland used by dealers and collectors to,Paragraph
"reduce or eliminate import duties and value-added taxes. However, much as",Paragraph
"the new super-tall New York condos may serve that same general purpose,",Paragraph
"these are no works of art. If, as Goethe posited, architecture is frozen music,",Paragraph
then these buildings are vertical money.,Paragraph
"Interestingly, there’s a clear architectural disparity between the bloated",Paragraph
"behemoths of Midtown North and the smaller, livelier, but scarcely",Paragraph
inexpensive condominiums clustered around the High Line two miles to the,Paragraph
"southwest in Chelsea. Unlike the rebuilt 57th Street corridor, which quickly",Paragraph
became known as Billionaires’ Row—where city-planning loopholes have,Paragraph
been cunningly exploited to capitalize on the immense profits to be reaped,Paragraph
from supersized condominiums—areas adjacent to the High Line have not,Paragraph
been “up-zoned.” Higher buildings are largely confined to nearby north—,Paragraph
south avenues.,Paragraph
The enormous popular success of the High Line and the arty cachet of its,Paragraph
environs have made this a much sought after neighborhood among affluent,Paragraph
young creative sorts. The city’s principal contemporary art galleries now,Paragraph
"crowd the trestle in the West 10s and 20s, and the Whitney Museum of",Paragraph
American Art saw its attendance figures triple after it moved into its new,Paragraph
"home at the southern end of the linear park in 2015. As a result, developers",Paragraph
have been willing to sponsor architecturally inventive schemes in West,Paragraph
Chelsea to appeal to an audience more aesthetically sophisticated than the,Paragraph
cautious foreign investors who gravitate to blue-chip Midtown North.,Paragraph
The art world favorite Annabelle Selldorf has designed both galleries and,Paragraph
"apartments near the High Line. However, developers favor Pritzker Prize",Paragraph
"winners for the implicit cultural validation they bring to a project, as",Paragraph
Portzamparc did when Extell hired him to design One57. The Pritzker,Paragraph
laureates Shigeru Ban and Jean Nouvel have built condominiums near the,Paragraph
"High Line, and one of the last works designed by the award’s 2004",Paragraph
"recipient, Zaha Hadid, is her thirty-nine-unit condo of 2013-2018 at 28th",Paragraph
Street. This swoopingly streamlined eleven-story composition—in a retro-,Paragraph
futuristic style—rivaled prices achieved in Midtown North with a penthouse,Paragraph
"that had a reported $35 million asking price. And that building’s developer,",Paragraph
"Related Companies, enlisted yet another Pritzker honoree, Rem Koolhaas of",Paragraph
"the firm OMA, to do a condo next to the High Line at West 18th Street.",Paragraph
"In tandem with all this high-priced development, New York City housing",Paragraph
since the turn of the millennium has become far less affordable (especially,Paragraph
"for young people, except for those who work in financial services,",Paragraph
"information technology, or other highly lucrative fields). In 2016 the",Paragraph
median price paid for apartments in the city rose to a new high of $1.2,Paragraph
"million, with the median for condos reaching $3.1 million. Gone are the",Paragraph
"days when aspiring writers, artists, actors, dancers, and other low-earming",Title
bohemians could count on finding a solo dwelling in Manhattan. Apart,Paragraph
from the new-found fashionableness of Brooklyn—whose hippest sections,Paragraph
are now prohibitively expensive—even the remotest reaches of the five,Paragraph
"boroughs are being gentrified, and longtime tenants sometimes find",Paragraph
themselves priced out of their neighborhoods.,Paragraph
"To combat this trend, New York State Senator Brad Hoylman of",Paragraph
Manhattan in 2014 said he would sponsor a bill to impose a property tax,Paragraph
surcharge on nonprimary residences in New York City valued at $5 million,Paragraph
"and higher, which one study says could generate some $665 million to",Paragraph
"subsidize low- and middle-income housing. Predictably, the city’s powerful",Paragraph
"real estate industry—largely controlled by a few dozen family-owned firms,",Paragraph
some with long-standing ties to politicians of both major parties—,Paragraph
"vigorously opposed the idea. Nonetheless, this brave initiative was surely",Paragraph
more equitable than incentives given to developers of Manhattan’s new,Paragraph
safe-deposit boxes in the sky. As Charles V. Bagli reported in the Times in,Paragraph
"February 2015, under New York City’s Property Tax Exemption Program,",Paragraph
"known as 421a, the $100 million apartment at One57 qualified for a 95",Paragraph
"percent tax cut worth about $360,000. (Such abatements decrease over time",Paragraph
and usually expire in twenty-five years or less.),Paragraph
"In return for these breaks, developers were required to create housing for",Paragraph
"low-income tenants, but fewer than 10 percent of new dwellings in the city",Paragraph
have been earmarked as such. Some of those subsidized units are located in,Paragraph
the new luxury towers themselves (though in a few instances are accessible,Paragraph
only through a separate entrance that activists have scorned as “the poor,Paragraph
door”). Developers can also support off-site affordable housing in order to,Paragraph
"qualify apartments for 421a status, as Extell did with One57 by",Paragraph
"underwriting sixty-six such units in the Bronx. However, in his 2015 State",Paragraph
"of the City address, Mayor Bill de Blasio asserted that “the city has for",Paragraph
decades let developers write their own rules. . . . Sometimes projects,Paragraph
"included affordable housing . . . but far too often, they did not.”",Paragraph
De Blasio identified six neighborhoods outside Manhattan where,Paragraph
"developers would be compelled to build 80,000 units of affordable housing",Paragraph
"over the next decade, and twice that number of market-rate properties in",Paragraph
"general. In postmillennial New York, no one has it as bad as the growing",Paragraph
"homeless population, which between 2006 and 2014 increased by 93",Paragraph
"percent to more than 60,000, a good-sized city in itself. By the end of 2017",Paragraph
"that number had ballooned to 76,000, a 4 percent increase over the",Paragraph
preceding year.,Paragraph
"Appropriately enough considering those appalling figures, the finest",Paragraph
apartment building completed in New York City during this marathon of,Paragraph
hyper-expensive construction is Alexander Gorlin’s Boston Road,Paragraph
"Supportive Housing of 2013-2016, which was created specifically to help",Paragraph
alleviate the homeless crisis (see Illustration 18c). In several respects this,Paragraph
"twelve-story, 154-unit structure in the gritty Morrisania section of the South",Caption
Bronx is far from the aeries of Billionaires’ Row and the avant-garde,Paragraph
condos around the High Line. It fairly jumps out of its drab surroundings,Paragraph
"thanks to its crisp colorful design, with a strikingly fresh, deceptively",Paragraph
"simple, but carefully composed facade that mixes and mashes bright metal",Paragraph
panels in syncopated rhythms that make you wonder why so many New,Paragraph
York City buildings have to be so boring.,Paragraph
Easily visible on the southern horizon from the upper stories of Gorlin’s,Caption
building is the inescapable 432 Park Avenue. Yet although these two,Paragraph
residences were erected with vastly disparate budgets and entirely different,Paragraph
"inhabitants in mind, the notable contrast in quality between Vifioly’s magic",Paragraph
beanstalk and Gorlin’s pragmatic gem proves that America’s ever-widening,Paragraph
gap between rich and poor is neither inevitable nor unbridgeable when it,Paragraph
comes to architecture. Boston Road was conceived not for society’s most,Paragraph
"privileged members but for its least—once-homeless elderly people,",Paragraph
"survivors of HIV/AIDS, and the growing ranks of the urban poor. Still,",Paragraph
"beauty is as beauty does, and the strong social underpinnings of Boston",Paragraph
Road give it a significance beyond mere good looks.,Paragraph
Gorlin knows both components of this equation better than most of his,Paragraph
"fellow American professionals. Born to a middle-class family in Queens,",Paragraph
"New York, in 1955, he studied architecture as an undergraduate at Cooper",Paragraph
Union during the mid-1970s. He went on to get a master’s degree from,Paragraph
"Yale, which exposed him to a more patrician view of architecture. After",Paragraph
"stints working for I. M. Pei and Kohn Pedersen Fox, Gorlin founded his",Paragraph
"own New York office in 1987. On the one hand, he does a thriving business",Paragraph
"in clean-lined, exquisitely detailed Modernist houses and interiors for the",Paragraph
"rich, as well as aesthetically ambitious synagogues for wealthy Jewish",Paragraph
"congregations. On the other hand, he feels a moral obligation to do less",Paragraph
"remunerative but more socially beneficial work, and subsidizes the time he",Paragraph
spends on such undertakings with the proceeds from his more lucrative,Paragraph
"commissions, like an architectural Robin Hood. Thus a substantial part of",Paragraph
his practice has been devoted to collaborations with Breaking Ground—a,Paragraph
private organization founded (as Common Ground) in 1990 to address,Paragraph
homelessness with housing that reintegrates residents into the community,Paragraph
rather than simply sheltering them. This initiative seems a particularly vital,Paragraph
contribution now that new publicly financed dwellings are a thing of the,Paragraph
past.,Paragraph
The quality of design Gorlin has achieved with the Boston Road,Paragraph
"Supportive Housing, for which he had a very limited construction budget of",Paragraph
"$30 million, or about $325 per square foot, approximately half what luxury",Paragraph
"Manhattan condos were built for at that time, is extraordinary by any",Paragraph
standard. Boston Road’s most arresting physical aspect is its handsome,Paragraph
"exterior. Unlike almost all other mid-block buildings in big cities, which",Paragraph
"usually have unfinished-looking sides and backs, each elevation of this L-",Paragraph
shaped configuration is as fully surfaced and detailed as the lively street,Paragraph
"facade. The structure is clad in dark gray brick, a perfect foil for the",Paragraph
primary and secondary hues Gorlin chose for the metal panels between,Paragraph
windows. The interiors are equally successful and show how much can be,Paragraph
achieved with very little. The apartments—all 350-foot studios with a,Paragraph
"private, windowless bath and _ integral kitchen—are virtually",Paragraph
indistinguishable from a new breed of “micro-apartments” that began,Paragraph
appearing around the same time in New York in response to skyrocketing,Paragraph
"real estate values. At one of them, Camel Place on Manhattan’s East 27th",Paragraph
"Street, a 360-square-foot studio rented in 2015 for $2,920 a month, as",Paragraph
opposed to $550 here (where fees are gauged on ability to pay).,Paragraph
In addition to Boston Road’s shared amenities—which include an,Paragraph
"exercise room with fitness machines on a par with commercial gyms, a bike",Paragraph
"room, a computer center, and a laundry room—the facility contains ample",Paragraph
common areas for its full array of social services. Among them are a,Paragraph
"resident nurse, a twelve-step program, nutritional and weight-loss guidance,",Paragraph
"career counseling, and discussion groups, all aimed at propelling residents",Paragraph
into self-sufficient lives among the larger community. As other Breaking,Paragraph
"Ground facilities have demonstrated, these all-important support and",Paragraph
monitoring activities can prevent recidivism to a remarkable extent. Boston,Paragraph
Road’s model of a mixed population of former vagrants alongside low-,Paragraph
income workers is an important step forward in destigmatizing,Paragraph
"homelessness, and the proximity of employed residents with others just off",Paragraph
the streets likewise provides a potentially motivating example of self-help.,Paragraph
None of the demographic shifts reflected in these New York City housing,Paragraph
"patterns, high and low, is accidental. During his twelve years in office,",Paragraph
Mayor Bloomberg repeatedly declared his intention to make New York—,Paragraph
long renowned for turning generations of poor immigrants into middle-class,Paragraph
taxpayers—into what the political blogger Alex Pareene has characterized,Paragraph
as the billionaire businessman’s “perfectly engineered technocratic dream,Paragraph
"city.” As Bloomberg said in 2013, “If we could get every billionaire around",Paragraph
"the world to move here it would be a godsend.” In fact, he believes that",Paragraph
economic inequality in the city is attributable not to growing poverty among,Paragraph
the many but to burgeoning wealth among the few:,Paragraph
The reason [the income gap] is so big is that at the higher end we’ve,Paragraph
"been able to do something that none of these other cities can do, and",Paragraph
that is attract a lot of the very wealthy from around the country and,Paragraph
around the world. They are the ones that pay a lot of the taxes. They’re,Paragraph
the ones that spend a lot of money in the stores and restaurants and,Paragraph
create a big chunk of our economy. And we take the tax revenues from,Paragraph
those people to help people throughout the entire rest of the spectrum.,Paragraph
"Such persistent Reagan-era fantasies of trickle-down economics aside,",Paragraph

Although Lin’s rigorously abstract scheme—devoid of the,Paragraph
representational elements and allegorical imagery typical of war,Paragraph
monuments since ancient times—provoked great controversy in some,Paragraph
"quarters when it was chosen from among the 1,421 contest entries, her",Paragraph
powerful melding of the period’s two main avant-garde sculptural,Paragraph
"developments, Minimalism and Earth Art, fundamentally recast popular",Paragraph
notions of commemorative architecture. This symmetrical composition of,Paragraph
"two wedge-shaped, vertically paneled, polished black granite walls, set at a",Caption
125-degree angle to each other and sunk ten feet below grade at their,Paragraph
"deepest, is inscribed with the names of 58,307 American military personnel",Paragraph
who died as a result of the Vietnam War between 1957 and 1975.,Paragraph
The sloping walkway parallel to this 493-foot-long expanse of stone,Paragraph
begins at street level and then reaches its nadir at the monument’s midpoint.,Paragraph
The transit along the declivity gives one the palpable impression of being,Paragraph
swamped by a tide of mortality as the rows of names rise higher and higher,Paragraph
"above one’s head. Then, as the pedestrian path begins to ascend at the",Paragraph
"structure’s midpoint, the opposite occurs, the sensation ebbing and abating",Paragraph
"as one reaches the flat expanse of the National Mall once again, filled with",Paragraph
relief that the flood of names has finally ended. It is not uncommon to see,Paragraph
"visitors in tears after they have negotiated this symbolic abyss, a journey",Paragraph
made all the more unnerving because of the unconsoling directness of the,Paragraph
"experience. However, the stunning physical immediacy of Lin’s design",Paragraph
"could not be conveyed in preparatory drawings or models, and thus its",Paragraph
visceral impact was unanticipated by many until the monument was,Paragraph
completed.,Paragraph
The adage that success has many fathers but failure is an orphan certainly,Paragraph
pertains to those involved with the Vietnam Veterans Memorial,Paragraph
"commission, although the person most responsible for its triumphant",Paragraph
outcome—the artist herself—has never tried to arrogate sole credit for what,Paragraph
became a hugely complicated and highly politicized process. Robert,Paragraph
"Doubek, who served as the executive director of the Vietnam Veterans",Paragraph
Memorial Fund (the nonprofit organization created in 1979 to raise money,Paragraph
"for the monument’s construction), in 2015 published a heartfelt memoir of",Paragraph
"the struggle to bring this patriotic dream to fruition, and he was not at all",Paragraph
reticent in aggrandizing the part he played. As the definite article in his,Paragraph
"subtitle suggests, Creating the Vietnam Veterans Memorial: The Inside",Paragraph
Story is not only a first-person but also a one-sided account of this,Paragraph
frequently contentious saga.,Paragraph
"Nonetheless, for all its flaws and self-serving paybacks, this is a valuable",Paragraph
"contribution to the memorial’s historiography, above all in Doubek’s",Paragraph
portrayal of the conflicting forces that vied for supremacy. We get a vivid,Paragraph
sense of the emotions Lin’s design aroused among those who felt her,Paragraph
scheme was disrespectful to the memory of the fallen because of its,Paragraph
"uncompromising abstraction and the way it is dug into the earth—a grave, a",Paragraph
"pit, a latrine, detractors charged—rather than physically elevated to a",Paragraph
position of high honor.,Paragraph
Doubek admits that he was no fan of Lin’s design as it emerged from the,Paragraph
crowd of other submissions during the selection process. “[Her] sketches,Paragraph
"and drawings were very amateurish,” he writes, “and the black shapes said",Paragraph
nothing to me. ‘What the hell is that?’ I had thought.” A very different,Paragraph
"reaction came from the West Point—trained Jack Wheeler, co-founder (with",Paragraph
"another former soldier, Jan Scruggs) and chairman of the Vietnam Veterans",Paragraph
"Memorial Fund, who instantly declared, “It’s a work of genius.” Doubek",Paragraph
still didn’t get it.,Paragraph
“T had anticipated a messiah emerging from the mists of competition-,Paragraph
"land,” he recalls of his first meeting with Lin. “But she didn’t have a lot to",Paragraph
say and didn’t seem to know or care much about us. I felt like I had let a,Paragraph
genie out of the bottle only to have the genie chill out.” Things between,Paragraph
"them never improved greatly, and in the book’s postscript the author sourly",Paragraph
notes that it was only in 2007 that “Lin for the first time expressed thanks to,Paragraph
"me and the others with VVMF,” oblivious to why it may have taken her so",Paragraph
"long. But Doubek’s obtuseness was far from the worst adversity Lin faced,",Paragraph
as she endured vicious sexist and racist attacks from those outraged that an,Paragraph
"Asian woman—a “gook,” many openly said—should determine how the",Paragraph
Vietnam War was memorialized for the ages.,Paragraph
Concerted objections to Lin’s design among veterans’ groups led to the,Paragraph
"addition of a naturalistic bronze statue, Frederick Hart’s The Three Soldiers,",Caption
which depicts a trio of zombielike combatants who exhibit the so-called,Paragraph
thousand-yard stare of battle-hardened warriors. Unveiled a year after the,Paragraph
"main memorial’s completion, this kitschy tableau was at least placed far",Paragraph
enough away from the great earthwork to inflict minimum damage. Not,Paragraph
"surprisingly, Hart’s hyper-masculine lineup spurred feminists in turn to",Paragraph
"demand yet another sculptural supplement to the site, which resulted in the",Paragraph
"Vietnam Women’s Memorial (1993), a bronze figural group by Glenna",Paragraph
Goodacre that shows three servicewomen tending to a wounded GI in the,Paragraph
attitudes of an overcrowded but still male-centered Pietd.,Paragraph
The pervasive influence of Lin’s masterwork has been repeatedly,Paragraph
demonstrated in a period when traditional forms of architecture and,Paragraph
sculpture have come to seem wholly inadequate in memorializing events,Paragraph
"once deemed unimaginable, most clearly the attack on the World Trade",Paragraph
Center in 2001. Michael Arad and Peter Walker’s National September 11,Caption
Memorial on the site of that catastrophe reinterprets several of Lin’s,Paragraph
concepts in highly original ways. So as not to become architecture’s Lady,Paragraph
"of Perpetual Mourning, she has turned down all but three subsequent offers",Paragraph
"to design memorials, including that at Ground Zero. (The other two",Paragraph
commemorative commissions she accepted were the Civil Rights Memorial,Paragraph
"of 1989 in Montgomery, Alabama, and the Women’s Table of 1993 at Yale,",Paragraph
which was commissioned in 1989 to mark twenty years of coeducation at,Paragraph
her alma mater.) She has promised that her final effort in that vein will be,Paragraph
"What Is Missing?, which is intended to raise awareness of species",Paragraph
extinction and protection.,Paragraph
"Lin turned instead to environmental sculptures, as well as to a smaller",Paragraph
number of modestly scaled buildings that have led some to underestimate,Paragraph
her degree of professional ambition. Yet in contrast to architecture as many,Paragraph
"men in the profession still would define it—the bigger, costlier, and showier",Paragraph
the better—her meditative view of the building art provides a means for,Paragraph
"expressing poetic impulses about humanity’s place in the natural, rather",Paragraph
"than man-made, environment. Indeed, Lin’s steadfast determination to",Paragraph
ignore the corruptions of modern publicity—that fatal addiction of,Paragraph
"postmillennial culture, signified in her profession by the hideous neologism",Paragraph
“starchitect”—has been among her most important qualities.,Paragraph
It could be said that such indifference is easy for someone whose place in,Paragraph
architectural history is already secure. But the blatant degree to which some,Paragraph
"of Lin’s colleagues in the profession, female as well as male, have fallen in",Paragraph
with the contemporary celebrity industry offers a cautionary contrast. When,Paragraph
Jerry Seinfeld was once asked how he could ever possibly exceed the,Paragraph
"phenomenal success of his eponymous TV sitcom, which ended in 1998, he",Paragraph
replied in words that echo Lin’s attitude: “There’s only one way to top it.,Paragraph
And that’s to remain an artist and not a ‘star.’”,Paragraph
Maya Ying Lin was born in 1959 to culturally sophisticated and,Paragraph
"professionally accomplished Chinese immigrants in Athens, Ohio, where",Paragraph
her parents—who met as students at the University of Washington—moved,Paragraph
"that year to take up posts at Ohio University. Her mother, Julia Ming-hui",Paragraph
"Chang Lin, was a poet and scholar of Chinese literature. Her father, Henry",Paragraph
"Huan Lin, a renowned studio potter, founded the school’s ceramics program",Paragraph
"and later became the dean of its College of Fine Arts. His older half sister,",Paragraph
"Lin Huiyin, China’s first female architect, married the architect Liang",Paragraph
"Sicheng, known as the father of modern architecture in his country. Liang,",Paragraph
who studied at the University of Pennsylvania under the Classicist Paul Cret,Paragraph
"(as did his exact contemporary Louis Kahn), maintained close ties to the",Paragraph
"West, and after World War II served as China’s representative on the",Paragraph
architectural advisory committee that oversaw the design of the United,Paragraph
Nations headquarters in New York. His posthumously published Chinese,Paragraph
Architecture: A Pictorial History (1984) remains the basic English-language,Paragraph
introduction to that subject.,Paragraph
"Maya Lin’s more distant antecedents were no less distinguished, as was",Paragraph
"revealed in a 2016 episode of the PBS series Finding Your Roots, with",Paragraph
"Henry Louis Gates Jr., in which the Harvard historian showed her a copy of",Paragraph
a scroll that purportedly traces the Lin family’s origins directly back to her,Paragraph
ninety-ninth great-grandfather in 1092 BCE. Gates also identified one of,Paragraph
"her maternal great-grandmothers, Ye Deyi (born 1885), a gynecologist and",Paragraph
pediatrician who was among China’s first female physicians. Lin’s self-,Paragraph
assurance in entering a field still dominated by men doubtless owes much to,Paragraph
"her parents’ encouragement, but it is hard not to wonder if genetics also",Paragraph
played a significant part.,Paragraph
Her gift for the sympathetic placement of architecture within a landscape,Paragraph
"is of a piece with her strong sculptural instincts, and most evident in her",Paragraph
"work at Haley Farm, the 157-acre rural campus of the Children’s Defense",Paragraph
"Fund in northeastern Tennessee. Her two buildings there, though quite",Paragraph
"different from each other, are nonetheless alike in their thoughtful siting,",Paragraph
"humane scale, humble materials, and appropriateness to their function, and",Paragraph
symbolically evoke the enclave’s purpose as a training and conference,Paragraph
center for young community activists of color. Her first project on the,Paragraph
property—the Langston Hughes Library of 1999—was a remodeling of an,Paragraph
1860s barn of a form particular to the region: a rectangular shed raised one,Caption
"story above the ground, atop a considerably smaller pair of grain-storage",Caption
cribs composed of horizontally stacked logs. (A similar top-heavy,Paragraph
configuration is seen in Scandinavian folk architecture.) Lin treated the,Paragraph
"existing building as a precious historic artifact, but to support the significant",Paragraph
added weight of heavily laden bookshelves she inserted an entirely new,Paragraph
steel framework within the wood-frame structure.,Caption
She employed an equally timeless form for the nearby Riggio-Lynch,Paragraph
"Chapel of 2004, a simple but beautifully crafted wooden structure whose",Paragraph
"subtly curving contours recall those of a boat, a reference that harks back to",Paragraph
early Christian iconography of the church as a barque akin to that of Jesus,Paragraph
and his apostles as they fished on the Sea of Galilee (see [llustration 19b).,Paragraph
"Indeed, the architectural term “nave”—the main enclosure of a sanctuary—",Paragraph
derives from the Latin navis (ship). An extra layer of symbolism attaches to,Paragraph
this seemingly beached vessel on the edge of a pond fringed by weeping,Paragraph
willows. The finely crafted but economical unpainted particleboard interior,Paragraph
"of the windowless chapel is illuminated by skylights, and one’s focus is",Paragraph
directed to the central pulpit in the grand tradition of black preaching,Paragraph
churches.,Paragraph
Lin has demonstrated a similar topographic sensitivity in her remarkable,Paragraph
"series of earthwork sculptures, which began with The Wave Field (1995). It",Paragraph
was commissioned for the interior courtyard of an aerospace building at the,Paragraph
"University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, which was named in memory of an",Paragraph
"alumnus, Francois-Xavier Bagnoud, a helicopter rescue pilot who died in an",Paragraph
"air accident at age twenty-four. (He was a great-grandson of Simén Patifio,",Paragraph
"the Bolivian “Tin King,” and The Wave Field was underwritten by",Paragraph
Bagnoud’s philanthropic mother.) Eager to express the freedom and fluidity,Paragraph
"of youth and aeronautics, Lin found inspiration in the undulating, parallel",Paragraph
"lines of a water current called a Stokes wave. Using that pattern as a model,",Paragraph
"she demarcated a one-hundred-foot square, had its surface shaped on the",Paragraph
"diagonal into rows of swelling grass-covered hillocks three to five feet high,",Paragraph
and achieved an effect of rippling propulsion akin to a verdant meadow,Paragraph
beneath the rotors of a chopper during liftoff.,Paragraph
At once specific in its commemorative purpose but generalized in its,Paragraph
"abstract, hypnotic beauty, The Wave Field, now a popular campus gathering",Paragraph
"place, demonstrates Lin’s genius for transforming profound personal loss",Paragraph
"into a force for social cohesion, no less so than in her most famous work.",Paragraph
The architect has since produced two variations on this theme: Flutter,Paragraph
"(2005), for a federal courthouse in Miami, Florida; and the eleven-acre",Paragraph
"Storm King Wavefield (2009) at Storm King, the sculpture park in Orange",Caption
"County, New York. The latter installation is more extensive than its",Paragraph
"predecessors not only in area but also in the size of the waves, which here",Paragraph
"vary from ten to eighteen feet high, with a separation of some forty feet",Paragraph
"between each row of mounds, proportions that approximate the sensation of",Paragraph
being on a stormy sea where one’s view of the horizon is blocked by tall,Paragraph
swells. Storm King Wavefield gives those who climb up and down the,Paragraph
slopes to reach its centermost folds a palpable sense of being engulfed by,Paragraph
"the forces of nature, an immersive experience not unlike that of the Vietnam",Paragraph
"Veterans Memorial, but without the political meaning imputed to that earlier",Paragraph
work.,Paragraph
Related to the wave fields but more reminiscent of the land forms built,Paragraph
over a five-thousand-year period by Native American cultures collectively,Paragraph
known as the Mound Builders are Lin’s “Earth Drawings.” These include,Paragraph
Eleven Minute Line (2004) at the Wands Foundation sculpture park in,Caption
"southern Sweden and Kentucky Line (2008) near Louisville, both of which",Paragraph
extend like gigantic snakes across their rural settings. These works are less,Paragraph
"pictographic than their ancient antecedents, which often represented living",Paragraph
creatures; their most obvious model is the Great Serpent Mound in,Paragraph
"southwestern Ohio, which has been dated to the eleventh century but may",Paragraph
be much older. Like many such constructions (unless they are cut into a,Paragraph
"hillside) their patterns are most discernible from overhead, and thus Lin’s",Paragraph
“Earth Drawings” are not as fully comprehensible at ground level as her,Paragraph
"wave fields, which exert a far stronger effect on the viewer.",Paragraph
"Since 2008, Lin has been represented by the New York-based Pace",Paragraph
"Gallery, one of the four so-called megadealers (along with Gagosian,",Paragraph
"Hauser & Wirth, and David Zwirner) that have increasingly monopolized",Paragraph
the very high end of the international art trade since the start of the,Paragraph
millennium. One of the principal motivating factors behind Earth Art was to,Paragraph
"create works whose environmental, site-specific nature would negate the",Paragraph
commercial commodification that disturbed many young artists during the,Paragraph
"late 1960s. However, in order to finance such costly undertakings as",Paragraph
Michael Heizer’s massive earthworks or Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s,Paragraph
"grandiose wrappings, these visionaries also created salable, domestically",Paragraph
scaled objects to underwrite their endeavors.,Paragraph
"Furthermore, since the greatest examples of Earth Art—including Robert",Paragraph
"Smithson’s Spiral Jetty on Utah’s Great Salt Lake, Walter De Maria’s",Paragraph
"Lightning Field in western New Mexico, and James Turrell’s Roden Crater",Paragraph
"in Arizona’s Painted Desert—tend to be in remote locations, more",Paragraph
physically accessible manifestations of such colossal conceptions are,Paragraph
essential to gain critical and financial support for projects that otherwise,Paragraph
"might remain intriguing hypotheses on paper. Lin, for her part, is the most",Paragraph
ethical of artists and there is nothing venal about her assertion that “I,Paragraph
wanted to transfer what I was exploring in my outdoor installations to the,Paragraph
confines of a museum.”,Paragraph
Her Around the World x 3 (2014) is a twelve-foot-wide floor piece,Paragraph
"comprising three concentric rings of white marble, an arrangement that",Paragraph
immediately suggests Richard Long’s circular aggregations of rough-hewn,Paragraph
"stones on a flat surface. The upper surfaces of this tripartite, target-like",Paragraph
composition are naturalistically carved at various heights to suggest,Paragraph
"comparative elevations of points around the globe including the North Pole,",Paragraph
"Iceland, the Ural Mountains, the Bering Strait, New York City, Ecuador,",Caption
"Indonesia, Kenya, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Given several",Paragraph
other recent conceptual pieces by Lin that address the crisis of climate,Paragraph
"change, rising sea levels, and the disastrous effect that global warming is",Paragraph
"already having on the world’s coastlines, one assumes that the aim of this",Paragraph
beautiful object is to dramatize that present threat in readily comprehensible,Paragraph
form. What is certain is that the elegant surface Lin achieves here—which,Paragraph
attains a level of suave semi-primitive effect reminiscent of Isamu,Paragraph
"Noguchi’s half-raw, half-polished stone sculptures—can also divert",Paragraph
attention from the urgency of her important if inchoately articulated,Paragraph
message. Her desire to bring the grandeur of untamed nature into a gallery,Paragraph
setting can seem a bit too self-defeatingly well-mannered compared to,Paragraph
"grittier efforts of other Earth artists, especially Long and Heizer.",Paragraph
"In 1996 Lin married the pioneering photography dealer Daniel Wolf,",Paragraph

master plan for this expansion of the firm’s enclave adjacent to the MIT,Paragraph
"campus, as well as two of the three buildings (the third is by the architect",Paragraph
"Toshiko Mori). As indicated by her series of twenty-eight study models, she",Paragraph
finally settled on a format that assigned laboratories to a glass-walled,Paragraph
medium-rise slab set at an angle against a low-rise street-front volume with,Paragraph
ground-floor commercial spaces and offices above. The evident aim is to,Paragraph
encourage a lively engagement with pedestrians that is often missing along,Paragraph

Massachusetts Avenue.,Paragraph
"The obliquely angled facade of the scheme’s lower portion, which",Paragraph
"reflects the irregular intersection of the surrounding streets, is clad with pale",Paragraph
stone blocks worked into porous patterns meant to evoke microscopic,Paragraph

"horizontal band of glass beneath a projecting flat roof, which brings to mind",Paragraph
midcentury modernism of a superior sort that might have been executed in,Paragraph
"Miami or Rio de Janeiro, or by Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron,",Paragraph
"whose Switch House addition to their Tate Modern gallery in London,",Paragraph
"which opened in 2016, has a not dissimilar exterior of perforated brick.",Paragraph
Lin came of professional age at the conjunction of two immense changes,Paragraph
in architectural culture: the increasing acceptance of women in a field that,Paragraph
"had long restricted them to subsidiary roles, and a renewed sense that what",Paragraph
during the modern period had come to be seen primarily as a technical,Paragraph
discipline was an art form as well. Thanks to her culturally supportive,Paragraph
"upbringing, youthful acclaim, and preternatural self-confidence in following",Paragraph
"multidisciplinary pursuits without a careerist agenda, Lin has freed herself",Paragraph
from the entrapments of the infernal fame machine. If all her experiments,Paragraph
"do not lead to a breakthrough as momentous as her defining hour in 1981,",Paragraph
she nonetheless has established herself as a model of what architecture can,Paragraph
become in the hands of a woman unafraid to pursue a different path.,Paragraph
