BOOK Sigfried Giedion Building in France Building in Iron Building in Ferroconcrete.pdf,Caption
Introduction,Title
Sokratis Georgiadis,Title
There is broad agreement among historians of modern architecture that,Paragraph
"Sigfried Giedion’s Bauen in Frankreich, Bauen in Eisen, Bauen in Eisenbeton",Caption
(1928) may without reservation be called a classic of modern architectural,Paragraph
literature (fig. 1). Reyner Banham presents this book as a kind of authorized,Paragraph
history of Modernism: “the Modern Movement’s view of its own history.”!,Paragraph
On the basis of this book and in connection with Giedion’s work as secretary,Paragraph
"of the Congrés Internationaux d’Architecture Moderne (c1AM), Spiro Kostof",Caption
characterizes him as “the official historian of the Modern Movement.”? And,Paragraph
Stanislaus von Moos maintains that with Bauen in Frankreich Giedion has,Paragraph
“drawn the picture of a developmental continuity” that “time and again has,Paragraph
inspired the history of modern architecture.”>,Paragraph
"Nevertheless, one can hardly describe Giedion’s intention as primarily",Paragraph
"historiographic. With this book, born as it was from a series of articles writ-",Paragraph
ten for the journal Cicerone and still bearing “the odium of a manifesto”,Paragraph
"(von Moos), the author wanted to be, in his own words, “the conveyor of a",Paragraph
viewpoint.” He wanted to sketch a vision of a modern architecture that—in,Paragraph
accordance with the demands of the avant-garde — broke decisively with the,Paragraph
traditional values of the discipline. Only later did he place this vision within,Paragraph
a historical context. He attempted to do so by means of the hypothesis that,Paragraph
the great iron constructions of the nineteenth century and the ferroconcrete,Title
architecture produced by the pioneers of Modernism belong aesthetically,Paragraph
under one and the same roof.,Paragraph
"Intellectually, Bauen in Frankreich is the product of Giedion’s direct con-",Paragraph
"tact with the leading personalities of Modernism, “with the artists of his",Paragraph
own time.” This contact began during the summer of 1923 with the large,Paragraph
Bauhaus exhibition in Weimar (his first meeting with Walter Gropius) and,Paragraph
continued during the Esprit Nouveau exhibition of 1925 in Paris (his first,Paragraph
contact with Le Corbusier). It resulted in Giedion’s numerous articles on,Paragraph
"contemporary architecture, which appeared in newspapers and professional",Paragraph
journals in Germany and Switzerland. With the publication of Bauen in,Paragraph
Frankreich and with the assumption of his role as secretary general of claM,Paragraph
"(which he helped found in 1928), Giedion the historian renounced the",Paragraph
neutrality of an outside observer of events: he willingly shed his supposed,Paragraph

Georgiadis,Title
"innocence and became, both programmatically and definitively, an integral",Paragraph
"part of the Modern Movement. This, in any case, is how Giedion himself",Paragraph
related the sequence of events on various occasions. Yet things began quite,Paragraph
differently.*,Paragraph
Giedion was a Swiss citizen born in Prague on 14 April 1888. After com-,Paragraph
"pleting his secondary schooling, he studied mechanical engineering in",Paragraph
"Vienna at the behest of his parents. But engineering, with a view to taking",Paragraph
"over the family’s textile concern, was not to his liking, and he decided",Paragraph
instead to study art history. In 1915 he commenced his studies at the Uni-,Paragraph
"versity of Zurich and eventually transferred to the University of Munich,",Paragraph
"where Heinrich Wolfflin, one of the great art historians of the day, taught.",Paragraph
Giedion did his doctoral work under Wolfflin and in 1922 published his,Paragraph
"dissertation, Spdtbarocker und romantischer Klassizismus (Late Baroque and",Paragraph
"Romantic classicism).> Concurrent with his studies he wrote poetry, prose,",Paragraph
and — inspired by the Aktivismus literary movement —a play called Arbeit,Paragraph
"(Work), which was staged in 1917 in Vienna, Leipzig, and Basel, and in",Paragraph
Berlin by Max Reinhardt. In the turbulent years following World War 1,Caption
Giedion became politically active and supported the Munich Rédterepublik.,Paragraph
"In Munich he also met the art historian Carola Welcker, who was to become",Paragraph
his wife.,Paragraph
"Notwithstanding his excellent preparation for it, an orderly academic",Paragraph
career interested Giedion about as much as the management of a textile,Paragraph
mill. Instead he cast himself in the role of a comrade-in-arms in and — wher-,Paragraph
ever possible — fellow creator of an admittedly still-vague but all the more,Paragraph
passionately desired cultural renewal. It was precisely with this aim that he,Paragraph
"turned toward modern architecture, which received its first, unshakable",Paragraph
foundation with Bauen in Frankreich.,Paragraph
"In the decade following its publication, Giedion was active as a freelance",Paragraph
writer on art. He contributed regularly to the journals Cicerone and Cahiers,Paragraph
d’art; he wrote a small book on the modern housing form for a Zurich pub-,Paragraph
"lisher (Befreites Wohnen (Liberated dwelling], 1929); and for Editions Crés he",Paragraph
"prepared the first short monograph on Gropius (Walter Gropius, Paris, 1931).",Paragraph
He also worked intensively on a projected multivolume history of modern,Paragraph
"civilization, Die Entstehung des heutigen Menschen (The origin of modern",Paragraph
"man), which remained unfinished. From his home in the Zurich Doldertal,",Paragraph
which served both as the c1am headquarters and as a meeting place for,Paragraph

"lectures, and codirected a firm that had as its goal the dissemination of mod-",Paragraph

modern painting to efforts to introduce a quiet toilet. As an architectural,Paragraph
client he initiated construction of two prototypical multifamily residences in,Paragraph
"Zurich, designed by Alfred and Emil Roth and Marcel Breuer.”",Paragraph
In the 1920s Giedion also tackled the issue of architectural education. In,Paragraph
the early 1930s he even sought an academic post at Zurich’s Eidgendssische,Paragraph
"Technische Hochschule (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH). His",Paragraph
"breakthrough, however, did not come until a few years later when, through",Paragraph
"the auspices of Gropius, he was appointed: the Charles Eliot Norton Profes-",Paragraph
sor of Poetry at Harvard University for the academic year 1938-1939.8 From,Caption
"his series of lectures titled “The Life of Architecture” came the book Space,",Paragraph
"Time, and Architecture,’ which has gone through numerous editions and",Paragraph
been translated into several languages. One of the century's most successful,Paragraph
"architectural books, it gained a considerable international reputation for its",Paragraph
"author. Giedion integrated large parts of Bawen in Frankreich into this work,",Paragraph
which Gropius described in a letter to its author of 18 May 1941 as “really,Paragraph
the best statement about our movement.”,Paragraph
"In Space, Time, and Architecture Giedion also broadened his conception",Paragraph
of Modernism. He discussed the turn-of-the-century’s moral revolt against,Paragraph
eclecticism and the revolution of modern painting (which was the first art,Paragraph
to develop a new spatial conception} as further important factors in defin-,Paragraph

"ern man’s disastrous “schism between thinking and feeling,” for which he",Paragraph
blamed the nineteenth century.,Paragraph
This dilution of the subject matter of Bauen in Frankreich can be traced,Paragraph
"not least to the fact that in Space, Time, and Architecture Giedion made an",Paragraph
important new discovery: America. In quick “close-ups” he sketched the,Paragraph
"architecture of the New World, from the anonymous buildings of the first",Paragraph
settlers to the so-called Chicago school and Frank Lloyd Wright. America,Paragraph
now became for Giedion an aspect of the modern adventure that could not,Paragraph
be circumvented and at the same time a “primary influence in the matura-,Paragraph
tion of his historical vision.” It is thus not surprising that America would,Paragraph
"become the central theme of his next book, Mechanization Takes Command,""",Paragraph
Georgiadis,Title
Whether in the Patent Office in Washington or in the slaughterhouses of,Paragraph
"Cincinnati, he steadfastly sought out the documents of an anonymous",Paragraph

"Meanwhile, Europe degenerated into a negative image of an emotionally",Paragraph
unresolved onslaught of the modern. The vestiges of Bauen in Frankreich,Paragraph
"had now completely disappeared, and the optimistic perspective that had",Paragraph
defined the tone of this publication in the 1920s similarly disappeared.,Paragraph
Giedion questioned the omnipotence of a rationalism that was an end in,Paragraph
itself and registered his skepticism of the naive faith in progress. In his,Paragraph

During these last years Giedion’s interests followed two paths. He con-,Paragraph

Introduction,Title
extent dissolve itself as a body. No one summed up the relevant feelings,Paragraph
"better than the architect Gottfried Semper, who called it a “glass-covered",Paragraph
vacuum.”!6 This sensation was made technically possible by using a material,Paragraph
that seemed quite unexpectedly to shatter the age-old tangible certainty of,Paragraph
architecture. This material was iron.,Paragraph
Some eight decades separate the erection of the Crystal Palace and the,Paragraph
"appearance of Bauen in Frankreich. This is, by and large, also the period dur-",Paragraph
ing which the debate over the architectural use of iron took place. Whereas,Paragraph
"the debate was in part very intense and indeed passionate, it also had quieter",Paragraph
"stretches and more sober turns. Nevertheless, much was at stake: nothing",Paragraph
"less than a new style of architecture, the new form from which one hoped",Paragraph
to tailor an architectural dress for the modern age. Semper’s ideas about,Paragraph
iron formed one of the two most important reference points during the,Paragraph
first phase of this debate. The other pole was defined by the theories of Carl,Paragraph
"Gottlieb Wilhelm Botticher, the author of the epoch-making study Die Tek-",Paragraph
tonik der Hellenen (The tectonics of the Hellenes).’”,Paragraph
Iron: The Expectation of the New Art-Form,Title
Botticher’s decisive plea for the extensive architectural use of iron and,Paragraph
this material’s promise of creating a new style go back to his lecture “Das,Paragraph
Prinzip der Hellenischen und Germanischen Bauweise hinsichtlich der,Title
Ubertragung in die Bauweise unserer Tage” (The principle of the Hellenic,Title
and Germanic styles of building with regard to their application to today’s,Paragraph
way of building). It was an address given at the first festival commemorating,Paragraph
"Karl Friedrich Schinkel, organized in 1846 by the Berliner Architekten-Verein",Paragraph
(Berlin architectural association).'®,Paragraph
"In his monumental work Die Tektonik der Hellenen, Bétticher had con-",Paragraph
cerned himself with comparing “Hellenic and Germanic styles of building.”,Paragraph
"As he had noted in that work, he felt obliged “to dispel the suspicion that a",Paragraph
"constrained, one-sided preference for the forms of Hellenic tectonics has",Paragraph
guided the principle of my work and robbed me of an eye and free aware-,Paragraph
ness of the value of medieval tectonics.” Bétticher’s contribution can thus,Paragraph
"be placed within the context of the ongoing debate on style, which had",Paragraph
excited the temperaments of architects and architectural thinkers since the,Paragraph
1820s.” He sought to reconcile the differences by proposing a stylistic syn-,Paragraph
"thesis. In this, Schinkel’s work provided him with a prototype.",Paragraph
But in his Schinkel address of 1846 Bétticher developed a completely dif-,Paragraph
"ferent position, the foundation of which was a radical historicizing of the",Paragraph
Georgiadis,Title
architecture of antiquity and Gothic times. On this ground he questioned,Paragraph
the viability of either style for future development. Bétticher’s starting point,Paragraph
was the same one he had used in Tektonik der Hellenen: architecture had no,Paragraph
"analogs in the world of perception, no models in nature. This was the rea-",Paragraph
son for its “working independence.” He reproached classicists and Neo-,Paragraph
gothicists alike for the fact that they had remained stuck on the “outer shell”,Paragraph
"of architecture. The “working principle” of architecture — from which, so to",Paragraph
"speak, the different physiognomies of the two styles had arisen — rested",Paragraph
precisely on their respective “static principles” and “material relations.” For,Paragraph
"this reason, the two competing parties had failed to see that the two ways",Paragraph
of building had been merely evolutionary stages of a history that would,Paragraph
certainly not end there.,Paragraph
"Both [styles] define only two evolutionary stages, which have to run their course",Paragraph
and complete their prescribed circle before a third style can see the light of,Paragraph
"day. Fhis in no way invalidates either of the styles; rather, only by basing itself",Paragraph
on the results of both can a third and higher stage of development come to the,Paragraph
"fore —a third style, whose creation is reserved by historic necessity for a later",Paragraph
"time but whose foundation our own age has, in fact, already started laying.?!",Paragraph
"Classic and Gothic architecture are no longer seen, as in the Tektonik der",Paragraph
"Hellenen, as dialectical opposites, whose poles are on the verge of synthesis.",Paragraph
"The historical perspective opens up, and this opening is bound to the cer-",Paragraph
"tainty of an expected epochal change, upon the threshold of which Bétticher",Paragraph
believed his generation had already arrived.,Paragraph
"Botticher was convinced that iron represented the dawn of a new, higher",Paragraph
"historical level. He believed this material presaged a new, third way of build-",Paragraph
"ing and consequently also a new architecture. Naturally, he made his point",Paragraph
of view from a constructional perspective. Just as he had asserted in Tek-,Paragraph
"tonik der Hellenen, he attached decisive importance to roof construction and",Paragraph
regarded it as the most essential aspect of an architectural style. The sys-,Paragraph
tem of monolithic stone beams in antiquity and the arched vaulting of the,Paragraph
"Middle Ages, he said, had completely exhausted the constructional and",Paragraph
architectural possibilities of stone. A material was now needed that could,Paragraph
"facilitate construction and span great openings, one that could therefore",Paragraph
guarantee a reliable roofing system and thus permit every imaginable floor,Paragraph
plan and spatial configuration —a material that consequently might bring,Paragraph
with it a “new realm of art-forms.” This material was none other than iron.,Paragraph
6,Caption
Introduction,Title
Botticher was certainly not the first to discuss the new material from a,Paragraph
"theoretical perspective. The year before Botticher’s Schinkel address, Eduard",Paragraph
"Metzger contributed to the still-lively debate on style, and iron construction",Paragraph
constituted an important part of his argument. Metzger described the view,Paragraph
of his contemporaries thus: “Iron Constructions: 1 can well imagine these,Paragraph
words terrify the plastically minded architect!”2? But he was of the opinion,Paragraph
that the architect must face the challenge presented by iron. He himself,Paragraph
did so by seeking to link the use of iron with his own penchant for the Neo-,Paragraph
gothic. “The network of the Gothic arch and all of its spanning members is,Paragraph
closely related to the one that develops in accordance with the nature of,Paragraph
"iron.” In Metzger’s eyes, the main problem was the practical joining of iron",Paragraph
"to stone construction, for “it almost appears as if iron spanning members",Paragraph
and the more massive architectural bodies are distinct incompatibilities.’**,Paragraph
"Althéugh he offered no solutions, he spoke confidently concerning the",Paragraph
developmental possibilities of a new pointed-arch style in which iron would,Paragraph
play a critical role.,Paragraph
The significance of Bétticher’s contribution is already evident. He was,Paragraph
"the first to deduce a wholly new tectonic principle from iron, one funda-",Paragraph
"mentally different from any that had gone before. At the same time, he",Paragraph
endeavored to base this principle on a historical-theoretical foundation. He,Paragraph
"did not, however, succeed in satisfactorily answering the aesthetic question.",Paragraph
Although he held out the prospect that iron construction’s “core-form” (Kern-,Paragraph
"form) would create a new sphere of “art-forms” (Kunstformen), he avoided",Paragraph
"outlining even roughly the character of these art-forms, which he had done",Paragraph
in Tektonik der Hellenen for stone buildings of antiquity. There the art-form,Paragraph
"was the symbolic representation of the tectonic form, or the core-form.",Paragraph
"Richard Streiter, who in 1896 wrote a comprehensive critique of Bétticher’s",Paragraph
"Tektonik,?5 pointed out this omission and correctly noted that the various",Paragraph
attempts to translate Botticher’s theory into practice had not yet yielded “a,Paragraph
"fundamentally new way of designing, evolving from the characteristics of",Paragraph
"material and technique.””® Instead, Bétticher’s students had simply trans-",Paragraph
posed the ornamental motifs of the Greek temple to the iron components.,Paragraph
“Invisible Architecture”,Title
Bétticher’s remarks did not meet with unconditional agreement. Even,Paragraph
"Heinrich Leibnitz, who in a short book of 1849 attempted to popularize the",Paragraph
"Tektonik der Hellenen and apply its system to all of architectural history, dis-",Paragraph
tanced himself from Bétticher’s position as soon as it touched upon the,Paragraph
Georgiadis,Title
"architectural applicability of iron. At the end of his book, where he examined",Paragraph
"contemporary events, Leibnitz noted that “iron is not the kind of material",Paragraph
"that can call forth a new artistic epoch in architecture, for it transpresses",Paragraph
"measure, contradicts static feeling, and destroys mass.’”” The question of",Paragraph
"the new style was also drawn, like a red thread, through the entire theoreti-",Paragraph
cal work of Gottfried Semper. His most brilliant statement on this subject,Paragraph
"was given in his lecture of 4 March 1869 in the Zurich City Hall, in which",Paragraph
he discussed the conditions of the origin and change of architectural,Paragraph
styles.28 His polemical sting was directed against two contemporary theo-,Paragraph
"retical conceptions of style. On the one hand, he criticized the historical",Paragraph
"Darwinists who would apply the laws of natural selection, heredity, and",Paragraph
"adaptation to architecture. On the other hand, he opposed those who “start",Paragraph
from the erroneous assumption that the question of style is chiefly a con-,Paragraph
structional question.” It is clear already from this criticism that Semper’s,Paragraph
position is incompatible with the idea that a constructional material alone,Paragraph
has the’capacity to create a style — as Bétticher's Schinkel address implied.”,Paragraph
The same is true for Botticher’s prophesy that the use of iron could lead to a,Paragraph
"third, modern way of building, following the Greek and Gothic styles.",Paragraph
Semper’s negative attitude toward the extensive architectural use of iron,Paragraph
was also based on another important factor. He had discussed the material,Paragraph
"as early as 1849 in an article reviewing the Jardin d’hiver in Paris,*° and",Paragraph
"there he altogether rejected the open display of it, at least in monumental",Paragraph
buildings. As a constructional material iron should “by its nature be used as,Paragraph
slender rods and sometimes as cables.” Due to the small surface displayed in,Paragraph
"these forms, the more perfect the construction, the more the iron visually",Paragraph
disappears. It is in this sense that Semper spoke of it as an “invisible mate-,Paragraph
rial.” Barely fifteen years later he repeated this assessment in his principal,Paragraph
"work, Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen Kiinsten; oder, Praktische",Caption
"Asthetik (Style in the technical and tectonic arts; or, Practical aesthetics).",Paragraph
"We have in metal-rod construction, he noted, “a poor soil for art! There can",Paragraph
be no question of a monumental style with cast-iron rods; its very ideal is,Paragraph
"invisible architecture! For the thinner metal is spun, the more perfect is its",Paragraph
manner.”}! Clearly Semper could not tolerate a dematerialized architecture.,Paragraph
"For him, matter carried the symbolic form of the architecture and thus con-",Paragraph
stituted a necessary precondition for the pursuit of its social function.,Paragraph
This is why Semper completely dismissed the idea that iron could engen-,Paragraph
der a new monumental architecture and warned that “the dangerous idea,Paragraph
"that iron construction, applied to monumental building, could give us a new",Paragraph
8,Caption
Introduction,Title
"architectural style has already led many talented, yet artistically estranged,",Paragraph
architects astray.”?? It is also quite certain that here Semper had in mind,Paragraph
"Henri Labrouste, whose Bibliothéque Sainte-Geneviéve in Paris he had also",Paragraph
explicitly criticized in his review of 1849.3,Paragraph
"Whether in the form of rods or cables, iron’s unfitness for monumental",Paragraph
"purposes did not mean, however, that it was unsuited for other tasks. Sem-",Paragraph
"per was fully prepared to acknowledge the possibility, for instance, of using",Paragraph
"the material for decorative purposes in latticework. In addition, he advocated",Paragraph
"the use of iron in sheet form. By that he meant “sheet beams” (Blechbalken),",Paragraph
which must always remain invisible but could play an important role in,Paragraph
bridging large spans; sheet metal used as a wall dressing or as a material in,Paragraph
"doors; and finally hollow, cast-iron forms, such as tubular columns.",Paragraph
"Moreover, iron could be used in buildings of a nonmonumental nature,",Paragraph
"in Semper’s words, “buildings of a decidedly practical purpose.” The iron",Paragraph
roof trusses of railroad stations gave him a “satisfactory impression.” In Der,Paragraph
Stil he spoke about them in an almost enthusiastic way but distinguished all,Paragraph
the more rigorously such building tasks from monumental architecture:,Paragraph
"“Let us permit and praise the visible, plain iron roof trusses of the railroad",Paragraph
engineer in terminals and other such things as symbols of their provisional,Paragraph
"nature. Spare us the wonders of decorated iron libraries, festival halls, and",Paragraph
the like!”34 The consequence for the architect is clear: he should not yield to,Paragraph
the temptations of the material.,Paragraph
Iron: The Engineer’s Material,Title
The Gotha architect Ludwig Bohnstedt*’ reflected on the premise that archi-,Paragraph
"tects and engineers had completely different responsibilities, which in",Paragraph
"many respects could never be reconciled. This premise also influenced, as",Paragraph
"it were, his ideas on the architectural use of iron. With clear reference to",Paragraph
"Botticher’s Schinkel address of 1846, Bohnstedt thus noted in 1867 in his",Paragraph
essay “Uber die Bedeutung des Eisens fiir die Baukunst” (On the signifi-,Caption

"Yet, at the same time he recognized iron’s applicability to the construc-",Paragraph
"tions of engineers, and he even spoke of the great progress that could be",Paragraph
made when iron was used in appropriate works. The strength of the material,Paragraph
and its ease of handling were its greatest advantages. Speaking about archi-,Paragraph
"tecture, he maintained that iron was completely inappropriate for carrying",Paragraph
9,Caption
Georgiadis,Title
"the art-form because “it had to appear undisguised.” Like Bétticher, Bohn-",Paragraph
stedt was convinced of the role construction played in determining a style.,Paragraph
"He believed, however, that only stone construction (that is, the quintessen-",Paragraph
"tial architectural material) was receptive to a formal treatment, and he could",Paragraph
not imagine the possibility of forming a style without taking this into,Paragraph
"account. “Our traditional laws of style,” he wrote, “are rooted precisely in our",Paragraph
experiences with a solid material — with stone — and have been made to,Paragraph
"harmonize with it; those laws determine the fulfillment of all demands,",Paragraph
"which up to now only stone has been able to satisfy.""37 Consequently, only",Paragraph
stone was acceptable as a construction material; stone was the “autocratic,Paragraph
"tuler,” as Bohnstedt characteristically expressed it. The reason for iron’s",Paragraph
"unsuitability for architecture was its lack of corporeality, the impossibility",Paragraph
of employing it “in all dimensions.” Its volume could only expand and,Paragraph
"approach that of stone when it was shaped as a hollow body, but that would",Paragraph
contradict #ts materially appropriate use.**,Paragraph
Preliminaries Toward an Incorporeal Architectural Aesthetic,Title
The aesthetic development of iron construction was the topic of a lecture,Paragraph
"delivered in 1870 to the Berliner Architekten-Verein by Richard Lucae, archi-",Paragraph
tect of the Frankfurt Opera House. It was not the first time he addressed,Paragraph
this issue. A year earlier he had written an article for Andreas Romberg’s,Paragraph
"Zeitschrift fiir praktische Baukunst, in which he entered what was at the time",Paragraph
uncharted theoretical territory. The subject was the architectural signi-,Paragraph
"ficance of space, which the author attempted to decipher by examining",Paragraph
various architectural tasks. Among these were some that were directly,Paragraph
related to the use of iron. At the center of Lucae’s reflections was the effect,Paragraph
of space on human feelings. He saw form (understood as the relationship,Paragraph
"of spatial dimensions to one another), light, measure, and color as critical",Paragraph
factors for spatial perception as well as decisive artistic moments. Each of,Paragraph
these factors played a particular role as a component of architectural space.,Paragraph
"Thus, form was responsible for the aesthetic effect of space; light for its",Paragraph
"character; color for the specific mood produced; and, finally, measure was",Paragraph
“the spatial relation of our body to our spirit as perceived by our conscious-,Paragraph
ness.” Lucae specifically emphasized that the question of style could be,Paragraph
ignored within the framework of his theory: “Style only influences the effect,Paragraph
"of space to a very small degree.”*! He gave different explanations for this, but",Paragraph
"failed to mention the most important: namely, that his theory of space",Paragraph
removed from style (in the sense of conventional historical styles) the basis,Paragraph
10,Title
Introduction,Title
on which it had traditionally been able to work — the architectural body. And,Paragraph
it was precisely this that led him to iron construction. Thus his extreme reti-,Paragraph
cence is quite surprising in his discussion of the spatial effects of those,Paragraph
building tasks for which iron is the material of choice. Among these are the,Paragraph
"railroad station halls, in which, according to Lucae, one “had thought one",Paragraph
could do without art.”,Paragraph
Ifa meaningful thought of beauty were added to the grand constructional ideas,Paragraph
"of their roof form, then our eye might find rest and enjoyment among the con-",Paragraph
fusing web of iron bars and cables crossing each other in every direction. Then,Paragraph
"we would, figuratively speaking, not notice the individual instances of this",Paragraph
mathematical formula translated into iron and simply organize the result into,Paragraph
"an ‘easily surveyed sum, into a system appearing as beautiful form. For the",Paragraph
"purely mathematical construction is not a finished artistic achievement, but",Paragraph
only a skeleton like the one in the human body.*?,Paragraph
"Lucae, on the other hand, was utterly fascinated by the Crystal Palace,",Paragraph
which in the meantime had been rebuilt in Sydenham. He characterized the,Paragraph
"building as a “piece of sculptured atmosphere,” as a “magically poetic form",Paragraph
"of light,” and forgot, apparently out of sheer enthusiasm, about the demand",Paragraph
for a “meaningful thought of beauty.” He elaborated upon his remarks in his,Paragraph
lecture on the aesthetics of iron construction. Lucae referred to the issue as,Paragraph
"“one of the most important questions of architectural development,” in",Paragraph
order to underscore the great difficulties one encountered in surmounting,Paragraph
it. These difficulties were without exception related to the diminished bulk,Paragraph
of iron construction compared to stone construction. Lucae again used the,Paragraph
analogy of the human body: “A purely mathematical construction is as much,Paragraph
an unfinished artistic result as is the human body with its muscles and ligaments,Paragraph
"exposed, or even as its skeleton is capable of being a living creation of nature; thus",Paragraph
I maintain that the beauty of a building system is partially due to the fact,Paragraph
that there is a surplus of mass beyond the material necessary for support.”,Paragraph
Lucae thought that architects were facing a dilemma. Through its “lim-,Paragraph
"ited corporeality” iron had rid itself, “as it were, of the material by which we",Paragraph
"can display beauty.” Without an increase in iron’s dimension, it lacked the",Paragraph
"aesthetic sense conditioned by stone. Increasing its bulk, on the other hand,",Paragraph
"robbed it of its characteristic property, “namely, that it remains delicate and",Paragraph
yet still evokes the impression of strength.” Yet Lucae did not exclude the,Paragraph
possibility that “a new art-form” could arise “out of the nature of iron”;,Paragraph
Il,Title
Georgiadis,Title
"rather, he shifted its emergence into the future. His own generation was",Paragraph
denied the push toward the new art-form as well as an unbiased approach to,Paragraph
the question of iron construction: “A succeeding generation will grow up,Paragraph
"with iron construction, just as we have grown up with stone construction;",Paragraph
they will in many cases have the fully undisturbed sense of beauty that still,Paragraph
"today leaves us unfulfilled, for we feel that the tradition of beauty so dear to",Paragraph
us is under attack.”4*,Title
From this basic assessment of contemporary conditions Lucae deduced,Paragraph
the promise of a new art-form: his was a technical age rather than a reli-,Paragraph
"gious one, an age dominated by exact science and its representatives, the",Paragraph
"engineers. As a result, the hub of the new architectural aesthetics could be",Paragraph
"neither the palace nor the church, but solely utility buildings — that is,",Paragraph
"bridges and transportation buildings, the vessels of modern life.",Paragraph
~ He sought to sketch the elements of the new sense of beauty and support,Paragraph
it with his previously developed theory of space. He was thoroughly con-,Paragraph

"sine qua non, it was inconceivable without a fundamental idea of beauty.",Paragraph
Lucae was of the same opinion as Bétticher (without mentioning him by,Paragraph
name) that the roof was of decisive tectonic importance. At the same time,Paragraph
he wanted to see Bétticher’s concept of Tektonik expanded. It was one of,Paragraph
the principles of tectonics that the art-form had to explicate symbolically the,Paragraph

its original meaning as a structurally passive architectural element and is,Paragraph
here transformed into a symbol.) To this end and in order to bolster its true,Paragraph
"significance, Lucae thought it possible that the actual construction should",Paragraph
"not be visible: “As paradoxical as it might at first appear, one can only show",Paragraph
the roof if one more or less conceals it.”*,Paragraph
Lucae’s theory broke up the unity of body and space. It had still existed,Paragraph
"for Bétticher, who wrote in the preface to his Tektonik der Hellenen that “the",Paragraph

“space-creating organism” was none other than the corporeal members,Paragraph
"(membra) of that organism. In drawing upon this, he maintained in his",Paragraph
Schinkel address that the “essence of architecture resided in expanding”,Paragraph
ideas into a “corporeal-spatial entity.”,Paragraph
What is significant about Lucae’s understanding of the roof as a symbol,Paragraph
of “suspension” is that the “spatial image” in this instance no longer needs,Paragraph
the body for its support; at least Lucae in this instance refrains from refer-,Paragraph
ring to the need for corporeality. This conception comes very close to an,Paragraph
aesthetic of the noncorporeal as it was developed by later Modernists.,Paragraph
These ideas indicate the general limits within which Lucae saw the role of,Paragraph
the architect. The architect was not allowed to operate exclusively based on,Paragraph
his “constructional feeling”; he needed to collaborate with the representatives,Paragraph
"of the exact sciences. However, his specific role was indispensable. Lucae",Paragraph
"stood for the “separation of disciplines,” even though he was also convinced",Paragraph
that the architect and the engineer were working toward a common goal.,Paragraph

At the third convention of the Verband der deutschen Architekten- und,Paragraph

entitled “Uber die asthetische Behandlung des Eisen im Hochbau” (On the,Caption
aesthetic treatment of iron in architecture).* In it he attempted to articulate,Paragraph
"a modern position on this issue, a position that would be open to the most",Paragraph
recent developments. The premises upon which the science of engineering,Paragraph
produced its works were presented as follows:,Paragraph
"Among the technical sciences, the science of engineering, a pure child of our",Paragraph
"time, has forcefully stepped to the fore. Standing upon thoroughly modern,",Paragraph
"thoroughly real grounds, it aims at the fulfillment of purpose and — delegat-",Paragraph

13,Title

"But precisely only to a certain extent, for in order to evoke aesthetic plea-",Paragraph
"sure, the satisfaction of emotional requirements should be added to that of",Paragraph
intellectual ones. Lipsius believed that truth and beauty were mutually,Paragraph
"dependent, yet a truth oriented merely to purpose such as that expressed in",Paragraph
the works of engineers is not sufficient for a work of art. The real truth must,Paragraph
be supplemented by an ideal truth. And this is precisely the domain of the,Paragraph
"architect, whose task it is to endow the ideal with artistic form.",Paragraph
Lipsius warned all those who were “promising to themselves the blos-,Paragraph
"soming of a new, unique art from the use of iron” against exaggerated expec-",Paragraph

added (in following Semper) that its particular architectural dressing did,Paragraph
"not yet exist. Yet, during the process of its formation one could not deny a",Paragraph
certain importance to the emerging technical possibilities corresponding to,Paragraph
the use of the new materials — naturally presuming that its aesthetic imple-,Paragraph
mentation be successful.,Paragraph
"Returning to the original question of the aesthetic treatment of iron,",Paragraph
Lipsius then explained that he did not mean its use as a constructional aid,Paragraph
but its appearance as an independent organism. He first of all drew a sharp,Paragraph
distinction between wrought and cast iron. To the former he attributed no,Paragraph
significance for monumental architecture beyond its use in the manu-,Paragraph
facture of light latticework. The slight volume of wrought iron lagged,Paragraph
behind its actual capacity for carrying a load. With cast iron it was dif-,Paragraph
"ferent; when formed as a hollow body, it assumed a “corporeality in this",Paragraph
"manner of presentation similar to that of stone, the monumental building",Paragraph
material par excellence.” It was suitable for both columns and trusses and,Paragraph
also for the construction of roofs. The important thing was to make the,Paragraph
cast iron itself recognizable and visible. Only in this way could “the pos-,Paragraph
sibility of a building’s solidity” be visually understood and its “factual,Paragraph
reality” explained. The same was true for the connections between the indi-,Paragraph
vidual constructional members and for the connections between supporting,Paragraph
"and supported parts. In the discussion of roofs, whose importance he (like",Paragraph
"Botticher) stressed, Lipsius praised the achievements of Labrouste (refer-",Paragraph
ring to the Bibliothéque Nationale in Paris) and Félix Duban (referring to,Paragraph
"the roofing of the inner court of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts), and he praised",Paragraph
one of the iron designs presented by Eugéne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc in,Paragraph
his Entretiens.,Paragraph
Lipsius’s concept of the “aesthetic treatment of iron” remained fixed to,Paragraph
the tectonics of stone construction. Iron appeared as a substitute for stone;,Paragraph
14,Title
Introduction,Title
iron construction was nothing more and nothing less than a stone building,Paragraph
with emaciated contours.,Paragraph
Although the display of iron construction for Lipsius was an essential,Paragraph
"precondition for its aesthetic effect, its appearance belonged merely to the",Paragraph
"preliminary stages of the architectural work of art, which he viewed as",Paragraph
the aesthetic embodiment of an architectural idea beyond construction.,Paragraph
The aesthetic realm remained the exclusive domain of the architect. Thus,Paragraph
the goals of the architect and the engineer were in his view widely divergent.,Paragraph

From Invisibility to Monumentality,Title
At the tenth annual meeting of the Verband der deutschen Architekten-,Paragraph
"und Ingenieur-Vereine, in 1892, the architect Hubert Stier delivered a lec-",Paragraph
ture entitled “Riickblick auf die Entwicklung der deutschen Architektur in,Paragraph
den letzten 50 Jahren” (Retrospective of German architectural development,Title
in the last fifty years}.°° Referring to the question of the architectural use,Paragraph
"of iron, he spoke of two phases during this period. In Stier's words, the first",Paragraph
phase began “with the use of iron mainly as cast iron for decorative pur-,Paragraph
"poses instead of wrought iron, whose treatment had been forgotten: there",Paragraph
was at that time hardly a glimmer of understanding of iron’s importance,Paragraph
"for constructional purposes.”*! The entire first phase, which according to",Paragraph
"Stier lasted until 1872, was admittedly characterized by an increasing use",Paragraph
"of iron, “but primarily only as a constructional aid under the sheathing",Paragraph
and veiling of another material. No one had the courage to display it,Paragraph
"openly. One wrote about its aesthetic treatment, but no one attempted such",Paragraph
treatment.”,Paragraph
The debate about the use of cast and wrought iron was in fact settled at,Paragraph
"the latest in the early 1880s, and indeed in favor of wrought iron. A com-",Paragraph
mentator in the Deutsche Bauzeitung noted that the hope was long gone “that,Paragraph
through cast iron one could achieve either new stylistic forms or transforma-,Paragraph
tions of certain elements of inherited stylistic forms according to time and,Paragraph
"place, such as, for instance, the Moorish.”®? Architects now favored wrought",Paragraph
"iron alone, the “so-called genuine” material.",Paragraph
"But wrought iron still posed a problem, and possibly an even greater one",Paragraph
than cast iron. One was still uncertain as to how to treat it aesthetically. Its,Paragraph
"limited corporeality or linearity offended many people, as did the “confusing",Paragraph
"number of small, crisscrossing structural parts — flat bars, angle irons,",Paragraph
15,Title
Georgiadis,Title
"round bars, and so on.’** There was a demand for visual repose, which one",Paragraph
"hoped to achieve, for instance, by using supports covered by compact deco-",Paragraph
rated walls instead of latticeworks and frames. A further nagging problem,Paragraph
was the treatment of the points at which iron joined the stone construction;,Paragraph
this problem appeared especially in cases where wrought iron by itself was,Paragraph
used to cover vast spaces.>$,Paragraph
The Cologne architect Georg Heuser also attempted to solve the trou-,Paragraph
bling problem posed by Semper and others since him — architecture’s loss,Paragraph
of corporeality through the use of iron. At the end of the 1880s and in the,Paragraph
"early 1890s, Heuser launched an extended journalistic investigation into",Paragraph
the aesthetic question of iron construction.°* He developed his position,Paragraph
"from his reading of Botticher’s Tektonik der Hellenen, Semper's Der Stil, and",Paragraph
Darwin’s theory of evolution. He was particularly interested in “compart-,Paragraph
"mented forms” (Gefachformen), that is, iron construction consisting of the",Paragraph
“flange and web” (Gurt und Steg). These elements furnished him with the,Paragraph
name of his theoretical construction: the “compartmented style” (Gefachstil).,Paragraph
Heuser proposed a three-step plan by which the dematerialized lattice-and-,Paragraph
"rod construction visually transformed itself into a mass-form, which only",Paragraph
then made possible a monumental architecture:,Paragraph
"Depending on the shape of the web, the expression of the compartmented style",Paragraph
changes as follows:,Title
1. If the web consists of the lattice-and-rod system that characterizes the “iron,Caption
"style,” then we have an invisible architecture...",Paragraph
"2. Ifthe web is a thin but generally enclosing wall, then we have a bodiless, mate-",Paragraph

"mental architecture, in which the principle of “flange and web” can be",Paragraph
"appreciated as an artistic idea, both for its stability and for its basic decora-",Paragraph
tive richness.*”,Paragraph
"In this way, Heuser traversed the path from line to surface to mass,",Paragraph
thereby intending to eliminate Semper’s reservations about iron construc-,Paragraph
tion. The only thing that seemed to remain was a convincing answer to the,Paragraph
"question of decoration. And precisely on this issue, Heuser attempted by",Paragraph
means of Darwin to confirm Bétticher’s art-form. Heuser championed the,Paragraph
"naturalistic ornament, which was applied to the technical form — the latter",Paragraph
understood as “organ projection” or the imitation of nature — and which,Paragraph
16,Title
Introduction,Title
was thus analogous to the static function of each constructional member.,Paragraph
Here the decoration was subordinate to the constructional web.,Paragraph
"Despite his very ambitious theoretical claims, in the final analysis",Paragraph
Heuser’s position remained rather conventional. The aesthetic closeness of,Paragraph
"iron and stone, which he explicitly presented as a goal, in the end amounted",Paragraph
to a perversion of the new construction.,Paragraph
Heuser’s “compartmented style” found approval and support from the,Paragraph
"architect of the Imperial Post Office in Berlin (kaiserlicher Postbaurat), Robert",Caption
"Neumann.°* In his remarks on the future architectural style, iron played an",Paragraph
extremely important role. The well-known themes were repeated in his enu-,Paragraph

"corporeality, however, its light and airy character (which did not allow the",Paragraph

"author praised Heuser’s compartmented style, he registered doubts about",Paragraph

laid down fourteen “new” formative principles by which a style allegedly,Paragraph
undergoes historical change. As soon as he started discussing iron in the,Paragraph
"conclusion, however, he fell into astonishingly conventional categories",Paragraph
of thought. He essentially repeated the reproach of “bodilessness” and,Paragraph
expanded it by claiming that no decorative forms could be developed from,Paragraph
wrought iron and therefore an aesthetic treatment was hardly possible. He,Paragraph
also rejected the connection between iron and stone as a basis for the devel-,Paragraph

"never offer sufficient form. Therefore, stone must, as before, be the sole vehicle",Paragraph
for such a style.,Paragraph
The defense of stone against iron led many writers into theoretical,Paragraph
"sophistry, to claims that could not stand up to even elementary historical or",Paragraph
factual review. One such example was given by the editor of the Deutsche,Paragraph
"Bauzeitung, K. E. O. Fritsch.",Caption
Fritsch delivered the keynote address at the ninth annual meeting of the,Paragraph
Verband der deutschen Architekten- und Ingenieur-Vereine in Hamburg in,Caption
August 1890. He was interested in stylistic changes in contemporary,Paragraph
"architecture; however, he placed the theme within the historical perspective",Paragraph
"of architectural development since the Enlightenment. According to Fritsch,",Paragraph
the first phase of this period was characterized by the “idealism” of early,Paragraph
historicism. Around 1850 this was replaced by an increasingly realistic atti-,Paragraph
"tude, due in part to the significant impact of Gottfried Semper. The “real-",Paragraph
ism” of the second phase consisted of different styles. Fritsch listed them —,Paragraph
"Hellenistic, Renaissance, northern Renaissance, Baroque, Empire, Gothic,",Paragraph
Romanesque — and did not conceal his preference for the Neoromanesque;,Paragraph
yet he came to the conclusion that none of the currently used styles could,Paragraph
"claim absolute validity. In closing, he expressed the wish for a new style,",Paragraph
which he was inclined to see as a welding together of all historical styles. In,Paragraph
"this connection, he also spoke of the “iron style.” Fritsch emphatically",Paragraph
"rejected the idea that this could become the future style, as had been said",Paragraph
everywhere since the Paris World Exhibition of 1889: “I must confess to,Paragraph
being a stubborn heretic on this point. For such a belief seems to me to be,Paragraph
18,Title
Introduction,Title
not only an extreme overestimation but above all a complete misjudgment,Paragraph
of the significance of iron for architecture.”,Paragraph
Fritsch’s attack was directed at none other than Bétticher and his,Paragraph
Schinkel address of 1846. Fritsch rejected Bétticher’s thesis that the roofing,Paragraph
system was the historical motor of architectural change —a thesis from,Paragraph
which the latter had concluded that iron would be of decisive importance for,Paragraph
a future style. Fritsch held that the wall rather than the roof was the decisive,Paragraph
"element. From this perspective, the history of architecture recognized two",Paragraph
"main groups of styles. He called them, respectively, “scaffold styles,” which",Paragraph
"derived from the craftsmanship of carpentry, and “mass styles,” which",Paragraph
"derived from masonry. In ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, in Rome and in",Paragraph
"the early Middle Ages, and also during the Renaissance and the Baroque,",Paragraph
mass styles were practiced without exception. Ancient Greek and the Gothic,Paragraph
"architecture, on the other hand, were scaffold styles. In the period immedi-",Paragraph
"ately after the Enlightenment, the scaffold style became the foundation of",Paragraph
architectural activity. Fritsch saw this simply as an enfeeblement and gave,Paragraph
the following explanation:,Paragraph
"The reason, however, that the stylistic experiments that started more than a",Paragraph
hundred years ago were oriented primarily toward the two scaffold styles —,Paragraph
"Greek and Gothic art—is simply that these styles, as opposed to the mass",Paragraph
"styles, had a canon. However, the canon yields to a certain extent because it is",Paragraph
"necessary to let the architectural scaffold appear; the mass style, on the other",Paragraph
"hand, allows considerably more freedom to the individual sentiment of the",Paragraph
artist. Weaker talents are thus always more comfortable employing a scaffold,Paragraph
"style, and it was also inevitable than an age that demanded, above all, firm prin-",Paragraph
ciples for artistic activity eagerly reached for them.®,Paragraph
"It is surprising, in fact, that the realist Fritsch praised artistic individual-",Paragraph
ity and clearly renounced the idea of architectural normativity. The upshot of,Paragraph
his analysis was that the artistic freedom he so desired could be attained,Paragraph
"only through the material that permitted the effect of mass, in short, stone.",Paragraph
Iron merely permitted a scaffold construction. In order to be able to argue,Paragraph
"against iron, Fritsch, as expected, quoted Semper: iron offered “a poor soil",Paragraph

upheavals caused by the intellectual and material conditions of the time.,Paragraph
"The author's conclusion, based on an anatomy of the contemporary zeit-",Paragraph
"geist, is that under the new conditions, the advance of the engineer seemed",Paragraph
"not only plausible but an outright necessity. “Everything is in transition,”",Paragraph
"wrote Hofmann, “and this ongoing transition is at the same time economic,",Paragraph

"worldview was in the process of disintegration, induced by the pressures of",Paragraph
"the “positivism of science,” the “nihilism of intellectuals,” and the “material-",Paragraph

Implicit in these statements is the question of the aesthetics of engineer-,Paragraph

representative of a scientific art.” “Hellenism is out of the question for the,Paragraph
"German nation,” Gurlitt continued: he explained this by the extinction of the",Paragraph
“rationalism of art.” He then announced prophetically that “the days of indi-,Paragraph
"vidualism will dawn again!”*? What Gurlitt did in 1890 with Bétticher, he",Paragraph
repeated ten years later with Semper. He maintained that “Semper’s entire,Paragraph
theory of style” was demolished because we have ceased to comprehend,Paragraph
the symbolic content of a work of art as the “application of stylistic forms.”,Paragraph
He attached to his criticism against Semper his disagreement with Otto,Paragraph
Wagner's thesis that in architecture the art-form gradually arose out of the,Paragraph
work-form. This criticism implied the view that the work-form by itself,Paragraph
already possessed both aesthetic and symbolic relevance (arising from,Paragraph
Gurlitt’s criticism of Semper).,Paragraph
"For Gurlitt, the new paradigm was Japanese art, whose forms “are simply",Paragraph
"developed from laws of utility and are yet undeniably artistic.” Moreover,",Paragraph
"they can convey symbolic content. This is the basis on which Gurlitt, so to",Paragraph
"speak, integrated the forms “invented by engineers” into the realm of art.",Paragraph
He vehemently opposed the view that “the work of the mathematically,Paragraph
inclined engineer was inherently inartistic” and that consequently the archi-,Paragraph
"tect has “to make forms intelligible through art.” Straightforward design,",Paragraph
"practical planning, and simple and purposive execution suffice to character-",Paragraph
ize a building as beautiful. Even the general population understands this.,Paragraph
Naturally this explanation brought Gurlitt into conflict with his earlier criti-,Paragraph
cism of Bétticher and his alleged “scientific art.” For the beauty of which,Paragraph
"Gurlitt himself spoke, as he conceded, was a pure product of mathematical",Paragraph
"calculation. Be that as it may, Gurlitt’s contribution is typical of the new",Paragraph

ideas that had now entered the debate. The magical words “utility.” “Sach-,Paragraph
"lichkeit” (architectural realism), and “purposiveness” — with all of their",Paragraph
implications ~ now set the tone.,Paragraph
"Hermann Muthesius, for example, emphasized in his famous book Stil-",Paragraph
architektur und Baukunst (Style-architecture and building-art) that modern,Paragraph
architecture had to conform to the new economic and transportational,Paragraph
"conditions, to the new constructional principles, and to the new materials.",Paragraph
"He praised the architecture of iron and glass, the works of Paxton and",Paragraph
"Labrouste, the Eiffel Tower and Galerie des Machines of the Paris World",Caption
"Exhibition of 1889, and finally Alfred Messel’s Wertheim Department Store",Paragraph
(1898) in Berlin. But somewhat later in the text he explicitly deduced from,Paragraph
"these givens the signs of a new style, indeed, with a wording that fully",Paragraph
endorsed Gurlitt’s conceptualization:,Paragraph
If we wish to seek a new style — the style of our time — its characteristic features,Paragraph
are to be found much more in those modern creations that truly serve our,Paragraph
newly established needs as for example in our railway terminals and exhibition,Paragraph
"buildings, in very large meeting halls, and further, in the general tectonic",Paragraph
"realm, in our large bridges, steamships, railway cars, bicycles, and the like. It is",Paragraph
precisely here that we see embodied truly modern ideas and new principles of,Paragraph
"design that demand our attention. Here we notice a rigorous, one might say",Paragraph
"scientific objectivity [Sachlichkeit], an abstention from all superficial forms of",Paragraph
"decoration, a design strictly following the purpose that the work should serve.",Paragraph
"All things considered, who would deny the pleasing impression of the broad",Paragraph
"sweep of an iron bridge? Who is not pleased by today’s elegant landau, trim",Paragraph
"warship, or light bicycle?",Paragraph
"Muthesius returned to the theme of iron construction in an essay of 1913,",Paragraph
published in the yearbook of the Deutscher Werkbund.* His position was,Paragraph
different from that of 1904 in that he now no longer traced the cause of,Paragraph
aesthetic feeling (the pleasing impression) experienced through technical,Paragraph
"form to the fulfillment of practical purpose. He argued, like Hofmann in",Paragraph
"1893, that a certain sense of form contributed to the technical form of iron",Paragraph
"construction and that it, essentially, helped to shape the appearance of iron.",Paragraph
He was even more specific in linking this sense of form to an “aesthetic sub-,Paragraph
"consciousness,” which was active in every human form, such as the “produc-",Paragraph
"tion of instruments, building, and constructional activity.” As he noted,",Paragraph
"“Even if the producer aimed only at purposive reason, we could claim that",Paragraph
25,Title
Georgiadis,Title
"he has also been influenced by considerations about form, even if only",Paragraph
through an unfelt aesthetic ‘subconsciousness.’”®,Paragraph
Muthesius now gave an unequivocally negative answer to the question,Paragraph
"that Hofmann left unanswered in 1893, namely, whether purposiveness and",Paragraph
beauty are mutually dependent. “It is a false idea that an engineer is entirely,Paragraph
"pleased when a building, an instrument, a machine that he creates satisfies",Paragraph
a purpose; still more erroneous is the recently often-heard proposition that,Paragraph
"if it fulfills a purpose, it is also beautiful. Utility in and of itself has nothing",Paragraph
to do with beauty.”8°,Paragraph
"And precisely because they are independent of one another, it is neces-",Paragraph
sary to weld them together. This synthesis does not take place when the,Paragraph
architect beautifies the exterior of an engineer's work. The sense of form has,Paragraph
to contribute at the outset to the transformation of the purposive idea that,Paragraph
"supports the object, as a kind of controlling device. The logical conclusion is",Paragraph
that Muthesius did not make any distinction between the works of engi-,Paragraph
"neers and of architects, and in this he once again distanced himself from",Paragraph
Hofmann’s position of 1893.,Paragraph
Muthesius consequently rejected the notion that the works of engineers,Paragraph
were ugly and that beauty was therefore the province solely of the architect.,Paragraph
He distanced himself from Semper’s criticism of iron construction. Accord-,Paragraph
"ing to Muthesius, “massive” stone architecture, which contrasted with iron’s",Paragraph
"“invisible architecture,” was nothing more than an ideal formed by a habit",Paragraph
and brought about by the fact that one had always built with materials that,Paragraph
"seemed massive. Yet, this should in no way be taken as an absolute ideal.",Paragraph
"Incidentally, Hofmann had by 1907 reached a view very similar to that",Paragraph
expressed in Muthesius’s text of 1913. He spoke of a necessary “spiritualiza-,Paragraph
"tion of matter,” an operation that already participated in the conception of",Paragraph
the building and that transcended the simple consideration of purpose.,Paragraph
Parallel to this he stressed that “we expect from engineering the enrichment,Paragraph
"of art through new forms and new designs, as external expressions of a new",Paragraph
power inherent in the human intellect and its productions.”®”,Paragraph
An argument similar to that presented by Muthesius in his book of 1902,Paragraph
"was put forward by Friedrich Naumann, the other spiritual father of the",Paragraph
"Deutscher Werkbund. He, too, fought against the belated artistic treatment",Paragraph
"of purposive form and believed that because of its purposiveness, such form",Paragraph
"was already beautiful. Concerning iron construction, he wrote: “Here art is",Paragraph
"not practiced alongside construction: no pasted-on decoration, no simple",Paragraph
"curlicues; here creation is for a purpose, and form is born like a child",Paragraph

Introduction,Title
unplanned by its parents.” Naumann thereby indicated the aesthetic,Paragraph
"unconditionality of engineered form, and hence its actual detachment from",Paragraph
any genealogical connection to the discipline of architecture. He then plasti-,Paragraph
cally described the emancipation of technical form from its incapacitation,Paragraph
by historical architecture —an emancipation that heralded a new era of,Paragraph
"civilization. In another passage, Naumann simply referred to this era as the",Paragraph
“iron age.”,Paragraph
Untold potential exists here. All the old concepts of space are shifting. Relations,Paragraph
of support and load have changed. To let huge vaults rest virtually on points is,Paragraph
"something so new that the architect, as if ashamed of his youthful strength, still",Paragraph
"often finds false piers necessary. Out of a kind of timidness, iron buildings are",Paragraph
still given stone vestibules. Yet the magic of the new art resides precisely in this,Paragraph
quiet and yet so happy emergence from the forest of the past.5?,Caption
In the first years of the new century Heinrich Pudor also published a,Paragraph
series of essays on iron construction ~-- mainly in the journal Der Architekt,Caption
"as well as in a separate brochure of 1904, entitled Die neue Architektur.°°",Paragraph
He causally deduced the aesthetic effect of a technical object (whether a,Paragraph
machine or an iron construction) from the form's immediate accord with its,Paragraph
practical purpose. The basis of aesthetics was the fulfillment of this purpose,Paragraph
with the minimum means. For Pudor “means” signified above all the mate-,Paragraph
rial necessary in the production of the object. He thus expected an enhance-,Paragraph
"ment of the aesthetic effect through a reduction of the material expended,",Paragraph
understandably with a concomitant enhancement of the quality of the mate-,Paragraph
"rial, which he understood as durability and efficiency. He called this the",Paragraph
"“material style,” noting that it “frees us from superfluous decoration and",Paragraph
"ornament and combines beautiful purposive form with beautiful material,”",Paragraph
and that it “constitutes the modern form of expression not only in the,Paragraph
"applied arts but also in commercial art and industry, and likewise in archi-",Paragraph
tecture and engineering.”™!,Paragraph
"To support his thesis, Pudor used a biological analogy. He criticized every",Paragraph
attempt to imitate stone architecture in iron construction and contrasted it,Paragraph
"with the ideal of an “airy,” frame-and-skeletal, iron architecture. He spoke of",Paragraph
"the “architectural revolution” in progress, made possible by iron. [t unfolded",Paragraph
"in two phases: “Here, too, the first period is characterized by the fact that",Paragraph
"one was ashamed of iron construction and tried to conceal it from view,",Paragraph
"whereas in the second period, whose beginning is marked by the Eiffel",Paragraph
27,Title
Georgiadis,Title
"Tower, its naked beauty is exposed to view.’ In general, the Eiffel Tower was",Paragraph
of paradigmatic importance to him. It signaled a historical epoch that was,Paragraph
just beginning.,Paragraph
"In the essay “Asthetik des Eisens” (The aesthetics of iron), Wilhelm",Paragraph
Freiherr von Tettau also occupied himself with the well-known prob-,Paragraph
lematics: “Should technically perfect expression be identical with artistically,Paragraph
"perfect expression?” Not quite, was his answer, for this overlooked the",Paragraph
actual distinction between science and art. In structural processes the,Paragraph
"“power of inner forces” was active, and this was precisely what should be",Paragraph
brought out and articulated. This was the task of art. The inner tension car-,Paragraph
ried to the surface appeared as an interplay of concealment and pronounce-,Paragraph
"ment, and was “a matter only of artistic tact.” That which was statically",Paragraph
incomprehensible could be made more apparent to the spectator through,Paragraph
"artistic expression. Only through this was aesthetic pleasure possible, for",Paragraph
“I am convinced that aesthetic pleasure is increased with greater compre-,Paragraph
hension of the system.”™,Paragraph
Contradiction,Title
These views could not be established without being contested. Richard,Paragraph
"Streiter, for instance, expressed grave doubts. In his book Architektonische",Paragraph
"Zeitfragen (Contemporary architectural questions),°> which was conceived as",Paragraph
"a critique of Otto Wagner's Moderne Architektur, he nevertheless took posi-",Paragraph
tions on all the important themes of the contemporary architectural debate.,Paragraph
He summarized the discussion on iron construction since Bétticher —,Paragraph
rejecting both the latter's prediction that a “new realm of art-forms” could be,Paragraph
expected from the new constructional material and Wagner's statement,Paragraph
“that wherever art has shaped this material completely new forms have in,Paragraph
fact appeared. Thus it has provided one of the greatest impulses to the,Paragraph
"growth of the new style!""®° Finally, Streiter also called to account Heuser's",Paragraph
“compartmented style.”,Paragraph
Not only was Streiter’s own position characterized by the idea of the rela-,Paragraph
"tive autonomy of artistic form from technical form, but he even gave the",Paragraph
former unequivocal preference. Although he accepted the possibilities,Paragraph
advanced by the new technical means — he described the extensive use of,Paragraph
iron as a building material as “the greatest constructional achievement of,Paragraph
the modern age” — he was also convinced “that the new technology will not,Paragraph
"generate a new style, but that a certain sense of form will artistically develop",Paragraph
the new technology in this or that way.”*” Streiter had some doubt as to,Paragraph
28,Title
Introduction,Title
"whether this was indeed possible with iron, that is, whether it lent itself to",Paragraph
artistic treatment or at least allowed such treatment. His response to this,Paragraph
"question was similar to Semper’s argument, but it also combined various",Paragraph
other arguments critical of the architectural use of iron into a platform for,Paragraph
"its rejection. Understandably, the defense of the architectural body, the sine",Paragraph
"qua non of architecture's artistic effect, assumed center stage.",Paragraph
"Wherever iron structures of significant dimension stand visible and alone, their",Paragraph
absolute resistance to artistic design becomes apparent. The hope that the,Paragraph
future will bring the solution to something not yet achieved can certainly be,Paragraph
described as illusory. For the possibility of developing an iron construction,Paragraph
"through a structural-symbolic shaping of the whole, and especially of the parts,",Paragraph
into a no longer abstract-rigid system but into a concrete-living structural,Paragraph
"organism, one whose members by the expression of their corporeality allow us",Paragraph
to feel immediately their cooperation in a “happy state of equilibrium” — this,Paragraph
single possibility of the tectonic “idealization” of the work-form is precluded,Paragraph
by the nature of the material and by the nature of its assembly. The fleshless,Paragraph
thinness and stiff tediousness of structural parts; the system's adherence to,Paragraph
structural calculation; the external uniformity of the elements that in general,Paragraph
disallows recognizing the differences of their load (resistance to tension or,Paragraph
"compression); the confusing quantity of crisscrossing, almost incorporeal lines",Paragraph
"in large constructions, whose sense and purpose can be understood only by a",Paragraph
technically trained reasoning but not by simple feeling: all this makes iron con-,Paragraph
"struction appear indifferent to us — even though, it must be admitted, there is",Paragraph
often a certain aesthetic charm in the overall contour of such works (arched,Paragraph
"bridges, the Eiffel Tower) or in the effect of the enormous interiors they make",Paragraph
possible. Yet even the grandest iron structure will not succeed in evoking an,Paragraph
"important, profound, and truly artistic mood.%*",Paragraph
Opposition to iron construction was voiced not just by those who wanted,Paragraph
to bring the institution of architecture (with its basic aesthetic assumptions,Paragraph
and normative positions) safely into the new century. Opposition also came,Paragraph
"from those movements forming at the turn of the century that, on the one",Paragraph
"hand, turned against the stylistic variety of eclecticism and, on the other",Paragraph
"hand, perceived the progressive modernization of society and its thorough-",Paragraph

that was deployed as a polar opposite to the doctrines of historical architec-,Paragraph

development. He could not foresee the sharpness of the conflict.,Paragraph
"Only one year after Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, in 1909, had described",Paragraph
the beauty of Nike of Samothrace coming to a wretched end in a collision,Paragraph

Introduction,Title
"to his book, “that nowadays, from early childhood onward, technology is",Paragraph
more important than Plato.” Lux explained why this is so a little later on with,Paragraph
the statement that “two worlds are sharply contrasted.” The world of tech-,Paragraph
"nology that Lux supported arose independently, even in opposition to any",Paragraph
"tradition, in the sense of interrupting historical lines of continuity. For halfa",Paragraph
century theorists had been grappling with the idea of making a start at the,Paragraph
"“artistic transfiguration” of technical form, in order — as one hoped — to",Paragraph
save the inherited ideal of beauty from the avalanche of advancing technol-,Paragraph
"ogy. To Lux, this idea had become obsolete.",Paragraph
"Should technology, which is completely a child of our time, now wear the old",Paragraph
"fashions and tailor the old, bygone styles to its youthful, gigantic body? Should",Paragraph
it dress like a great-grandmother? It is a healthy instinct to reject altogether this,Paragraph
retrogression toward old motifs. Artistic form must be discovered anew from the,Paragraph
new elements. This is the problem on which we are all working.,Paragraph
"Lux explicitly presented the demand for a “new architecture,” whose",Paragraph
seeds “resided in the technical field.” Its forms would be borne by a new aes-,Paragraph
thetics; its name would be “engineering aesthetics.” The paradigm to which,Paragraph
it had to conform consisted of the products of modern machine technology:,Paragraph
"“Our culture is not reflected in the architecture but rather in the vehicles, in",Paragraph
"modern transportation technology. If we inquire about the style of our time,",Paragraph
here we have it.”!%5,Paragraph
"In positing the imperative of the new style, Lux echoed the ideas of the",Paragraph
"Deutscher Werkbund, of which he was a member until 1908. Sachlichkeit",Paragraph
"and purposive perfection were thus the leading concepts or, in his words,",Paragraph
the “supreme principles.” Lux again asked whether purposiveness and,Paragraph
beauty were mutually conditioned. He saw their harmony as the realization,Paragraph
not only of an aesthetic principle but even more that of an “ethical princi-,Paragraph
"ple.” Truthfulness and solidity release aesthetic feelings, he thought, and the",Paragraph
"more purely and completely they were expressed, the more satisfactory",Paragraph
would be their effect. Lies and masquerades were in this sense rejected; they,Paragraph
were even seen as hateful. It is precisely these principles that Lux projected,Paragraph
"onto the new architecture of iron, “which impressed the modern time with",Paragraph
"its distinct stamp of style.” Iron was “style-forming,” whereas stone killed",Paragraph
"every new formal idea. The architecture of iron was “unconditional,” and the",Paragraph
personality that embodied the new spirit in architecture was not that of the,Paragraph
architect but that of the engineer. Lux affirmed that “the engineer is the real,Paragraph

"unconditional form, on the other hand, he did not want to break definitively",Paragraph
with the idea of the creative act or with the notion of genius that belonged to,Paragraph
"idealistic aesthetics. Moreover, he was not convinced that the conditions of",Paragraph
beauty were set principally by technical form: “Thus we should not give,Paragraph
credence to the false view that technical genius works without regard to,Paragraph
"aesthetics or, if you will, artistic appearance. Many structures and machines",Paragraph
owe their form not to mere mathematical calculation but to a certain kind of,Paragraph
"experience, which offers the design of certain parts to the sense of form.”""”",Paragraph
This sense of form admittedly has nothing at all to do with any “stylistic-,Paragraph
"historical influence” but is the result, as Lux timidly notes, of a certain",Paragraph
"“presentiment of form.” In conceiving technical form, the engineer proceeds",Paragraph
"approximatively, and precisely this fact provides the channels through",Paragraph
which a “sense for a certain exterior harmony” can prevail.,Paragraph
Lux admittedly did not go so far as to propose a grammar of engineered,Paragraph
"form, but he nevertheless roughly sketched the formal characteristics of",Paragraph
"iron construction. In the process, he reinterpreted in a positive way all the",Paragraph
reproaches that had been made against the works of engineers during sixty,Paragraph
years of debate. Thus the antimonumental effect of iron construction,Paragraph
"became one of its greatest virtues, the inclination toward “dematerializa-",Paragraph
"tion” its supreme law, and so on. In contrast to stone architecture, the goal",Paragraph
"of which was the creation of spatial enclosures, iron construction was a",Paragraph
"matter “of mere linear contours, of the fleshless skeleton or the open frame,",Paragraph
"in short, the support that transmits the energies and represents lines of",Paragraph
"force.” Like Hofmann before him, Lux emphasized the linearity of iron",Paragraph
construction as the essential mark of its aesthetic effect. Through this arose,Paragraph
"“new spatial images.” He declined to expand on this statement, but he",Paragraph
stressed that the perception of the beauty of iron construction demanded a,Paragraph
“new eye.”,Paragraph
Lux also discussed ferroconcrete — warning against it rather than approv-,Paragraph

jeopardized by the fact that ferroconcrete reintroduced corporeality into,Paragraph

which appeared three years after his death and was planned as the first part,Paragraph

incomplete (a supplementary final chapter was added by Tettau}.,Paragraph
"Meyer's enterprise was twofold. First, he attempted to explain theoreti-",Paragraph
"cally the special features of iron construction, accompanied by reflections",Paragraph
"on its aesthetics, Second, he intended to deduce historically the beginnings",Paragraph
of iron construction and its further development. The fulfillment of this last,Paragraph
"task, which Tettau undertook in the added “fourth section” of the volume,",Paragraph
"entitled “Kunstformen” (Art-forms), was the least successful. It is a listing of",Paragraph
"realized iron constructions in cast iron and rolled iron, without any grand",Paragraph
theoretical claims and intentions.,Paragraph
"Regarding the origin of modern iron construction, Meyer referred to the",Paragraph
debate at the end of the eighteenth century concerning the nature of archi-,Paragraph
tecture. It had divided minds into two camps: those who held that architec-,Paragraph
"ture was a “naturalisation scientifique,” based upon mathematical rules and",Paragraph
"calculation, and those who saw it as a pure creation of artistic genius.",Paragraph
"According to Meyer, the shift occurred with Jean-Baptiste Rondelet, who",Paragraph
“treated the structural calculation for the first time as an essential part of the,Paragraph
discipline of construction.” This opened the path to iron’s use as a building,Paragraph
"material, for “the nature of iron building is based on ‘rational construction;",Paragraph
by which it is able to resist stress and strain with far less material volume,Paragraph
than any other material.”! Profiting from a new mode of building based on,Paragraph
"calculation, iron construction had contributed to its further development up",Paragraph
"to the point of perfection, that is, from calculation into formal vision. “It",Paragraph
"stands ...so to speak, just at the end of that synthetic path, in which the",Paragraph
problems of mechanics are being transposed from the realm of arithmetic,Paragraph
operations and algebraic formulae into the vision of graphic forms.”',Paragraph
Thus we may speak of an aesthetics of iron construction in two respects.,Paragraph
"Since the purpose of calculation is the building, an “inner vision” is",Paragraph
"required that is able to grasp the finished form visually before its erection, a",Paragraph
"“pictorial ‘thinking,” as Meyer calls it. “Such ‘calculation’ is then a dispos-",Paragraph
"ing of forces, in which what is sought is no longer what is numerically and",Paragraph
33,Title
Georgiadis,Title
"technically ‘rational, but rather what has the formally favorable effect.”""""! The",Paragraph
“intellectual activity of constructing” and the “sensuous imagination” are,Paragraph
joined; the intellect even surrenders to imagination.,Paragraph
"On the other hand, iron construction as a finished, built artifact affects",Paragraph
the observer in the immediate sense of an aisthesis (sensory perception).,Paragraph
"Unfortunately, Meyer very soon abandoned the epistemologically risky",Paragraph
realm of “pictorial thinking” in order to examine the aesthetics of iron con-,Paragraph
struction exclusively in the realm of perception. This posed the question of,Paragraph
the “style-forming” or “style-inhibiting” aspects of iron architecture.,Paragraph
"Meyer was of the opinion, as was August Schmarsow,!” that architecture",Paragraph
"was, above all, an art of space, and that the essential task of architectural crea-",Paragraph
tion was the design of space. The “new spatial value” that iron construction,Paragraph
yielded was therefore the foremost aspect of his consideration. He examined,Paragraph
"the Crystak Palace, built for the London World Exhibition of 1851, with this",Paragraph
in mind. Meyer shared Lucae’s enthusiasm and repeated the latter’s charac-,Paragraph
terization of the building as a “piece of sculptured atmosphere.’ He spoke,Paragraph
"of the “limitless space,” of the “bright space” that was brought about by",Paragraph
"the shadowless, glazed architecture flooded with light, which was still",Paragraph
connected ~ through its structural linearity and Owen Jones’s color treat-,Paragraph
ment — to the “realm of measures and space” (perhaps in the sense of spatial,Paragraph
"limitations). These last elements — line and color ~ were, so to speak, the",Paragraph
stylistic support for the building. Although Meyer recognized their artistic,Paragraph
"value, he maintained that they were insufficient for “space formation.” The",Paragraph
Crystal Palace’s jatticework was capable only of mere “spatial enclosure” and,Paragraph
“spatial cover.”,Paragraph
"According to Meyer, the “new width” was the second aspect of the aes-",Paragraph
"thetics of iron construction, which he described by means of the Galerie des",Paragraph
"Machines at the Paris World Exhibition of 1889. Here classical tectonics,",Paragraph
which had always presented the problem of the relation between “support,Paragraph

"design of architectural space is based on spatial division, had now become",Paragraph

Introduction,Title
The “decisive power of the line” became Meyer's third aesthetic char-,Paragraph
"acteristic of iron construction, the “new height” that it produced. Meyer",Paragraph
"investigated this aspect in the Eiffel Tower, which he characterized as “a",Paragraph
landmark in human history.” He again took up Semper’s argument about,Paragraph
the “invisible architecture” of iron and objected that the three-hundred-,Paragraph
meter-high Eiffel Tower was the most visible structure in Paris. “Invisibil-,Paragraph
"ity” was not its characteristic, but rather transparency, and he maintained",Paragraph
that this arose from the reduction of mass to surface and of surface to line.,Paragraph
"In judging it, the historical concept of style, which had developed from",Paragraph
"“other materials and other constructional achievements,” likewise failed.",Paragraph
Although Meyer stressed the Eiffel Tower’s “charm of the stupendous” and,Paragraph
"even its mysterious effect, he noted that these judgments had “nothing to",Paragraph
do...with aesthetic pleasure.” He even criticized the linear labyrinth in,Paragraph
some parts of the structure as style-inhibiting. What Meyer experienced,Paragraph
"as nonaesthetic, he actually described in terms of an aesthetics of the sub-",Paragraph
"lime. His own aesthetic view was, however, so bound by the idea of beauty",Paragraph
that he could not exploit the theoretical opportunity that he himself had,Paragraph
opened up.,Paragraph
The fourth and last part of the aesthetic tetraptychon on iron construc-,Paragraph
tion carried the title “Neue Linien” (New lines). Here the emphasis was on,Paragraph
bridge construction and the question of whether it should be classed as,Paragraph
architecture. Meyer thought that bridges did not shape space but that they,Paragraph
were “without doubt an architectural task.” The “power of the line” ex-,Paragraph
"pressed itself here in the sense of the contour of the structure, and it was at",Paragraph
the same time its most important aesthetic component.,Paragraph
Meyer's concept of architecture started with an aesthetics of space in,Paragraph
the sense of creating spatial divisions and enclosures. But he had to relin-,Paragraph
quish it piece by piece in the course of his presentation of iron construction.,Paragraph
The expectation that this process could generate a new conception of space,Paragraph
remained unfulfilled. The question of balance between “style-forming” and,Paragraph
“style-inhibiting” elements of the (no longer) new construction was not,Paragraph

The reason for this fiasco is that by the end of the first decade of the,Paragraph

subject extended beyond the narrow boundaries of this branch of knowledge,Paragraph
and could only be discussed within the framework of a discipline that,Paragraph
possessed an appropriate theoretical instrument for such a question: philo-,Paragraph
sophical aesthetics. The author criticized the notion that the aesthetic,Paragraph
pleasure of viewing a building depended on the degree of its purposive-,Paragraph
ness and on understanding the function of its parts. Muthesius provided,Paragraph
him with the argument: functional purpose was not the only critical aspect,Paragraph
of the modern designer’s work; the unconscious drive toward pleasing,Paragraph
forms should also be at work.'?5 Jordan expanded this position by main-,Paragraph
taining that between the basic structural idea and the design there is a,Paragraph
phase of “continuous selection between different possibilities.” To this he,Paragraph
"added, “Thus scientific considerations and calculations are often of little",Paragraph
help”? — implying that the constructional form cannot be accounted for,Paragraph
simply by arguments on the level of the rationality of purpose. But he rela-,Paragraph
"tivized even the thesis of “pleasing forms,” in that he asserted that the",Paragraph
aesthetic effects of iron construction did not necessarily mean that it was,Paragraph
also beautiful. “Aesthetically effective” is a much more general concept,Paragraph
than “beautiful.”?7,Paragraph
Jordan seems to have had his doubts even about the harmonious effect,Paragraph
{as a condition of beauty) of iron construction. Harmony was “unity in mul-,Paragraph
"tiplicity,” he noted, and from this position he compared the machine form",Paragraph
with the iron structure. One could well claim that a machine or a vehicle was,Paragraph
harmonious because its design depended on the harmony of its various,Paragraph

"parts but rather very simple, clearly visible functions that could be met by a",Paragraph
"small number of structural elements. Nevertheless, one could also speak of",Paragraph
an “aesthetic effect” of iron construction that was in no way inferior to that,Paragraph
of machines. Jordan solved the apparent puzzle of this position with the,Paragraph
help of Karl Groos’s Aesthetik.,Paragraph
"In order better to explain this effect, | must again return to the book by Groos",Paragraph
that has already been mentioned several times. Among the various aesthetic,Paragraph

Georgiadis,Title
lems. The reason for this might be found in the conditions surrounding the,Paragraph
introduction of concrete as sketched by Mecenseffy. He thought that the,Paragraph
advent of this material in architecture had encountered far less resistance,Paragraph
than iron and gave two reasons for this. The first was the general condition,Paragraph
"of architecture at the time, which was characterized by “a certain feeling of",Paragraph
"unease [Katzenjammerstimmung] toward the inherited world of forms,” and",Paragraph
"the second was to be found in the properties of the new material itself,",Paragraph
"namely, concrete’s ability to adapt “to any possible formal language.” As he",Paragraph
"noted, “this coincidence appears to have been the reason that ferroconcrete",Paragraph
"was approached in a more unbiased way than, for example, its immediate",Paragraph
predecessor among the new building materials ~ iron — the appropriate,Paragraph
form for which one still struggles after heatedly today.” Mecenseffy’s per-,Paragraph
sonal view was that the promise of a new architectural style linked to the use,Paragraph
of iron had not been redeemed: “Today we still experience such forms as,Paragraph
"ugly and strange.""0! He noted that as far as the aesthetics of ferroconcrete",Paragraph
"itself were concerned, the process of producing concrete buildings (wherein",Paragraph
a formless material is stamped into forms) “imposed on the architect an,Paragraph
extensive self-denial” because the forms permitted only “fairly meager geo-,Paragraph
metrical surfaces and bodies.”,Paragraph
The same view was represented a few years earlier by the Austrian archi-,Paragraph
"tect of the courts of law in Salzburg and Brno, Alexander von Wielemans, at",Paragraph
"the seventh International Congress of Architects, 1906."" It actually seems",Paragraph
that Mecenseffy borrowed his ideas about the aesthetic design of ferro-,Paragraph
concrete largely from Wielemans’s publications. In his excellent study Con-,Paragraph
"crete, 1959, Peter Collins rightly emphasized Wielemans’s closing remarks",Paragraph
on the question of style. Wielemans noted that he was not preoccupied first,Paragraph
"and foremost with the search for a new style, for a style arose in a fairly",Paragraph

the shock of iron construction had provoked. During the year before Bauen,Paragraph
"in Frankreich was published, one of the staunchest advocates of the new",Paragraph

But corporeality was not to Giedion’s liking. He therefore gave new life,Paragraph

debt to that debate. Even the imbalance between the first part of the book (in,Paragraph
which he conceptually grasped the aesthetics of the new architecture by,Paragraph
reflecting on iron construction) and the second part (in which he applied,Paragraph
this aesthetics to buildings in ferroconcrete) was a clear reflection of the,Paragraph
German debate.,Paragraph
That kind of connection between building in iron (the creations of the,Paragraph
engineers of the nineteenth century) and building in ferroconcrete (the,Paragraph
works of architects from Auguste Perret via Tony Garnier to Le Corbusier,Caption
and “the next generation”) is the new element in Bauen in Frankreich. This,Paragraph
"fact becomes especially clear if one compares it to another book, which",Paragraph
appeared at almost the same time as Giedion’s and which also had as its,Paragraph
object the architectural possibilities of ferroconcrete: Julius Vischer and,Paragraph
Ludwig Hilberseimer’s Beton als Gestalter (Concrete as shaper of form).,Paragraph
The introductory text by Hilberseimer admittedly established a connection,Paragraph
"between the iron skeleton and the ferroconcrete skeleton, as when he referred",Paragraph
"to them as two methods of scaffolding construction. Yet, when it comes to",Paragraph
"the architectural design of ferroconcrete, this connection appears largely",Paragraph
"without background, as a type of parthenogenesis.1%°",Paragraph
"Giedion’s historical operation is not without problems. Aesthetically, he",Paragraph

tions about the typographic design. Giedion’s contribution took the form of,Paragraph
layout sketches from his own hand (see Appendix). The book was finally,Paragraph
"printed during the last days of May, and an edition of three thousand copies",Paragraph
was published at the beginning of June.,Paragraph
"Bauen in Frankreich, Bauen in Eisen, Bauen in Eisenbeton met with a",Paragraph
mainly positive response. People were especially impressed by its catchy,Paragraph
"design, its wealth of illustrations, and its striking textual commentary. A few",Paragraph
aspects appear to have played a special role in its reception. Thus several,Paragraph
reviewers saw the book as a rehabilitation of the nineteenth century. “When,Paragraph
"someone like Giedion places the accents correctly,” wrote C. O. Jatho, “one",Paragraph
arrives at a fuller appreciation of the much-maligned nineteenth century.”,Paragraph
"Reading the book in a similar way, Karl With maintained that the new archi-",Paragraph
“tecture with respect to “the construction problem already is a ‘legitimate,Paragraph
part’ of the development of the nineteenth century.”* The anonymous,Paragraph
commentator from the Dresdner Zeitung spoke of a “new discovery of the,Paragraph
nineteenth century in a field... that is generally despised: that of architec-,Paragraph
ture.”*7 And Alfred Gellhorn even characterized the book as a “clearance of,Paragraph
the nineteenth century’s name.”!%*,Paragraph
"A series of reviewers stressed the relevance of the topic, above all, with",Paragraph
respect to the lack of assent still plaguing the new architecture. Gustav Stotz,Paragraph
thus noted:,Title
"Giedion uncovered . . . the basis of a tradition, which may be described as the only",Paragraph
"true one for our contemporary architecture, whose decisive forms are being",Paragraph
created in iron and concrete. The book gains enormous relevance and liveliness,Paragraph
through the way it reveals the connections and relations between the constructive,Paragraph
efforts of the previous century and the modern efforts in the field in question. '©,Paragraph
Curt Glaser wrote that Giedion’s book shows that the new architecture,Paragraph
"“did not spring arbitrarily from the brain of a few artistic revolutionaries,",Paragraph
"but rather had been prepared for a long time.”'”° “After reading this book,”",Paragraph
"declared Peter Meyer, “no one will again be able to dismiss modern archi-",Paragraph

the further development of “industrialized architecture” in France and,Paragraph

became the occasion to denounce the backwardness of the German scene.,Paragraph
"This was the case with Paul Klopfer, whose main assault was aimed at the",Paragraph
advocates of the Heimatschutz.'”,Paragraph
Some critics stressed the imbalance between the two parts of the book.,Paragraph
The chapter on iron generally came off better than that on ferroconcrete.,Paragraph

"retth as a whole. The viewpoints varied from critic to critic. Leo Adler, for",Paragraph
"instance, reproached Giedion for having fallen into the very difficulty he",Paragraph
professed to criticize: aestheticism. Because he polemicized against stylistic,Paragraph
"romanticism, he closed his eyes to the romanticism of twentieth-century",Paragraph
"engineers, as realized, for instance, by Gropius in the Bauhaus in Dessau.",Paragraph
Adler characterized the book’s passages on Le Corbusier as “pure propa-,Paragraph
ganda.”!”” Herman Sdérgel expressed this differently; he felt that the aes-,Paragraph
"thetics that Giedion derived from the materials of iron and, in particular,",Paragraph
ferroconcrete were unsuited for precisely the building task where they lay,Paragraph
claim to validity in the twentieth century — residential construction. “When,Paragraph
"Giedion speaks of the demand for flushing the new house with air, inside",Paragraph
"and out, from below (!) and above, then one can just as well say that this is",Paragraph
"precisely what the house should protect us from, for otherwise we would",Paragraph
hardly need a roof over our heads.”!78,Paragraph
But the general feeling remained positive. Prominent critics expressed,Paragraph
their enthusiasm for the book. Its modernity appeared to be the main reason,Paragraph
for its positive reception. Max Osborn thought that “this development [of,Paragraph
"modern architecture} has never been shown more concisely, more plausibly,",Paragraph
or more obviously (particularly the captioned illustrations).””° Justus Bier,Paragraph

"Despite the excellent critical reception, sales did not materialize for",Paragraph
Bauen in Frankreich. During the first month after its publication some three,Paragraph
"hundred copies were sold, but by the end of the year this number had not",Paragraph
"even tripled. The publisher, Georg Biermann, brought up these difficulties",Paragraph
in a letter to Giedion of 12 December 1928 and thought that they could be,Paragraph

Giedion replied on 29 December. He felt that the sales were depressing,Paragraph
and insisted that the book was a “decent product.” The many complimentary,Paragraph
reviews proved that. He pleaded for an intensification of advertising (“we,Paragraph
must proceed in the American fashion”) and proposed the publication of a,Paragraph
"new prospectus (figs. v, v1). As for the title, he considered a change, which",Paragraph
would be made in connection with the second edition. This would appear,Paragraph
simultaneously with a French edition of the book and would be an expanded,Paragraph
version of the original German text.'®” The title of the French edition would,Paragraph
be Lorigine de Varchitecture contemporaine (The origin of contemporary archi-,Paragraph
tecture); the German title would correspondingly be Ursprung des neuen,Paragraph
Bauens. Giedion’s proposed change indicated that he suspected the tactical,Paragraph
"problem of connecting the “new architecture” with one country (France),",Paragraph
which the book's German target audience would regard as less a prototype,Paragraph
"and more a competitor. Biermann agreed with this, apparently forgetting his",Paragraph
"old proposals for a title but not his reproaches against Giedion: “Believe me,”",Paragraph
"he wrote Giedion on 5 January 19269, “the failure of your book can only be",Paragraph
"blamed on its foolish title. No German, not even a German architect, is",Paragraph
"interested in the new architecture in France, but yes, in the most important",Paragraph
problem — building in iron and ferroconcrete. As long as this title is not,Paragraph
"changed, my feeling is that all efforts are in vain.” Biermann also insisted",Paragraph
on this view in later letters sent to Giedion.,Paragraph

Introduction,Title
Giedion applied directly to Editions Crés for the first time on 3 April,Paragraph
"1929. He referred to his correspondence with Le Corbusier who, as Giedion",Paragraph
"wrote, was the supervisor of a publication project for this publisher on the",Paragraph
"topic of “modern architecture,” in which the translation of Bauen in Frank-",Paragraph
"reich would be the first volume of a proposed series. For the French edition,",Paragraph
Giedion held out the prospect of including additional unpublished docu-,Paragraph
ments. On 8 May 1929 Giedion contacted the architect Frank Otten in,Paragraph
"Brussels, whom Alberto Sartoris recommended to him for the French trans-",Paragraph
lation.’ At the end of May Giedion traveled to France in order to discuss,Paragraph
the plans for the French edition. On 29 June 1929 he wrote to Biermann to,Paragraph
report that his discussions there had led to a proposal to publish Bauen in,Paragraph
Frankreich with the new title L’origine de l’architecture moderne. The text,Paragraph
would be expanded by twenty-four pages and the illustrations doubled. It,Paragraph
"would be the first volume of a new series, Cycle d’architecture moderne. The",Paragraph
French publisher would apparently take care of a simultaneous German edi-,Paragraph
tion. Klinckhardt & Biermann would in that case be used only for sales in,Paragraph
Germany.,Paragraph

INTRODUCTION,Title
"Even the historian stands within, not above, time. He has lost the pedestal of eternity.",Paragraph
"It is the same with poets, musicians, and architects in relation to the general public;",Paragraph
with parents and teachers in relation to children; and in the relation between man,Paragraph
and woman: we struggle on equal levels.,Paragraph
"Vital, forward-looking periods seem to have hardly a place for pedestals. We do not",Paragraph
"fear the past. Past, present, and future are for us an indivisible process. But we do not",Paragraph
"live looking backward; we live looking ahead. The past strengthens us, for it provides",Paragraph
"us with the certainty that our will is not individually confined. But the future, what-",Paragraph
"ever it may hold, is more important to us. The first concern is with those things that",Paragraph
are becoming: children are more defenseless than the old.,Paragraph
The task of the historian is first to recognize the seeds and to indicate—across all,Paragraph
"layers of debris—the continuity of development. The historian, unfortunately, has",Paragraph
used the perspective of his occupation to give eternal legitimation to the past and,Paragraph
"thereby to kill the future, or at least to obstruct its development.",Paragraph
Today the historian’s task appears to be the opposite: to extract from the vast com-,Paragraph
plexity of the past those elements that will be the point of departure for the future.,Paragraph
In every field the nineteenth century cloaked each new invention with historiciz-,Paragraph
ing masks. In the realm of architecture as well as in the realm of industry or soci-,Paragraph

"apparatus of industry was created, but every attempt was made to distort its signifi-",Paragraph
cance in that only a few were allowed to benefit from the advantages of the pro-,Paragraph
duction process.,Paragraph
This historicizing mask is inseparably linked to the image of the nineteenth century.,Paragraph
It cannot be denied. But by the same token we must not forget the forward,Paragraph
momentum that permeates the nineteenth century.,Paragraph
"If we extract from that century those elements that live within us and are alive, we",Paragraph
"see with surprise that we have forgotten our own particular development—if you will,",Paragraph
our TRADITION.,Paragraph
"Brushing away the decades of accumulated dust atop the journals, we notice that the",Paragraph
questions that concern us today have persisted in unsettled discussion for more than,Paragraph
a century.,Paragraph

the moment of the transformation from hand work to industrial production. We,Paragraph
scarcely have the right to compare our century with the nineteenth as far as the bold-,Paragraph
ness of its advance and its works are concerned.,Paragraph
The task of this generation is: to translate into a HOUSING FORM [Wohnform] what,Paragraph
"the nineteefith century could say only in abstract and, for us, internally homogenous",Paragraph
constructions. Everyone knows that we are therefore still at the very beginning of a,Paragraph
long-neglected transformation from handicraft to industrial building production.,Paragraph
The division by generations that was necessary and that we ourselves have yet,Paragraph
to complete may perhaps become more acceptable as we confront the past without,Paragraph

CONSTRUCTION,Title
Is CONSTRUCTION something EXTERNAL?,Paragraph
We are being driven into an indivisible life process. We see life more and more as a,Paragraph
moving yet indivisible whole. The boundaries of individual fields blur. Where does,Paragraph
"science end, where does art begin, what is applied technology, what belongs to pure",Paragraph
knowledge? Fields permeate and fertilize each other as they overlap. It is hardly of,Paragraph
interest to us today where the conceptual boundary between art and science is drawn.,Paragraph
We value these fields not hierarchically but as equally justified emanations of the,Paragraph
"highest impulse: LIFE! To grasp life as a totality, to allow no divisions, is",Paragraph
among the most important concerns of the age.,Paragraph
Physiologists have shown that a person’s body build and nature are inseparably con-,Paragraph
nected. Science traces specific characters back to certain bodily types. The connection,Paragraph
between respiration and mental balance has been discovered. The body takes its form,Paragraph
"internally through breathing, gymnastics, sport. To overdevelop an arm muscle, or to",Paragraph
"douse the face witli cosmetics like an isolated body (as the arteries harden), is no",Paragraph
longer acceptable.,Paragraph
Construction is also not mere ratio.! The attitude that drove the previous,Paragraph
"century to expand our knowledge of matter, so much that it resulted in a previously",Paragraph
"inconceivable command of it, is as much the expression of an instinctive drive",Paragraph
as is any artistic symbol.,Paragraph
"We say that art anticipates, but when we are convinced of the indivisibility of the life",Paragraph
"process, we must add: industry, technology, and construction also anticipate.",Paragraph
"Let us go further: architecture, which has certainly abused the name of art in many",Paragraph
"ways, has for a century led us in a circle from one failure to another.",Paragraph
Aside from a certain haut-godt charm the artistic drapery of the past century has,Paragraph
become musty. What remains unfaded of the architecture is those rare instances when,Paragraph
"construction breaks through. Construction based entirely on provisional purposes,",Paragraph
"service, and change is the only part of building that shows an unerringly consis-",Paragraph
tent development. Construction in the nineteenth century plays the role of the sub-,Paragraph
"conscious. Outwardly, construction still boasts the old pathos; underneath,",Paragraph
"concealed behind facades, the basis of our present existence is taking shape.",Paragraph
') We mean here not just the creative intuition that every great constructor must have. It is well,Paragraph
known that he fixes the dimensions mostly emotionally and that calculation often comes later only as a,Paragraph
"test. We mean construction itself, which is not determined by purpose alone, but which seems also",Paragraph
to transcend rational values and is expressive. This also challenges the old prejudice that art and con-,Paragraph
"struction may be neatly divided, by presenting art as “unintentional” and “purposeless,” and construc-",Paragraph
tion alone as “purposeful.”,Paragraph
INDUSTRY,Title
Industry completes the transition from handicraft to machine production.,Paragraph
Industry is only part of the problem connected with the transition from individual to,Paragraph
collective design.,Paragraph
"Machine work means serial design, precision. Handicraft has its own special charm",Paragraph
that can never be replaced: the uniqueness of the product.,Paragraph
But without machine work there is no higher technology. By hand one can neither,Paragraph
"mill sprocket wheels that fit frictionlessly together, nor draw out uniform wire, nor",Paragraph
profile iron precisely. The transition from individual to collective design is taking,Paragraph
"place in all fields, practical as well as spiritual ones.",Paragraph
"Now, it is the case that INDUSTRY, which is intensively involved with the life process,",Paragraph
displayed this change before other fields—private life or art—took note of it.,Paragraph
"Industry, big industry, is a result of the French Revolution.?",Paragraph

Second: life itself compels its own laws. The surface of the earth is trans-,Paragraph

Production established on a totally different basis (industry). The,Paragraph

"Indeed, in the long run, such usurpation is only mock rule; subliminally, life compels",Paragraph
"form, but there emerges an oppressive atmosphere that time and again demands",Paragraph
upheaval.,Paragraph
This is especially obvious in the field of architecture: if we employ the usual stylistic,Paragraph

throughout the last century one built with a bad conscience or with uncertainty.,Paragraph

"architecture will have advanced far enough to allow a broader survey, it may become",Paragraph

constructional soul of French architecture!,Title
France played the leading role in the history of nineteenth-century constructivism.,Paragraph
"From the beginning of the century, two poles opposed one another in France: L’Ecole",Paragraph
des Beaux-Arts—L’Ecole Polytechnique.,Paragraph
Napoleon founded the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in an unfortunate moment and,Paragraph
"thereby revived an institution of the ancien régime. By that, official architecture",Paragraph
"became a branch of the fine arts. That became its ruin. In the Baroque, this unity had",Paragraph
been complete and self-evident. But in the course of the nineteenth century it had,Paragraph
become conflicting and false. Even today the academy des Beaux-Arts proves itself to,Paragraph

Around the Ecole Polytechnique gathered the great mathematicians ([Gaspard],Paragraph

"STONE can only resist compression. It allows inert masses to be layered into piles,",Paragraph

IRON can be stretched and drawn together. It resists extension and pressure and,Paragraph

The significance of iron is: to condense high potential stress into the most minimal,Paragraph
"dimensions. If a comparison is permitted, iron suggests both muscular tissue and",Paragraph

This leads to new laws of design.,Paragraph

"cement, sand, and gravel, from an “aggregate body,” vast building complexes can",Paragraph

of iron and concrete. This insight fell to German engineers in 1880. But the decisive,Paragraph
step that would enable a new means of architectural design to arise from an ancillary,Paragraph

"Even this, like almost all enduring knowledge of our age, was not the result of fan-",Paragraph
"tastic visions—they were later consequences—but of microscopic examination. Or,",Paragraph
expressed in the more modest language of the our time—of patents.,Paragraph
In 1892 Hennebique took out a patent on “composite beams.”,Paragraph
Until then the weak point in ferroconcrete construction had been the joints: those,Paragraph
places where the ceiling merged with the beam and the beam with the supports. It,Paragraph
didn’t work there. With an appropriate placement and bending of the reinforcing,Paragraph
"iron, Hennebique succeeded in bonding the ceiling, beams, and columns into one",Paragraph
"”) To our knowledge, the first extensive use of CONCRETE occurred at the Paris Exhibition of 1867.",Paragraph
In the large ellipsoidal main building (cf. fig. 39) Coignet used concrete ceiling slabs above the cellars,Caption
of the commercial areas that were located in front of the Galerie dea Machines.,Paragraph
"7!) Francois HENNEBIQUE, who came to ferroconcrete via stone masonry and iron construction, is him-",Paragraph
self one of the first examples of an industrial building entrepreneur. Just as one had previously sold,Paragraph

continuous unit (ribbed beam). The building as monolith became possible. Isolated,Paragraph
cast-iron columns were replaced by ferroconcrete pillars. The unified frame-structure,Paragraph
emerged. The architectural imagination could move in tow of the patents. We know,Paragraph
how cumbersome this process was.,Paragraph
It is clear where this path would lead. Formerly little-noticed uprights were now,Paragraph
busily examined. In 1899 Armand Considére discovered special methods to make,Paragraph
them rigid (corded concrete). Most recently one has even succeeded in making the,Paragraph
beams —these last vestiges of timber construction— disappear: girderless ceilings! The,Paragraph
efficacy of iron radiates almost like a magnetic field over its corporeal expanse within,Paragraph

"could, it is true, attach the most outrageous facades, but its actual control, despite",Paragraph

The concrete firm is not the conventional building entrepreneur who passes the work,Paragraph
on to about fifty manual laborers and actually does nothing more than continue the,Paragraph
"medieval building production in a coarser way. Scientific, industrialized building",Paragraph
"production stands behind the concrete entrepreneur. Ferroconcrete requires this, from",Paragraph
its laboratory beginnings to the treatment demanded by the material on-site. There,Paragraph
is no other way. Here we point out its characteristics; this is not the place to expand,Paragraph
on the many shortcomings ferroconcrete still possesses today that impede its applica-,Paragraph
bility. It will hopefully not remain the only new material. To say nothing of the fact,Paragraph
that wood and iron also are about to be rediscovered.,Paragraph
What is important: to show that we find ourselves in a lawful evolution and that our,Paragraph
real tradition has gradually been formed during the last half century. In its strength,Paragraph
and depth it is comparable to any other age. Only we must place the accents correctly.,Paragraph

The church of Le Raincy (1922/23) employs the same system:” flat vaults only,Paragraph

"He is not as precise a constructor as Auguste Perret, nor do his houses display, down",Paragraph
"to the last detail, the deliberate functionality of a J[ohannes| J[acobus] P[ieter] Oud.",Paragraph
But Corbusier has ventured pioneering work like no one else in our time. He attempts,Paragraph
"to translate into the housing form that suspended equilibrium, that lightness and",Paragraph
openness that iron constructions of the nineteenth century express abstractly. He has,Paragraph
"shown us how one must mold the house throughout —below, above, on the sides —",Paragraph
in order to relieve its weight.,Paragraph
Corbusier’s means are not unique to him but originate earlier in,Paragraph
industry. The posts that support his houses can be seen in many French ware-,Paragraph
houses; the strip windows—fenétres en longueur—are commonly found in factories,Paragraph
"and wooden barracks as the result of construction, and the concrete column running",Paragraph

busier is the first to conceive a house so thoroughly that the weight has actually been,Paragraph
"taken away from it, and it has not remained a block whose roof has simply been",Paragraph
"shaved off. Not the least of his roles seems to be the fact that he, in overriding all",Paragraph
"inhibitions, has helped people go their own independent way.",Paragraph
Corbusier’s houses can be attacked on several points. He has been reproached for his,Paragraph

We need to consider here the competition for the League of Nations only insofar as it,Paragraph
touches upon the large issues that run through the entire century.,Paragraph
"We thus encounter, perhaps for the last time in history, the name of the ACADEMIE",Paragraph
DES BEAUX-ARTS.,Paragraph
The academy was—as we mentioned—renewed by Napoleon at the moment (1806),Paragraph
when he was preoccupied with giving a feudal veneer to the new empire. The,Paragraph
tradition the academy maintains is in no way a generally national one: it is the,Paragraph
"mentality of feudalism! Because feudalism as a social system is dead,",Paragraph
"the academy, too, is dead. That is the reason why for the last hundred years",Paragraph
the academy’s name has appeared only when it has been a question of impeding,Paragraph
development.,Paragraph
"Nothing has changed since Labrouste, already in 1840, proved that the academy’s",Paragraph
training produced students with an incapacity to deal with life (see page 98).,Paragraph
"Already fifty years ago the secretary of the academy, the vicomte Henri Delaborde,”",Paragraph
publicly declared that the doors to the academy opened only “when genius was,Paragraph
"gradually in accord with everyone,” that is to say, the academy inconsiderately",Paragraph
"reserves for itself the traditional right to sabotage young talents, to suppress their",Paragraph
"development as much as possible, only to assimilate them in their old age.",Paragraph

"92) ELEMENTS: ferroconcrete skeleton with uninterrupted supports, non-load-bearing walls with",Paragraph
"continuous strip windows, absence of the plinth, and inclusion of attic space within the building",Caption
complex.,Paragraph
93) The state of affairs may be expressed with almost cynical candor: “Sooner or later they find that they,Paragraph
"have no adversaries left and, without yielding anything of substance, they are more or less in agreement",Paragraph
with everybody. This is how it has been in our century with painters such as [Jean-Auguste-Dominique],Paragraph
"Ingres and [Eugéne] Delacroix, with sculptors such as David... , with such a musician as [Hector]",Paragraph
Fig. 118,Caption
"[117, 118]",Caption
"the academy sabotaged Henri Labrouste, up to the final works of his students, and it",Paragraph
later even suppressed a (Eugéne-Emmanuel] Viollet-le-Duc; and just as it yesterday,Paragraph
"ostracized Auguste Perret, so it today ostracizes Le Corbusier.",Paragraph
No one outside France has yet concerned himself with the academy. But through the,Paragraph
inertia of events or the mentality of political leaders it is a reality. This is why we,Paragraph
"must concern ourselves with it, however little it can be doubted that this feudalistic",Paragraph
holdover will soon be swept away.,Paragraph
The task of designing a building in which all nations would assemble to maintain the,Paragraph
equilibrium of the world is completely new and belongs to the time. To want to solve,Paragraph
"it any way other than with TODAY’S MEANS is dilettantism, for, as we will show, one",Paragraph
