"presage of a style that began to develop in the nineteenth century, that of",Paragraph
"metallic architecture. With the use of metal, and of concrete reinforced by",Paragraph

architects without endangering the solidity of the structure. In the conflict,Paragraph
"that obtains between the two elements of construction, solidity and open",Paragraph
"space, everything seems to show that the principle of free spaces will prevail,",Paragraph

There is not much to change today in the passage that has been,Paragraph

the different countries of Europe before the War the conceptions,Title
of the international style had come independently into existence.,Paragraph
It remained for the younger generation to combine and crystallize,Paragraph
the various esthetic and technical results of the experimentation,Paragraph
of their elders.,Paragraph
But it was in America that the promise of a new style appeared,Paragraph

"_ There is, however, a definite breach between Wright and the",Paragraph

"War. Ever since the days when he was Sullivan’s disciple,",Paragraph
"Wright has remained an individualist. A rebel by temperament,",Paragraph

Wright belongs to the international style no more than Behr-,Paragraph
ens or Perret or Van de Velde. Some of these men have been,Paragraph
ready to learn from their juniors. They have submitted in part to,Paragraph
the disciplines of the international style. But their work is still,Paragraph
marked by traces of the individualistic manners they achieved in,Paragraph
their prime. Without their work the style could hardly have come,Paragraph
"into being. Yet their individualism and their relation to the past,",Paragraph
"for all its tenuousness, makes of them not so much the creators of",Paragraph
a new style as the last representatives of Romanticism. They are,Paragraph
more akin to the men of a hundred years ago than to the genera-,Paragraph

The continued existence of Romantic individualism is not a,Paragraph
question of architecture alone. There is a dichotomy of the spirit,Paragraph
more profound than any mere style can ever resolve. The case,Paragraph
against individualism in architecture lies in the fact that Wright,Paragraph
has been almost alone in America in achieving a distinguished,Paragraph

"Gropius in Germany, Oud in Holland, and Le Corbusier in",Paragraph
"France, that the various steps in the inception of the new style",Paragraph
must be sought. These three with Mies van der Rohe in Germany,Paragraph
remain the great leaders of modern architecture.,Paragraph
"Gropius’ factory at Alfeld, built just before the War, came",Paragraph
nearer to an integration of the new style than any other edifice,Paragraph
built before 1922. In industrial architecture the tradition of the,Paragraph
"styles of the past was not repressive, as many factories of the",Paragraph
nineteenth century well illustrate. The need for using modern,Paragraph
construction throughout and for serving function directly was pe-,Paragraph
culiarly evident. Hence it was easier for Gropius to advance in,Paragraph
"this field beyond his master, Behrens, than it would have been in",Paragraph
any other. The walls of the Alfeld factory are screens of glass,Paragraph
with spandrels of metal at the floor levels. The crowning band of,Paragraph
brickwork does not project beyond these screens. The purely me-,Paragraph
chanical elements are frankly handled and give interest-to a de- |,Paragraph

"Doesburg made of houses in the early twenties, in collaboration",Paragraph

But the man who first made the world aware that a new style,Paragraph
"was being born was Le Corbusier. As late as 1916, well after his",Paragraph
"technical and sociological theorizing had begun, his conceptions",Paragraph
of design were still strongly marked by the Classical symmetry of,Paragraph

as novel esthetically as Oud’s village. The enormous window,Paragraph
"area and the terraces made possible by the use of ferroconcrete,",Paragraph
"together with the asymmetry of the composition, undoubtedly",Paragraph
"produced a design more thoroughly infused with a new spirit,",Paragraph

with the new architecture and it has been praised or condemned,Paragraph
"very largely in his person. But he was not, as we have seen, the",Paragraph
only innovator nor was the style as it came generally into being,Paragraph
after 1922 peculiarly his. He crystallized; he dramatized; but he.,Paragraph
was not alone in creating.,Paragraph
When in 1922 he built at Vaucresson: his first house in the,Paragraph

In America also there are both architects and critics who con-,Paragraph

IV,Title
A FIRST PRINCIPLE,Title
Architecture as Volume,Title
C entemporary methods of construction provide a cage or,Paragraph
skeleton of supports. This skeleton as it appears before the build-,Paragraph
ing is enclosed is familiar to everyone. Whether the supports are,Paragraph
"of metal or of reinforced concrete, the effect from a distance is of",Paragraph
a grille of verticals and horizontals. For protection against the,Paragraph
weather it is necessary that this skeleton should be in some way,Paragraph
enclosed by walls. In traditional masonry construction the walls,Paragraph
were themselves the supports. Now the walls are merely subordi-,Paragraph
nate elements fitted like screens between the supports or carried,Paragraph
like a shell outside of them. Thus the building is like a boat or an,Paragraph
umbrella with strong internal support and a continuous outside,Paragraph
"covering. In the buildings of the past, support and protection",Paragraph
were both provided by the same masonry wall. It is true that sup-,Paragraph
porting wall sections are still sometimes used in combination,Paragraph
"with skeleton construction. (Pages 133 and 217,) Isolated sup-",Paragraph
"ports, piers of metal or reinforced concrete, are, however, normal",Paragraph
and typical.,Paragraph
Plans may be worked out with far greater freedom than in the,Paragraph
past. The piers of modern construction are so slight in section,Paragraph
that they create no serious obstruction. If in given cases they,Paragraph
"might interfere, occasional supports may be omitted and their ©",Paragraph
burden carried by cantilevering. Entire facades are frequently,Paragraph
cantilevered and the screen walls set some distance outside the,Paragraph
supports. (Pages 118 and 172.) Symbolically the indication of,Paragraph
modern plans is reduced to points representing support and lines,Paragraph
representing separation and protection from the weather. No lon-,Paragraph
ger do we find the solid blocks of bearing walls and piers of ma-,Paragraph
sonry. The plan can be composed almost entirely in terms of the,Paragraph
"neéds it must provide for, with only minimal concessions to the",Paragraph
inescapable needs of sound construction.,Paragraph
"The effect of mass, of static solidity, hitherto the prime quality",Paragraph
"of architecture, has all but disappeared; in its place there is an",Paragraph
"effect of volume, or more accurately, of plane surfaces bounding",Paragraph
a volume. The prime architectural symbol is no longer the dense,Paragraph
"brick but the open box. Indeed, the great majority of buildings",Paragraph
"are in reality, as well as in effect, mere planes surrounding a vol-",Paragraph
ume. With skeleton construction enveloped only by a protective,Paragraph
"screen, the architect can hardly avoid achieving this effect of",Paragraph
"surface of volume unless, in deference to traditional design in",Paragraph
"terms of mass, he goes out of his way to obtain the contrary effect.",Paragraph
The European functionalists conform unconsciously to this _,Paragraph
principle of the international style without accepting its validity,Paragraph
"as an eesthetic discipline, The American functionalists, however,",Paragraph
"often load their surfaces, thus obscuring with an effect of solidity",Paragraph
and weight the non-supporting character of their wall screens. If,Paragraph
they design at all—and except in factories the client usually de-,Paragraph
mands some sort of applied design—they design still in mass. A,Paragraph
striking contrast is familiar to everyone as it appears in buildings,Paragraph
"under construction: the strong light cage of steel, and the heavy",Paragraph
solid-appearing walls with which it is gradually covered. The,Paragraph
"greater simplicity of the newer skyscrapers, the increase in the",Paragraph
window area and the growing awareness of the international style,Title
are reducing little by little this superficial heaviness. But thus far,Paragraph
"the more expensive the building, the more surely is there a con-",Paragraph
flict between its true character as an enclosed steel cage and the,Paragraph
apparent mass of its vertical buttressing and its pyramidal com-,Paragraph
position.,Paragraph
Of course this pyramidal composition is required in high,Paragraph
buildings by the zoning laws. Present American zoning laws are,Paragraph
at best pseudo-functional. They attempt merely to ameliorate,Paragraph
the sociological and technical difficulties inherent in crowding,Paragraph
tall buildings together on narrow streets. Proper zoning laws,Paragraph
would require the spacing of skyscrapers far enough apart so,Paragraph
that they might rise straight to the top without setbacks. Set-,Paragraph
backs complicate the structure and provide relatively little ter-,Paragraph
"race space, nor do they adequately protect the light and air of",Paragraph
neighboring buildings. The criticism that accepts the present,Paragraph
zoning laws as beneficent is mistaken. If that criticism is,Paragraph
"wsthetic, it rests on the false assumption that skyscrapers are",Paragraph
mere enlargements of the masonry towers of the past. If the,Paragraph
"criticism is functional, it has failed to go to the root of the",Paragraph
"urban problem, Skyscrapers have their proper place in the",Paragraph
"modern city, but they must be so widely spaced that they re-",Paragraph
lieve congestion rather than aggravate it. |,Paragraph
The MeGraw-Hill Building (Page 163) comes nearest to,Paragraph
"achieving esthetically the expression of the enclosed steel cage,",Paragraph
but it is still partially distorted into the old silhouette of the mas-,Paragraph
"sive tower. The setbacks are, of course, required by the zoning",Paragraph
"law, but they are arranged without subtlety. The unnecessary py-",Paragraph
ramidal feature which crowns the structure is inexcusably heavy.,Paragraph
"Yet the architect, Raymond Hood, in the Daily News Building of",Paragraph
"the previous year, which is in other ways less pure in expression,",Paragraph
handled the setbacks so that they did not suggest steps and,Paragraph
brought his building to a clear stop without decorative or termi-—,Paragraph
nal features. This has also been justly criticised by those func-,Paragraph
tionalists whose ideology is more European. For the water-tanks,Paragraph
and elevator machinery which have to find a place on top of a,Paragraph
"large building are there, hidden within the shell of the main",Paragraph
structure. “,Paragraph
"These various objections, which place both of these buildings.",Paragraph
"as something less than distinguished architecture, are implicit in",Paragraph
American conditions. Only the acceptance of a thoroughgoing,Paragraph
esthetic discipline by our architects would make it possible for,Paragraph
"our skyscrapers to be finer than our factories. For our factories,",Paragraph
"unless the client has called for embellishment, are like the con-",Paragraph
structions of the European functionalists. They exist clearly and,Paragraph
"effectively as the surfaces of volumes, even though the architect",Paragraph
has never accepted the zsthetic principle that they should do so.,Paragraph
In the past the great styles became something more than a cer-,Paragraph
"tain sort of construction, or a certain repertory of ornament. Post",Paragraph
and lintel construction was used in Egyptian architecture as well,Paragraph
as Greek. Romanesque churches achieved nearly as great a sci-,Paragraph
ence and elaboration of vaulting as did the later ones of the,Paragraph
Gothic age. The Gothic architects emphasized the impression of,Paragraph
height and of orderly multiplicity of organically related parts; the -,Paragraph
Greek architects so adjusted their design as to give their build-,Paragraph
ings the plastic. somatic character of their sculpture. Style is,Paragraph
"character, style is expression; but even character must he dis-",Paragraph
"played and expression may be conscious and clear, or muddled",Paragraph
and deceptive. The architect who builds in the international style,Paragraph
seeks to display the true character of his construction and to ex-,Paragraph
press clearly his provision for function. He prefers such an orga-,Paragraph
"nization of his general composition, such a use of available sur-",Paragraph
"face materials, and such a handling of detail as will increase",Paragraph
rather than contradict the prime effect of surface of volume.,Paragraph
In giving this effect the flat roofs normal with modern methods,Paragraph
of construction have an essential zsthetic significance. Roofs,Paragraph
"with a single slant, however, have occasionally been used with",Paragraph
success. For they are less massive and simpler than the gabled,Paragraph
roofs usual on the buildings of the past. Flat roofs are so much,Paragraph
more useful that slanting or rounded roofs are only exceptionally,Paragraph
justified.,Paragraph
The clarity of the impression of volume is diminished by any,Paragraph
"sort of complication. Volume is felt as imnzaterial and weightless,",Paragraph
a geometrically bounded space. Subsidiary projecting parts of a,Paragraph
building are likely to appear solid. Hence a compact and unified,Paragraph
solution of a complex problem will be best zsthetically as well as,Paragraph
economically. The massiveness of the architecture of the past,Paragraph
"was felt as gravitational, with surface and content one. Being",Paragraph
"heavy, massive architecture demanded the appearance of sup-",Paragraph
port such as could be given by a piling up of the parts. This sort,Paragraph
"of stability, like that of a wood pile, our tenuous cage construc-",Paragraph
"tion does not give. The sense of internal support is, on the other",Paragraph
"hand, increased by the avoidance of subsidiary parts and by the",Paragraph
achievement as far as possible of the effect of a single volume,Paragraph
with continuous surfaces.,Paragraph
Thus as a corollary of the principle of surface of volume there,Paragraph
is the further requirement that the surfaces shall be unbroken in,Paragraph
"effect, like a skin tightly stretched over the supporting skeleton.",Paragraph
The apparent tensions of a masonry wall are directly gravita-,Paragraph
"tional, although they are actually modified more or leas by the",Paragraph
use of lintels and arches. The apparent tensions of screen walls,Paragraph
"are not thus polarized in a vertical direction, but are felt to exist",Paragraph
"in all directions, as in a stretched textile. Hence the breaking of",Paragraph
the wall surface by placing windows at the inner instead of at the,Paragraph
outer edge of the wall is a serious fault of design. (Pages 159 and,Caption
232.) For the glass of the windows is now an integral part of the,Paragraph
enclosing screen rather than a hole in the wall as it was in ma-,Paragraph
sonry construction. .,Paragraph
Where the roof is supported on sections-of wall rather than on,Paragraph
"isolated posts, only the non-supporting sections are really",Paragraph
screens. Yet the discipline of the general style ig better served if,Paragraph
the contrast between the supporting wall surfaces and the non-,Paragraph
supporting surfaces is not over-emphasized. Such construction,Paragraph
with a reinforced concrete roof slab is still more. like the normal,Paragraph
modern cage construction than like traditional masonry con-,Paragraph
struction. (Page 133.) This is a special case which demands on,Paragraph
the part of the designer unusual tact and sense of the atyle. Such,Paragraph
exceptions must always be borne in mind by the eritic. Their suc-,Paragraph
"cessful incorporation in the style according to the spirit, if not the",Paragraph
"letter, of the fundamental disciplines makes the existence of a",Paragraph
contemporary style difficult to dispute.,Paragraph
The ordering of the openings in the wall surface is quite as,Paragraph
important as the avoidance of apparent reveals in the preserva-,Paragraph
tion of the integrity of the wall plane. But questions of order fall,Paragraph
more logically in a later section of this discussion. Needless to,Paragraph
"say, the more consistently a surface is arranged, the more con- |",Paragraph
spicuous will be its character as a surface. Contemporary: build-,Paragraph
ings often have entire walls of transparent glass constituting one .,Paragraph
"enormous window, The frames of the paries in auch walls must be",Paragraph
light enough to be distinguished from true supports. (Pages. 156,Caption
and 191.) Otherwise these subordinate divisions will so break up,Paragraph
the surface into panels that its continuous character is confused.,Paragraph
Even though the independent supporting skeleton is perfectly,Paragraph
"clearly seen behind, such a panelled treatment appears to have",Paragraph
weight if not mass. Such altogether transparent walls are not by,Paragraph
any means the easiest for the architect to handle effectively.,Paragraph
They no longer appear the extreme toward which the develop-,Paragraph
"ment of the contemporary style inevitably leads. Indeed, as the",Paragraph
Crystal Palace of the last century and the steel and glass depart-,Paragraph
"ment stores of 1900 suggest, such maximal fenestration was a",Paragraph
preparation for the development of a more general principle of,Paragraph
modern design: that of emphasizing the surfaces whether they,Paragraph
‘are opaque or transparent.,Paragraph
Windows constitute a more important element in modern ar-,Paragraph
chitecture than they have in any architecture since that of the,Paragraph
Gothic cathedrals. They are the most conspicuous features of,Paragraph
modern exterior design. Their handling is therefore an sesthetic,Paragraph
problem of the greatest importance. The very effect of volume,Paragraph
that is sought in choosing surfacing materials can easily be,Paragraph
diluted or contradicted by bad fenestration. _,Paragraph
Window frames unavoidably break the general wall surface,Paragraph
and if they are heavy tend to make the window a mere hole in the,Paragraph
wall quite as much as do reveals. (Pages 139 and 179.) Light,Paragraph
"simple frames, preferably of durable non-corroding metal in",Paragraph
"standardized units, are to be desired as much esthetically as",Paragraph
practically. (Pages 155 and 173.) Non-corroding metals are still,Paragraph
rather expensive. Moreover standardized metal frames have not,Paragraph
yet come into use everywhere. But the general development in,Paragraph
this direction is undeniable and one of happy augury for the con-,Paragraph
temporary style.,Paragraph
Wooden window frames are becoming a makeshift. Yet many,Paragraph
atchitects have heen able to make them appear hardly heavier,Paragraph
than metal ones. Some of the finest examples of fenestration in,Paragraph
modern architecture are executed in wood. (Pages 113 and 127.),Paragraph
Of course the elegance which is obtained by light frames and,Paragraph
muntins goes for nothing if the windows are badly subdivided,Paragraph
and badly placed in the general design.,Paragraph
The spirit of the principle of surface covers many exceptions,Paragraph
to its letter. The type of construction represented by Miés van der,Paragraph
"Rohe’s Barcelona pavilion, (Page 187), as well as that repre-",Paragraph
"sented in Le Corbusier’s house at Le Pradet, (Page 133), leads to",Paragraph
a treatment of surfaces sensibly different from that which has,Paragraph
"been primarily stressed here. These works, nevertheless, testify",Paragraph
that their designers are extending the possibilities of the contem-,Paragraph
potary style. In each of these buildings the surfaces are empha-,Paragraph
sized and their continuity made evident although their relation to,Paragraph
the supporting construction is less simple than in most buildings.,Paragraph
_ Inthe Barcelona pavilion the walls are screens but they do not,Paragraph
define a fixed yolume. The volume beneath the post-supported,Paragraph
slab roof is in a sense bounded by imaginary planes. The walls,Paragraph
"are independent screens set up within this total volume, having",Paragraph
each a separate existence and creating subordinate volumes. The,Paragraph
"design is unified by the slab roof on its regular supports, not by",Paragraph
the usual continuous exterior screen wall.,Paragraph
In the Le Pradet house by Le Corbusier sections of rubble ma-,Caption
sonry wall provide the main support and isolated piers are. used,Paragraph
only subordinately. These supporting sections are unbroken by,Paragraph
"windows and widely separated by wall areas entirely of glass, As",Paragraph
in the Barcelona pavilion the enclosing volume is defined by the,Paragraph
continuous slab roof. The exterior surfaces are not continuous,Paragraph
"because they are of two sorts, unbroken masonry walls and inter-",Paragraph
vening glass screens. But the two sorts of surfaces are both .,Paragraph
treated in a way to emphasize their specific characters. The sup-,Paragraph
porting walls are rough and solid in appearance; the intermediate,Paragraph
"screens, light, smooth and transparent. The two sorts are care-",Paragraph
fully related in proportion. The use of a special type of construc-,Paragraph
tion suited to the particular problem of a Riviera country house,Paragraph
has led to a special type of design. The expression is related to,Paragraph
the general principle of surface of volume but not restricted by it.,Paragraph
Thus the prime principles of the great styles of the past were ap-,Paragraph
plied in exceptional cases. This special type of design has its,Paragraph
place in the general contemporary style as much as astylar build-,Paragraph

Th. character of surface of volume is not expressed merely,Paragraph
by the general design of a modern building; the actual materials,Paragraph
of the surface itself are of the utmost importance. The whiquitous,Paragraph
"stucco, which still serves as the hall-mark of the contemporary",Paragraph
"style, has the esthetic advantage of forming a continuous even",Paragraph
"covering, But if the stucco is rough, the sharpness of the design,",Paragraph
"which facilitates apprehension of the building’s volume, is",Paragraph
"blunted. (Page 155.) Rough stucco, because of its texture and —",Paragraph

where the large scale of the construction makes the flaws that,Paragraph
come with time relatively inconspicuous. A material like stucco,Paragraph
"but elastic and with a wide color range, which could be laid over",Paragraph
"various bases, would be ideal.",Paragraph
Wooden sheathing is admirable in the special case of modern,Paragraph
"construction in wood. It is not as durable as stone or brick, yet as",Paragraph
"we are aware in Amenica, it can well outlast a century if it is kept",Paragraph

breaks the continuity of surface and should be avoided.,Paragraph
"As in the architecture of the past, the finest materials for wall",Paragraph
"surfacing are stones, granites and marbles. (Pages 135 and 187",Paragraph
"f.) Unless they are large in area, however, the separate units are",Paragraph
"likely to appear like the faces of blocks of masonry, suggesting",Paragraph
weight and mass. As in Byzantine architecture it is possible to,Paragraph
use plates so that their true character as sheathing is evident.,Paragraph
Rich natural materials are expensive and hence more suitable in,Paragraph
construction of a monumental or luxurious character than in or-,Paragraph
"dinary buildings, Artificial plaques of various sorts and metal",Caption
plates exposed or painted have similar advantages and will,Paragraph
doubtless be increasingly used. (Pages 113 and 169.) In any sort,Paragraph
of plate covering it is important that the plates be so joined that,Paragraph
"the surface is as little broken as possible. Graining, moreover,",Paragraph
should be so disposed as to emphasize the continuity of the,Paragraph
"whole wall and net, as in the past, to produce symmetrical pat-",Paragraph

Plate sheathing has the distinct advantage of similarity in tex-,Paragraph

Today the general consistency of the design and the senge of con-,Paragraph

the transparent and the opaque sections of the bounding walls.,Paragraph
Windows should be independent in character but not a breach in,Paragraph
the general coherence of the surface.,Paragraph
Burned clay products are more frequently uged than plate,Paragraph
sheathing. Brick is from the practical point of view the most sat-,Paragraph
isfactory inexpensive surfacing material in general use. It may be,Paragraph
eqiially. well used for screen walls and for sections of supporting,Paragraph

"aesthetic point of view, brick is undoubtedly less satisfactory",Paragraph
"than other materials, including stucco. Indeed, brick is often",Paragraph
covered with stucco even by architects who claim to be unin-,Paragraph
fluenced by sesthetic considerations. (Page 219.) This conces-,Paragraph
sion to the principle of achieving a smooth continuous surface is,Paragraph
an important instance of the exaggeration of the functionalists’,Paragraph
anti-sesthetic claims.,Paragraph
"Brick, when laid conventionally, suggests a solid supporting",Paragraph
wall even where that does not exist. Even a screen wall of brick,Paragraph
appears to retain something of the. mass and the dead weight of,Paragraph
the architecture of the past. The use of brick tends-to give a pie-,Paragraph

A different shape of brick and a different method of laying,Paragraph

Ordinary terra cotta blocks or concrete blocks of the cheapest,Paragraph

acceptable except at the economic minimum.,Paragraph
In the range of constructions of medium cost and medium size,Paragraph
glazed tile laid with continuous vertical as well as horizontal,Paragraph
joints provides a material that vies in esthetic effectiveness with,Paragraph
plate sheathing. (Page 175.) The shape of the units may be such,Paragraph
that all suggestion of the traditional masonry block is lost. The,Paragraph
texture is smooth and permanent; the color possibilities are wide.,Paragraph
The small scale of the individual tiles is less harmonious with the,Paragraph

Glass bricks and translucent glass plates are types of surfac-,Paragraph

A SECOND PRINCIPLE,Title
Concerning Regularity,Title
‘T.. patterns of Gothie fenestration were ordered according,Paragraph
to definite conceptions of design derived from structure and,Paragraph
leading more and more to arbitrary decoration. Today the pat-,Paragraph
"terns of windows, the composition of the parts of contemporary",Paragraph
"architecture, must also be ordered according to an esthetic prin-",Paragraph
ciple if a. contemporary style exist. The functionalists claim that,Paragraph
they order their designs according to practical ‘considerations,Paragraph
"alone. Yet even they, because of the economic force of standard-",Paragraph
"ization, accept a discipline of design not dissimilar to that found",Paragraph
in the work of contemporary architects who grant the importance,Paragraph
of esthetic considerations. Beside the principle of surface of vol-,Paragraph
"ume already discussed there is a second controlling principle,",Paragraph
evident in the productions of the international style including the,Paragraph
work of the European functionalists.,Paragraph
This. second principle of contemporary style in architecture,Paragraph
"has to do with regularity, The supports in skeleton construction",Paragraph
are normally and typically spaced at equal distances in order,Paragraph
that strains may be equalized. (Pages 117 and 149.) Thus most,Paragraph
buildings have an underlying regular rhythm which is clearly,Paragraph
"seett before the outside surfaces are applied. Moreover, eco-",Paragraph
nomic considerations favor the use of standardized parts,Paragraph
throughout. Good modern architecture expresses in its design,Paragraph
this characteristic orderliness of structure and this similarity of,Paragraph
parts by an esthetic ordering which emphasizes the underlying,Paragraph
regularity. Bad modern design contradicts this regularity. Regu-,Paragraph
"Jarity is, however, relative and not absolute in architecture.",Paragraph
The varied purposes which most buildings serve cannot be,Paragraph
"completely regularized. A loft building in a city may be, and",Paragraph
"often is, regular throughout except for the entrances and the",Paragraph
elevators. (Page 162.) The many purposes which each floor,Paragraph
serves are so neatly alike that the same plan and elevation may,Paragraph

buildings built at minimal cost with practical considerations,Paragraph
dominant throughout may be held to be less fully architectural,Paragraph
than those on which the architect has more freedom of choice in,Paragraph
the use of materials and the distribution of the parts.,Paragraph
"Under whatever conditions buildings are built, they tend to be",Paragraph
more architectural as they serve more complicated functions.,Paragraph
The more specialized the combination of functions served by a,Paragraph
"building, the more opportunity there is for the architect to",Paragraph
achieve a design controlled by zsthetic as well as practical con-,Paragraph
siderations. The more simple and repetitious the functions of a,Paragraph
"building and the more it resembles in purpose other buildings,",Paragraph
the less likely is the architect to reach a solution of his problems,Paragraph

"On the whole, whether one examine contemporary architecture",Paragraph

dard of good building has been an unmixed gain. This has been,Paragraph
due as much to the functionalists as to those who still believe in,Paragraph
the possibility of architecture as an art. The nineteenth century,Paragraph
produced a great deal of bad architecture and very little good,Paragraph
"building, as the functionalists delight in pointing out.",Paragraph
"But we still have architecture: that is, edifices consciously",Paragraph
raised above the level of mere building. Architecture is seldom,Paragraph
merely neutral zsthetically. It is good architecture or it is bad.,Paragraph
"When it is bad, the extreme contentions of the functionalists",Paragraph
"seem justified. But when it is good, such negative contentions",Paragraph
appear an essential denial of the important spiritual function,Paragraph
which all art serves. Good modem architecture may be-as richly,Paragraph
and coherently imbued with the style of our day as were the great,Paragraph
edifices of the past with that of theirs.,Paragraph
"The functionalists, approaching architecture from the materi-",Paragraph
"alistic point of view of sociology, go behind the problems that are",Paragraph

demand a fully architectural solution. In their estimation the,Paragraph

of good building. The question passes outside the field of archi- .,Paragraph
tecture into the field of politics and economics. The arguments of,Paragraph
the functionalists are not based on the actual situation in the,Paragraph

contemporary world outside Russia. Whether they ought to or,Paragraph
"not, many elients can still afford architecture in addition to",Paragraph
"A millennium of good building is as far away as any other, and",Paragraph
"it is a worthy aspiration to lay plans for it. In such a millennium,",Paragraph
"moreover, there should still be a place for architecture. Good ar-",Paragraph
chitecture demands intelligence and taste more than money.,Paragraph
"Today architecture and building remain closely related, shading",Paragraph
subtly one into the other. Whether or not the contemporary style,Paragraph
"should produce architecture as well as building, it certainly does",Paragraph
"so, Indeed many developments in structure and in articulation of",Paragraph
function now incorporated in minimal building were first evolved,Paragraph
in expensive constructions. All the leading modem architects of,Paragraph
the intemational style have been technical as well as xsthetic,Paragraph
innovators. The European functionalists who now disown Le Cor-,Paragraph
"busier, and Oud, and Gropius and Miés van der Rohe first",Paragraph
learned the science of building from them. Most American func-,Paragraph
tionalists have much to learn from the leaders of the international,Paragraph
"style, even if they cannot accept sincerely the esthetic discipline",Paragraph
those leaders have brought into being.,Paragraph
"On the other hand, this xsthetic discipline was derived in.",Paragraph
considerable part from an appreciative study of industrial build-,Paragraph
ing. It is in the plain building of the nineteenth century rather,Paragraph
than in its elaborate architecture that the principles of the inter-,Paragraph
national style were foreshadowed. The most significant work of,Paragraph
"Gropius and Oud, among the leaders of modern architecture, has",Paragraph
"been in the field of inexpensive building, which they have raised",Paragraph
to the level of real architecture.,Paragraph
The idea of permanence has always been associated with ar-,Paragraph
chiteeture. Many problems of building are best solved temporar-,Paragraph
ily. But temporary constructions are seldom as architectural in,Paragraph
character as. those built to endure. The international style is so,Paragraph
dependent on new methods of construction that it might seem,Paragraph
that its principles could only apply to the most advanced known,Paragraph
"construction. Functionalists, indeed, often deny that building",Paragraph
can be sound unless it is radical in its technics. Arguments of,Paragraph
economics and questions of durability are often disregarded or,Paragraph
disputed when critics discuss the continued use of wood or ma-,Paragraph
sonry.,Paragraph
"In many regions wood, for example, is economically the most",Paragraph
satisfactory material. For certain types of building its relative im-,Paragraph
permanence is not a disadvantage. Nor is there anything in,Paragraph
wooden construction which makes it unsuitable to the zsthetic or,Paragraph
the functional disciplines of the contemporary style. Wooden,Paragraph
"construction, as much as construction in steel or ferroconcrete, is",Paragraph
a cage with a protective sheathing rather than a supporting wall.,Paragraph
Thus the principle of architectural expression as surface of vol-,Paragraph
"ume applies to it. Indeed, wood lends itself particularly well to",Paragraph
"the production of fine surfaces. Wooden construction is, algo,",Paragraph
normally regular. The principle of avoidance of ornament holds,Paragraph
regardless of materials. (Pages 119 and 225.),Paragraph
Wood does not permit all the technical audacities of steel and,Paragraph
"concrete, but within a certain range it is unusually elastic and",Paragraph
responsive. In the past wooden construction was often called,Paragraph
upon to imitate styles developed in masonry. Yet many half-tim-,Paragraph
ber houses with their great ranges of windows are surprisingly,Paragraph
modern in conception. Today the skeleton is no longer exposed.,Paragraph
The lighter framing used today is better protected by a continu-,Paragraph
ous outside covering such as has always been used in America.,Paragraph
(Page 227.),Caption
The steeply slanting roofs of the Middle Ages were already —,Paragraph
replaced in the nineteenth century by roofs with an inconspicw-.,Paragraph
ous slant on many wooden houses. Today the heavy pyramidal,Paragraph
effect that tall roofs produce can be successfully avoided. The,Paragraph
weightlessness and the consistency of modern design need no,Paragraph
longer be contradicted by so definitely traditional a feature. Skil-,Paragraph
"ful architects, both in Europe and America, have even succeeded",Paragraph
in using roofs of a single slant which avoid the traditional gable,Paragraph
and give no impression of mass. Others have used terrace roofs,Paragraph
just as they would on houses of steel and concrete.,Paragraph
Wood is admirable for building in certain special conditions,Paragraph
"but it is hardly suitable in others where the fire hazard is great, or",Paragraph
"fer monumental architecture. If, however, wooden construction is",Paragraph
"to be controlled by zsthetic principles, it certainly lends itself to",Paragraph
. those of the international style.,Paragraph
The same is not so true of solid masonry. The character of ma-,Paragraph
sonry is in direct opposition to the character of contemporary,Paragraph
"methods of construction. Masonry, either of stone or brick, can",Paragraph
hardly avoid offering an effect of mass and weight. Nor can it,Paragraph
provide for large openings without the use of arches or of steel or,Paragraph
"ferroconcrete beams, Masonry structure used consistently",Paragraph
throughout a building remains traditional both technically and,Paragraph
esthetically. Yet in monumental edifices which have only the,Paragraph
most elementary functional requirements and demand the assur-,Paragraph
"ance of Egyptian permanence, masonry wall construction might .",Paragraph
appropriately be used. An exceptional monument of solid granite,Paragraph
or marble of the order of the Temple of the Sphinx might be re-,Paragraph
lated to the international style by an imitative application of its,Paragraph
"sesthetie principles. The surface might be continuous, the detail",Paragraph
minimal; but the effect of mass could hardly be honestly avoided.,Paragraph
IX,Title
PLANS,Title
ii far there has been only incidental mention of the plan,Paragraph
in contemporary architecture. Modern methods of skeleton con-,Paragraph
struction have freed planning from conforming to the rigid lines,Paragraph
of masonry structure. Isolated supports interfere hardly at all,Paragraph
"with free space and circulation. Interior partitions, like exterior",Paragraph
"walls, are mere screens, Thus planning has become absolutely",Paragraph
"pliant to the needs of function. New study of function, moreover,",Paragraph
has broken down most of the conventions of planning inherited |,Paragraph
"from the past, quite as rapidly as structural advance has made.",Paragraph
radical changes in plan possible.,Paragraph
The functionalists make. a particular fetish of planni,Paragraph
. They,Paragraph
sometimes claim that they have never studied or composed their,Paragraph
"exteriors, but have merely allowed them to grow as the unavoida-",Paragraph
ble clothing of the plan. It is true that the full application of the,Paragraph
principle of regularity to the plans and the sections induces con-,Paragraph
"sistency in the elevations. It does not, however, lead automati-",Paragraph
cally to good proportions in the fagades. Architects who aim at,Paragraph
achieving the fullest architectural character in their buildings,Paragraph
must still study elevations alone quite as much as plans and sec-,Paragraph
"tions,",Title
The essence of architecture lies in the relation of the various,Paragraph
sorts of geometrical projections. The realities of function influ-,Paragraph
"ence chiefly the plan, but the expression of function must appear",Paragraph
in the elevations. Eveh the functionalists who deny the necessity,Paragraph
for esthetic expression must admit that the essential character of,Paragraph
the plan is generally apprehended from the exterior of the build-,Paragraph
ing. The contemporary exaggeration of the importance of the plan,Paragraph
is primarily an architect’s game. The game was well played at the,Paragraph
Ecole des Beaux Arts long before modern architecture came into,Paragraph
existence. It led to 2 very one-sided architecture since most of its,Paragraph
interest and beauty could only be appreciated on paper.,Paragraph
The innovations in plan of the international style have led to.,Paragraph
much that is valuable both from the functional and from the,Paragraph
esthetic point of view. Even the functionalists have profited by,Paragraph
the innovations of architects interested in the zsthetics of inte-,Paragraph
"rior space. Today there are three types of interiors: first, the in-",Paragraph
"side of the volume of the building, consisting of the entire con-",Paragraph
tent of the building or of a considerable part of it (Pages 109 and,Caption
"220); second, interiors which open up into one another without",Paragraph
"definite circumscribing partitions (Page 190); and finally, the or-",Paragraph
dinary enclosed room.,Paragraph
"The first sort of interior, which is not essentially different from",Paragraph
the monumental interiors in the churches and theatres of the,Paragraph
"past, is of the scale of exterior architecture. Its walls are usually",Paragraph
the interior surface of the same protecting screen which consti-,Paragraph
tutes the exterior surface of the architectural volume. They re-,Paragraph
"quire, therefore, a similar treatment, although naturally the de-",Paragraph
mands of durability in the materials are much less stringent. In,Paragraph
"such interiors the supports will often stand isolated, making the",Paragraph
character of the construction perfectly clear. These supports re-,Paragraph
"quire different treatment, so that the lack of connection with the",Paragraph
wall screens will be evident. They give scale to the created,Paragraph
"space. (Pages 109 and 220.) Therefore, they should be sharply",Paragraph
defined and elegant in profile. Like the supports which are visi-,Paragraph
ble outside they are best if rounded in section.,Paragraph
The second sort of interiors is the particular invention of the,Paragraph
international style. (Pages 146 and 194.) In conteast to the com-,Paragraph
pletely enclosed rooms of the past they stress the unity and conti-,Paragraph
_nuity of the whole volume inside a building. The independence,Paragraph
of the dividing screens and their variation in size and placing,Paragraph

function and the relation of one function to another can be clearly,Paragraph
expressed. The different screens serving different purposes may,Paragraph
well be of different materials provided always their thinness and,Paragraph
freedom from structural duty is stressed. While the visible sup-,Paragraph

The modern Siedlung raises the question of what is meant by.,Paragraph

In the single residence units themselves the present and the,Paragraph

client and standing in its own grounds—still a very important,Paragraph
- architectural problem in every country of the world except,Paragraph
Russia—the functions of the house as a place to live in must be,Paragraph

"them by analysis. Indeed, satisfying the particular client is one",Paragraph
important function of architecture that the European functional-,Paragraph

significance.,Paragraph
The Siedlung implies preparation not for a given family but for,Paragraph
"a typical family. This statistical monster, the typical family, has",Paragraph

logical theories of the architects. The European functionalists in,Paragraph
their annual conferences set up standards for ideal minimal,Paragraph

"private, as well as in public, practice must suggest and provide",Paragraph

Too often in European Siedlungen. the functionalists build for,Paragraph

the work of his pupils is doubtless more typical of the style; and,Paragraph

does continue to disown the idea of style at every opportunity.,Paragraph
It was in Mies’s projects of 1922 that his true significance as,Paragraph

The next section of the book was concerned with “Functional-,Paragraph

Some modem critics and groups of architects both in Europe,Paragraph
and in America deny that the aesthetic element in architecture is,Paragraph
"important, or even that it exists. All aesthetic principles of style",Paragraph
are to them meaningless and unreal.,Paragraph
There are still those who insist that architecture ought to be,Paragraph
entirely a matter of technics and that architects should therefore,Paragraph
hand over the whole field of building to engineers. But the,Paragraph
glorification of engineering is a less popular critical gambit than,Paragraph
it was earlier. (Then it will perhaps be recalled there was even a,Paragraph
"“Great Engineer” in the White House!) Yet, looking back over",Paragraph
"the building production of the last two generations, it is evident",Paragraph
that the really great engineers have frequently built edifices,Paragraph
which were more monumental and in many ways more visually,Paragraph

Some sort of architectural style inevitably arises from the,Paragraph
