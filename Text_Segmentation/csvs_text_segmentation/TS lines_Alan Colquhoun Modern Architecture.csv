Introduction,Title
The term ‘modern architecture’ is ambiguous. It can be understood to,Paragraph
refer to all buildings of the modern period regardless of their ideolog-,Paragraph
"ical basis, or it can be understood more specifically as an architecture",Paragraph
conscious of its own modernity and striving for change. It is in the,Paragraph
latter sense that it has generally been defined in histories of contem-,Paragraph
"porary architecture, and the present book follows this tradition.",Paragraph
"Already in the early nineteenth century, there was wide dissatisfaction",Paragraph
"with eclecticism among architects, historians, and critics. This well-",Paragraph
documented attitude justifies a history of modern architecture,Paragraph
"concerned primarily with reformist, ‘avant-garde’ tendencies, rather",Paragraph
than one that attempts to deal with the whole of architectural produc-,Paragraph
"tion as if it operated within a non-ideological, neutral field.",Paragraph
It is in the space between the idealist utopias of the historical avant-,Paragraph
"gardes and the resistances, complexities, and pluralities of capitalist",Title
culture that this book seeks to situate itself. Though not attempting to,Paragraph
"be in any way encyclopedic, the narrative follows an overall chronolog-",Paragraph
"ical sequence, and tries to be, perhaps, less certain in its outcome and",Paragraph
less triumphalist than those of most previous histories of modernism.,Paragraph
The book consists of a number of essays that can be read either as self-,Paragraph
"contained narratives or as part of a larger whole, each dealing with a",Paragraph
cluster of related themes reflecting an important moment in the con-,Paragraph
frontation of architecture with the external conditions of modernity. If,Paragraph
"it is still largely a history of the masters, that is because that was the",Paragraph
"nature of modernism itself, despite its many claims to anonymity.",Paragraph
A word on terminology: I use—more or less interchangeably—the,Paragraph
"terms ‘modern architecture’, ‘Modernism, ‘the avant-garde’, to mean",Paragraph
the progressive movements of the 1910s and 19208 as a whole. I also,Paragraph
"occasionally use the term ‘historical avant-garde’, which has the effect",Paragraph
of historicizing the movement and distinguishing it from contempo-,Paragraph
"rary practice. I do not follow Peter Birger (Theory of the Avant-Garde,",Paragraph
"1984), who, in the context of Dada photomontage, distinguishes",Paragraph
between an avant-garde that sought to change the status of art within,Paragraph
the relations of production and a Modernism that sought only to,Paragraph
change its forms. That these two polar positions can be applied to,Paragraph
"architecture is undeniable. But the line between them is hard to define,",Paragraph
and even the work of the Left Constructivists and Marxists like Hannes,Paragraph
"Meyer does not, in my opinion, escape aestheticism. This is hardly sur-",Paragraph
"prising, since, before it could be separated from the classical-academic",Paragraph
"theory of the arts, aesthetics had first to become an autonomous cate-",Paragraph
gory. Apart from the general terms mentioned above—which are useful,Paragraph
"precisely because of their semantic vagueness—other terms are used,",Paragraph
"either to define well-attested sub-movements, such as Futurism, Con-",Paragraph
"structivism, De Stijl, LEsprit Nouveau, and the Neue Sachlichkeit",Title
"(New Objectivity), or migratory tendencies within the overall phe-",Paragraph
"nomenon of modernism, such as organicism, neoclassicism,",Paragraph
"Expressionism, functionalism, and rationalism. I have tried to explain",Paragraph
what I mean by these slippery terms in the appropriate chapters.,Paragraph
"From a certain perspective, general terms such as ‘modernism’ can",Paragraph
"also be applied to Art Nouveau—as, indeed, the temporal span of this",Paragraph
book implies. To try to avoid such ambiguities would be to make,Paragraph
unsustainable claims for logic. Art Nouveau was both the end and the,Paragraph
"beginning of an era, and its achievements as well as its limitations were",Paragraph
the result of this Janus-like perspective.,Paragraph
Many aspects of Modernist theory still seem valid today. But much,Paragraph
"in it belongs to the realm of myth, and is impossible to accept at face",Paragraph
"value. The myth itself has now become history, and demands critical",Paragraph
interpretation. One of the main ideas motivating the protagonists of,Paragraph
the Modern Movement was the Hegelian notion that the study of,Paragraph
history made it possible to predict its future course. But it is scarcely,Paragraph
possible any longer to believe—as the Modernist architects appear to,Paragraph
"have believed—that the architect is a kind of seer, uniquely gifted with",Paragraph
the power of discerning the spirit of the age and its symbolic forms.,Paragraph
Such a belief was predicated on the possibility of projecting the condi-,Paragraph
tions of the past onto the present. For progressive-minded architects of,Paragraph
"the nineteenth century and their twentieth-century successors, it",Paragraph
seemed essential to create a unified architectural style that would reflect,Paragraph
"its age, just as previous styles had reflected theirs. This meant the rejec-",Paragraph
"tion of an academic tradition that had degenerated into eclecticism,",Paragraph
imprisoned in a history that had come to an end and whose forms could,Paragraph
only be endlessly recycled. It did not imply a rejection of tradition as,Paragraph
"such. The architecture of the future would return to the frve tradition,",Paragraph
"in which, it was believed, a harmonious and organic unity had existed",Paragraph
between all the cultural phenomena of each age. In the great historical,Paragraph
periods artists had not been free to choose the style in which they,Paragraph
worked. Their mental and creative horizons had been circumscribed by,Paragraph
a range of forms that constituted their entire universe. The artist came,Paragraph
into a world already formed. The study of history seemed to reveal that,Paragraph
"these periods constituted indivisible totalities. On the one hand, there",Paragraph
"were elements unique to each period; on the other, the organic unity",Paragraph
that bound these elements together was itself a universal. The new age,Paragraph
must exhibit the cultural totality characteristic of all historical periods.,Paragraph
"The question was never asked how a cultural totality, which by defi-",Paragraph
"nition had depended on an involuntary collective will, could now be",Paragraph
achieved voluntarily by a number of individuals. Nor did it ever seem to,Paragraph
have occurred to those who held this view that what separated the past,Paragraph
from the present might be precisely the absence of this inferred organic,Paragraph
"unity. According to the model of the organic unity of culture, the task of",Paragraph
the architect was first to uncover and then create the unique forms of,Paragraph
the age. But the possibility of such an architecture depended on a defin-,Paragraph
ition of modernity that filtered out the very factors that differentiated it,Paragraph
most strongly from earlier traditions: capitalism and industrialization.,Paragraph
"William Morris, the founder of the Arts and Crafts movement, had",Paragraph
"rejected both capitalism and machine production, a position that was at",Paragraph
"least consistent. But the theorists of the German Werkbund, while they",Paragraph
"rejected capitalism, wanted to retain industrialization. They con-",Paragraph
demned what they saw as the materialistic values of both Marxism and,Paragraph
"Western liberal democracy, but sought an alternative that would",Paragraph
combine the benefits of modern technology with a return to the pre-,Paragraph
ndustrial community values that capitalism was in the process of,Paragraph
destroying. The Modern Movement was both an act of resistance to,Paragraph
social modernity and an enthusiastic acceptance of an open technologi-,Paragraph
"cal future. It longed for a world of territorial and social fixity, while at",Paragraph
"the same time embracing, incompatibly, an economy and technology in",Paragraph
flux. It shared this belief in a mythical ‘third way’ between capitalism,Paragraph
"and communism with the Fascist movements of the 1930s, and though",Paragraph
"it would be completely wrong to brand it with the crimes of Fascism, it",Paragraph
is surely no accident that the period of its greatest intensity coincided,Paragraph
be,Title
"with the anti-democratic, totalitarian political movements that were",Paragraph
such a dominant feature of the first half of the twentieth century.,Paragraph
The conclusion would seem inescapable that the cultural unity and,Paragraph
shared artistic standards—whether deriving from folk or from aristo-,Paragraph
cratic traditions—demanded by the modern movement from its,Paragraph
inception were increasingly out of step with the political and economic,Paragraph
realities of the twentieth century. Based on an idealist and teleological,Paragraph
"conception of history, modernist theory seems radically to have mis-",Paragraph
"read the very Zeitgeist it had itself invoked, ignoring the complex and",Paragraph
"indeterminate nature of modern capitalism, with its dispersal of power",Paragraph
and its constant state of movement.,Paragraph
"The revolution of modernism—partly voluntary, partly involun-",Paragraph
tary—has irrevocably changed the course of architecture. But in the,Paragraph
process it has itself become transformed. Its totalizing ambitions can,Paragraph
"no longer be sustained. Yet, the adventure of the Modern Movement is",Paragraph
still capable of acting as an inspiration for a present whose ideals are so,Paragraph
much less clearly defined. It is the aim of this book to sharpen our,Paragraph
image of that adventure.,Paragraph

1890-1910,Title
In 1892 the short-lived but vigorous Art Nouveau movement was,Paragraph
"launched in Belgium and quickly spread, first to France and then to the",Paragraph
rest of Europe. Its inspiration came from the English Arts and Crafts,Paragraph
"movement and developments in wrought iron technology, particularly as",Paragraph
"interpreted by the French architect and theorist, Eugéne-Emmanuel Viollet-",Paragraph
le-Duc (1814-79). The movement was closely associated with the rise ofa,Paragraph
"new industrial bourgeoisie on the one hand and, on the other, with the",Paragraph
many movements for political independence in fin-de-siécle Europe. It,Paragraph
"spread rapidly by means of journals such as The Studie, which included",Paragraph
"high-quality, mass-produced images, made possible by the new print-",Paragraph
ing techniques of offset lithography and photolithography which came,Paragraph
into commercial use in the 1880s and 18gos.,Paragraph
Art Nouveau was the first systematic attempt to replace the classical,Paragraph
system of architecture and the decorative arts that had been handed,Paragraph
down from the seventcenth century and was enshrined in the teaching,Paragraph
of the Beaux-Arts academies. The new movement abandoned the,Paragraph
"post-Renaissance convention of realism, drawing inspiration from",Paragraph
"styles outside the classical canon—from Japan, from the Middle Ages,",Paragraph
"and even from Rococo. Though it lasted barely 15 years, many of its pre-",Paragraph
cepts were incorporated into the avant-garde movements that,Paragraph
followed.,Paragraph
Like all progressive movements of the late nineteenth and early,Paragraph
"twentieth centuries, Art Nouveau was caught in an inherent",Paragraph
dilemma—how to preserve the historical values of art under condi-,Paragraph
tions of industrial capitalism. The Industrial Revolution had radically,Paragraph
altered both the individual and the collective conditions of artistic,Paragraph
production. In the face of this situation Art Nouveau artists and,Paragraph
architects reacted in a way that would become typical of later avant-,Paragraph
gardes: they leapt over recent history to a remote and idealized past in,Paragraph
order to find an art that could be historically justified and yet be,Paragraph
absolutely new.,Paragraph
Although Art Nouveau was preceded and profoundly influenced,Paragraph
"by the Arts and Crafts movement, the two continued in parallel, cach",Paragraph
"modifying the other. In Austria, and to some extent in England, there",Paragraph
was a fusion of the two movements. In Germany the influence of the,Paragraph
"Arts and Crafts proved the stronger of the two, leading to the",Paragraph
Deutscher Werkbund and the alliance between industry and the,Title
decorative arts.,Paragraph
Antecedents,Title
The reform of the industrial arts,Title
"Art Nouveau was the outcome of a transformation in the industrial, or",Paragraph
"decorative, arts that had been initiated in England and France earlier",Paragraph
in the nineteenth century. As early as 1835 a parliamentary commission,Paragraph
had been set up in England to study the problem of the decline in artis-,Paragraph
tic quality of machine-made objects and the consequent damage to the,Paragraph
export market. In 1851 a Great Exhibition of Industry of all Nations,Paragraph
"was organized in London, following a similar but abortive project in",Paragraph
France. (France had led the way in industrial exhibitions but these had,Paragraph
been exclusively national.) The Great Exhibition was a huge commer-,Paragraph
"cial and political success, but it confirmed the low quality of decorative",Paragraph
"products not only in England but in all the industrial countries, com-",Paragraph
pared to those of the East. This realization prompted a succession of,Paragraph
"initiatives both in England and France . In England, the Victoria and",Paragraph
Albert Museum and the Department of Practical Art were founded in,Paragraph
"1852, and a spate of books on the decorative arts appeared, including",Paragraph
the influential Grammar of Ornament (1856) by Owen Jones (1809-74).,Paragraph
"In France, the Comité central des beaux-arts appliqués 4 l'industrie",Paragraph
"was founded (also in 1852), followed by the Union centrale des beaux-",Paragraph
"arts appliqués a I’ndustrie (1864), which later became the Union",Paragraph
centrale des arts décoratifs.,Paragraph
"Though originating from the same concerns, these institutional",Paragraph
reforms resulted in a different development in each country. In,Paragraph
"England, after the government initiatives of the 1830s, the reform of",Paragraph
"the arts became a private affair, dominated by a single individual, the",Paragraph
"artist and poet William Morris (1834-96). For Morris, as for the",Paragraph
"philosopher-critic John Ruskin (1819-1900), the reform of the indus-",Paragraph
trial arts was impossible under the present conditions of industrial,Paragraph
capitalism by which the artist was alienated from the product of his,Paragraph
"labour. In 1861, he set up the firm of Morris, Marshall, and Faulkner to",Paragraph
create a context for artists to relearn the various crafts under conditions,Paragraph
as near as possible to those of the medieval guilds. Morris’s initiative,Paragraph
"was followed up by others, creating what was to become known as the",Paragraph
Arts and Crafts movement.,Paragraph
The situation in France was different. First there was a politically,Paragraph
"influential art establishment, based on the Academy, fundamentally",Paragraph
"conservative, but aware of the need for reform and eager to promote it.*",Paragraph
"Secondly, the abolition of the guilds during the French Revolution had",Paragraph
not destroyed artisanal traditions in France as thoroughly as the,Paragraph
Industrial Revolution had those of England. When they began experi-,Paragraph
"menting with new techniques and forms in the 1870s, artists and",Paragraph
craftsmen working in the decorative arts such as Eugéne Rousseau,Paragraph
"(1827-91), Felix Bracquemond (1833-1914), and Emile Gallé (1846-1904)",Paragraph
were able to build upon existing craft traditions. The ultimate model for,Paragraph
"both English and French artists was the medieval guild, but in France",Paragraph
this model was combined with the more recent domestic tradition of,Paragraph
Rococo.,Paragraph
Viollet-le-Duc and structural rationalism,Title
"The Arts and Crafts movement and its off-shoot, the English ‘free-",Paragraph
style’ house were to have a considerable influence on the development,Paragraph
of Art Nouveau. But there was another influence at work as well—the,Paragraph
use of iron as an expressive architectural medium. The role of iron in,Paragraph
architecture had been central to the debates between traditionalist and,Paragraph
progressive-positivist architects in France throughout the nineteenth,Paragraph
century. The debate was stimulated by the projects of the Saint-,Paragraph
Simonian engineers and entrepreneurs who were largely responsible,Paragraph
for laying down the French technical infrastructure in the 1840s and,Paragraph
"1850s, and by discussions in the progressive magazine Revue de",Paragraph
l'Architecture under the editorship of César-Denis Daly (1811-93). But,Paragraph
it was chiefly through the theories and designs of Viollet-le-Duc that,Paragraph
"iron became associated with the reform of the decorative arts, and that",Paragraph
an idealist decorative movement became grafted onto the positivist,Paragraph
structural tradition.,Paragraph
The career of Viollet-le-Duc had been devoted to the distillation of,Paragraph
"the rational and vitalistic core of Gothic architecture, which he saw as",Paragraph
the only true basis for a modern architecture. The main precepts,Paragraph
Viollet bequeathed to the Art Nouveau movement were: the exposure,Paragraph
of the armature of a building as a visually logical system; the spatial,Paragraph
organization of its parts according to function rather than to rules of,Paragraph
symmetry and proportion; the importance of materials and their,Title
"properties as generators of form; the concept of organic form, deriving",Paragraph
from the Romantic movement; and the study of vernacular domestic,Title
architecture.,Paragraph
"Through two of his many books, Entretiens sur [’Architecture",Paragraph
(Lectures on Architecture) and the Dictionnaire Raisonné de l’Architecture,Title
"Francaise (Dictionary of French Architecture), Viollet-le-Duc became",Paragraph
the rallying point for all those opposed to the Beaux-Arts. This was,Paragraph
"true not only in France, where ‘alternative ateliers’ were set up (though",Paragraph
"these were soon reabsorbed into the Beaux-Arts system),’ but also",Paragraph
elsewhere in Europe and in North America. His influence on the Art,Paragraph
Nouveau movement came from both his theory and his designs.,Paragraph
Symbolism,Title
Most historians* agree that important changes took place in the intel-,Paragraph
lectual climate of Western Europe in the last two decades of the,Paragraph
nineteenth century. The century had been dominated by a belief in,Paragraph
"progress made possible by science and technology, a belief that found",Paragraph
its philosophical formulation in the movement known as Positivism,Paragraph
founded by Auguste Comte (1798-1857). In literature and art it was,Paragraph
Naturalism that corresponded most closely to the prevailing Positivist,Paragraph
frame of mind. But by the 1880s belief in Positivism had begun to,Paragraph
"erode, together with the faith in liberal politics that had supported",Paragraph
"it. Several political events no doubt contributed to this phenomenon,",Paragraph
including the terrible European economic depression that began,Paragraph
in 1873.,Paragraph

Correspondences (which incorporated Emanuel Swedenborg’s theory of,Paragraph
"synaesthesia, though probably unknowingly), gives voice to the idea",Paragraph
that the arts are intimately related to each other at a profound level:,Paragraph

"out of the body, rather than",Paragraph

Naturalistic representation is,Paragraph

concept.,Paragraph
work of the 1870s and 1880s [2].° Common to these proto-Art,Paragraph
Nouveau works was the principle that in ornament the imitation of,Paragraph
nature should be subordinated to the organization of the plane surface.,Paragraph
"In his book Du dessin et de la couleur (Drawing and Colour), published in",Paragraph
"1885, the ceramicist Felix Bracquemond defined the new concept in the",Paragraph
following terms: ‘Ornament does not necessarily copy nature even,Paragraph
when it borrows from her . . . Its infidelity to her . . . [is] due to the fact,Paragraph
"that it is solely concerned with embellishing surfaces, that it depends",Paragraph
"on the materials it has to adorn, on the forms it has to follow without",Paragraph
altering them.”,Paragraph
"In Art Nouveau, this ‘functional’ dependency of ornament led to a",Paragraph
"paradoxical reversal. Instead of merely obeying the form of the object,",Paragraph
"ornament began to merge with the object, animating it with new life.",Paragraph
"This had two effects: first, the object became thought of as a single",Paragraph
"organic entity rather than as an aggregation of separate parts, as in the",Paragraph
"classical tradition; second, ornament was no longer thought of as ‘space",Paragraph
"filling’, and a dialogue was set up between two positive values—orna-",Paragraph
ment and empty space. The discovery of what might be called ‘spatial,Paragraph
silence’—probably mainly derived from Japanese prints—was one of,Paragraph
Art Nouveau’s chief contributions to modern Western aesthetics.,Paragraph
"In this redefinition, the accepted boundary between ornament and",Paragraph
form became blurred. The classical attitude had been that ornament,Paragraph
was a supplementary form of beauty. It was the German archaeologist,Paragraph
Karl Bétticher (1806-89) who first suggested that ornament (Kunst-,Paragraph
"form) was organically related to the underlying substance of the object,",Paragraph
giving the inert mechanical structure (Kernform) the semblance of,Paragraph
organic life—an idea later used by Gottfried Semper (1803-79) in his,Paragraph

in ‘structuring’ the form and not in adorning it . . . The relations between the,Paragraph

"In their desire to extend these principles beyond the isolated object,",Paragraph

"William Morris, the Belgian Symbolist journal L’drt Moderne,",Paragraph

"In 1892, Willy Finch (1854-1936) and Henry van de Velde, members",Paragraph
"of the painters’ group Les XX, inaugurated a decorative art movement",Paragraph
based on the English Arts and Crafts Society. A year later the salon of,Paragraph
"Les XX devoted two rooms to the decorative arts, which were thereby",Paragraph
associated with the fine arts rather than the industrial arts. Les XX was,Paragraph
"superseded by Libre Esthétique in 1894. At the group’s first salon, Van",Paragraph

The early careers of Olbrich and Hoffman had almost identical,Paragraph

"In a lecture entitled ‘Modern Architecture’, delivered in Schenectady",Paragraph
"on g March 1884, the New York journalist and architectural critic",Paragraph
Montgomery Schuyler set out what he saw to be the problem facing,Paragraph
American architecture. Schuyler presented his argument in the form,Paragraph
of thesis and antithesis. He asserted the need for a universal culture of,Paragraph
architecture such as existed in Europe but was lacking in America due,Paragraph
"to the absence of good models. The Beaux-Arts system, he said,",Paragraph
"might provide the basis for such a culture, one that would inculcate",Paragraph
"the qualities of ‘sobriety, measure, and discretion’, were it not for the",Paragraph
fact that it failed to produce an architecture appropriate to modern,Paragraph
"life. Architecture, he says, is the most reactionary of the arts:",Paragraph
"“Whereas in literature the classical rules are used, in architecture they",Paragraph
are copied . . . in architecture alone does an archaeological study pass,Paragraph
"for a work of art .. . It is not the training that I am depreciating, but",Paragraph
the resting in the training as not a preparation but an attainment.’ He,Paragraph
went on to describe a confusion between language and architecture: ‘A,Paragraph
"word is a conventional symbol, whereas a true architectural form is a",Paragraph
direct expression of a mechanical fact.’,Paragraph
"Schuyler praised American architects, particularly those of",Paragraph
"Chicago, for attempting to adapt architecture to such technical prob-",Paragraph
"lems as the elevator and the steel frame, unhampered by too many",Paragraph
scruples about stylistic purity. Yet he felt that the problem had not been,Paragraph
fully solved. “The real structure of these towering buildings—the,Paragraph
"“Chicago construction’—is a structure of steel and baked clay, and",Paragraph
"when we look for the architectural expression of it, we look in vain.’",Paragraph
"Such an articulated structure, ‘being the ultimate expression of a struc-",Paragraph
"tural arrangement, cannot be foreseen, and the form .. . comes as a",Paragraph
surprise to the author’. Schuyler thus came out in favour of a direct and,Paragraph
expressive modern architecture. Yet he never explicitly rejected the,Paragraph
"Beaux-Arts tradition. Does he think that ‘sobriety, measure, and dis-",Paragraph
cretion’ should be sacrificed on the altar of verisimilitude? That Europe,Paragraph
"should be rejected? We are not told, and, in spite of his preference for",Paragraph
"the second alternative, one has the impression that the first has not",Paragraph
been completely abandoned.,Paragraph
Schuyler’s writings drew attention to a conflict between the,Paragraph
architect as manipulator of a visual ‘language’ (classicist) and as expo-,Paragraph
nent of a changing technology (organicist). This can be broken down,Paragraph
"into a series of further oppositions: collectivism versus individualism,",Paragraph
identity (nation) versus difference (region); the normative versus the,Paragraph
"unique; representation versus expression, the recognizable versus",Paragraph
the unexpected.,Paragraph
These oppositions constantly reappeared in the architectural,Paragraph
"debates of the early twentieth century. But in America, more transpar-",Paragraph

high national policy. It is in Chicago that this tendency manifested,Paragraph
itself most dramatically.,Paragraph
The Chicago School,Title
"After the fire of 1871 and the subsequent economic depression, Chicago",Paragraph
experienced an extraordinary boom in commercial real estate. The,Paragraph
architects who flocked to the city to profit from this situation brought,Paragraph
with them a strong professional sense of mission. They saw their task,Paragraph
"as the creation of a new architectural culture, believing that architec-",Paragraph
ture should express regional character and be based on modern,Paragraph
techniques. The situation in Chicago seemed to offer the possibility of,Paragraph
a new synthesis of technology and aesthetics and of the creation of an,Paragraph
architecture that symbolized the energy of the Mid-west.,Paragraph
The term ‘Chicago School’ was first used in 1908 by Thomas,Paragraph
"Tallmadge to refer to the group of domestic architects, active between",Paragraph
"1893 and 1917, to which both he and Frank Lloyd Wright (1867-1959)",Paragraph
belonged. It was not until 1929 that it was also used for the commercial,Paragraph
architects of the 1880s and 1890s by the architectural critic Henry,Paragraph
Russell Hitchcock (1903~87) in his book Modern Architecture: Rom-,Paragraph
anticism and Reintegration. Hitchcock associated both groups of,Paragraph
architects with ‘pre-modern’ Symbolists such as Victor Horta. In the,Paragraph
19408 he made a new distinction between a commercial and a domestic,Paragraph
"phase of the school. But in contemporary usage, a complete reversal",Paragraph

"mercial architecture of the 1880s and 1890s, while the work of Frank",Paragraph
Lloyd Wright and his colleagues is referred to as the ‘Prairie School’.,Paragraph
This is the terminology that will be adopted here.,Paragraph

The problem that Sullivan,Title
solved so brilliantly in the,Paragraph

was that of reconciling the,Paragraph

with the ‘democratic’,Title

though it would certainly not have worked visually in a building of rad-,Paragraph

In his essay entitled “The Tall Office Building Artistically Con-,Paragraph
"sidered’ (1896), Sullivan claimed that the organization of the",Paragraph
"Wainwright type of building into three clearly stated layers, with their",Paragraph
"corresponding functions, was an application of ‘organic’ principles. In",Paragraph
"order to judge the validity of this claim, it will be necessary briefly to",Paragraph
"consider Sullivan’s architectural theory, as found in his two books,",Paragraph
Kindergarten Chats and The Autobiography of an Idea. More than any of,Paragraph
"the other Chicago architects, Sullivan had been influenced by the New",Paragraph
"England philosophical school of Transcendentalism. This philosophy,",Paragraph
"whose chief spokesman had been Ralph Waldo Emerson, was largely",Paragraph
"derived from German Idealism, into which Sullivan had been initiated",Paragraph
by his anarchist friend John H. Edelman. The ‘organic’ idea can be,Paragraph
traced back to the Romantic movement of around 1800—particularly to,Paragraph
"such writers as Schelling and the Schlegel brothers, who believed that",Paragraph
"the external form of the work of art should, as in plants and animals, be",Paragraph
"the product ofan inner force or essence, rather than being mechanically",Paragraph
"imposed from without, as they judged to be the case with classicism.*",Paragraph
"Those architectural theorists who, in their different ways, were",Paragraph
heirs to this idea and to the concomitant notion of tectonic expres-,Paragraph
"sion—such as Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Horatio Greenough, and",Paragraph
"Viollet-le-Duc—had acknowledged that, when applied to human",Paragraph
"artefacts, the concept of a ‘natural’ aesthetic had to be extended to",Paragraph
include socially derived normative values.’ Sullivan ignored this cul-,Paragraph
tural factor and based his argument purely on the analogy between,Paragraph
architecture and nature. But in practice he tacitly accepted customary,Paragraph
norms. The Wainwright facade was derived from the tradition he so,Paragraph
vehemently condemned—the classical—-Baroque aesthetic enshrined,Paragraph
in Beaux-Arts teaching. In ‘correcting’ the Chicago architects’ mis-,Paragraph
"taken interpretation of this tradition, he was, in fact, returning to the",Paragraph
classical principle they had discarded: the need for the facade to have a,Paragraph
tripartite hierarchy corresponding to the functional distribution of the,Paragraph
interior.,Paragraph
The Wainwright Building can certainly be called a ‘solution’ to the,Paragraph
problem of the Chicago office fagade. But its very brilliance brought,Paragraph
with it certain problems. The ‘impure’ solutions of the Chicago,Paragraph
"School, including Sullivan’s own Auditorium Building, had the merit",Paragraph
"of presenting to the street a complex, contrapuntal texture capable of",Paragraph
being read as part of a continuous urban fabric. The Wainwright,Paragraph
"Building, with its vertical emphasis and strongly marked corner",Paragraph

Sullivan was originally offered a partnership by Adler on the,Paragraph
strength of his skill as an ornamentalist and designer of facades.,Paragraph
Sullivan believed that the visible expression of a building spiritualized,Paragraph
"an otherwise inarticulate structure. Adler, on the other hand, thought",Paragraph
that the facade merely gave the finishing touches to an organizational,Paragraph
"and structural concept. This difference of view, whether it shows Adler",Paragraph
"to have been the better organicist or merely more practical, seems to",Paragraph
"have given rise to a simmering conflict between the two men, and this",Paragraph
is indirectly revealed in a statement made by Adler after the partner-,Paragraph
ship had broken up (due to lack of commissions): “The architect is not,Paragraph
"allowed to wait until, seized by an irresistible impulse from within, he",Paragraph
gives the world the result of his studies and musings. He is of the world,Paragraph
as well as in it.”,Paragraph
Sullivan's catastrophic professional failure a few years after the,Paragraph
dissolution of the partnership was no doubt due to a complicated,Paragraph
"mixture of psychological, ideological, and economic factors. But already",Paragraph
in the 1890s the climate of opinion in Chicago was changing. Architects,Paragraph
no longer listened to the Transcendental message they had found so,Paragraph
"compelling a short time before, nor were they so interested in Sullivan's",Paragraph
doctrine of the redemption of a materialistic society through inspired,Title

The World’s Columbian Exposition,Title
The turn towards classicism inaugurated by the Chicago World’s,Paragraph
Exposition of 1893 was related to a number of contemporary political,Paragraph
and economic events in America. The most important of these were,Paragraph

tion of the ‘open-door’ trade policy for a country now ready to take its,Paragraph
"place on the world stage, and the rise of a collectivist politics both",Paragraph

these developments: ‘During this period [the 1890s] there was well,Paragraph

"terra firma... monopoly was in the air” According to Sullivan,",Paragraph
Daniel Burnham was the only architect in Chicago to catch this,Paragraph
"movement, because, ‘in its tendency towards bigness, organization,",Paragraph
"delegation, and intense commercialism, he sensed the reciprocal",Paragraph
workings of his own mind’. These developments were responsible for,Paragraph
sounding the death knell of the philosophy of individualism that had,Paragraph

The Werkbund’s orientation towards high-quality goods for mass,Paragraph

"people do not have the money to hire artists, and, consequently, many",Paragraph

Form or Gestalt,Title
The need to assimilate the machine to the artistic principles of the Arts,Paragraph
and Crafts movement entailed a reconceptualization of the role of the,Paragraph
artist. Morris’s conception of the artist-craftsman as someone physi-,Paragraph

as ‘form giver’. The new concept was put forward at the Werkbund,Paragraph
"congress of 1908 by the sculptor Rudolf Bosselt, and reaffirmed by",Paragraph

beginning with Immanuel Kant’s isolation of art as an autonomous,Paragraph
"system, and culminating in the theory of ‘pure visibility’ (Sicbrbarkeit)",Paragraph
propounded by the philosopher of aesthetics Conrad Fiedler.,Paragraph
Muthesius and the notion of type,Title
Closely connected with the idea of Gestalt was Muthesius’s concept of,Paragraph
Typisierung (typification)—a word he coined to denote the establish-,Paragraph
ment of standard or typical forms.’ His argument was the apparently,Paragraph
"trivial one that mass production entails standardization. But, relying",Paragraph
"on the ambiguity inherent in the word ‘type’, Muthesius conflated a",Paragraph
pragmatic notion of standardization with the idea of the ‘type’ as a,Paragraph
"Platonic universal. Only through typification, he said, ‘can architecture",Paragraph
recover that universal significance which was characteristic of it in,Paragraph
times of harmonious culture’.”°,Paragraph
Muthesius’s concept of a unified culture was an attack on /aissez-,Paragraph
"faire capitalism, though not on monopoly capitalism. For him, and for",Paragraph
"many within the Werkbund who shared his views, the degeneration of",Paragraph
"modern taste was due not, as Ruskin had thought, to the machine as",Paragraph
"such, but to the cultural disorder caused by the operation of the",Paragraph
"market, and the destabilizing effect of fashion. If the middle-man who",Paragraph
manipulated the market could be eliminated it would be possible to,Paragraph
recover the direct relationship between producer and consumer and,Paragraph
"between technique and culture, that had existed in pre-capitalist soci-",Paragraph
eties. Muthesius foresaw the emergence of large factories for the,Paragraph
production of consumer goods similar to the trusts and cartels that,Paragraph
were becoming increasingly characteristic of German heavy industry.,Paragraph
"These firms, producing goods of standardized artistic quality, would be",Paragraph
"able to dominate the market and act as the sole arbiters of taste, operat-",Paragraph
ing as the modern equivalent of the medieval guilds.’,Paragraph
When Muthesius presented his notion of Typisierung at the,Paragraph
Werkbund congress of rg14 at Cologne it was strongly criticized by a,Paragraph
"group of artists, architects, and critics which included Van de Velde,",Paragraph
Bruno Taut (1880-1938) and Walter Gropius (1883-1969). Van de,Paragraph
"Velde, though a passionate disciple of William Morris, did not ques-",Paragraph
"tion the need for machine production, nor did he disagree with the",Paragraph
notion of a unified culture. But he disagreed with the bureaucratic,Paragraph
"methods proposed by Muthesius. For him and his supporters, culture",Paragraph
could not be created by the imposition of typical forms. High artistic,Paragraph
quality depended on the freedom of the individual artist. Fixed types,Paragraph
"did indeed emerge in all artistic cultures, but they were the end-prod-",Paragraph
"ucts of an evolutionary process of artistic development, not its initial",Paragraph
condition. Muthesius had simply reversed the order of cause and,Paragraph
effect. This celebrated conflict has usually been interpreted as a battle,Paragraph
between the avant-garde supporters of a new machine culture and the,Paragraph
regressive supporters of an outdated handicraft tradition. The truth is,Paragraph
"more complex, and to understand the situation it is necessary to disen-",Paragraph
tangle the confusion that reigned at the time as to the status of the,Paragraph
‘artist’ in the modern industrial arts.,Paragraph
The debate between Van de Velde and Muthesius cannot be seen,Paragraph
merely as the conflict between handicraft and the machine (though it,Paragraph
was this as well) since the ambiguous figure of the ‘artist’ appears as,Paragraph
"chief protagonist on both sides. Both groups believed that, under con-",Paragraph
"ditions of machine production, division of labour had separated",Paragraph
technique from art and that it was necessary to reintroduce the artist,Paragraph
"into the production process. They differed, however, in their interpreta-",Paragraph
tion of role that the artist would now play. Insofar as he saw the artist as,Paragraph
"a specialist in ‘pure form’, divorced from the mechanics of craft (now the",Paragraph
"domain of the machine), Muthesius’s position seems ‘progressive’,",Paragraph
seeking to adapt the artist to the abstract processes of capitalism. But,Paragraph
Van de Velde’s concept of the evolutionary process of style formation,Paragraph
"was more compatible with the conditions of market capitalism, and in",Paragraph
that sense more ‘modern’ than Muthesius’s bureaucratic model. To what,Paragraph
"extent Van de Velde, with his strongly held socialist views, grasped the",Paragraph
connection between the artistic freedom he was proposing and the mar-,Paragraph
"ketplace is an intriguing question, but the connection is clearly reflected",Paragraph
"in the writings of his patron and supporter, Karl Ernst Osthaus.”",Paragraph
Originally Muthesius had also held to this concept of the individu-,Paragraph
"alistic artist. For example, he had been in favour of the law of 1907",Paragraph
which gave the applied artist the copyright protection that was already,Paragraph
enjoyed by the fine artist.!’ But some time between 1907 and 1910 he,Paragraph
seems to have moved towards the idea that the artist should not seek,Paragraph
"originality, but should be the conduit for universal aesthetic laws, a view",Paragraph
that was in line with the prevalent neo-Kantian aesthetic philosophy.,Paragraph
Muthesius now argued that there was a kinship between the law-like,Paragraph
stability and anonymity of the classical and vernacular traditions on the,Paragraph
"one hand, and the repetitiveness, regularity, and simplicity of machined",Paragraph
"forms on the other. Machined forms were the modern, historical",Paragraph
"instance of a universal law. Though this idea did not exclude the artist,",Paragraph
"it did demand that the personality of the artist should be controlled.""",Paragraph
Muthesius sought to implement these ideas by creating an organi-,Paragraph
"zational framework within which future artists would have to work,",Paragraph
thus reverting to archaic processes similar to those that Karl Friedrich,Paragraph
Schinkel had adopted when commissioned to ‘normalize’ the rural,Paragraph
"architecture of Prussia a century earlier. In Muthesius, therefore, we",Paragraph
"see the fusion of two ideologies, the one bureaucratic and nationalistic,",Paragraph
the other classicizing and normative. Though it is difficult to say at,Paragraph
"what level these ideologies are, in fact, connected, they appear to have",Paragraph
been inseparable within the context of architectural discourse in the,Paragraph
years leading up to the First World War in Germany. It was a combina-,Paragraph

Style and ideology,Title
Another aspect of the battle between Muthesius’s concept of type and,Paragraph

The standardization required by machine production was seen to rec-,Paragraph
oncile modernity with classical humanism. But the demand for the,Paragraph
"freedom of the artist was also associated with a Nietzschian, Dionysian,",Paragraph
anarchistic urge not to try to tame the disorder of modernity but to,Paragraph
plunge into its terrifying and nihilistic stream. These different attitudes,Paragraph
"correspond to two groups of architects. Among the classicizing group,",Paragraph
two will be discussed here—Heinrich Tessenow (1876-1950) and Peter,Paragraph
Behrens—and their work will be compared to that of the young Walter,Paragraph

Tessenow’s housing projects were supported by a social theory that,Paragraph
romanticized the petite bourgeoisie as the foundation of traditional,Paragraph

Not that the building lacks optical tricks. But it no longer makes,Paragraph

Adolf Loos (1870-1933) occupies a unique place in the history of,Paragraph
"modern architecture. A maverick who refused to join any ‘club’, he was",Paragraph
not only a powerful thinker able to expose the contradictions of con-,Paragraph
"temporary theory but an architect whose work, though small in output,",Paragraph
was provocative and highly original. His influence on the succeeding,Paragraph
"generation of architects, particularly Le Corbusier, was enormous, and",Paragraph
"his ideas have, through successive reinterpretations, maintained their",Paragraph
relevance to the present day.,Paragraph
"The son ofa stonemason, Loos was born in Brno, Moravia (at the time part",Paragraph
"of the Austro-Hungarian empire, now in the Czech Republic) and studied at",Paragraph
"the Imperial State Technical College in Vienna, and the Dresden College of",Paragraph
"technology. In 1893 he travelled to America, where his uncle had emigrated,",Paragraph
ng the Columbia World’s Fair and eventually starting a small practice in,Paragraph
"New York before returning to Austria in 1896. As a result of this experience,",Paragraph
he was to retain a lifelong admiration for Anglo-American culture.,Paragraph
Although he belonged to the same generation as the main figures of,Paragraph
"the Art Nouveau and Jugendstil movements, Loos reacted strongly",Paragraph
against their attempt to replace Beaux-Arts eclecticism with what he,Paragraph
"saw as a superficial system of ornament. He was not, of course, alone in",Paragraph
"his rejection of Jugendstil and its ideology of the Gesamrkunstwerk, In",Paragraph
"Germany by 1902, as we have seen, designers like Richard",Paragraph
"Riemerschmid and Bruno Paul had abandoned this style, and in",Paragraph
"Austria Josef Hoffmann, the founder of the Wiener Werkstitte, had",Paragraph
drastically simplified the Secessionist vocabulary. But Loos’s critique,Paragraph
was more fundamental than theirs; it was based on a rejection of the,Paragraph
very concept of ‘art’ when applied to the design of objects for everyday,Paragraph
use. Whereas Van de Velde and the Jugendstil movement had wanted,Paragraph
"to eliminate the distinction between the craftsman and the artist, Loos",Paragraph
saw the split between them as irreversible. Far from believing in a,Paragraph
unified culture in which the craftsman and the artist would be,Paragraph
"reunited, he readily accepted the distinction between the objects of",Paragraph
everyday life and imaginative works of art. But for Loos that distinc-,Paragraph
tion was not based on the division of hand-work and machine-work or,Paragraph
of mental conception and execution—the issue that was so important,Paragraph
for the ideologues of the Werkbund. What defined the useful object,Paragraph
was not its mode of manufacture but its purpose. Perfection of execu-,Paragraph
tion should be the aim of hand-work and machine-work alike. In both,Paragraph
cases the maker should not express individuality but should be the,Paragraph
transmitter of impersonal cultural values. Loos’s enthusiasm for the,Paragraph
English Arts and Crafts movement was based not only on the quality,Paragraph
"ofits workmanship, but also on the fact that it did not strive for the wil-",Paragraph
"fully new, but respected tradition and custom.",Paragraph
It was as a writer of polemical articles that Loos first became,Paragraph
"known. His aphoristic, witty, and sarcastic pieces, which gained him as",Paragraph
"many enemies as friends, resembled the writings of his close friend, the",Paragraph
"poet Karl Kraus (1874-1936), editor and sole writer of the satirical",Paragraph
"journal Die Fackel (The Torch), published from 1899 to 1936. In this",Paragraph
journal Kraus pursued a relentless campaign against the Austrian cul-,Paragraph
"tural and political establishment and its journalists, whose abuse of",Paragraph
language he saw as betraying unfathomable depths of hypocrisy and,Paragraph
moral degradation.’ Loos himself started a journal—Das Andere (The,Paragraph
"Other)—which, however, appeared in only two numbers in 1903, as",Paragraph
"supplements in Peter Altenberg’s journal Die Kunst. This publication,",Paragraph
subtitled 4 Journal for the Introduction of Western Civilization into,Caption
"Austria, paralleled Die Fackel’s cultural critique in the sphere of the",Paragraph
"useful arts, comparing Austrian culture unfavourably with that of",Paragraph
England and America. Loos’s articles attacked not only Austrian,Paragraph
"middle-class culture, but also the very ‘avant-garde’ culture that aimed",Paragraph
to supersede it.?,Paragraph
Loos’s writings shifted the debate on the reform of the applied arts,Paragraph
into a new register—one that was eventually to turn him into the,Paragraph
unwitting father figure of the 1920s Modern Movement. In his essay,Paragraph
"‘Ornament and Crime’ (1908), he claimed that the elimination of",Paragraph
ornament from useful objects was the result of a cultural evolution,Paragraph
leading to the abolition of waste and superfluity from human labour.,Paragraph
"This process was not harmful but beneficial to culture, reducing the",Paragraph
time spent on manual labour and releasing energy for the life of the,Paragraph
mind.,Paragraph
The essay was not merely an attack on the Viennese Secession and,Paragraph
"Jugendstil, it was also an attack on the Werkbund, founded a year",Paragraph
"earlier. As we have seen, Muthesius’s aim for the Werkbund was to give",Paragraph
"the artist a form-giving role within industry, and thus to establish the",Paragraph
"Gestalt of the machine age. ’To Loos, this was unacceptable—not, as for",Paragraph
"Van de Velde and Gropius, because it would destroy the freedom of the",Paragraph
artist but precisely because it envisaged the artist as the primary agent,Paragraph
in the creation of everyday objects. Loos believed that the ‘style of an,Paragraph
epoch’ was always the result of multiple economic and cultural forces.,Paragraph
"It was not something which the producer, aided by the artist, should",Paragraph
"try to impose on the consumer: ‘Germany makes, the world takes. At",Paragraph
least it should. But it does not want to. It wants to create its own forms,Paragraph
for its own life rather than have them imposed by some arbitrary pro-,Paragraph
ducers’ association.”,Paragraph
"With his aim of involving the artist in industry, Muthesius (Loos’s",Paragraph
argument implied} was merely substituting form for ornament in an,Paragraph
attempt to add a fictitious ‘spiritual’ quality to the social economy and,Paragraph
to bind Kultur and Zivilisation together in a new organic synthesis. But,Paragraph
such a synthesis was neither possible nor necessary. An ineradicable,Paragraph
gap had opened up between art-value and use-value. In tearing them,Paragraph
"apart, capitalism had liberated them both. Art and the design of use-",Paragraph
objects now existed as independent and autonomous practices: “We are,Paragraph
grateful to [the nineteenth century] for the magnificent accomplish-,Paragraph
ment of having separated the arts and the crafts once and for all.’* The,Paragraph
search for the ‘style of the time’ that Muthesius’s types were intended,Paragraph
to express was still based on a nostalgia for the pre-industrial ‘organic’,Paragraph
"society. In fact, a style of the modern age already existed—in industrial",Paragraph
products without any artistic pretensions:,Paragraph
All those trades which have managed to keep this superfluous creature [the,Paragraph
artist] out of their workshops are at present at the peak of their ability. . .,Paragraph
[their] products . . . capture the style of our time so well that we do not even,Paragraph
look on them as having style. They have become entwined with our thoughts,Paragraph
"and feelings. Our carriage construction, our glasses, our optical instruments,",Paragraph
"our umbrellas and canes, our luggage and saddlery, our silver cigarette cases,",Paragraph
our jewellery... and clothes—they are all modern.*,Paragraph
The attempt consciously to create the formal ‘types’ of the new age was,Paragraph
"doomed to fail, just as Van de Velde’s attempt to create a new ornament",Paragraph
had failed: “No one has tried to put his podgy finger into the turning,Paragraph
wheel of time without having his hand torn off.”,Paragraph
"According to Loos, art could now survive in only two (absolutely",Paragraph
antithetical) forms: firstly as the free creation of works of art that no,Paragraph
longer had any social responsibility and were therefore able to project,Paragraph
ideas into the future and criticize contemporary society; and secondly,Paragraph
in the design of buildings which embodied the collective memory.,Paragraph
Loos schematized these buildings as Denkmal (the monument) and,Paragraph
"Grabmal (the tomb).’ For Loos, the private house belonged to the cat-",Paragraph
"egory of the useful, not to that of the monument, hence the rarity in his",Paragraph
"houses of a fully developed classical language, except for a brief period",Paragraph
between rgrg and 1923 (see page 83).,Paragraph
Decorum,Title
Loos identified the surviving realm of the monument with the antique:,Paragraph
"‘The architect’, he said, ‘is a stonemason who has learned Latin,®",Paragraph
echoing Vitruvius’s statement that knowledge of building grows,Paragraph
equally out of fabrica (material) and rafio (reason).’ His attitude to the,Paragraph
"classical tradition differed from that of Otto Wagner or Behrens, for",Paragraph
"whom a synthesis between art (spirit, soul) and rationality was still",Paragraph
"possible, and who wanted to adapt classicism to modern conditions.",Paragraph
"For Loos, as for Kraus, the antique had preserved in language the",Paragraph
search for a ‘lost image of the primordial’.’° Its syntax should either be,Paragraph
"imitated to the letter, even if made with modern materials, or not at all:",Paragraph
“Modern architects seem more like Esperantists. Drawing instruction,Paragraph
"needs to proceed from classical ornament.”! By the same token, both",Paragraph
"he and Kraus believed in the importance of the tradition of rhetoric,",Paragraph
"particularly its distinction between genres and its concept of decorum,",Paragraph
which divides the continuum of lived experience into discrete units. As,Paragraph
Kraus wrote:,Paragraph
"Adolf Loos and I, he in reality, 1 in words, have done nothing else than show",Paragraph
that there is a difference between an urn and a chamberpot and that this dif-,Paragraph
"ference is necessary because it guarantees the game of culture. The others, on",Paragraph
"the contrary, the defenders of ‘positive’ values, are divided between those who",Paragraph
mistake the urn for a chamberpot and those who mistake the chamberpot for,Paragraph
anurn.”,Paragraph
"For Loos, this sensibility of ‘difference’ was exacerbated, not elimi-",Paragraph
"nated, by the dislocations brought about by industrialization. As",Paragraph
"Massimo Cacciari has pointed out, modernity, for Loos, was consti-",Paragraph
"tuted by different and mutually intransitive ‘language games’.""* Loos",Paragraph
"thought in terms of art and industry, art and handicraft, music and",Paragraph
"drama, never in terms of a Gesamfkunstwerk that would synthesize",Paragraph
these different genres in a modern ‘community of the arts’.,Paragraph
In his designs for the War Ministry in Vienna (1907) and the monu-,Paragraph
"ment to the Emperor Franz Josef (1917), Loos adopted a neoclassicism",Paragraph
"which, though clearly mediated by the Beaux-Arts, was more literal",Paragraph
than the classicizing work of Wagner or Behrens. These types of build-,Paragraph
ing belonged to the category of Denkma/. But what about those,Paragraph
"buildings in the public realm which could make, at best, only weak",Paragraph
claims to monumentality—commercial buildings? In the latter part of,Paragraph
"his career Loos designed several large office blocks and hotels, none of",Paragraph
which were built.,Paragraph
The only realized project in which Loos addressed the problem of,Paragraph
inserting a large commercial building in a historical urban context was,Paragraph
the ‘Looshaus’ in Michaelerplatz of 1909-11 [45]. The ground floor,Caption
and mezzanine of this building were to be occupied by the fashionable,Paragraph
"gentlemen’s outfitters, Goldman and Salatsch, and the upper floors by",Caption
apartments. The problem faced by Loos was that of designing a,Paragraph
modern commercial building in a fashionable shopping street close to,Paragraph
"the Imperial Palace. Here, Loos’s idea of decorum came into full play;",Paragraph
"he decorated the lower floors, which belonged to the public realm, with",Paragraph

using false facades to look like Italian palazzi. Instead of creating a,Paragraph
"unified classical ‘palace’, Loos treated each part of the building in a way",Paragraph
"appropriate to its function, the building’s disjunctive parts reflecting",Paragraph
the disjunctions of modern capitalism. Whereas Behrens in his,Paragraph

"Nearly all of Loos’s early projects were for interior remodellings, and",Paragraph

32-3). But Loos’s critique of the Gesamfkunstwerk went further than,Paragraph
"theirs. Unlike Bruno Paul’s rooms, where the recognizably classical",Paragraph
"furnishings were unified by the architect’s personal style, Loos’s interi-",Paragraph

the architects . . . all mobile items are made by our craftsmen in the,Paragraph
modern idiom (never by architects)—everyone may buy these for,Paragraph

"with a vernacular style directly indebted to M. H. Baillie Scott, whose",Paragraph
interiors for the Grand Ducal Palace in Darmstadt (1897) had acted as,Paragraph
a stimulant to the anti-Jugendstil reaction in Germany.’ The living,Paragraph

period than to English,Title
"houses, where the rooms",Paragraph
were generally isolated from,Paragraph
each other.,Paragraph
faced fireplaces [47]. Loos later adapted this apartment typology to the,Paragraph
demands of the multi-storey house.,Paragraph
Loos’s commercial interiors have the same anonymous quality as his,Paragraph
apartments. The journal Das Interieur described Loos’s first shop for,Paragraph
Goldman and Salatsch (1898) as follows: “The Viennese gentlemen’s,Paragraph
outfitters shows unmistakably that the creator was aiming at English,Paragraph
"elegance, without reference to any particular model. Smooth reflecting",Paragraph
"surfaces, narrow shapes, shining metal—these are the main elements",Paragraph
from which this impeccably fashionable interior is composed.” The,Paragraph
"decor included built-in storage units, glazed or mirrored, with close",Paragraph
"verticals which recall Wagner's work, as well as refined and geometrical",Paragraph
"ornament reminiscent of the Wiener Werkstiitte. In addition to shops,",Paragraph
Loos designed several cafés. For the Museum Café in Vienna (1899)—,Paragraph
"which, to Loos’s delight, acquired the nickname Café Nihilismus",Paragraph
because of its iconoclaam—Loos used specially designed Thonet,Paragraph
"chairs and marble tables. By contrast, in the Kiirntner Bar in Vienna",Paragraph
(t907) Loos exploits the intimacy of a small room at the same time as,Paragraph
he extends the space to infinity by the use of uninterrupted mirror on,Paragraph
the upper part of the wall [44 (see page 72)].,Paragraph
The house,Title
"In his Exfretiens, Viollet-le-Duc had noted a fundamental difference",Paragraph

purpose and character. The parts dominated the whole. In the French,Paragraph
"house, on the contrary, the ruling principle was the family unit. The",Paragraph
"rooms were thinly partitioned subdivisions of a cubic volume, ensuring",Paragraph
constant social contact. It was the English type that became increas-,Paragraph
"ingly popular in the late nineteenth century, responding to the",Paragraph
prevailing spirit of bourgeois individualism. What Viollet did not,Paragraph
"mention was that, under the influence of neo-medieval ideas of social",Paragraph
"harmony, this individualism was modified by the appearance of a large",Paragraph
"central hall, based on the traditional English manor house.",Paragraph
"Originating with Norman Shaw in the 1860s, this double-height space",Paragraph
"became a prominent feature of the houses of Baillie Scott (Blackwell,",Paragraph
"Bowness, 1898), Van de Velde (Bloemenwerf, 1895), H. P. Berlage",Caption
"(Villa Henny, 1898), Josef Hoffmann (Palais Stoclet, rgo5—1), and",Caption
countless other houses of the period.,Paragraph
This evolution culminated in the series of large suburban villas that,Paragraph
Loos built between 1910 and 1930. In these Loos converted the central,Paragraph
hall into an open staircase and compressed a number of highly individ-,Paragraph
"ualized rooms into a cube, thus synthesizing Viollet-le-Duc’s two",Paragraph
models. The greatest differentiation between the rooms occurred on,Paragraph
"the piano nobile, where reception rooms at different levels and with dif-",Paragraph
ferent ceiling heights were connected to each other by short flights of,Paragraph
"stairs, their increments forming a kind of irregular spiral ascending",Paragraph
through the house [48]. Loos described this spatial organization in,Paragraph
somewhat apocalyptic terms:,Paragraph
This is architecture’s great revolutionary moment—the transformation of the,Paragraph
"floor plan into volume. Before Immanuel Kant, men could not think in terms",Paragraph
of volume; architects were forced to make the bathroom the same height as the,Paragraph
great hall. The only way of creating lower ceilings . . . was to divide them in,Paragraph
"half. But [as] with the invention of three-dimensional chess, future architects",Paragraph
"will now be able to expand floor plans into space.""",Paragraph
Loos’s Raumplan (as he called it) turned the experience of the house,Paragraph
"into a spatio-temporal labyrinth, making it difficult to form a mental",Paragraph
image of the whole. The way the inhabitant moved from one space to,Paragraph
another was highly controlled (though sometimes there were alterna-,Paragraph
"tive routes), but no a priori system of expectation was established, as it",Paragraph
would be in a classical plan. In the late Moller and Miiller houses an,Paragraph
intimate Ladies’ Boudoir was added to the set of reception rooms and,Caption
"placed at the highest point of the sequence, so that it acted simultane-",Paragraph
"ously as a command post and an inner sanctum.”° Often, diagonal",Paragraph
views were opened up through sequences of rooms [49].,Paragraph
"In the spatial ordering of these houses, the walls played an essential",Paragraph
"role, both phenomenally and structurally. The variability of floor levels",Paragraph
demanded that the walls (or at least their geometrical traces—some-,Paragraph
times they are replaced by beams resting on piers) continued vertically,Paragraph

also allowed the plan to,Paragraph

through all floors. Spatial continuity between rooms was created not by,Paragraph
omitting walls but by piercing them with wide openings so that views,Paragraph
were always framed and the sensation of the room’s spatial closure was,Paragraph
"maintained. Often the connection between rooms was only visual, as",Paragraph
"through a proscenium. At their interface, these spaces had a theatrical",Paragraph
quality. Beatriz Colomina has wittily noted that in a Loos interior,Paragraph
someone always seems about to make an entrance.”! The external walls,Paragraph
played a different though equally important role. They were pierced by,Paragraph
relatively small openings which did not allow any sustained visual,Paragraph
"contact with the outside world. Loos’s houses were hermetic cubes,",Paragraph
difficult to penetrate.,Paragraph
When Loos said “The walls belong to the architect’ he did not mean,Paragraph
"the contemporary architect, who had ‘reduced building to a graphic",Paragraph
"art’,” but the Baumeister who fashions the object he is making directly",Paragraph
in three dimensions. This return to a pre-Renaissance concept con-,Paragraph
nects Loos to the Romantic movement. Whatever the differences,Paragraph
between Loos and the Expressionist architect Bruno Taut (see pages,Paragraph
"go-2), they shared the Romantic idea that architecture should be a",Paragraph
natural and spontaneous language.”* His Baumeister is a descendant of,Paragraph
the eponymous hero of E. T. A. Hoffmann’s story Councillor Krespel. In,Paragraph
"this story, the Councillor, instead of using plans, traced the outline of",Paragraph
his house on the ground and when the walls reached a certain height,Paragraph
instructed the builder where to cut out the openings.* The analogy,Paragraph
"with Loos seems especially apt in the case of the Rufer House (1922),",Paragraph
with its square plan and its random windows which obey the secret rule,Paragraph
of the interior [50].,Caption
"Externally, Loos’s villas were cubes without ornament [51]. In",Paragraph

as,Title
he has penetrated,Paragraph
"the external wall, this ‘man of nerves’ is enmeshed in a ‘feminine’ and",Paragraph
"the modern metropolis.” But, in Loos’s houses, once",Paragraph
"sensuous complexity, full of those residues of cultural memory and",Paragraph
association that have been banished from the building’s exterior. The,Paragraph
disjunction between the inside and the outside echoes Loos’s concept,Paragraph
of an irrevocable split in modernity between tradition and the modern,Paragraph
techno-scientific world—between lived-in ‘place’ (Or?) and calculated,Paragraph
‘space’ (Raum).,Paragraph
"After the First World War, Loos’s houses underwent certain",Paragraph
"changes. Between 1919 and 1923, he designed a series of villas, none of",Paragraph
"which were built, with elevations and plans that are neoclassical in",Paragraph
"style, though in some, for example the Villa Konstadt of rg1g, neo-",Paragraph
"classical symmetry and Raumplan traits coexist. At the same time,",Paragraph
villas such as the Rufer House combined classicism in its cornices and,Paragraph
"cubic shape, with vernacular in its irregular windows. A picturesque",Paragraph
neoclassicism was not uncommon in central Europe at this time—we,Paragraph
"find it, for example, in the work of Peter Behrens, Karl Moser, and Joze",Paragraph
Pletnik. But for Loos it was a complete volte-face. These houses give,Paragraph
"back the right of monumental representation to the interior, and use",Paragraph
the same stylistic code for interior and exterior alike—something that,Paragraph
was assiduously avoided in the pre-war houses.,Paragraph
But this neoclassical interlude was short-lived and Loos picked up,Paragraph
the thread of his earlier Raxmp/an designs in his three last houses: the,Paragraph
"Tzara House (1926) in Paris (where Loos lived from 1923 to 1928), the",Paragraph

The critical reception of Loos,Title
"Until the 1970s, architectural historians tended to cast Loos as a proto-",Paragraph
Modernist and to attribute the apparent contradictions in his writings,Paragraph
and work to his position as a ‘transitory’ historical figure. The chief,Paragraph
problem for these critics lay in what seemed to be Loos’s ambivalence,Paragraph
towards conflicting values of tradition and modernity. On the one,Paragraph
"hand, his harsh rejection of ornament and the applied arts and his",Paragraph
belief in the implacable forces of history suggested that he had settled,Paragraph
"for a new technical culture, devoid of the ‘aura’ of the pre-industrial",Paragraph

other hand he appeared as the defender of this tradition against the,Paragraph
encroachments of Modernism.,Paragraph
"However, certain critics of the 1970s argued that beneath the ‘con-",Paragraph

Expressionist architecture,Title
Expressionist architecture is notoriously difficult to define. As Iain,Paragraph
"Boyd Whyte has observed, the movement has usually been defined in",Paragraph
"terms of what it is not (rationalism, functionalism, and so on) rather",Paragraph
"than what it is,* and there is some truth in the opinion that",Paragraph
Expressionism is a permanent and recurrent tendency in modern,Paragraph
architecture. Buildings which are commonly classified as Expressionist,Paragraph
"include such divergent groups as the early work of Hans Poelzig, the",Paragraph
"Jugendstil ‘Amsterdam School’, and architects of the 1920s such as",Paragraph
Erich Mendelsohn and Hugo Hiring; but these are also often more,Paragraph
"fruitfully discussed in other contexts. Here, we will concentrate on",Paragraph
what is generally recognized as the crowning period of Expressionism,Paragraph
as a multi-genre and politically involved movement between rg14 and,Paragraph
tgat. The focus will be on the group that formed round the architect,Paragraph
"Bruno Taut (1880-1930) during this period, the most important",Paragraph
members of which—beside Taut himself—were Walter Gropius and,Paragraph
the critic and art historian Adolf Behne (1885-1948).,Paragraph
Although Adolf Behne was the first to use the term ‘Expressionist’,Paragraph
"in connection with architecture (in an article in Der Sturm of tg15), it is",Paragraph
probably an article by Taut of February 1914 in the same journal—enti-,Paragraph
tled ‘A Necessity’—which has a more legitimate claim to being the first,Paragraph
‘manifesto’ of Expressionist architecture.* This article repeats several,Paragraph
of Worringer’s ideas. Taut notes that painting is becoming more,Paragraph
"abstract, synthetic, and structural and sees this as heralding a new unity",Paragraph
of the arts. ‘Architecture wants to assist in this aspiration.’ It should,Paragraph
"develop a new ‘structural intensity’ based on expression, rhythm, and",Paragraph
"P y P: » rhythm,",Paragraph
"dynamics, as well as on new materials such as glass, steel, and concrete.",Paragraph
This intensity will go ‘far beyond the classical ideal of harmony’. He,Paragraph
proposes that a stupendous structure be built in which architecture,Paragraph
shall once again become the home of the arts as it was in medieval,Paragraph
times. One of the most striking features of this article is the view it pre-,Paragraph

"worked simultaneously at both these poles, emphasizing one or the",Paragraph

"(house of the people) and the Stadtkrone (city crown), first outlined in",Paragraph
his article ‘A Necessity’. In these two closely related concepts he sought,Paragraph

figure and place the environment inside it’ [65]. In his “Technical,Paragraph
"Manifesto of Futurist Architecture’,”’ he arrives at the same idea. The",Paragraph
modern city can no longer be thought of as a series of static panoramas,Paragraph
"as in the past, but as an enveloping environment in a constant state of",Paragraph

broken up in response to the pressures of the interior. In both sculpture,Caption
"and architecture, therefore, Boccioni proposes to absorb the art work",Paragraph
"back into the world, so that it will become an intensification of the",Paragraph
"environment, not something idealistically set against it.",Paragraph
Antonio Sant’Elia,Title
The probable reason that Boccioni’s architectural manifesto remained,Paragraph
unpublished despite its obvious importance was that in July 1914,Paragraph
another such manifesto was written by Antonio Sant’Elia (1888-1916).,Paragraph
This architect’s accession to the Futurist movement coincided with an,Paragraph
"exhibition of the work of a rival group of artists, the Nuove Tendenze,",Paragraph
in which Sant’Elia showed an extraordinary series of perspective,Paragraph
drawings representing his idea of the architecture of the future. The,Paragraph
relationship between these drawings and the Futurist movement has,Paragraph
long been the subject of controversy.,Paragraph
The ideas expressed in Sant’Elia’s ‘Manifesto of Futurist Archi-,Paragraph
tecture? and in the slightly shorter version of it published in the,Paragraph
"exhibition catalogue (the ‘Messaggio™), correspond closely with the",Paragraph
"ideology of the movement, but the drawings themselves seem to con-",Paragraph
tradict it in important ways. It is likely that Sant’Elia had been in,Paragraph
"contact with the Futurists for some time, and that behind the mani-",Paragraph
festo and the ‘Messaggio’ there existed an urtext written in part by,Paragraph
"Marinetti or Boccioni or both, so as to provide the appropriate stylistic",Paragraph
(if not intellectual) credentials. This may explain the reason for the dis-,Paragraph
"crepancies between the drawings and the text, but the discrepancies",Paragraph
themselves need further elucidation.”,Paragraph
"Except for three very small structures, Sant’Elia’s legacy consists",Paragraph
exclusively of architectural drawings. These are either for actual but,Paragraph
"unbuilt projects, mostly facade studies, or perspectives of an imagi-",Paragraph
nary architecture. The facades are in a highly ornamented,Paragraph
Liberty-Secessionist style and Sant’Elia continued to produce such,Paragraph
work until his death. The perspectives are of three kinds. The first are,Paragraph
"totally unornamented, astylar compositions with generic titles such as",Paragraph
"“Modern building’, ‘Monument’, and ‘Industrial building’, dated 1913",Caption
[66]. Almost certainly these drawings were influenced by the pho-,Paragraph
tographs of North American grain silos illustrated by Gropius in the,Caption
"Jahrbuch des Deutschen Werkbundes of 1913, and quite possibly by the",Paragraph
stage designs of Gordon Craig and Adolfe Appia.*3 The second kind is,Paragraph
a set of drawings in which similarly abstract forms are adapted to one,Paragraph
particular industrial building type: the hydroelectric power station—a,Paragraph
type of building almost synonymous with the rapid industrialization,Paragraph
of the Po Valley in the first years of the twentieth century [53 (see,Caption
page 86) and 67].,Paragraph
Finally there is a set of drawings entitled La Citta Nuova (The New,Paragraph
City). These are very detailed and their technique is harsher and less,Paragraph
atmospheric [68]. Stepped-back floors of multi-storey apartment,Caption
blocks (resembling the powerful sloping walls of the hydroelectric,Paragraph
"dams) are contrasted with vertical elevator towers, to which they are",Paragraph
connected by bridges. The ground is completely eroded with a multi-,Paragraph
level network of transport viaducts. The drawings depict a city from,Paragraph
"which all traces of nature have been removed, a city dominated by a",Paragraph
"plethora of horizontal and vertical distribution systems, against which",Paragraph
the facades of the apartment units seem to play a passive and secondary,Paragraph
"role. Sant’Elia took elements of his city from various sources, includ-",Paragraph

In the set to which this,Paragraph
"drawing belongs, the",Paragraph
elements of the two previous,Title
sets are transformed into a,Paragraph

landscape. The multi-level,Paragraph
transport viaducts and their,Title
attendant pylons are derived,Paragraph
from Otto Wagner's Vienna,Title
Stadtbahn. Although human,Paragraph
"beings are absent, the pylons",Paragraph
stand around like calcified,Paragraph

[69]. Out of such ‘found’ elements Sant’Elia created a synthesis which,Paragraph
"was, from a pictorial point of view, utterly convincing.",Paragraph
"But, impressive as Sant’Elia’s drawings are in their dramatic repre-",Paragraph
"sentation of the city of the future, their forms and technique contradict",Paragraph
many of the ideas put forward in the Futurist manifestos. While the,Paragraph

The avant-garde in Holland,Title
Two opposed movements in architecture and the decorative arts flour-,Paragraph
ished in Holland during and immediately after the First World,Paragraph
War—the Amsterdam School and De Stijl. Both these movements,Paragraph
were related to Art Nouveau and the Arts and Crafts movement as well,Paragraph
as to German Expressionism; both believed in a unified style reflecting,Paragraph
the spirit of the age; both inherited the Morrisian idea that society,Paragraph
could be transformed by art; and both rejected the eclectic use of past,Paragraph
"styles, striving for a new, uncoded architecture. But each inherited a",Paragraph
"different strand of the earlier movements—the vitalistic, individualis-",Paragraph
"tic strand in the case of the Amsterdam School and the rationalist,",Paragraph
impersonal strand in the case of De Stijl. Each movement condemned,Paragraph
"the other, ignoring their shared aims and origins.’",Paragraph
The work of the Amsterdam School—whose chief exponent was,Paragraph
Michel de Klerk (1884-1923)—was characterized by the use of traditional,Paragraph
"materials, in particular brick, and the free, fantastical but craftsman-like",Paragraph
working of these materials. The forms of traditional architecture were,Paragraph
not so much abandoned as transformed and made strange. Much of,Paragraph
the most important work of the Amsterdam School was built between,Paragraph
1914 and 1923 and is to be found in the many public housing projects,Paragraph
that were part of the vast urban renewal programme being undertaken,Paragraph
in Amsterdam at the time under the direction of Berlage.,Paragraph

in favour of a geometrical anti-naturalism. In 1917 the painter Theo van,Paragraph
"Doesburg (1883-1931) published the first issue of De S7ij/, a magazine",Paragraph
promoting modern art. The term ‘De Stil’ is normally applied to both,Paragraph

"Rietveld (1888-1964), and J. J. P. Oud (1890-1963). The group’s identity,",Paragraph
"however, had less to do with its specific membership, which was highly",Paragraph
"volatile, than with its doctrine as defined in the first De Stijl Manifesto",Paragraph
of 1918 and in later issues of the magazine. De Stij/ was edited and dom-,Paragraph
inated by van Doesburg and became an important organ of the,Paragraph
international avant-garde until it ceased publication in 1932.,Paragraph
Theory,Title
The theoretical apparatus of De Stijl was a variant of existing (mostly,Paragraph
"Symbolist and Futurist-derived) doctrine, and the movement saw",Paragraph
itself as a crusade in the common cause of Modernism. It maintained,Paragraph
"close ties with avant-garde movements in the different arts abroad,",Paragraph
"including Dada (van Doesburg himself, under the pseudonym Aldo",Paragraph
"Camini, published Dada poetry in De Stj/).",Paragraph
The three main postulates of the movement can be roughly sum-,Paragraph
marized as follows: each art form must realize its own nature based on,Paragraph
its materials and codes—only then can the generative principles,Paragraph
"governing all the visual arts (indeed, all art) be revealed; as the spiritual",Paragraph
"awareness of society increases, so will art fulfil its historical (Hegelian)",Paragraph
destiny and become reabsorbed into daily life; art is not opposed to,Paragraph
science and technology—both art and science are concerned with the,Paragraph
discovery and demonstration of the underlying laws of nature and not,Title
"with nature’s superficial and transient appearance (the theory,",Paragraph
"however, did not take into account the possibility art could still be a",Paragraph
form of imitation).,Paragraph
De Stijl belonged to the millennialist tradition of Expressionism,Paragraph
"and Futurism. Although it lacked any obvious political dimension, it",Paragraph
was nonetheless Utopian; it imagined a future in which social divisions,Paragraph
would be dissolved and power dispersed. It combined a commitment,Paragraph
to modernity with an idealism that associated scientific and technical,Paragraph
change with spiritual as well as material progress. The metaphysics of,Paragraph
the movement were to a large extent taken from the Theosophist and,Paragraph
"Neoplatonist M. J. H. Schoenmaeker, whose book The Principles of",Paragraph
Plastic Mathematics (1916) claimed that plastic mathematics was a ‘pos-,Paragraph
itive mysticism’ in which ‘we translate reality into constructions,Paragraph
"controlled by our reason, later to recover these constructions in nature,",Paragraph
thus penetrating matter with plastic vision’. Schoenmaeker believed,Paragraph
"that the new plastic expression (‘Neoplasticism’), born of light and",Paragraph
"sound, would create a heaven on earth.”",Paragraph
The two main theorists of the movement were Mondrian and van,Paragraph
"Doesburg, but they by no means agreed on all points of doctrine.",Paragraph
"Mondrian’s concept of Neoplasticism, based partly on Schoenmaeker",Paragraph
and partly on Kandinsky’s influential book User das Geistige in der,Paragraph
"Kunst (Concerning the Spiritual in Art) of 1911, was restricted to paint-",Paragraph
"ing, whereas van Doesburg attempted to apply it to architecture as",Paragraph
well. Although both Huszar and Van der Leck made important contri-,Paragraph
"butions to the early development of Neoplasticism, it was Mondrian",Paragraph
who worked out its logical implications. The system that he eventually,Paragraph
arrived at was based on a radical process of reduction in which the,Paragraph
"complex, accidental appearance of nature was refined to the variations",Paragraph
"of an irregular orthogonal grid, partly filled in with rectangles of",Paragraph
"primary colour [72]. According to Yve-Alain Bois, Mondrian org-",Paragraph
anizes the picture surface in such a way that the traditional hierarchy,Paragraph
between figural objects and an illusionistic ground is abolished. In,Paragraph
"Mondrian, ‘no element is more important than any other, and none",Paragraph
must escape integration’.* These structural principles of non-redun-,Paragraph
dancy and non-hierarchy are similar to those underlying Schoenberg’s,Paragraph
atonal and serial music.* In traditional painting it is the figural object,Paragraph
that conveys the symbolic or lyrical content (as does melody in music);*,Paragraph
in Mondrian’s paintings the meaning is transposed from the repre-,Paragraph
sented object to the abstract organization of the two-dimensional,Paragraph
surface—an effect analogous to Boccioni’s idea that it was no longer,Paragraph

The relation between architecture and painting,Title
"In the early phase of the De Stijl movement, there was an emphasis on",Paragraph
the collaboration between architecture and painting. The following,Paragraph
remarks by Van der Leck are typical of this position:,Paragraph
Modern painting has now arrived at the point at which it may enter into col-,Paragraph
laboration with architecture. It has arrived at this point because its means of,Paragraph
expression have been purified. The description of time and space by means,Paragraph
of perspective has been abandoned; it is the flat surface itself that transmits,Paragraph
spatial continuity .. . Painting today is architectural because in itself and by its,Paragraph
own means it serves the same concept as architecture.®,Paragraph
"This statement is in many ways unclear. For example, if it is true that",Paragraph

"are limited (the one plane by the other), they can be imagined as extended into",Paragraph
"infinity, thereby forming a system of coordinates, the different points of which",Paragraph
"would correspond to an equal number of points in universal, open space.?",Paragraph
"In these drawings, axonometry is more than a useful graphic tool. It is",Paragraph
the only method of representation that does not privilege one part of,Paragraph
"the building over another (for example, the facade over the interior). In",Paragraph
"‘real life’, the only way to recall such a house in its totality would be to",Paragraph
"trace and retrace its interior spaces in time, as in the case of Loos’s",Paragraph
"Raumplan houses. Axonometry converts this temporal, semi-con-",Paragraph

mystical vision of an architecture identical with the flow of lived,Paragraph
experience. They were idealized representations of the ineffable.,Paragraph
Axonometry was also fundamental to van Doesburg’s attempts to,Paragraph

the gap between the avant-garde and the political establishment,Title
increased. As the Stalin government became increasingly authoritarian,Paragraph
"and culturally conservative, so the architects became more Utopian—",Paragraph
as the work of Leonidov demonstrates. The same was true at the level,Paragraph
of urbanism. While the architects of OSA condemned the traditional,Paragraph

After the war of 1914-18 there was a strong reaction in artistic circles in,Paragraph
France against the anarchy and uncontrolled experimentalism of the,Title
pre-war avant-gardes. A ‘return to order’ was seen to be necessary. But,Paragraph
while for some this meant a return to conservative values and a rejection,Paragraph

technology. What further complicated the situation was that both cul-,Paragraph
tural pessimists like the poet Paul Valéry and technological Utopians,Paragraph
like Le Corbusier invoked the spirit of classicism and geometry.,Paragraph
"In the aftermath of the war, there was little architectural activity in",Paragraph

attended an important Deutscher Werkbund conterence sponsored by,Paragraph
the cement industry at which most of the luminaries of the German,Paragraph
"avant-garde were present. He then travelled to the Balkans, Istanbul,",Paragraph

"‘masculine’ classicism of ancient Greece, which he identified with the",Paragraph
"spirit of modern rationalism. The effect of the Parthenon, combined",Paragraph
"with the teaching of Perret and Behrens, converted him to classicism,",Paragraph

had been trained.,Paragraph
"In his report on German applied art, which was entitled ‘Etude sur le",Paragraph

and Directoire styles; and the design of neoclassical villas. Of the three,Paragraph
villas that he built in the vicinity of La Chaux-de-Fonds—the Villa,Paragraph
"Jeanneret (912), the Villa Favre-Jacot (1912), and the Villa Schwob",Paragraph
(t916)—the first two were strongly influenced by Behrens’s neoclassical,Paragraph
houses and the third by Perret’s use of the reinforced-concrete frame.,Paragraph
"During this period, frequent visits to Paris kept him in touch with both",Paragraph
"Perret and French decorative art circles, in which his ‘Etude’ had",Paragraph
enjoyed something of a succés d ‘estime.*,Paragraph
"In 1917 Jeanneret moved permanently to Paris, where he was able to",Paragraph
"set up an office within the business ramifications of an old friend, the",Paragraph
engineer and entrepreneur Max Dubois. He also began to paint in oils,Paragraph
"under the guidance of the artist Amédée Ozenfant, whom he met in",Paragraph
"1918. Calling themselves ‘Purists’, the two immediately collaborated on",Paragraph
"a book, Aprés fe Cubisme, and with the poet Paul Dermée founded the",Paragraph
magazine L'Esprit Nouveau in 1920.,Paragraph

Dada tendencies) was published between October 1920 and January,Paragraph

"and Jeanneret themselves under various pseudonyms.’ (At this point,",Paragraph
"Jeanneret adopted the name of Le Corbusier, though he continued to",Paragraph

"The principal theme of L'Esprit Nouveau, already developed in",Paragraph
"Apreés le Cubisme, was the problematic relation between art and indus-",Paragraph
trial society. The review shared with De Stijl the idea that the modern,Paragraph
industrialized world implied a change from individualism to collec-,Paragraph
tivism. Both also agreed that art and science were not opposed to each,Paragraph
"other, even if they used different means, and that their union would",Paragraph
result in a new aesthetic. What differentiated L'Esprit Nouveau from,Paragraph
De Stijl was the belief that this new aesthetic would be classical in,Paragraph
spirit. This idea was underlined by the constant juxtaposition of old,Paragraph
and new: monographs on such French classical ‘masters’ as Poussin and,Title
Ingres were interleaved with articles by Charles Henry on the science,Paragraph
"of aesthetics;* the Parthenon was compared to a modern automobile,",Paragraph
and so on. The affinity between art and science was seen to be based on,Paragraph
"their common approximation to a condition of stasis, harmony, and",Paragraph
invariability. Science and technology had reached a state of perfection,Paragraph
of which the Greeks had only dreamed. Reason could now create,Paragraph
"machines of extreme precision; feeling, allied to reason, could create",Paragraph
works of art of an equally precise plastic beauty: ‘No one today denies,Paragraph
the aesthetic that emanates from the constructions of modern industry,Paragraph
"... machines display such proportions, plays of volume and materiality",Paragraph
"that many are true works of art, because they embody number, which is",Paragraph
to say order.’4 There was nothing new in the identification of modern,Paragraph
technology with classicism—it had been an essential part of,Paragraph
Muthesius’s post-Arts and Crafts aesthetic doctrine (see page 58). But,Paragraph
"Cubism had opened the way to a more abstract, Platonic idea of classi-",Paragraph
"cism, and it was in this form that the equation technology-classicism",Paragraph
reappeared in L'Esprit Nouveau.,Paragraph
The connection between science and Platonic forms depended on a,Paragraph
highly selective view of modern science. It tended to ignore such nine-,Paragraph
teenth-century developments as the life sciences and non-Euclidean,Paragraph
"geometries with their counterintuitive, often destabilizing, models of",Paragraph
reality. Even more problematic was the fact that in the new world of,Paragraph
objectivity and collectivism anticipated by L'Esprit Nouveau the posi-,Paragraph

"arguing from similar principles to L’Esprit Nouveau, had foreseen a",Paragraph
time when the artist would become redundant. But for L'Esprit,Paragraph
"Nouveau, the artist played an essential role within a modern society",Paragraph
dominated by science and technology—that of making visible the,Paragraph
unity of the age. Francoise Will-Levaillant’s judgement is difficult to,Paragraph

"its simplification of forms, its compression of pictorial depth, and its",Paragraph

ideologically aligned with contemporary Fascist movements in France,Paragraph
and Italy. Le Corbusier became an editor and major contributor to the,Paragraph
group’s journal Plans and its successor Prélude. Influenced by Pierre-,Paragraph
"Joseph Proudhon and Georges Sorel, the group called for the abolition",Paragraph
"of parliamentary democracy, and for the creation of a government of",Paragraph
"technical elites, on the Saint-Simonian principle of the ‘administration",Paragraph
"of things, not the government of people’, dedicated to a planned",Paragraph
economy. It believed that the alienation of modern social life could be,Paragraph

The architecture that began to emerge in Germany around 1922,Paragraph
reflected a dramatic change of orientation in the visual arts as a whole.,Paragraph
The movement known as ‘Neue Sachlichkeit’ (New Objectivity’ or,Paragraph
"more accurately ‘ Fact-like-ness’),' was indicative of a new realism. The",Paragraph
term was first used in 1923 in the context of painting by museum direc-,Paragraph
"tor Gustav Hartlaub, who defined it as ‘realism with a socialist flavour’.",Paragraph
The movement was sometimes interpreted as a form of cynicism—a,Paragraph
reaction to the horrors of a disastrous war—and sometimes as a ‘magic,Paragraph

"his essay of that year, ‘Kunst, Handwerk, Technik’ (‘Art, Craft, and",Paragraph

"itional period, the worker would come to understand his role within",Paragraph
the totality of industrialized society. Zivt/isation and Gesellschaft were,Paragraph

and his work was similar to the view that Gropius had already,Paragraph
expressed in his ‘Kunst und Industriebau’ speech of rgtt in an earlier,Paragraph

When Gropius was appointed to succeed Henry van de Velde as direc-,Paragraph

task of creating a new School of Architecture and Applied Art which,Paragraph
would unify the Hochshule fiir Bildende Kunst with the recently dis-,Paragraph
banded Kunstgewerbeshule. The integration of fine arts with crafts was,Paragraph
standard policy in German art schools at the time.4 But as we have seen,Paragraph
Gropius had grander ambitions: he wanted the academy (which he now),Paragraph
renamed the Bauhaus) to become the spearhead of the AFK’s pro-,Paragraph
gramme for the transformation of German artistic culture under the,Paragraph
wing of architecture (sce page 96). This programme was predicated on,Paragraph
the belief that artistic culture was threatened by the materialism of,Paragraph
industrial capitalism and could only be saved by a spiritual revolution.,Paragraph
"In the ‘Bauhaus Manifesto’ of 1919, Gropius wrote, in Expressionist",Paragraph
"vein, ‘Let us conceive a new building of the future . . . architecture,",Paragraph
"painting, and sculpture rising to Heaven out of the hands of a million",Paragraph
"craftsmen, the crystal symbol of the new in the future’ [107].*",Paragraph
"Between 1919 and 1923, however, the Bauhaus abandoned its",Paragraph
Expressionist ideology and began to absorb the ideas of Neue,Paragraph
"Sachlichkeit, De Stijl, and L'Esprit Nouveau. The initial impulse for",Paragraph
this change came in rg2t when van Doesburg set himself up in Weimar,Paragraph

diametrically opposed to the ideology of craftsmanship and artistic,Paragraph
‘intuition’ that still dominated the Bauhaus curriculum.,Paragraph
A. second influx of ideas came from Russian Constructivism.,Paragraph
During the early 1920s there was considerable cultural interchange,Paragraph
between Germany and Soviet Russia. In 1922 the first Exhibition of,Paragraph
Soviet Art was shown at the Grosse Berliner Kunstausstellung. This,Paragraph
coincided with the publication of El Lissitzky’s journal Veshcd (see page,Paragraph
128). In 1921 the Constructivist-based Congress of International,Paragraph

Nagy’s ideas roughly corresponded to that between the Rationalists,Paragraph
and the Constructivists within the Russian avant-garde (see page 122).,Paragraph

Functionalists versus rationalists,Title

"Behne, the functionalists (whom he might more accurately have called",Paragraph
"‘organicists’) created unique, non-repeatable buildings whose forms",Paragraph
"were shaped round their functions, whereas the rationalists looked for",Paragraph
typical and repeatable forms that were able to fulfil generalized needs.,Paragraph

the rationalists accept a responsibility to society.,Paragraph
"Theo van Doesburg, in one of his articles in the journal Her",Paragraph

paradoxically there were also strong revisionist pressures. Since most,Paragraph
"Modernist architects in Italy had been keen supporters of Fascism, the",Paragraph

architectural identity. Architects became engaged in a succession of,Paragraph
ideological debates which opened up the Modernist tradition to new,Paragraph

The movement was initiated by the architects Mario Ridolfi (1904-84),Paragraph

included the Tiburtino Housing Estate (1944-54) by Ridolfi and,Paragraph

This concept had already been broached in practical design before it,Paragraph
was theorized by Rogers. Two projects may be singled out as represcnt-,Paragraph
ing contrasting solutions to the same problem. In the INA Casa offices,Paragraph
in Parma (1950) by Franco Albini (1905-77) a visible concrete frame,Paragraph
provides a grid through which a play of vertically stressed solids and,Paragraph
voids is threaded. The complexities of daily life and the patterns of the,Paragraph
existing street facade are suggested without disturbing the underlying,Paragraph
"rationality of the idealized grid. In contrast to this, Rogers and his",Paragraph
partners Lodovico Belgiojoso (tg09-2004) and Enrico Peressutti (1908-75),Paragraph
"(BPR), in their office building in the Piazza Meda in Milan (1958-69),",Paragraph

"superimposed; in the second a hybrid is created, not attempting to",Paragraph
imitate its context but creating its analogue.,Paragraph
A more literal interpretation of ‘context’ can be seen in the work of,Paragraph

Anew urban dimension,Title
At the end of the 1950s the attitude of Italian architect-planners to the,Paragraph
problem of the city underwent an important shift. Demographic,Paragraph
movements due to south-north migration as well as technical develop-,Paragraph
ments in the building industry led to a redefinition of the scope of,Paragraph
"urban planning, now seen to embrace larger ‘city regions’. According to",Paragraph
Manfredo Tafuri:,Title
Italian intellectuals were becoming aware of a new reality; convulsive urban-,Paragraph
ization and the diffusion of mass communication had effected profound,Paragraph
"transformations in society. These changes, along with rapid economic growth,",Paragraph
encouraged the formation of interpretative models that quickly replaced those,Paragraph
of the preceding decade . . . Neorealist myths were replaced by technological,Paragraph
ones... The entire concept of urban planning would be overhauled in the,Paragraph
early 19608.,Paragraph
"The concept of the ‘city region’, seen as a set of dynamic relations in a",Paragraph
"state of constant change, took the place of the fixed model.¥",Paragraph
Anessential precondition of this concept was the revalidation of the,Paragraph
city as such. In 1959 the architect Giuseppe Samona (1898-1983) pub-,Paragraph
lished a book entitled Urbanism and the Future of the City in which he,Paragraph
defended the big city and attacked the social assumptions of the,Paragraph
Garden City movement and the Anglo-American concept of the,Title
small-town neighbourhood that had dominated Italian urban theory,Paragraph
since the war. At the same time a number of competitions were held for,Paragraph
the design of new business and administrative centres to be inserted,Paragraph
within existing cities. The first and most influential of such projects,Paragraph
was Quaroni’s design for the Quartiere Cepalle Barene di S. Giuliano,Caption
"in Mestre (1959) [131], in which the city fabric, free to develop with the",Paragraph

state-sponsored housing during the First World War to meet a,Paragraph

before in Germany. In 1932 the Social Democrats came to power and,Paragraph
instituted a series of reforms inspired by Prime Minister Per Albin,Paragraph
Hansen's slogan comparing the state to ‘the house of the people’,Paragraph
(Folkhemmet).® These reforms were carried out within a liberal democ-,Paragraph
"racy, but facilitated by a long tradition of state interventionism. At",Paragraph
their core was the housing programme. During the 1920s a vigorous,Paragraph
cooperative movement had paved the way for legislation which was to,Paragraph

cooperatives (which often had their own architectural departments),Paragraph
was extremely influential in the spread of Modernist architecture in,Paragraph

The New Empiricism,Title
The architects Sven Backstrém (1903-92) and Lief Reinius (1907-95),Paragraph
led the way in a Swedish revisionist movement after the Second,Paragraph
World War. They mixed Modernist macro-typologies with familiar,Paragraph
constructional techniques and decorative forms still in the repertoire,Title
of ordinary builders and within the taste range of ordinary users,Paragraph
"[133], seeking a more popular architecture that would acknowledge",Paragraph
‘psychological and irrational factors that please us—and—why not?—,Paragraph
"beauty’."" This ideology—enthusiastically dubbed “The New",Paragraph
Empiricism’ by the British journal Architectural Review in 1947—was,Paragraph
not in fact universally accepted in Sweden. The Swedish journal,Paragraph
Biggmésteren—which had ‘gone modern’ in 1928—ran a debate on the,Paragraph
relative merits of a rational ‘Apollonian’ and an irrational ‘Dionysia’,Paragraph

Systems design,Title
During the 1960s and 1970s there was a dramatic increase in housing,Paragraph
production in Sweden. A programme was instituted which aimed at,Paragraph
providing one million dwellings between 1965 and 1974.° Within this,Paragraph
"programme, 40 per cent of dwellings took the form of high-rise, high-",Paragraph
"density projects, using a ‘Systems’ approach to planning and",Paragraph
construction. This approach maximized the use of standardized parts,Paragraph
"and large-scale prefabrication, and was modelled on the technique of",Paragraph
Systems engineering used by the United States defence industry.’ The,Paragraph
approach was not restricted to Sweden. In Denmark—to speak of,Paragraph
Scandinavia alone—there was also a technically driven development in,Paragraph
"mass housing which resulted in dense, high-rise projects such as that of",Paragraph
Hoje Gladsaxe (1960-7o).””,Paragraph
In the late 1960s there was growing public opposition to this kind of,Paragraph
"development, which was often unsatisfactory even at a purely technical",Paragraph
"level. This reaction, which was exacerbated by the fall-out from the",Paragraph
"French student revolt of 1968, was to lead to revisions in government",Paragraph

At the same time Mikkola acknowledged that the Constructivists,Paragraph

"As in Sweden, the Systems-based approach described by Mikkola",Paragraph

Lewis Mumford’s writings in the 1920s still carried the imprint of,Paragraph
William Morris’s rejection of modern technology. But towards the end,Paragraph
of the decade he came increasingly under the influence of the optimistic,Paragraph

to a ‘neotechnic’ phase in which electricity would succeed coal as a,Paragraph

Mumford became convinced that such a neotechnic phase was in the,Paragraph

Europe as a whole the many points of connection between modern,Paragraph
architecture and the welfare state encouraged the experimental work of,Paragraph
Team X and the Megastructuralist movements (see pages 217 and 223).,Paragraph
During the same period in America the most vital developments in,Paragraph
modern architecture were in the private sector. Even public projects,Paragraph
were financed by private agencies (albeit with federal or state help) and,Paragraph
"this tended to inhibit, though it did not altogether eliminate, the",Paragraph
development of an ideology-driven Modernism. Precisely because of,Paragraph
the different conditions of architectural production in America and,Paragraph

The Case Study House Program,Title
"In the 1920s in Western Europe, the individual house had played an",Paragraph
important role in the birth of the Modern Movement. But in the two,Paragraph
"decades after the Second World War, European domestic building was",Paragraph
"largely confined to government housing programmes, which consisted",Paragraph

and carried out by private developers.* At the same time there was a,Paragraph
"large market in one-off family houses, extending from the modest and",Paragraph
pre-designed to the lavish and purpose-designed.,Paragraph
The stylistic tendencies within the housing market were the result,Paragraph
"of a complex interplay between various interested parties, including",Paragraph
"the loan agencies, the building industry, and professional and cultural",Title
pressure groups. Museums such as the Museum of Modern Art in,Paragraph
New York and progressive journals such as Architectural Record tried to,Paragraph
"popularize modern house design, but with only modest success. In 1951",Paragraph
"Architectural Record, commenting on a House of Ideas sponsored by the",Paragraph
"journal House and Garden, described it as a fusion of the ‘crisp, clean",Paragraph

manifesto calling for the application of wartime technology to the,Paragraph
post-war housing problem. The montages by Herbert Matter,Caption
announcing the manifesto showed a familiarity with Futurist and,Paragraph
"Constructivist graphics, but they placed a new emphasis on the",Paragraph
"analogy between machines, the human nervous system, and molecular",Paragraph
structures. The manifesto recast Bauhaus and Corbusian ideology in,Paragraph
terms of post-war American technology. In defining the principles on,Paragraph
"which the post-war house should be based, it declared:",Paragraph
The house is an instrument of service. Degrees of service are real and can be,Paragraph
measured. They are not dependent on taste. The house should not assert itself,Paragraph
"by its architectural design. In fact, the better integrated the services of the",Paragraph
"house become, the less one is apt to be conscious of the physical way in which",Paragraph
"it has been done. The kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, utilities, and storage will",Paragraph
profit most by an industrialized system of prefabrication. In the living—recre-,Paragraph
ational areas variation becomes a valid personal preference. A designer must,Paragraph
know what the house must supply to meet the physiological and psychological,Paragraph
needs of the members of the family.*,Paragraph
"Optimistic and positivistic in tone, the manifesto promoted the belief",Paragraph
that an art based on psychological laws and an architecture based on,Paragraph
scientific method would lead to a unified culture in tune with the,Paragraph
modern age. The aim of the manifesto was not social revolution but a,Paragraph
"revolution in aesthetics, starting with the enlightened bourgeoisie and",Paragraph
"filtering down to the masses. Nonetheless, the manifesto had a moral",Paragraph
and social as well as an aesthetic agenda: the particular aesthetic it pro-,Paragraph
"moted was one of transparency and ‘authenticity’, inseparable, it was",Paragraph
"thought, from the ideals of a rational and just social order.",Paragraph
"Prefabrication techniques, combining standardization and choice,",Paragraph
would make the new aesthetic principles available to everyone. Where,Paragraph
it differed from the European Modern Movement and from social,Paragraph
reformers like Lewis Mumford and Catherine Bauer was in its,Paragraph
assumption that the uniform culture it envisaged was compatible with,Paragraph
a market-based capitalism.,Paragraph
To carry out this ambitious agenda Entenza commissioned or,Paragraph
adopted a series of suburban houses in southern California by,Paragraph
"Modernist architects, including among others William Wurster",Paragraph
"(1895-1973), Ralph Rapson (b. 1914), and Richard Neutra, in order to",Paragraph
build up a ‘case study’ of the new domestic architecture. In spite of their,Paragraph
"differences these houses had many features in common, not all of",Paragraph
which were derived from the theory presented in the manifesto. They,Paragraph
"were, for a start, nearly all of one storey with flat roofs. The plans were",Paragraph
"open and informal but tended to be bi-nuclear, the living rooms and",Paragraph
bedrooms being remote from each other. The inside was opened up to,Paragraph
the outside by means of large areas of glazing. A tendency towards pic-,Paragraph
turesque dispersal was counteracted by the economic need for cubic,Paragraph
simplicity. Nearly all the houses had unrendered brick fireplaces—a,Paragraph
reassuring reference to the pre-industrial past. The layouts reflected a,Paragraph
somewhat ritualized suburban life style—non-rational and conformist,Paragraph
rather than rational and free as the theory claimed. Despite the use of,Paragraph
forms connoting prefabrication and mechanization most of the houses,Paragraph
"were built of blockwork with wood framing, and the flexibility of the",Paragraph
plans owed as much to traditional American building techniques as,Paragraph
they did to new technology and materials.,Paragraph
"Around 1950, the Case Study houses underwent a marked change,",Paragraph
"which first becomes noticeable in those by Raphael Soriano (1907-88),",Paragraph
"Craig Ellwood (1922-92), and Pierre Koenig (b. 1925) [161]. In these",Paragraph
houses there was a new concentration on modular construction and,Paragraph
prefabrication. The houses were thought of more as assembled systems,Paragraph
than as ‘designs’ in the traditional sense. It became possible to talk ofan,Paragraph
architecture of steel and glass. Nearly all the houses now had steel,Paragraph
frames and the structure and method of assembly became clearly,Paragraph
visible while the plans became simpler and less picturesque. Discussing,Paragraph
"Craig Ellwood’s House 17 of 195475, the Italian journal Domus wrote:",Paragraph

(see page 216).,Paragraph
"In its site organization Lever House is similar to, and probably",Paragraph
"derived from, the Rio building.’ It was the first building in Manhattan",Paragraph
"to be set back from the plot boundary, though unlike the Rio building",Paragraph
the tower rises up from a three-storey perimeter courtyard block on,Paragraph
pilotis. But in its use of a uniform curtain wall on all surfaces it followed,Paragraph

The American work of Mies van der Rohe occupies a position that is,Paragraph

building: central in the sense that Mies’s designs for the Illinois Insti-,Paragraph
tute of Technology in Chicago (1940-56) and Lake Shore Drive,Paragraph
Apartments provided the basic formal syntax for the corporate build-,Paragraph
ings of SOM and Saarinen; peripheral in the sense that Mies,Paragraph
maintained a certain detachment from the immediate needs of his,Paragraph
clients. Mies’s first scheme for the ITT campus was classical with two,Paragraph
"identical, symmetrically placed auditoria [167], continuing the compo-",Paragraph
"sitional characteristics of his German work—for instance, the Silk",Paragraph
ndustry Offices in Krefeld of 1937. When it was discovered that the,Paragraph
"existing road grid could not be altered, Mies changed the layout,",Paragraph
turning an articulated composition into an assemblage of rectangular,Paragraph
pavilions in a way that conformed to the abstract conditions of the,Paragraph
American grid [168]. All Mies’s energy went into discovering and per-,Paragraph
"fecting the types corresponding to what he saw as the ‘will of the epoch’,",Paragraph
and once he had arrived at a typical solution he simply repeated it.,Paragraph
Whereas in the work of SOM the same rational schema would often,Paragraph

between the personal solution and the type. A case in point is his use of,Paragraph

others were attempts by designers or architects to correct what they,Paragraph
saw as the weaknesses of Modernist artistic and architectural theory.,Paragraph
The critique of corporatism,Title
Mies’s carefully worked out idealist philosophy and his disdain for the,Paragraph
trivia of everyday life in favour of a purified expression of the Zeitgeist,Paragraph
coincided exactly with the worldly demands of corporate discipline—a,Paragraph
discipline that was accepted by SOM uncritically and on its own terms.,Paragraph
It was precisely this corporate discipline that was attacked by writers,Paragraph
"like David Riesman (The Lonely Crowd, 1950) and William H. Whyte",Paragraph
"(The Organisation Man, 1956), who saw the corporation as a dehuman-",Paragraph
"ized collective producing a new type of ‘other-directed’ character,",Paragraph

The critique of corporatism was also mounted on a more political,Paragraph

The Case Study houses and the corporate architecture of SOM can be,Paragraph

spaces grouped round a central space. The significant element is always,Paragraph

In this building the secondary,Paragraph

symmetry.,Paragraph
the room-space itself As Kahn expressed it: ‘Space made by a dome,Paragraph
and then divided by walls is not the same space .. . a room should be a,Paragraph
constructed entity or an ordered segment of a construction system.”,Paragraph
Kahn’s double allegiance to structural organicism and classicism—,Paragraph
to a whole that has not yet appeared and a whole that has been,Paragraph
lost—cuts across this generalized schema. The unbuilt project for a,Paragraph
Jewish Community Center at Trenton (1954-9) [174] exhibits both,Paragraph
these tendencies. A new arbitrary relation between form and function,Paragraph
appears. Architectural forms no longer correspond to immutable,Paragraph
causal relationships as they are supposed to do in functionalism. A,Paragraph
binary grid is set up in which the only fixed hierarchy is that between,Paragraph
"positive (served) and negative (servant) spaces. Apart from this, any",Paragraph
combination of functions can be inserted.,Paragraph
In the adaptation of an architectural programme to this a priori,Paragraph
system a new tension arises between Platonic and circumstantial,Paragraph
orders.” In the Richards Medical Research Laboratories at the Uni-,Paragraph
versity of Pennsylvania (1957-65) [175] Kahn had difficulty in,Paragraph
reconciling a highly technical programme to the system.” In the Salk,Paragraph
Institute for Biological Sciences in La Jolla (1959-65) he solved the,Paragraph
"problem by relegating the bulk of the programme to two enormous,",Paragraph
flexible sheds and restricting symbolic expression to fixed administra-,Paragraph
tive pavilions facing the plaza (there is an analogy here to the exhibition,Paragraph
pavilions in the Chicago World’s Fair).,Paragraph
At the other extreme lie projects like the First Unitarian Church in,Paragraph

"Le Corbusier’s concept of the free plan, and the dislocation in Mies van",Paragraph
der Rohe’s American phase between the regular building envelope and,Paragraph
"its variable content, were merely particular, working formulations of a",Paragraph
more general problem of disjunction.,Paragraph
"Louis Kahn, whether we see his work as derived from Viollet-le-",Paragraph
"Duc or the classical tradition, started from the same problem, but",Paragraph
moved in a different direction. This direction was being explored at the,Paragraph
"same time by Team X, and had been adumbrated by Le Corbusier in",Paragraph
his accentuation of each living cell in the Unité d’Habitation and other,Paragraph
post-war projects. For Kahn—going much further than Le Corbusier,Paragraph
in this direction—architecture only took on meaning when a unit of,Paragraph
structure coincided with a unit of habitable space. This made the free,Paragraph
plan inoperative and gave rise to a new problem: instead of being free to,Paragraph
"develop independently, as they were according to the logic of the free",Paragraph
"plan, ideal and circumstantial orders were now locked in a dialectic,",Paragraph
directing attention to the conflict between transcendent architectural,Paragraph
values and the contingencies of the modern economy.,Paragraph
Louis Kahn belonged firmly to the Modernist tradition in at least,Paragraph
one respect: he wanted to create an architecture that would embody a,Paragraph
new politico-moral order. In his attempt to achieve this he arrived at a,Paragraph
surprising new formulation of an old problem—how to achieve an,Paragraph
architecture that would be absolutely new but at the same time would,Paragraph
reaffirm timeless architectural truths.,Paragraph
The effect of this effort was to bring to a head and accelerate the,Paragraph
existing crisis within the Modern Movement. Rational functionalism,Paragraph
"had seemed to take on a new lease of life in post-war America, but by",Paragraph
the 1960s its principles seemed incapable of dealing with the web-like,Paragraph
"complexities of late capitalism. The Utopian promise ofa new, unified,",Paragraph
and universal architecture was becoming increasingly implausible. If,Paragraph
"there could still be said to be a ‘spirit of the epoch’, a Zeitgeist, it was",Paragraph
now the self-contradictory one of pluralism. Modernism was to,Paragraph
"survive, but only after abandoning its totalizing claims and by a process",Paragraph
"of continual self-cancellation. Paradoxically, the work of Louis",Paragraph
Kahn—anchored as it was in a belief in a transcendent order—was one,Paragraph
of the chief propelling agents in this emerging regime of uncertainty.,Paragraph
