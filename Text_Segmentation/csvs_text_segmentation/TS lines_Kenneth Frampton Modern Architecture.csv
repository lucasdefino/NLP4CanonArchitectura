BOOK Kenneth Frampton Modern Architecture.pdf,Caption
Introduction,Title
It is indeed unfortunate that human society should,Paragraph
encounter such burning problems just when it has become,Paragraph
materially impossible to make heard the least objection to,Paragraph
the language of the commodity; just when power - quite,Paragraph
rightly because it is shielded by the spectacle from having,Paragraph
to take responsibility for its delirious decisions - believes,Paragraph
that it no longer needs to think; and indeed can no longer,Paragraph
think.+,Paragraph
To attempt to expand on an account of the evolution of the,Paragraph
Modern Movement in architecture at the time of writing is a,Paragraph
contradictory and disturbing experience. While the level of,Paragraph
"professional talent and skill in the field is higher today,",Paragraph
"worldwide, than at any other moment in history, at the",Paragraph
same time the world enters ever more deeply into a,Paragraph
"confused state of total political paralysis, so much so that",Paragraph
one is reluctantly drawn to conclude that the human species,Paragraph
no longer has the capacity to act in its own best interests. At,Paragraph
"the micro-level, the techno-scientific division of labour is",Paragraph
such that we are able to penetrate ever more deeply into,Paragraph
"the mysteries of nature, but simultaneously we are the",Paragraph
perennial victims of a triumphant globalized capitalism,Title
"through which, at the macro-level, we are locked in a titanic",Paragraph
"struggle with a rebarbative nature, which is now already",Paragraph
beyond our control.,Paragraph
"The impasse of escalating climate change, which was",Paragraph
already a fact when the fourth edition of this history was,Paragraph
"published in 2007, is ever more apparent today as we",Paragraph
encounter the worldwide crisis of democracy and the,Title
accompanying hysteria of populist political reaction. Given,Paragraph
that this was already essentially the state of things at the,Paragraph
"millennium, | have elected to the eliminate the penultimate",Paragraph
chapter of the fourth edition and to expand its content into,Paragraph
"a new Part IV, under virtually the same title, ‘World",Paragraph
"Architecture and the Modern Movement’. Accordingly, the",Paragraph
"last chapter of the fourth edition, entitled ‘Architecture in",Paragraph
"the Age of Globalization’, has been kept in place as a coda",Paragraph
"to the fifth edition, carrying essentially the same content",Paragraph
save for certain material that has been absorbed into Part,Paragraph
IV.,Paragraph
"| began work on this history in 1970, when the idea of the",Paragraph
Modern Movement was still current on the London,Paragraph
"architectural scene despite the fact that, unknown at the",Paragraph
"time, the term ‘Modern Movement’ (Moderne Bewegung)",Paragraph
had first appeared in Otto Wagner’s book Moderne,Paragraph
Architektur (1896). While the term appears throughout the,Paragraph
"various editions of his book, the title of the last edition, of",Paragraph
"1914, was discreetly changed to Die Baukunst unserer Zeit",Paragraph
(The Architecture of our Time). Throughout the numerous,Paragraph
accounts of the evolution of the Modern Movement in,Paragraph
"architecture, there is a divide between authors who prefer",Paragraph
"to allude to a specific time period and others, like myself,",Paragraph
"who, possibly because they have had an architectural",Paragraph
"formation, prefer to allude to the Modern Movement in the",Paragraph
same way as the Italian architect-historian Leonardo,Paragraph
"Benevolo, whose two-volume Storia dell’architettura",Paragraph
"moderna of 1960, which was first published in English a",Paragraph
"decade later, specifically alluded to the Modern Movement",Paragraph
"in the subtitle of his second volume. Nevertheless, as we",Paragraph
pass from Gustav Adolf Platz’s pioneering Die Baukunst der,Title
neuesten Zeit (Building in our Time) of 1927 to Sigfried,Caption
"Giedion’s Space, Time and Architecture of 1941, to Arnold",Caption
Whittick’s European Architecture in the 20th Century of,Paragraph
1950 and finally to Reyner Banham’s Theory and Design in,Paragraph
"the First Machine Age of 1960, we notice that the",Paragraph
association of architecture with modernity is discreetly,Paragraph
"avoided, and likewise there is no reference to the Modern",Paragraph
Movement in an avant-gardist sense of that term. In this,Paragraph
"fifth edition, however, | have frequently had to return to the",Paragraph
idea of the Modern Movement by alluding to the beginnings,Paragraph
of a discernibly modern architecture in various parts of the,Paragraph
"world, under the decidedly open-ended title of ‘World",Paragraph
Architecture’.,Paragraph
The term ‘World Architecture’ was first coined by the,Paragraph
"China Architecture and Building Press in 2000, when it",Paragraph
"published its ambitious project of 1,000 significant buildings",Paragraph
"worldwide for the entire 20th century, which had been",Paragraph
critically selected by ten regional committees. The work was,Paragraph
"published in ten volumes, one for each region, with the",Paragraph
subtitle A Critical Mosaic 1900-2000. Something similar was,Paragraph
attempted for the period of the millennium alone through,Paragraph
Luis Fernandez-Galiano’s four-volume publication Atlas:,Title
"Global Architecture circa 2000, issued in 2007 by the BBVA",Paragraph
Foundation in Spain.,Paragraph
"In the new Part IV of my unduly ambitious account, | have",Paragraph
"attempted to assemble, under the rubric of ‘World",Paragraph
"Architecture’, a synthesis between these two editorial",Paragraph
operations. | have adopted Fernandez-Galiano’s approach of,Paragraph
audaciously dividing the world into four transcontinental,Paragraph
"regions - Europe, the Americas, Africa and the Middle East,",Paragraph
and Asia and the Pacific - while at the same time moving,Paragraph
"across the entire span of the 20th century to touch, however",Paragraph
"provisionally, not only on the beginnings of the Modern",Paragraph
"Movement in various parts of the world, but also on",Paragraph
relatively recent developments where these appear to merit,Paragraph
"inclusion. | feel it is necessary to add that, however dated",Paragraph
"this may seem, the Modern Movement was once inseparable",Paragraph
from the liberative modern project in the sense in which this,Paragraph
was defined by the German philosopher and sociologist,Paragraph
"Jurgen Habermas, implying an ultimately socialist welfare",Paragraph
state irrespective of the political ideology at a given instant,Paragraph
in time and at a specific place.,Paragraph
Here an effort has been made to widen the scope of the,Paragraph
book in order to redress the Eurocentric and transatlantic,Paragraph
"bias of previous editions of this history. However, it has not",Paragraph
proved possible to be as comprehensive as the title of the,Paragraph
new Part IV would suggest. One explanation is that there is,Paragraph
"a physical limit, beyond which the book becomes so thick",Paragraph
and cumbersome that it no longer fulfils its fundamental,Paragraph
role as a convenient reference work or textbook. The other,Paragraph
"limit is the embarrassing fact that, despite the best",Paragraph
"intentions of the author, no single person can possibly hope",Paragraph
to cover the vast breadth and complexity of contemporary,Paragraph
"architecture as it exists today, irrespective of whether the",Paragraph
focus is on the largely forgotten pioneering essays of the,Paragraph
"Modern Movement of the 1920s and 1930s, or the various",Paragraph
socio-political and cultural developments that have taken,Paragraph
place throughout the world over the last half-century.,Paragraph
While the material covered in Parts | and Il of Modern,Paragraph
"Architecture: A Critical History remain largely unaltered,",Paragraph
separate chapters dealing with developments in France and,Paragraph
Czechoslovakia between the two world wars have been,Paragraph
"inserted. At the same time, new lacunae have arisen in as",Paragraph
much as modern architecture in Russia after 1932 has been,Paragraph
"wilfully excluded from this account, as has Eastern European",Paragraph
architecture in general. My sole justification for this,Paragraph
"draconian omission is partly owing to the fact that, as Akos",Paragraph
"Moravansky has argued, after the collapse of the Soviet",Paragraph
"Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the inherently",Paragraph
destructive power of free-market capitalism led to the,Paragraph
general adoption of the so-called Moscow Style. This,Paragraph
judiciously combined international Post-Modernism with a,Paragraph
certain nostalgia for the Russian Art Nouveau in order to,Paragraph
produce an appropriate setting for the banks and shopping,Paragraph
malls built during the presidency of Boris Yeltsin (1991-99).,Paragraph
"Thus, despite talented forays here and there on the part of",Paragraph
"Eastern European architects, it has proved difficult until now",Paragraph
to discern any indications of an emerging regional culture of,Paragraph
consequence.,Paragraph
Despite the fact that the fifth edition makes a concerted,Paragraph
"effort to address large parts of the non-Eurocentric world,",Paragraph
"or, let us say, the post-colonial world, Europe nonetheless",Paragraph
still appears in Part IV as a continental sector because | feel,Paragraph
that in following Fernandez-Galiano’s taxonomy it is,Paragraph
necessary to pick up certain canonical works by prominent,Paragraph
"architects, particularly some Scandinavians, who had",Paragraph
previously been inexplicably overlooked in earlier editions.,Paragraph
"Nevertheless, there remain many omissions that are",Paragraph
"categorically difficult to justify, above all in Southeast Asia:",Paragraph
"Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore.",Paragraph
All of this begs the question as to what do we mean by a,Paragraph
culture of architecture and how do we begin to perceive it in,Paragraph
the first place? We surely have to concede that the Modern,Paragraph
"Movement in architecture has had, and continues to have, a",Paragraph
"decidedly wave-like character: it comes into being,",Paragraph
"somewhat unannounced, rises to its maturity and then",Paragraph
"eventually declines, possibly arising again in virtually the",Paragraph
same place but at an entirely different time and ina,Paragraph
"different form, to begin the cycle all over again. Throughout",Paragraph
this history | have made an effort to reveal this cyclical,Paragraph
character not only with regard to the movement’s,Paragraph
"Eurocentric beginnings, but also its manifestation in",Paragraph
contemporary architecture in the world at large. To this end |,Paragraph
have indicated from time to time the way in which certain,Paragraph
political and socio-economic transformations have had an,Paragraph
impact not only on the lifecycle of a given cultural,Paragraph
"momentum, but also on the programme and the character",Paragraph
of an emerging environmental form.,Paragraph
All of this has now shaped my approach to documenting,Paragraph
the dissemination of the Modern Movement across time. In,Paragraph
dealing with each vast continental sector and the national,Paragraph
"subsets of which it is necessarily comprised, | have",Paragraph
attempted to adopt the same procedure throughout:,Paragraph
beginning with a brief documentation of the Modern,Paragraph
Movement and then passing abruptly to more recent,Paragraph
manifestations of a similar impulse. This constant double-,Paragraph
take across large lapses of time has meant that | have had,Paragraph
to rely on illustrations to a much greater extent than in,Paragraph
"earlier editions of this history, because it is difficult to",Paragraph
convey the often highly inflected nature of recent,Paragraph
"architecture, which, while not in any way Post-Modern,",Paragraph
"nonetheless incorporates a tactile, microcosmic character",Paragraph
that is difficult to convey in words.,Paragraph
One of the challenges of writing an account over such a,Paragraph
broad front is the quandary of the criteria by which one,Paragraph
decides to include or exclude a particular work. Despite a,Paragraph
"constant attempt to maintain a certain level of objectivity,",Paragraph
there is an inescapable subjectivity determining one’s,Paragraph
choices. Perhaps this is the ultimate meaning of the term ‘a,Paragraph
critical history’ inasmuch as the historical account fuses,Paragraph
"with both criticism and theory, serving to justify expansion",Paragraph
"on a particular work or subject matter that one values, at",Paragraph
"the expense of the others that, because of time, space and",Paragraph
"polemical prejudices, one elects to ignore. Of course, there",Paragraph
"is no absolute history, for, as E.H. Carr made clear in his",Paragraph
"book What is History?, each age writes its own history and",Paragraph
in this sense creates a purview with which we may hopefully,Paragraph
proceed in a culturally significant way.,Paragraph
"It is ironic that the first edition of this history, written by",Paragraph
"an architect, committed to ‘the unfinished modern project’,",Paragraph
"to coin Jurgen Habermas’s memorable phrase, should have",Paragraph
been published in the same year as the first architectural,Paragraph
"biennale, staged in Venice in 1980. This exhibition, curated",Paragraph
"by Paolo Portoghesi, was dedicated to celebrating the",Paragraph
"historicizing pastiche of Post-Modern architecture, under the",Paragraph
"slogan, ‘The End of Prohibition and the Presence of the Past’.",Paragraph
"Since this time, subsequent editions of this history, of",Paragraph
"which this is the greatly expanded fifth edition, have been",Paragraph
"dedicated, in one way or another, to the continuation of the",Paragraph
modern project in terms of a liberative architecture.,Paragraph
"However, it has become increasingly clear that under the",Paragraph
"aegis of an anti-ecological, neo-liberal consumerism,",Paragraph
"continually exacerbating the the maldistribution of wealth,",Paragraph
"the prospects for any kind of rational land settlement, let",Paragraph
"alone urbanism, are extremely limited, if not totally",Paragraph
unavailable. At best what is left for the critical practice of,Paragraph
architecture at a large scale are predominantly horizontal,Paragraph
megaforms designed as artificial landscapes in order to,Paragraph
encapsulate some vestige of the civic and to stand against,Paragraph
the universal placelessness of the environment as a whole.,Paragraph

Neo-Classical Architecture,Title
1750-1900,Title
The Baroque system had operated as a kind of double,Paragraph
intersection. It had often contrasted with rationalized,Paragraph
"gardens, building facades decorated with plant motifs. The",Paragraph
reign of man and the reign of nature had certainly remained,Paragraph
"distinct but they had exchanged their characteristics,",Paragraph
merging into each other for the sake of ornamentation and,Paragraph
"prestige. On the other hand the ‘English style’ park, in which",Paragraph
"man’s intervention was supposed to remain invisible, was",Paragraph
"intended to offer the purposefulness of nature; while within,",Paragraph
"but separate from the actual park, the houses constructed",Paragraph
"by Morris or Adam manifested the will of man, isolating",Paragraph
Clearly the presence of human reason in the midst of the,Paragraph
irrational domains of freely growing vegetation. The,Paragraph
Baroque interpenetration of man and nature was now,Paragraph
"replaced by a separation, thus establishing the distance",Paragraph
between man and nature which was a prerequisite for,Paragraph
nostalgic contemplation. Now ... this contemplative,Paragraph
separation arose as a compensatory or expiatory reaction,Paragraph
against the growing attitude of practical men towards,Title
nature. While technical exploitation tended to wage war on,Paragraph
"nature, houses and parks attempted a reconciliation, a local",Paragraph
"armistice, introducing the dream of an impossible peace:",Paragraph
and to this end man had continued to retain the image of,Paragraph
untouched natural surroundings.,Paragraph
Jean Starobinski,Title
"L’Invention de la liberté, 19641",Caption
The architecture of Neo-Classicism seems to have emerged,Paragraph
out of two different but related developments which,Paragraph
radically transformed the relationship between man and,Paragraph
nature. The first was a sudden increase in man’s capacity to,Paragraph
"exercise control over nature, which by the mid-17th century",Paragraph
had begun to advance beyond the technical frontiers of the,Paragraph
Renaissance. The second was a fundamental shift in the,Paragraph
"nature of human consciousness, in response to major",Paragraph
"changes taking place in society, which gave birth to a new",Paragraph
cultural formation that was equally appropriate to the,Paragraph
lifestyles of the declining aristocracy and the rising,Title
bourgeoisie. Whereas technological changes led to a new,Paragraph
infrastructure and to the exploitation of an increased,Title
"productive capacity, the change in human consciousness",Title
yielded new categories of knowledge and a historicist mode,Paragraph
of thought that was so reflexive as to question its own,Paragraph
"identity. Where the one, grounded in science, took",Paragraph
immediate form in the extensive road and canal works of,Paragraph
the 17th and 18th centuries and gave rise to new technical,Paragraph
"institutions, such as the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées,",Paragraph
"founded in 1747, the other led to the emergence of the",Paragraph
"humanist disciplines of the Enlightenment, including the",Paragraph
"pioneer works of modern sociology, aesthetics, history and",Paragraph
"archaeology - Montesquieu’s De /’esprit des lois (1748),",Paragraph
"Baumgarten’s Aesthetica (1750), Voltaire’s Le Siécle de",Paragraph
Louis XIV(1751) and J. J. Winckelmann’s Geschichte der,Paragraph
Kunst des Altertums of 1764.,Paragraph
The over-elaboration of architectural language in the,Paragraph
Rococo interiors of the Ancien Régime and the secularization,Caption
of Enlightenment thought compelled the architects of the,Paragraph
"18th century, by now aware of the emergent and unstable",Paragraph
"nature of their age, to search for a true style through a",Paragraph
precise reappraisal of antiquity. Their motivation was not,Paragraph
simply to copy the ancients but to obey the principles on,Paragraph
which their work had been based. The archaeological,Paragraph
research that arose from this impulse soon led to a major,Paragraph
"controversy: to which, of four Mediterranean cultures - the",Paragraph
"Egyptians, the Etruscans, the Greeks and the Romans -",Paragraph
should they look for a true style?,Paragraph
One of the first consequences of reassessing the antique,Paragraph
world was to extend the itinerary of the traditional Grand,Paragraph
"Tour beyond the frontiers of Rome, so as to study at its",Paragraph
"periphery those cultures on which, according to Vitruvius,",Paragraph
Roman architecture had been based. The discovery and,Paragraph
"excavation of Roman cities at Herculaneum and Pompeii,",Paragraph
"during the first half of the 18th century, encouraged",Paragraph
expeditions further afield and visits were soon being made,Paragraph
to ancient Greek sites in both Sicily and Greece. The,Paragraph
received Vitruvian dictum of the Renaissance - the,Paragraph
catechism of Classicism - was now to be checked against,Paragraph
the actual ruins. The measured drawings that were,Paragraph
"published in the 1750s and 1760s, Julien-David Le Roy’s",Paragraph
"Ruines des plus beaux monuments de la Gréce (1758),",Caption
James Stuart and Nicholas Revett’s Antiquities of Athens,Title
"(1762), and Robert Adam and Charles-Louis Clérisseau’s",Paragraph
"documentation of Diocletian’s palace at Split (1764), testify",Caption
to the intensity with which these studies were pursued. It,Paragraph
was Le Roy’s promotion of Greek architecture as the origin,Paragraph
of the ‘true style’ that raised the chauvinist ire of the Italian,Paragraph
architect-engraver Giovanni Battista Piranesi.,Caption
Piranesi’s Della Magnificenza ed Architettura de’ Romani,Caption
of 1761 was a direct attack on Le Roy’s polemic: he asserted,Paragraph
not only that the Etruscans had antedated the Greeks but,Paragraph
"that, together with their successors the Romans, they had",Paragraph
raised architecture to a higher level of refinement. The only,Paragraph
evidence that he could cite in support of his claim was the,Paragraph
few Etruscan structures that had survived the ravages of,Paragraph
Rome - tombs and engineering works - and these seem to,Paragraph
have orientated the remainder of his career in a remarkable,Paragraph
way. In one set of etchings after another he represented the,Paragraph
dark side of that sensation already classified by Edmund,Paragraph
"Burke in 1757 as the Sublime, that tranquil terror induced",Paragraph
"by the contemplation of great size, extreme antiquity and",Paragraph
decay. These qualities acquired their full force in Piranesi’s,Paragraph
work through the infinite grandeur of the images that he,Paragraph
"portrayed. Such nostalgic Classical images were, however,",Paragraph
"as Manfredo Tafuri has observed, treated ‘as a myth to be",Paragraph
"contested ... as mere fragments, as deformed symbols, as",Paragraph
hallucinating organisms of an “order” in a state of decay’.,Paragraph
Between his Parere su i’Architettura of 1765 and his,Paragraph
"Paestum etchings, published only after his death in 1778,",Paragraph
Piranesi abandoned architectural verisimilitude and gave his,Paragraph
"imagination full rein. In one publication after another,",Paragraph
culminating in his extravagantly eclectic work on interior,Paragraph
"ornamentation of 1769, he indulged in hallucinatory",Paragraph
manipulations of historicist form. Indifferent to,Paragraph
Winckelmann’s pro-Hellenic distinction between innate,Paragraph
"beauty and gratuitous ornament, his delirious inventions",Paragraph
"exercised an irresistible attraction on his contemporaries,",Paragraph
and the Adam brothers’ Graeco-Roman interiors were,Paragraph
greatly indebted to his flights of imagination.,Paragraph
"In England, where the Rococo had never been fully",Paragraph
"accepted, the impulse to redeem the excess of the Baroque",Paragraph
found its first expression in the Palladianism initiated by the,Paragraph
"Earl of Burlington, though something of a similar purgative",Paragraph
spirit may be detected in the last works of Nicholas,Paragraph
"Hawksmoor at Castle Howard. By the end of the 1750s,",Paragraph
"however, the British were already assiduously pursuing",Paragraph
"instruction in Rome itself where, between 1750 and 1765,",Paragraph
the major Neo-Classical proponents could be found in,Paragraph
"residence, from the pro-Roman and pro-Etruscan Piranesi to",Paragraph
"the pro-Greek Winckelmann and Le Roy, whose influence",Paragraph
had yet to take effect. Among the British contingent were,Paragraph
"James Stuart, who was to employ the Greek Doric order as",Paragraph
"early as 1758, and the younger George Dance, who soon",Paragraph
"after his return to London in 1765 designed Newgate Gaol, a",Paragraph
superficially Piranesian structure whose rigorous,Paragraph
organization may well have owed something to the Neo-,Paragraph
Palladian proportional theories of Robert Morris. The final,Paragraph
development of British Neo-Classicism came first in the,Paragraph
"work of Dance’s pupil John Soane, who synthesized to a",Paragraph
"remarkable degree various influences drawn from Piranesi,",Paragraph
"Adam, Dance and even from the English Baroque. The Greek",Paragraph
"Revival cause was then popularized by Thomas Hope, whose",Paragraph
Household Furniture and Interior Decoration (1807) made,Paragraph
"available a British version of the Napoleonic ‘Style Empire’,",Paragraph
then in the process of being created by Charles Percier and,Paragraph
Pierre-Francois-Léonard Fontaine.,Caption
Nothing could have been further from the British,Paragraph
experience than the theoretical development that attended,Paragraph
the emergence of Neo-Classicism in France. An early,Paragraph
awareness of cultural relativity in the late 17th century,Title
prompted Claude Perrault to question the validity of the,Paragraph
Vitruvian proportions as these had been received and,Paragraph
"refined through Classical theory. Instead, he elaborated his",Paragraph
"thesis of positive beauty and arbitrary beauty, giving to the",Paragraph
former the normative role of standardization and perfection,Title
and to the latter such expressive function as may be,Paragraph
required by a particular circumstance or character.,Paragraph
This challenge to Vitruvian orthodoxy was codified by the,Paragraph
Abbé de Cordemoy in his Nouveau Traité de toute,Paragraph
"l’architecture (1706), where he replaced the Vitruvian",Paragraph
"attributes of architecture, namely utilitas, firmitas and",Paragraph
"venustas (utility, solidity and beauty) by his own trinity of",Paragraph
"ordonnance, distribution and bienséance. While the first two",Paragraph
of his categories concerned the correct proportioning of the,Paragraph
"Classical orders and their appropriate disposition, the third",Paragraph
"introduced the notion of fitness, with which Cordemoy",Paragraph
warned against the inappropriate application of Classical or,Paragraph
honorific elements to utilitarian or commercial structures.,Paragraph
"Thus, in addition to being critical of the Baroque, which was",Paragraph
"the last rhetorical, public manner of the Ancien Régime,",Paragraph
Cordemoy’s Traité anticipated Jacques-Frangois Blondel’s,Paragraph
preoccupation with appropriate formal expression and with,Paragraph
a differentiated physiognomy to accord with the varying,Paragraph
social character of different building types. The age was,Paragraph
already having to confront the articulation of a much more,Paragraph
complex society.,Paragraph
Apart from insisting on the judicious application of,Paragraph
"Classical elements, Cordemoy was concerned with their",Paragraph
"geometrical purity, in reaction against such Baroque devices",Paragraph
"as irregular columniation, broken pediments and twisted",Paragraph
"columns. Ornamentation too had to be subject to propriety,",Paragraph
"and Cordemoy, anticipating Adolf Loos’s Ornament und",Paragraph
"Verbrechen (Ornament and Crime) by two hundred years,",Paragraph
argued that many buildings required no ornament at all. His,Paragraph
preference was for astylar masonry and orthogonal,Paragraph
"structures. For him, the free-standing column was the",Paragraph
essence of a pure architecture such as had been made,Paragraph
manifest in the Gothic cathedral and the Greek temple.,Paragraph
The Abbé Laugier in his Essai sur l’architecture (1753),Caption
"reinterpreted Cordemoy, to posit a universal ‘natural’",Paragraph
"architecture, the primordial ‘primitive hut’ consisting of four",Paragraph
"tree trunks supporting a rustic pitched roof. After Cordemoy,",Paragraph
he asserted this primal form as the basis for a sort of,Paragraph
classicized Gothic structure in which there would be neither,Paragraph
arches nor pilasters nor pedestals nor any other kind of,Paragraph
"formal articulation, and where the interstices between the",Paragraph
columns would be as fully glazed as possible.,Paragraph
Such a ‘translucent’ structure was realized in Jacques-,Paragraph
"Germain Soufflot’s church of Ste-Geneviéve in Paris [2],",Caption
"begun in 1755. Soufflot, who in 1750 had been one of the",Paragraph
"first architects to visit the Doric temples at Paestum, was",Paragraph
"determined to recreate the lightness, the spaciousness and",Paragraph
the proportion of Gothic architecture in Classical (not to say,Paragraph
"Roman) terms. To this end he adopted a Greek cross plan,",Paragraph
the nave and aisles being formed by a system of flat domes,Paragraph
and semicircular arches supported on a continuous internal,Paragraph
peristyle.,Paragraph
The task of integrating the theory of Cordemoy and the,Paragraph
magnum opus of Soufflot into the French academic tradition,Title
"fell to Blondel, who, after opening his architectural school in",Paragraph
"Rue de la Harpe in 1743, became the master of that so-",Paragraph
called ‘visionary’ generation of architects that included,Paragraph
"Etienne-Louis Boullée, Jacques Gondoin, Pierre Patte, Marie-",Caption
"Joseph Peyre, Jean-Baptiste Rondelet and, probably the most",Paragraph
"visionary of all, Claude-Nicolas Ledoux. Blondel set out his",Paragraph
"main precepts, concerning composition, type and character,",Paragraph
"in his Cours d’architecture, published from 1750 to 1770.",Paragraph
"His ideal church design, published in the second volume of",Paragraph
"his Cours, was related to Ste-Geneviéve and prominently",Paragraph
"displayed a representational front, while articulating each",Paragraph
internal element as part of a continuous spatial system,Paragraph
whose infinite vistas evoked a sense of the Sublime. This,Paragraph
church project hints at the simplicity and grandeur that,Paragraph
"were to inform the work of many of his pupils, most notably",Paragraph
"Boullée, who after 1772 devoted his life to the projection of",Paragraph
buildings so vast as to preclude their realization.,Paragraph
In addition to representing the social character of his,Paragraph
"creations in accordance with the teachings of Blondel,",Paragraph
Boullée evoked the sublime emotions of terror and,Paragraph
tranquillity through the grandeur of his conceptions.,Paragraph
Influenced by Le Camus de Méziéres’ Génie de,Paragraph
"l'architecture, ou l’analogie de cet art avec nos sensations",Title
"(1780), he began to develop his genre terrible, in which the",Paragraph
immensity of the vista and the unadorned geometrical,Title
purity of monumental form are combined in such a way as,Paragraph
to promote exhilaration and anxiety. More than any other,Paragraph
"Enlightenment architect, Boullée was obsessed with the",Paragraph
capacity of light to evoke the presence of the divine. This,Paragraph
intention is evident in the sunlit diaphanous haze that,Paragraph
"illuminates the interior of his ‘Métropole’, modelled partly on",Paragraph
Ste-Geneviéve. A similar light is portrayed in the vast,Paragraph
masonry sphere of his projected cenotaph for Isaac Newton,Caption
"[3], where by night a fire was suspended to represent the",Paragraph
"sun, while by day it was extinguished to reveal the illusion",Paragraph
of the firmament produced by the daylight shining through,Paragraph
the sphere’s perforated walls.,Paragraph
"3 Boullée, project for a cenotaph for Isaac Newton, c. 1785. Section by ‘night’.",Caption
While Boullée’s political sentiments were solidly,Paragraph
"republican, he remained obsessed with imagining the",Paragraph
monuments of some omnipotent state dedicated to the,Paragraph
"worship of the Supreme Being. Unlike Ledoux, he was",Paragraph
unimpressed by the rural decentralized utopias of Morelly or,Paragraph
"Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Despite this, his influence in post-",Paragraph
"Revolutionary Europe was considerable, primarily through",Paragraph
"the activity of his pupil Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand, who",Paragraph
reduced his extravagant ideas to a normative and economic,Paragraph
"building typology, set out in the Précis des lecons données a",Paragraph
l’Ecole Polytechnique (1802-09) [4].,Caption
"4 Durand, possible combinations and permutations of plan forms, from his",Caption
"Précis, 1802-09.",Caption
After fifteen years of millennial disarray the Napoleonic,Paragraph
era required useful structures of appropriate grandeur and,Paragraph
"authority, on the condition that they be achieved as cheaply",Paragraph
"as possible. Durand, the first tutor in architecture at the",Paragraph
"Ecole Polytechnique, sought to establish a universal building",Paragraph
"methodology, an architectural counterpart to the Napoleonic",Paragraph
"Code, by which economic and appropriate structures could",Paragraph
be created through the modular permutation of fixed plan,Paragraph
types and alternative elevations. Thus Boullée’s obsession,Paragraph
with vast Platonic volumes was exploited as a means to,Paragraph
achieve an appropriate character at a reasonable cost.,Paragraph
"Durand’s criticism of Ste-Geneviéve, for example, with its",Paragraph
"206 columns and 612 metres (2,008 feet) of wall, involved",Caption
him in making a counter-proposal for a circular temple of,Paragraph
comparable area that would require only 112 columns and,Paragraph
"248 metres (814 feet) of wall - a considerable economy,",Paragraph
"with which, according to him, one would have achieved a far",Paragraph
more impressive aura.,Paragraph
"Ledoux, after his career had been terminated by the",Paragraph
"Revolution, returned during his imprisonment to develop the",Paragraph
scheme of the salt works that he had built for Louis XVI at,Paragraph
Arc-et-Senans in 1773-79. He expanded the semicircular,Paragraph
form of this complex into the representational core of his,Paragraph
"ideal city of Chaux [5], published in 1804 under the title",Paragraph
"L’Architecture considérée sous le rapport de I’art, des",Caption
moeurs et de la législation. The semicircular salt works itself,Paragraph
(which he developed into the oval centre of his city) may be,Paragraph
"seen as one of the first essays in industrial architecture,",Paragraph
inasmuch as it consciously integrated productive units with,Paragraph
workers’ housing. Each element in this physiocratic complex,Paragraph
was rendered according to its character. Thus the salt,Paragraph
evaporation sheds on the axis were high-roofed like,Paragraph
"agricultural buildings and finished in smooth ashlar, with",Paragraph
"rusticated dressings, while the director’s house in the centre",Paragraph

symbolized the saline solution on which the enterprise was,Paragraph
based but also suggested that the productive system and,Paragraph
the labour force had an equally processal status.,Paragraph
"5 Ledoux, ideal city of Chaux, 1804.",Caption
In fictitiously developing this limited typology to include,Paragraph
"all the institutions of his ideal city, Ledoux extended the",Paragraph
idea of an architectural ‘physiognomy’ to symbolize the,Paragraph
social intention of his otherwise abstract forms. The,Paragraph
"meanings are established either by conventional symbols,",Paragraph
such as the fasces evoking justice and unity on the,Paragraph
"courthouse, the so-called Pacifére, or by isomorphism, as in",Paragraph
"the case of the Oikema, planned in the shape of a penis.",Paragraph
"This last structure was dedicated to libertinage, whose",Paragraph
curious social purpose was to induce virtue through sexual,Paragraph
satiety.,Paragraph
A whole world separates Durand’s rational permutation,Paragraph
of received Classical elements from Ledoux’s arbitrary but,Paragraph
purgative reconstitution of fragmented Classical parts,Title
demonstrated in the toll-gates that he designed for Paris,Paragraph
between 1785 and 1789. These barriéres were just as,Paragraph
disconnected from the culture of their time as the idealized,Paragraph
institutions of Chaux. With their gradual demolition after,Paragraph
1789 they suffered the same fate as the abstract and,Paragraph
unpopular customs boundary that they were intended to,Paragraph
"administer, the Enceinte des Fermiers Généraux, of which it",Paragraph

"After the Revolution, the evolution of Neo-Classicism was",Paragraph
largely inseparable from the need to accommodate the new,Paragraph
institutions of bourgeois society and to represent the,Paragraph
emergence of the new republican state. That these forces,Paragraph
were initially resolved in the compromise of constitutional,Paragraph
monarchy hardly detracted from the role that Neo-,Paragraph
Classicism played in the formation of the bourgeois,Paragraph
imperialist style. The creation of Napoleon’s ‘Style Empire’,Paragraph
in Paris and Frederick Il’s Francophile ‘Kulturnation’ in Berlin,Paragraph
are but separate manifestations of the same cultural,Paragraph
tendency. The former made an eclectic use of antique,Paragraph
"motifs, be they Roman, Greek or Egyptian, to create the",Paragraph
instant heritage of a republican dynasty - a style that,Paragraph
revealed itself significantly in the theatrical tented interiors,Paragraph

the myth of the ideal Prussian state. His remarkable,Paragraph
monument would have taken the form of an artificial,Paragraph
acropolis on the Leipzigerplatz. This temenos would have,Paragraph
been entered from Potsdam through a squat triumphal arch,Paragraph
capped by a quadriga.,Paragraph
"Gilly’s colleague and successor, the Prussian architect",Paragraph
"Karl Friedrich Schinkel, acquired his early enthusiasm for",Paragraph
"Gothic not from Berlin or Paris, but from his own first-hand",Paragraph
experience of Italian cathedrals. Yet after the defeat of,Paragraph
"Napoleon in 1815, this Romantic taste was largely eclipsed",Paragraph
by the need to find an appropriate expression for the,Paragraph
triumph of Prussian nationalism. The combination of political,Paragraph
idealism and military prowess seems to have demanded a,Paragraph
return to the Classic. In any event this was the style that,Paragraph
"linked Schinkel not only to Gilly but also to Durand, in the",Paragraph
creation of his masterpieces in Berlin: his Neue Wache of,Paragraph
"1816, his Schauspielhaus of 1821 and his Altes Museum of",Paragraph
1830 [6]. While both the guard-house and the theatre show,Paragraph

massive corners of the one and the mullioned wings of the,Paragraph

"the museum, which is a prototypical museum plan taken",Paragraph
from the Précis and split in half - a transformation in which,Paragraph
"the central rotunda, peristyle and courtyards are retained",Paragraph
and the side wings eliminated (see p. 269). While the wide,Paragraph
"entry steps, the peristyle and the eagles and Dioscuri on the",Caption
roof symbolized the cultural aspirations of the Prussian,Paragraph
"state, Schinkel departed from the typological and",Paragraph
representational methods of Durand to create a spatial,Paragraph

symmetrical entry stair and its mezzanine (an arrangement,Paragraph
which would be remembered by Mies van der Rohe).,Paragraph

The main line of Blondel’s Neo-Classicism was continued,Paragraph
"in the mid-19th century in the career of Henri Labrouste,",Paragraph
who had studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts (the institution,Paragraph
that succeeded the Académie Royale d’Architecture after,Paragraph
"the Revolution) with Antoine-Laurent-Thomas Vaudoyer, who",Paragraph
had been a pupil of Peyre. After winning the Prix de Rome in,Paragraph
1824 Labrouste spent the next five years at the French,Paragraph
"Academy, devoting much of his time in Italy to a study of",Paragraph
the Greek temples at Paestum. Inspired by the work of,Paragraph
"Jakob-Ignaz Hittorff, Labrouste was among the first to argue",Paragraph
that such structures had originally been brightly coloured.,Paragraph
"This, and his insistence on the primacy of structure and on",Paragraph
"the derivation of all ornament from construction, brought",Paragraph
him into conflict with the authorities after the opening of his,Paragraph
own atelier in 1830.,Paragraph
In 1840 Labrouste was named architect of the,Paragraph
Bibliotheque Ste-Geneviéve in Paris which had been created,Paragraph
to house part of the library impounded by the French state,Paragraph
in 1789. Based apparently on Boullée’s project for a library,Paragraph
"in the Palais Mazarin, of 1785, Labrouste’s design consists of",Paragraph
a perimeter wall of books enclosing a rectilinear space and,Paragraph
"supporting an iron-framed, barrel-vaulted roof which is",Paragraph
divided into two halves and further supported in the centre,Paragraph
of the space by a line of iron columns.,Paragraph
Such Structural Rationalism was further refined in the,Paragraph
main reading room and book stack that Labrouste built for,Caption
"the Bibliotheque Nationale in 1860-68 [7]. This complex,",Paragraph
"inserted into the courtyard of the Palais Mazarin, consists of",Paragraph
a reading room covered by an iron and glass roof carried on,Caption
sixteen cast-iron columns and a multi-storey wrought- and,Caption
cast-iron book stack. Dispensing with the last trace of,Caption
"historicism, Labrouste designed the latter as a top-lit cage,",Paragraph
in which light filters down through iron landings from the,Paragraph
roof to the lowest floor. Although this solution was derived,Paragraph
from Sydney Smirke’s cast-iron reading room and stack built,Caption

The middle of the 19th century saw the Neo-Classical,Paragraph
heritage divided between two closely related lines of,Paragraph
development: the Structural Classicism of Labrouste and the,Title
Romantic Classicism of Schinkel. Both ‘schools’ were,Paragraph
confronted by the same 19th-century proliferation of new,Paragraph
institutions and had to respond equally to the task of,Paragraph
creating new building types. They differed largely in the,Paragraph
manner in which they achieved these representative,Paragraph
qualities: the Structural Classicists tended to emphasize,Paragraph
"structure - the line of Cordemoy, Laugier and Soufflot; while",Paragraph
the Romantic Classicists tended to stress the physiognomic,Paragraph
"character of the form itself - the line of Ledoux, Boullée and",Paragraph
Gilly. Where one ‘school’ seems to have concentrated on,Paragraph
"such types as prisons, hospitals and railway stations, in the",Paragraph
work of men like Emile-Jacques Gilbert and Francois-,Paragraph

"In terms of theory, Structural Classicism began with",Paragraph
Rondelet’s Traité de /’art de batir (1802) and culminated at,Paragraph
the end of the century in the writing of the engineer,Paragraph
"Auguste Choisy, particularly his Histoire de I’architecture",Paragraph
(1899). For Choisy the essence of architecture is,Paragraph
"construction, and all stylistic transformations are merely the",Paragraph
logical consequence of technical development: ‘To parade,Title
your Art Nouveau is to ignore the whole teaching of history.,Paragraph
Not so did the great styles of the past come into being. It,Paragraph
was in the suggestion of construction that the architect of,Paragraph
the great artistic ages found his truest inspiration.’ Choisy,Paragraph
illustrated the structural determination of his Histoire with,Paragraph
axonometric projections [8] which revealed the essence of a,Paragraph
"type of form in a single graphic image, comprising plan,",Paragraph
"section and elevation. As Reyner Banham has observed,",Paragraph
these objective illustrations reduce the architecture that,Paragraph
"they represent to pure abstraction, and it was this, plus the",Paragraph
"amount of the information they synthesized, that endeared",Paragraph
them to the pioneers of the Modern Movement after the turn,Title
of the century.,Paragraph
"8 Choisy, axonometric projection of part of the Panthéon, Paris (fig. 2), from his",Caption
"Histoire de l’architecture, 1899.",Caption
The emphasis that Choisy’s history placed on Greek and,Paragraph
Gothic architecture was a late 19th-century rationalization,Paragraph
of that Graeco-Gothic ideal which had first been formulated,Paragraph
over a century before by Cordemoy. This 18th-century,Paragraph
projection of Gothic structure into Classical syntax found its,Paragraph
parallel in Choisy’s characterization of the Doric as wooden,Paragraph
structure transposed into masonry. Just such a transposition,Paragraph
"was to be practised by Choisy’s disciple, Auguste Perret,",Paragraph
who insisted on detailing his reinforced-concrete structures,Paragraph
after the manner of traditional wood framing.,Paragraph
"A Structural Rationalist to the core, Choisy was",Paragraph
nonetheless capable of responding to the Romantic,Paragraph
sensibility when he wrote of the Acropolis: ‘The Greeks,Paragraph
never visualized a building without the site that framed it,Paragraph
and the other buildings that surrounded it... each,Paragraph
"architectural motif, on its own, is symmetrical, but every",Paragraph
group is treated like a landscape where the masses alone,Paragraph
balance out.’,Paragraph
Such a Picturesque notion of partially symmetrical,Paragraph
balance would have been as foreign to the teaching of the,Paragraph
Beaux-Arts as it was to the polytechnical approach of,Paragraph
Durand. Certainly it would have had a limited appeal for,Paragraph
"Julien Guadet, who sought, in his lecture course E/éments et",Paragraph
"théorie de I’architecture (1902), to establish a normative",Paragraph
approach to the composition of structures from technically,Title
"up-to-date elements, arranged as far as possible according",Paragraph

"The finite city, as it had come into being in Europe over the",Paragraph

a century by the interaction of a number of unprecedented,Paragraph
"technical and socio-economic forces, many of which first",Paragraph
emerged in England during the second half of the 18th,Paragraph
century. Prominent among them from a technical point of,Paragraph
view must be counted such innovations as Abraham Darby’s,Paragraph
"mass production of cast-iron rails, from 1767, and Jethro",Paragraph
"Tull’s seed-drill cultivation of crops in rows, generally",Paragraph
adopted after 1731. Where Darby’s invention led to Henry,Paragraph
Cort’s development of the puddling process for the,Paragraph
"simplified conversion of cast to wrought iron in 1784, Tull’s",Paragraph
drill was essential to the perfection of Charles Townshend’s,Paragraph
four-crop rotational system - the principle of ‘high farming’,Paragraph
that became general towards the end of the century.,Paragraph
Such productive innovations had multiple repercussions.,Paragraph
"In the case of metallurgy, English iron production increased",Paragraph
forty-fold between 1750 and 1850 (rising to two million tons,Paragraph
"a year by 1850); in the case of agriculture, after the",Paragraph
Enclosures Act of 1771 inefficient husbandry was replaced,Paragraph
by the four-crop system. Where the one was boosted by the,Paragraph
"Napoleonic Wars, the other was motivated by the need to",Paragraph
feed a rapidly growing industrial population.,Paragraph
"At the same time the cottage-weaving industry, which",Paragraph
had helped to sustain the agrarian economy of the first half,Paragraph
"of the 18th century, was rapidly changed, first by James",Paragraph
"Hargreaves’s spinning jenny of 1764, which greatly",Paragraph
"increased the individual’s spinning capacity, and then by",Paragraph
"Edmund Cartwright’s steam-powered loom, first used for",Paragraph
factory production in 1784. This last event not only,Paragraph
"established textile production as a large-scale industry, but",Paragraph
also led immediately to the invention of the multistorey,Paragraph
fireproof mill. Thus traditional textile manufacturing was,Paragraph
forced to abandon its predominantly rural base and to,Paragraph
"concentrate both labour and plant, first next to",Paragraph
"watercourses and then, with the advent of steam power,",Paragraph
"close to coal deposits. With 24,000 power looms in",Paragraph
"production by 1820, the English mill town was already an",Paragraph
established fact.,Paragraph
"This process of uprooting - enracinement, as Simone Weil",Paragraph
has called it - was further accelerated by the use of steam,Paragraph
traction for transport. Richard Trevithick first demonstrated,Paragraph
the locomotive on cast-iron rails in 1804. The opening of the,Paragraph
first public rail service between Stockton and Darlington in,Caption
1825 was followed by the rapid development of a,Paragraph
"completely new infrastructure, Britain having some 10,000",Paragraph
miles of track in place by 1860. The advent of long-distance,Paragraph
steam navigation after 1865 greatly increased European,Paragraph
"migration to the Americas, Africa and Australia. While this",Paragraph
migration brought the populations needed to expand the,Paragraph
economy of colonial terrirories and to fill the growing grid-,Paragraph
"plan cities of the New World, the military, political and",Title
economic obsolescence of the traditional European walled,Title
"city led, after the liberal-national revolutions of 1848, to the",Paragraph
wholesale demolition of ramparts and to the extension of,Paragraph
the formerly finite city into its already burgeoning suburbs.,Paragraph
"These general developments, accompanied by a sudden",Paragraph
drop in mortality due to improved standards in nutrition and,Paragraph
"medical techniques, gave rise to unprecedented urban",Paragraph
"concentrations, first in England and then, at differing rates",Paragraph
"of growth, throughout the developing world. Manchester’s",Paragraph
"population grew eight-fold in the course of the century, from",Paragraph
"75,000 in 1801 to 600,000 by 1901, as compared to",Paragraph
"London's six-fold increase over the same period, from",Paragraph
around one million in 1801 to six and a half million by the,Paragraph
turn of the century. Paris grew at a comparable rate but had,Paragraph
"a more modest beginning, expanding from 500,000 in 1801",Paragraph
to 3 million by 1901. Even these six- to eight-fold increases,Paragraph
are modest compared with New York’s growth over the,Paragraph
same period. New York was first laid out as a gridded city in,Paragraph
"1811, in accordance with the Commissioners’ Plan of that",Paragraph
"year, and grew from its 1801 population of 33,000 to",Paragraph
"500,000 by 1850 and 3% million by 1901. Chicago grew at",Paragraph
"an even more astronomical rate, rising from 300 people at",Paragraph
"the time of Thompson’s grid of 1833 to around 30,000 (of",Paragraph
whom something under half had been born in the States) by,Paragraph
"1850, and going on to become a city of two million by the",Paragraph
turn of the century.,Paragraph
The accommodation of such volatile growth led to the,Paragraph
"transformation of old neighbourhoods into slums, and also",Paragraph
to jerry-built new houses and tenements whose main,Paragraph
"purpose, given the general lack of municipal transport, was",Paragraph
to provide as cheaply as possible the maximum amount of,Paragraph
rudimentary shelter within walking distance of the centres,Caption
of production. Naturally such congested developments had,Paragraph
"inadequate standards of light, ventilation and open space",Title
"and poor sanitary facilities, such as communal outside",Paragraph
"lavatories, wash-houses and refuse storage. With primitive",Paragraph
"drainage and inadequate maintenance, this pattern could",Paragraph
lead to the piling up of excrement and garbage and to,Paragraph
"flooding, and these conditions naturally provoked a high",Paragraph
"incidence of disease - first tuberculosis and then, more",Paragraph
"alarmingly for the authorities, a number of outbreaks of",Paragraph
cholera in both England and Continental Europe in the,Paragraph
1830s and 1840s.,Paragraph
These epidemics had the effect of precipitating health,Paragraph
reform and of bringing about some of the earliest legislation,Title
governing the construction and maintenance of dense,Title
conurbations. In 1833 the London authorities instructed the,Paragraph
"Poor Law Commission, headed by Edwin Chadwick, to make",Paragraph
enquiries about the origins of a cholera outbreak in,Paragraph
"Whitechapel. This led to Chadwick’s report, An Inquiry into",Paragraph
the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population in Great,Title
"Britain (1842), to the Royal Commission on the State of",Paragraph
"Large Towns and Populous Districts of 1844 and, eventually,",Paragraph
"to the Public Health Act of 1848. This Act, in addition to",Paragraph
"others, made local authorities legally responsible for",Paragraph
"sewerage, refuse collection, water supply, roads, the",Title
inspection of slaughter-houses and the burial of the dead.,Paragraph
Similar provisions were to occupy Haussmann during the,Paragraph
rebuilding of Paris between 1853 and 1870.,Paragraph
The result of this legislation in England was to make,Paragraph
society vaguely aware of the need to upgrade working-class,Paragraph
housing; but as to the models and means by which this,Paragraph
should be achieved there was little initial agreement.,Paragraph
"Nonetheless, the Chadwick-inspired Society for Improving",Paragraph
the Conditions of the Labouring Classes sponsored the,Paragraph
erection of the first working-class flats in London in 1844 to,Paragraph
"the design of the architect Henry Roberts, and followed this",Paragraph
resolute beginning with its Streatham Street flats of 1848-,Paragraph
50 and a prototypical two-storey worker's cottage,Caption
"containing four flats, again to the design of Roberts, for the",Paragraph
Great Exhibition of 1851. This generic model for the,Paragraph
stacking of apartments in pairs around a common staircase,Paragraph
was to influence the planning of working-class housing for,Paragraph
the rest of the century.,Paragraph
The American-backed philanthropic Peabody Trust and,Paragraph
various English benevolent societies and local authorities,Title
"attempted, after 1864, to upgrade the quality of working-",Paragraph
"class housing, but little of significance was achieved until",Paragraph
the slum clearance Acts of 1868 and 1875 and the Housing,Title
"of the Working Classes Act of 1890, under which local",Paragraph
"authorities were required to provide public housing. In 1893,",Paragraph
when the London County Council (established in 1890),Title
"began to build workers’ flats under the auspices of this Act,",Paragraph
its Architects’ Department made a remarkable effort to,Paragraph
deinstitutionalize the image of such housing by adapting the,Paragraph
Arts and Crafts domestic style (see p. 53) to the realization,Paragraph
of six-storey blocks of flats. Typical of this development is,Paragraph
"the Millbank Estate, begun in 1897.",Paragraph
Throughout the 19th century the effort of industry to take,Paragraph
"care of its own assumed many forms, from the ‘model’ mill,",Paragraph
railway and factory towns to projected utopian communities,Title
intended as prototypes for some future enlightened state.,Paragraph
Among those who manifested an early concern for,Paragraph
integrated industrial settlements one must acknowledge,Title
"Robert Owen, whose New Lanark in Scotland (1815) was",Paragraph
designed as a pioneering institution of the co-operative,Paragraph
"movement, and Sir Titus Salt, whose Saltaire, near Bradford",Paragraph
"in Yorkshire (founded in 1850), was a paternalistic mill town,",Paragraph
complete with traditional urban institutions such as a,Paragraph
"church, an infirmary, a secondary school, public baths,",Paragraph
almshouses and a park.,Paragraph
Neither of these realizations could match in scope and,Paragraph
liberating potential the radical vision of Charles Fourier’s,Paragraph
"‘new industrial world’, as formulated in his essay of that title",Paragraph
(Le Nouveau Monde industriel) published in 1829. Fourier’s,Paragraph
non-repressive society was to depend on the establishment,Paragraph
"of ideal communities or ‘phalanxes’, housed in pha/anstéres,",Paragraph
where people were to be related in accordance with,Paragraph
Fourier’s psychological principle of ‘passional attraction’.,Paragraph
Since the phalanstery was projected as being in open,Paragraph
"country, its economy was to be predominantly agricultural,",Paragraph
supplemented by light manufacturing. In his earliest,Paragraph
writings Fourier outlined the physical attributes of his,Paragraph
communal settlement; it was modelled on the layout of,Paragraph
"Versailles, its central wing being given over to public",Paragraph
"functions (dining hall, library, winter-garden, etc.), while its",Paragraph
side wings were devoted to the workshops and the,Paragraph
caravanseray. In his Traité de l'association domestique,Paragraph
agricole (1822) Fourier wrote of the phalanstery as being a,Paragraph
miniature town whose streets would have the advantage of,Paragraph
not being exposed to the weather. He saw it as a structure,Paragraph
"whose grandeur, if generally adopted, would replace the",Paragraph
petit-bourgeois squalor of the small individual free-standing,Paragraph
"houses that were, by then, already filling the outer",Paragraph
interstices of towns.,Paragraph
"Fourier’s disciple Victor Considérant, writing in 1838,",Paragraph
mixed the metaphor of Versailles with that of the steamship,Paragraph
"and questioned whether it was ‘easier to house 1,800 men",Paragraph
"right in the middle of the ocean, six hundred leagues from",Paragraph
"every shore, ... than to house in a unitary construction some",Paragraph
"1,800 good peasants in the heart of Champagne or firmly on",Caption
the soil of Beauce?’ This particular conflation of commune,Paragraph
"and ship was to be returned to by Le Corbusier, over a",Paragraph
"century later, in his self-contained commune or Unité",Paragraph
"d’Habitation, realized with Fourierist overtones at Marseilles",Paragraph
in 1952 (see p. 259).,Paragraph
The enduring importance of Fourier lies in his radical,Paragraph
"criticism of industrialized production and social organization,",Paragraph
"for, despite numerous attempts to create phalansteries in",Paragraph
"both Europe and America, his new industrial world was fated",Paragraph
to remain a dream. Its closest realization was the Familistére,Paragraph
"[9], built by the industrialist Jean-Baptiste André Godin next",Caption
to his factory at Guise in 1859-70. This complex comprised,Paragraph
"three residential blocks, a créche, a kindergarten, a theatre,",Paragraph
"schools, public baths and a laundry. Each residential block",Paragraph
enclosed a top-lit central courtyard which took the place of,Paragraph
the elevated corridor streets of the phalanstery. In his book,Paragraph
Solutions sociales (1870) Godin absorbed the more radical,Paragraph
aspects of Fourierism by showing how the system could be,Paragraph
adapted to co-operative family living without resorting to,Paragraph
the eccentric theories of ‘passional attraction’.,Paragraph
"9 Godin, Familistére, Guise, 1859-70.",Caption
"Aside from accommodating the labouring masses,",Paragraph
London’s 18th-century matrix of streets and squares was,Paragraph
extended throughout the 19th century to meet the,Paragraph
residential requirements of a growing urban middle class.,Paragraph
"No longer satisfied, however, with the scale and texture of",Paragraph
the occasional green square - delimited on all sides by,Paragraph
streets and continuous terraces - the English Park,Title
"Movement, founded by the gardener Humphry Repton,",Paragraph
attempted to project the ‘landscaped country estate’ into,Paragraph
"the city. Repton himself succeeded in demonstrating this, in",Paragraph
"collaboration with the architect John Nash, in their layout of",Paragraph
Regent’s Park in London (1812-27). After the victory over,Paragraph
"Napoleon in 1815, the proposed development enclosing the",Paragraph
"park was augmented, under royal patronage, by a",Paragraph
"continuous ‘display’ facade, penetrating into the existing",Paragraph
urban fabric and extending as a more or less uninterrupted,Paragraph
ribbon of terraced accommodation from the aristocratic,Caption
vistas of Regent’s Park in the north to the palatial urbanity,Paragraph
of St James’s Park and Carlton House Terrace in the south.,Caption
The squirearchical concept of the Neo-Classical country,Paragraph
house set in an irregular landscape (an image derived from,Paragraph
the Picturesque work of Capability Brown and Uvedale Price),Title
was thus translated by Nash to the provision of terraced,Paragraph
housing on the perimeter of an urban park. This model was,Paragraph
first systematically adapted to general use by Sir Joseph,Paragraph

"Frederick Law Olmsted’s Central Park in New York,",Caption
"inaugurated in 1857, was directly influenced by Paxton’s",Paragraph
"example, even down to its separation of carriage traffic from",Paragraph
pedestrians. The concept received its final elaboration in the,Paragraph
"Parisian parks created by Jean Charles Adolphe Alphand,",Paragraph
where the circulation system totally dictated the manner in,Paragraph
"which the park was to be used. With Alphand, the park",Paragraph
becomes a civilizing influence for the newly urbanized,Paragraph
masses.,Paragraph
The irregular lake that Nash created in St James’s Park in,Paragraph
1828 out of the rectangular basin that the Mollet brothers,Paragraph
had made in 1662 may be taken to symbolize the victory of,Paragraph
the English Picturesque over the French Cartesian,Title
conception of landscape dating from the 17th century. The,Paragraph
"French, who had hitherto regarded greenery as another",Paragraph
order of architecture and had rendered their avenues as,Paragraph
"colonnades of trees, were to find the romantic appeal of",Paragraph
Repton’s irregular landscape irresistible. After the Revolution,Paragraph

the physical aspect of this complex problem was percement.,Paragraph
"His broad purpose was, as Francoise Choay has written, ‘to",Paragraph
give unity and transform into an operative whole the “huge,Paragraph

agglomerate’. Although the Artists’ Plan of 1793 and before,Paragraph
that Pierre Patte’s plan of 1765 had clearly anticipated the,Paragraph
"axial and focal structure of Haussmann’s Paris, there is, as",Paragraph
"Choay points out, a discernible shift in the actual location of",Paragraph
"the axes, from a city organized around traditional quartiers,",Paragraph

the ‘fever of capitalism’.,Paragraph

"the Ecole Polytechnique, influenced Napoleon Ill’s views as",Paragraph
to the economic means and the systematic ends to be,Paragraph
"adopted in the rebuilding of Paris, emphasizing the",Paragraph
importance of rapid and efficient systems of,Paragraph
communication. Haussmann converted Paris into a regional,Paragraph
"metropolis, cutting through its existing fabric with streets",Paragraph
whose purpose was to link opposing cardinal points and,Paragraph
"districts, across the traditional barrier of the Seine. He gave",Paragraph
top priority to the creation of more substantial north-south,Paragraph
"and east-west axes, to the building of the Boulevard de",Paragraph
Sébastopol and the easterly extension of the Rue de Rivoli.,Paragraph
"This basic cross, which served the main railway termini to",Paragraph
"the north and south, was encircled by a ‘ring’ boulevard",Paragraph
which in turn was tied into Haussmann’s major traffic,Paragraph
"distributor, his Etoile complex built around Chalgrin’s Arc de",Paragraph
Triomphe.,Paragraph
During Haussmann’s tenure the city of Paris built some,Paragraph
"137 kilometres (85 miles) of new boulevards, which were",Paragraph
"considerably wider, more thickly lined with trees and better",Paragraph
lit than the 536 kilometres (333 miles) of old thoroughfare,Paragraph
they replaced. With all this came standard residential plan,Paragraph
"types and regularized facades, and equally standard",Paragraph
"systems of street furniture - the pisso/rs, benches, shelters,",Paragraph
"kiosks, clocks, lamp-posts, signs, etc., designed by",Caption
Haussmann’s engineers Eugéne Belgrand and Alphand. This,Paragraph
entire system was ‘ventilated’ whenever possible by large,Paragraph
"areas of public open space, such as the Bois de Boulogne",Paragraph
"and the Bois de Vincennes. In addition, new cemeteries and",Paragraph
"many small parks, such as the Parc des Buttes Chaumont",Paragraph
"and the Parc Monceau, were either created or upgraded",Paragraph
"within the extended boundaries of the city. Above all, there",Paragraph
was an adequate sewer system and fresh water piped into,Paragraph
the city from the Dhuis valley. In achieving such a,Paragraph
"comprehensive plan, Haussmann, the apolitical",Caption
"administrator par excellence, refused to accept the political",Paragraph
logic of the régime he served. He was finally broken by an,Paragraph
"ambivalent bourgeoisie, who throughout his tenure",Paragraph
supported his ‘profitable improvements’ while at the same,Paragraph
time defending their proprietorial rights against his,Paragraph
intervention.,Paragraph

filled out this American-scale grid plan by the end of the,Paragraph

Theory of Urbanization’) of 1867 Cerda gave priority to a,Paragraph
"system of circulation and, in particular, to steam traction.",Paragraph
"For him transit was, in more ways than one, the point of",Paragraph
departure for all scientifically based urban structures. Léon,Paragraph

By 1891 intensive exploitation of the city centre was,Paragraph

"With the introduction of the underground railway (1863), the",Paragraph

With the entry into Chicago in 1882 of the steam-,Paragraph

"suburban transit greatly extended its range, speed and",Paragraph

Between 1893 and 1897 an extensive elevated railway was,Paragraph

these forms of transit were essential to Chicago’s growth.,Paragraph
Most important of all for the city’s prosperity was the,Paragraph

was the railway that redistributed this abundance from the,Paragraph
"1880s on, in Gustavus Swift’s refrigerated packing cars, and",Paragraph
the corresponding growth in trade greatly augmented the,Paragraph

"changes which, in conjunction with the grid plan, were soon",Paragraph
to transform the traditional city into an ever-expanding,Paragraph

Apart from being an antithesis to the radially planned,Paragraph

triangulated network of pre-existing routes connecting a set,Paragraph
of traditional regional centres. While the diagrammatic,Paragraph
projection of Howard’s city as a satellite town in open,Paragraph

less dynamic. On the model of Ruskin’s ill-fated St George’s,Paragraph
"Guild of 1871, Howard conceived of his city as an",Paragraph

producing little beyond its own needs. The difference,Paragraph
between these city models lay finally in the fundamentally,Paragraph

Howard's Rurisville was intended to eliminate the journey to,Paragraph

Over the next thirty years Telford went on to prove his,Paragraph

section iron beams. In each instance the beams carried,Paragraph
"shallow brick vaults, the whole assembly being stiffened by",Paragraph
an outer shell and by wrought-iron tie rods restraining the,Paragraph
structure in a lateral direction. This use of vaulting seems to,Paragraph
have derived directly from the 18th-century development of,Paragraph

adopted there as a means of achieving a fireproof structure,Paragraph

Around this time the technique of iron suspension,Paragraph

beginning with the American James Finley’s invention of the,Paragraph

informed Telford’s design for his 177-metre (580-foot) span,Paragraph
"Menai Straits bridge, which after eight years of arduous",Paragraph
work was finally opened in 1825. British wrought-iron,Paragraph
suspension construction culminated in Isambard Kingdom,Paragraph
"Brunel’s 214-metre (702-foot) span Clifton Bridge, Bristol,",Caption
"designed in 1829 but not completed until 1864, five years",Paragraph
after Brunel’s death. Since the manufacture of wrought-iron,Paragraph
links capable of withstanding tension was always an,Paragraph
"expensive and hazardous affair, the idea of using cables of",Paragraph
drawn wire instead of chains seems to have suggested,Paragraph
"itself, first in 1816 to White and Hazard, in their footbridge",Paragraph
"over the Schuylkill Falls in Pennsylvania, and then to the",Paragraph
"Séguin brothers, who constructed a wire bridge over the",Paragraph
Rhéne at Tain-Tournon in 1825. The Séguins’ work formed,Paragraph
the subject for an exhaustive analytical study carried out for,Paragraph
"the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées by Louis-Joseph Vicat, and",Paragraph
the publication of this work in 1831 inaugurated the golden,Paragraph

hundred such structures were built in the next decade. Vicat,Paragraph
recommended that all future suspension members should,Paragraph

A similar device was eventually used by the American,Paragraph

12 feet) across their respective axes. These chords,Paragraph
interacted with underslung iron chain catenaries to carry,Paragraph

"gradually adopted for the permanent way, but did not come",Paragraph
"into general structural use until after 1854, when heavier",Paragraph
versions with greater spanning capacity were successfully,Paragraph
"rolled. Meanwhile, engineers tried various ways to increase",Paragraph
the spanning capacity of the material by building up deep,Paragraph
members from the standard wrought-iron angles and plates,Paragraph
that were then being used in ship building. Fairbairn,Paragraph
reputedly made and tested such composite I-beams as early,Paragraph
as 1839.,Paragraph
These ingenious attempts to produce wide-span,Paragraph
elements through reinforcing or assembling iron,Title
components were more or less eclipsed at mid-century by,Paragraph
the successful rolling of a wrought-iron beam 17.8,Paragraph
centimetres (7 inches) deep. Fairbairn’s book On the,Caption
Application of Cast and Wrought Iron to Building Purposes,Title
"(1854) presented an improved system of mill construction,",Paragraph
consisting of rolled iron beams 40.6 centimetres (16 inches),Paragraph
"deep that supported shallow vaults made of sheet iron, the",Paragraph
whole topped out with concrete. Since the wrought-iron tie,Paragraph
"rods, still used to stabilize the structure, were cast into the",Paragraph
"concrete floor, this proposal brought Fairbairn fortuitously",Paragraph
close to the principles of reinforced concrete.,Paragraph
"In a similar vein, a remarkable four-storey cast- and",Paragraph
wrought-iron framed building was erected in the Naval,Paragraph
"Dockyard at Sheerness. This boat store, clad in corrugated",Paragraph
"iron, was designed by Colonel Greene and erected in 1860,",Paragraph
"some twelve years before the pioneering all-iron, skeleton-",Paragraph
framed Menier chocolate factory was built by Jules Saulnier,Caption
at Noisiel-sur-Marne. In its systematic use of iron I-sections,Paragraph
throughout (cast in the case of the columns and wrought in,Paragraph
the case of the beams) the Sheerness boat store anticipated,Paragraph
both the standard section and the assembly method of,Paragraph
modern steel-frame construction.,Paragraph
"By mid-century, cast-iron columns and wrought-iron rails,",Paragraph
"used in conjunction with modular glazing, had become the",Paragraph
standard technique for the rapid prefabrication and erection,Paragraph
"of urban distribution centres - market halls, exchanges and",Paragraph
arcades. This last type was developed in Paris. Fontaine’s,Paragraph
"Galerie d'Orléans, built in the Palais-Royal in 1829, was the",Paragraph
earliest arcade to have a glass barrel vault. The,Caption
prefabricated nature of these cast-iron systems guaranteed,Paragraph
not only a certain speed of assembly but also the possibility,Paragraph
of transporting building ‘kits’ over large distances: from mid-,Paragraph
century onwards the industrialized countries began to,Paragraph
export prefabricated cast-iron structures all over the world.,Paragraph
The sudden expansion in urban growth and trade on the,Paragraph
eastern American seaboard in the 1840s encouraged men,Paragraph
such as James Bogardus and Daniel Badger to open casting,Paragraph
shops in New York for the manufacture of multistorey,Paragraph
"architectural fronts in iron. Up to the late 1850s, however,",Paragraph
their ‘packaged’ structures relied on the use of large timber,Paragraph
"beams to span the internal space, iron being reserved for",Paragraph
the internal columns and the facades. One of the finest,Paragraph
works of Badger’s extensive career is his Haughwout,Paragraph
"Building, New York, of 1859, built to the designs of the",Caption
architect John P. Gaynor. This was the first building to be,Paragraph
"served by a passenger elevator, just five years after Elisha",Paragraph
Graves Otis had made his historic demonstration of the,Paragraph
device in 1854.,Paragraph
"The fully glazed structure, whose environmental",Paragraph
attributes were exhaustively discussed by J.C. Loudon in his,Paragraph
"Remarks on Hot Houses (1817), had little chance of having a",Paragraph
"more general application, at least in England, until the",Paragraph
repeal of the excise duty on glass in 1845. Richard Turner,Caption
"and Decimus Burton’s Palm House at Kew Gardens, built in",Caption
"1845-48, was one of the first structures to take advantage",Paragraph
of the sudden availability of sheet glass. The first large,Paragraph
permanent enclosures to be significantly glazed thereafter,Paragraph
were the railway termini that were built during the second,Paragraph
"half of the 19th century, a development that began with",Paragraph
"Turner and Joseph Locke’s Lime Street Station, Liverpool, of",Caption
1849-50.,Caption
The railway terminus presented a peculiar challenge to,Paragraph
"the received canons of architecture, since there was no type",Paragraph
available to express and articulate adequately the junction,Paragraph
"between the head building and the train shed. This problem,",Paragraph
which saw its earliest architectural resolution in,Paragraph
"Duquesney’s Gare de |’Est, Paris, of 1852, was of some",Paragraph
concern since these termini were effectively the new,Paragraph
gateways into the capital city. The engineer Léonce,Caption
"Reynaud, designer of the first Gare du Nord in Paris (1847),",Paragraph
was aware of this issue of ‘representation’ when he wrote in,Paragraph
his Traité d’architecture (1850):,Paragraph
Art does not have the rapid progress and sudden,Paragraph
"developments of industry, with the result that the majority",Paragraph
of buildings today for the service of railroads leave more or,Paragraph
"less to be desired, be it in relation to form or arrangement.",Paragraph
Some stations appear to be appropriately arranged but,Paragraph
having the character of industrial or temporary construction,Paragraph
rather than that of a building for public use.?,Paragraph
Nothing could be more exemplary of this predicament than,Paragraph
"St Pancras Station in London, where the vast shed, 74",Caption
"metres (243 feet) in span, built in 1863-65 to the designs of",Paragraph
"William Henry Barlow and Rowland Mason Ordish, was",Paragraph
totally divorced from the Gothic Revival hotel-cum-head,Paragraph
building completed in 1874 to the designs of George Gilbert,Caption
Scott. And what was true for St Pancras also applied to,Paragraph
"Brunel's designs for Paddington in London (1852), where",Paragraph
"once again, despite the conscientious efforts of the architect",Paragraph
"Matthew Digby Wyatt, the rather rudimentary station",Caption
building was left inadequately related to the vaulted profiles,Paragraph
of the shed.,Paragraph
The free-standing exhibition structure presented none of,Paragraph
"the problems of the terminus, for where the issues of",Paragraph
cultural context could scarcely arise the engineer reigned,Paragraph
supreme. This was never more so than in the case of the,Paragraph
"Crystal Palace in London, built for the Great Exhibition of",Caption
"1851, where the gardener Joseph Paxton was given a free",Paragraph
hand to design in accordance with a method for the,Paragraph
fabrication of glasshouses that he had developed through a,Paragraph
rigorous application of Loudon’s hothouse principles. Paxton,Paragraph
had developed his method in a series of glasshouses built,Paragraph
for the Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth. When,Paragraph
commissioned at the eleventh hour to design the Crystal,Paragraph
"Palace, Paxton was able to produce, in just eight days, an",Paragraph
"enormous orthogonal three-tiered glasshouse, whose",Paragraph
components were virtually identical to those of the giant lily,Paragraph
house that he had built at Chatsworth in the previous year.,Paragraph
"Except for three entrance porches, symmetrically disposed,",Paragraph
its glazed perimeter was uninterrupted. During its,Paragraph
"development, however, a revised scheme had to be",Paragraph
prepared in order to retain a group of mature trees. Since,Paragraph
the remaining public opposition to the Great Exhibition of,Paragraph
"1851 turned on this question of tree preservation, Paxton",Paragraph
was quick to realize that these troublesome items could,Paragraph
easily be accommodated by a central transept with a high,Paragraph
"curved roof, and thus the double symmetry of the final form",Paragraph
emerged.,Paragraph
The Crystal Palace was not so much a particular form as,Paragraph
"it was a building process made manifest as a total system,",Paragraph
"from its initial conception, fabrication and trans-shipment, to",Paragraph
"its final erection and dismantling. Like the railway buildings,",Paragraph
"to which it was related, it was a highly flexible kit of parts",Paragraph
[17]. Its overall form was structured around a basic 2.44-,Paragraph
"metre (8-foot) cladding module, assembled into a hierarchy",Paragraph
of structural spans varying from 7.31 to 21.95 metres (24 to,Paragraph
"72 feet). Its realization, which took barely four months, was",Paragraph
a simple matter of mass production and systematic,Title
assembly. As Konrad Wachsmann has remarked in his book,Paragraph
Wendepunkt im Bauen (The Turning Point of Building) of,Paragraph
"1961, ‘Its production requirements included studies which",Paragraph
indicated that for easy handling no part should weigh more,Paragraph
than one ton and that the greatest economies could be,Paragraph
obtained by using glass panels of the largest possible size.’,Paragraph
"17 Paxton, Crystal Palace, London, 1851. Component parts.",Caption
While the Crystal Palace engendered through its open,Paragraph
lattice work spectacular parallel and oblique perspectives,Title
"whose lines diminished into a diaphanous haze of light, its",Paragraph
"total envelope, comprising nearly 93,000 square metres (a",Paragraph
"million square feet) of glass, presented a climatic problem of",Paragraph
unprecedented scale. The desirable environmental,Paragraph
"conditions, however, remained the same as they had been",Paragraph
in Loudon’s curvilinear hothouses - to maintain comfortable,Paragraph
air movement and to moderate the heat of the sun. While,Paragraph
the elevation of the building off the ground and the,Paragraph
"provision of a slatted floor, together with adjustable louvres",Caption
"in the walls, provided satisfactory ventilation, the",Paragraph
accumulation of solar heat constituted a problem to which,Paragraph
"the railway engineer Charles Fox, who was responsible for",Paragraph
"the detailing of the structure, could find no adequate",Paragraph
solution. The eventual ad hoc use of canvas awnings to,Paragraph
shade the roof could hardly be regarded as an integral part,Paragraph
"of the system, and many of the international exhibitors",Paragraph
chose to shield themselves from the ‘greenhouse’ effect by,Paragraph
"canopies of festooned draperies, which were no doubt hung",Paragraph
as much against the unacceptable ‘objectivity’ of the,Paragraph
structure as they were against the sun.,Paragraph
The British abandonment of the international exhibition,Title
"field, after the triumph of 1851 and a further exhibition in",Paragraph
"1862, was at once exploited by the French, who mounted",Paragraph
five major international exhibitions between 1855 and 1900.,Paragraph
The degree to which these displays were regarded as,Paragraph
national platforms from which to challenge the British,Title
command over industrial production and trade may be,Paragraph
judged from the emphasis placed each time on the structure,Paragraph
and content of the ‘Galerie des Machines’. The young,Paragraph
Gustave Eiffel worked with the engineer Jean-Baptiste,Paragraph
Krantz on the most significant exhibition building to be,Paragraph
"erected after 1851, that for the Paris World Exhibition of",Paragraph
1867. This collaboration revealed not only Eiffel’s expressive,Paragraph
"sensibility but also his capacity as an engineer, since in",Paragraph
"detailing the Galerie des Machines, with its 35-metre (114-",Paragraph
"foot) span, he was able to verify the validity of Thomas",Paragraph
"Young’s modulus of elasticity of 1807, a hitherto solely",Paragraph
theoretical formula for determining the elastic behaviour of,Paragraph
"material under stress. The whole oval complex, of which the",Paragraph
"Galerie des Machines was merely the outer ring, was itself a",Paragraph
testament to the conceptual genius of Pierre Guillaume,Title
"Frédéric Le Play, who had suggested that the building be",Paragraph
"arranged as concentric galleries exhibiting machinery,",Paragraph
"clothing, furniture, liberal arts, fine arts and the history of",Title
labour.,Paragraph
After 1867 the sheer size and diversity of the objects,Paragraph
"produced, and the independence demanded by international",Paragraph
"competition, seem to have demanded multiple exhibition",Paragraph
structures. By the time of the International Exhibition of,Paragraph
1889 no pretence was made of housing the exhibits in one,Paragraph
self-contained building. This penultimate exhibition of the,Paragraph
century was dominated by two of the most remarkable,Paragraph
structures that French engineering was ever to achieve -,Paragraph
"Victor Contamin’s vast Galerie des Machines [18], 107",Caption
"metres (350 feet) in span, designed with the architect",Caption
"Charles Louis Ferdinand Dutert, and Eiffel’s tower, 300",Caption
"metres (984 feet) high, designed in collaboration with the",Paragraph
engineers Nouguier and Koechlin and the architect Stephen,Title
"Sauvestre. Contamin’s structure, based on statical methods",Paragraph
"perfected by Eiffel in his hinged viaducts of the 1880s, was",Paragraph
one of the first to use the three-hinged arch form in the,Paragraph
achievement of a large span. Contamin’s shed not only,Paragraph
"exhibited machines: it was itself an ‘exhibiting machine’, in",Paragraph
"which mobile viewing platforms, running on elevated tracks,",Paragraph
passed over the exhibition space on either side of the,Paragraph
"central axis, affording the visitor a fast and comprehensive",Paragraph
view of the entire show.,Paragraph
"at tM Fg ip i, en) yi",Paragraph
"18 Dutert and Contamin, Galerie des Machines at the Paris Exhibition, 1889,",Caption
showing the mobile viewing platform.,Paragraph
In the last half of the 19th century the Massif Central had,Paragraph
been found to be sufficiently rich in minerals to justify the,Paragraph
considerable expense of equipping it with a railway network.,Paragraph
The railway viaducts that Eiffel designed there between,Paragraph
1869 and 1884 exemplify a method and an aesthetic that,Paragraph
found their ultimate celebration in the design of the Eiffel,Paragraph
Tower. The boat-shaped base and the parabolic vertical,Paragraph
section of the tubular iron pylon that Eiffel evolved for these,Paragraph
viaducts is formally indicative of his constant attempt to,Paragraph
resolve the dynamic interaction of water and wind.,Paragraph
The need to make wider river crossings led Eiffel and his,Paragraph
associates to devise an ingenious system of viaduct,Paragraph
"support. The spur to such a solution came in 1875, with the",Paragraph
commission to construct a railway viaduct over the river,Caption
Douro in Portugal. The availability of cheap steel after 1870,Paragraph
afforded a material in which a wide-span solution might be,Paragraph
readily achieved. A decision was therefore made to cross,Paragraph
"the ravine in five spans, two short spans supported on",Paragraph
pylons on either side and a central longer span of 160,Caption
metres (524 feet) carried on a two-pinned arch. The,Paragraph
"procedure of erection, to be repeated a few years later at",Paragraph
"Garabit, was to construct the flanking spans with their",Paragraph
supporting pylons and then to erect the central section from,Paragraph
these continuous structures on either side. Truss extensions,Paragraph
"were cantilevered out at track level, and the hinged arch",Paragraph
"was simultaneously constructed, in two halves, from the",Paragraph
water below. The initial hinged sections were floated and,Paragraph
jacked into position and then maintained at a correct incline,Paragraph
during their final assembly by cables suspended from the,Paragraph
caps of the adjacent pylons. The outstanding success of the,Paragraph
"Douro Viaduct, completed in 1878, immediately brought",Paragraph
Eiffel a commission to build the Garabit Viaduct over the,Paragraph
River Truyére in the Massif Central.,Paragraph
Just as the Douro Viaduct provided the necessary,Paragraph
"experience to build Garabit, so the achievement of Garabit",Paragraph
was essential to the design and conception of the Eiffel,Paragraph
"Tower. Like the Crystal Palace, the tower was designed and",Paragraph
"erected under considerable pressure, but at a slower rate.",Paragraph
"First exhibited as a design in the spring of 1885, it was in",Paragraph
the ground by the summer of 1887 and well over 200,Paragraph
metres (654 feet) high by the winter of 1888. As in,Paragraph
"Contamin’s Galerie des Machines, the structure had to be",Paragraph
provided with an access system for the rapid movement of,Paragraph
"visitors. Speed was essential, since there was no way of",Paragraph
gaining access to the tower except via lifts that ran on,Paragraph
inclined tracks within its hyperbolic legs and rose vertically,Paragraph
from first platform to pinnacle. The guide rails for these lifts,Caption
"were exploited during erection as tracks for climbing cranes,",Paragraph
an economy in working method reminiscent of the mounting,Paragraph
technique used in the case of the hinged viaducts. As much,Paragraph
"a by-product of the railway as the Crystal Palace, the tower",Paragraph
"was, in effect, a 300-metre (974-foot) high viaduct pylon,",Paragraph
whose type-form had originally been evolved out of the,Paragraph
"interaction of wind, gravity, water and material resistance. It",Paragraph
was a hitherto unimaginable structure that could not be,Paragraph
experienced except by traversing the aerial matrix of the,Paragraph
space itself. Given the futuristic affinity of the tower to,Paragraph
"aviation - celebrated by the aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont,",Paragraph
when he circled the structure with his dirigible in 1901 - it is,Paragraph
hardly surprising that thirty years after its erection it should,Paragraph
have been appropriated and reinterpreted as the prime,Paragraph
"symbol of a new social and technical order, in Vladimir",Paragraph
"Tatlin’s monument to the Third International, projected in",Caption
1919-20.,Caption
As iron technology developed through the exploitation of the,Paragraph
"earth’s mineral wealth, so concrete technology, or at least",Paragraph
"the development of hydraulic cement, seems to have arisen",Paragraph
"out of traffic on sea. In 1774, John Smeaton established the",Paragraph
base of his Eddystone Lighthouse using a ‘concrete’,Caption
"compound of quicklime, clay, sand and crushed iron slag,",Paragraph
"and similar concrete mixes were used in England in bridge,",Paragraph
canal and harbour works throughout the last quarter of the,Paragraph
18th century. Despite Joseph Aspdin’s pioneering,Paragraph
development of Portland cement for use as imitation stone,Paragraph
"in 1824, and various other English proposals for metal-",Paragraph
"reinforced concrete construction, such as that made by the",Paragraph
"ever-inventive Loudon in 1792, the initial English lead in the",Paragraph
pioneering of concrete gradually passed to France.,Paragraph
In France the economic restrictions that followed the,Paragraph
"Revolution of 1789, the synthesis of hydraulic cement by",Paragraph
Vicat around 1800 and the tradition of building in pisé,Paragraph
(rammed earth) combined to create the optimum,Paragraph
circumstances for the invention of reinforced concrete. The,Paragraph
first consequential use of the new material was made by,Paragraph
"Francois Coignet, who was already familiar with the pisé",Paragraph
building method of the Lyons district. In 1861 he developed,Paragraph
"a technique for strengthening concrete with metal mesh,",Paragraph
and on the basis of this established the first limited,Paragraph
company to specialize in ferroconcrete construction. Coignet,Paragraph
"worked in Paris under Haussmann’s direction, building",Paragraph
sewers and other public structures in ferroconcrete -,Paragraph
"including, in 1867, a remarkable series of six-storey",Paragraph
"apartment blocks. Despite these commissions, Coignet",Paragraph
failed to uphold his patent and by the end of the Second,Paragraph
Empire his company was dissolved.,Paragraph
Another French pioneer of concrete was the gardener,Paragraph
"Joseph Monier, who, following his successful production of",Paragraph
"concrete flower pots in 1850, took out, after 1867, a series",Paragraph
"of patents for metal-reinforced applications, the partial",Paragraph
rights of which he ill-advisedly sold in 1880 to the engineers,Paragraph
Schuster and Wayss. Further rights were obtained from,Paragraph
"Monier in 1884 by the firm of Freytag, and soon afterwards",Paragraph
the large German civil engineering concern of Wayss and,Paragraph
Freytag came into being. Their monopoly over the Monier,Paragraph
system was consolidated by Gustav Adolf Wayss’s standard,Paragraph
"work on the Monier method (Monierbau), published in 1887.",Paragraph
The publication of important theoretical studies on,Paragraph
differential stress in reinforced concrete by the German,Paragraph
theorists Neumann and Koenen served to consolidate the,Paragraph
German lead in this type of construction.,Paragraph
The period of most intense development in reinforced,Paragraph
"concrete occurred between 1870 and 1900, with pioneering",Paragraph
"work being carried on simultaneously in Germany, America,",Paragraph
England and France. In building his reinforced-concrete,Paragraph
"Hudson River home in 1873, the American William E. Ward",Paragraph
became the first constructor to take full advantage of the,Paragraph
tensile strength of steel by situating bars below the neutral,Paragraph
axis of the beam. The inherent structural advantage of this,Paragraph
was almost immediately confirmed by the concrete beam,Paragraph
experiments conducted in England by Thaddeus Hyatt and,Paragraph
"Thomas Rickets, whose joint results were published in 1877.",Paragraph
"Despite these international developments, the",Paragraph
systematic exploitation of modern reinforced-concrete,Title
technique was to wait upon the inventive genius of Francois,Paragraph
"Hennebique. Hennebique, a self-educated French builder,",Paragraph
first used concrete in 1879. He then conducted an extensive,Paragraph
programme of private research before patenting his own,Paragraph
uniquely comprehensive system in 1892. Before,Paragraph
Hennebique the great problem in ferroconcrete had been,Paragraph
the provision of a monolithic joint. The compound concrete,Paragraph
and steel systems that had been patented by Fairbairn in,Paragraph
"1845 were far from being monolithic, and the same",Paragraph
restrictions applied to the work of Hyatt and Rickets.,Paragraph
Hennebique overcame this difficulty through the use of bars,Paragraph
of cylindrical section which could be bent round and hooked,Paragraph
together. Integral to his system alone was the cranking up,Paragraph
of reinforcement bars and the binding of joints with stirrup,Title
hoops in order to resist local stress. With the perfection of,Paragraph
"the monolithic joint [19], the monolithic frame could be",Paragraph
"realized, leading promptly to the first large-scale application",Paragraph
of such a system to three spinning mills that Hennebique,Paragraph
built in the region of Tourcoing and Lille in 1896. The results,Paragraph
"were at once acclaimed as a success, and Hennebique’s",Paragraph
"firm immediately prospered. His partner, Louis Gustave",Paragraph
"Mouchel, took the system to England in 1897, building the",Paragraph
first concrete road bridge there in 1901 and exhibiting a,Paragraph
"spectacular free-standing, helical, reinforced-concrete stair",Caption
at the Franco-British exhibition of 1908.,Paragraph
"19 Hennebique, monolithic reinforced-concrete joint, patented in 1892.",Caption
The wide success of the Hennebique firm dates from,Paragraph
"around 1898, with the regular publication of its house",Paragraph
magazine Le Béton armé (‘Reinforced Concrete’) and the,Paragraph
extensive use of its system in the eclectic structures of the,Paragraph
Paris Exhibition of 1900. Despite the false facades of the,Paragraph
"Chateau d’Eau, constructed out of ferroconcrete by Francois",Caption
"Coignet’s son, the Paris Exhibition of 1900 gave an",Paragraph
"enormous boost to concrete construction, and by 1902, a",Paragraph
"decade after its foundation, the Hennebique firm had grown",Paragraph
into a large international concern. By then innumerable,Paragraph
works were being constructed in concrete throughout,Paragraph
"Europe, with Hennebique acting as the main contractor. In",Paragraph
1904 he built his own reinforced-concrete villa at Bourg-la-,Paragraph
"Reine, complete with roof garden and minaret. Its solid walls",Paragraph
were formed out of ferroconcrete poured in place between,Paragraph
"permanent pre-cast concrete shuttering, and its almost",Paragraph
totally glazed facade was dramatically cantilevered out from,Paragraph
"the main plane of the building. By the turn of the century,",Paragraph
"Hennebique’s monopoly over his system began to wane,",Paragraph
although his patents still had a number of years to run. In,Paragraph
"1902 his chief assistant, Paul Christophe, popularized the",Paragraph
system by publishing Le Béton armé et ses applications.,Paragraph
"Four years later Armand-Gabriel Considéré, who had already",Paragraph
carried out concrete research for the department of Ponts et,Paragraph
"Chaussées, headed the national committee that established",Paragraph
the French code for reinforced-concrete practice.,Paragraph
In 1890 the engineer Paul Cottancin patented his own,Paragraph
"system of ciment armé, which depended on the combined",Paragraph
"reinforcement of concrete and brick, the bricks being",Paragraph
bonded into the concrete with wire reinforcement. In this,Paragraph
hybrid system the main function of the ferroconcrete,Paragraph
element was to maintain structural continuity in areas of,Paragraph
high tension. In areas of compression brick naturally,Paragraph
predominated. The system had a strong appeal for the,Paragraph
"rationalist architect Anatole de Baudot who, as a pupil of the",Paragraph
"great French ‘structural’ theorist Eugéne Viollet-le-Duc, was",Paragraph
preoccupied with revealed structure as the only valid basis,Paragraph
"for expression in architecture. On these grounds, de Baudot",Paragraph
"consigned monolithic béton armé to the field of engineering,",Paragraph
while reserving for the architect the statically more explicit,Paragraph
"and articulate technique of ciment armé, a technology",Paragraph
whose expressive qualities were most fully demonstrated in,Paragraph
his church of St-Jean-de-Montmartre in Paris (begun in,Paragraph
1894).,Paragraph
The intricate vaulting there was closely related to a,Paragraph
whole sequence of grande salle projects which de Baudot,Paragraph
"designed between 1910 and 1914. After Viollet-le-Duc, he",Paragraph
was concerned with the problem of the great space as the,Paragraph
necessary proving ground for any architectural culture. In,Paragraph
"this context his grande salle series, which commenced with",Paragraph
"a vast project for the 1900 Exhibition, may be seen as",Paragraph
anticipating the reticulated flat slabs and prefabricated,Paragraph
folded shells that were to be achieved half a century later,Paragraph
"by the Italian engineer Pier Luigi Nervi, most typically in the",Paragraph
"Turin Exhibition Hall of 1948 and the Gatti Wool Factory,",Paragraph
built outside Rome in 1953.,Paragraph
"In opposition to de Baudot’s principle of reticulated form,",Paragraph
the challenge of the great space was answered by Max Berg,Paragraph
through the use of reinforced-concrete elements of,Paragraph
"enormous size, in his Jahrhunderthalle [20] built by",Paragraph
Konwiarz and Trauer for the Breslau Exhibition of 1913.,Caption
"Inside this vast, centralized hall, 65 metres (213 feet) in",Paragraph
"diameter, the concrete ribs of the cupola sprang from a",Paragraph
perimeter ring beam which was in its turn supported by,Paragraph
massive pendentive arches. This awkward Herculean,Paragraph
structure was concealed on the outside by concentric tiers,Paragraph
"of glazing, the organic plan and dynamic structure being",Paragraph
suppressed by the superimposition of Neo-Classical,Paragraph
elements.,Paragraph
"20 Berg, Jahrhunderthalle, Breslau (Wroctaw), 1913.",Caption
"Up to 1895, ferroconcrete work in North America was",Paragraph
inhibited by its dependence on the importation of cement,Paragraph
"from Europe. Soon after, however, the epoch of the grain",Paragraph
"silo and the flatted factory commenced, first in Canada, with",Paragraph
"the reinforced-concrete silo structures of Max Toltz, and",Paragraph
"then, from 1900 onwards, in the United States, in the work",Paragraph
"of Ernest L. Ransome, who was the inventor of twisted",Paragraph
reinforcement. With the building in 1902 of his 91-metre,Paragraph
"(300-foot) machine shop at Greensburg, Pennsylvania,",Caption
Ransome became the pioneer of the monolithic concrete,Paragraph
frame in the United States. Here he applied for the first time,Paragraph
the principle of spiral column reinforcement in accordance,Paragraph
with the theories of Considéré. It says something for the,Paragraph
technical precociousness of Frank Lloyd Wright that he,Paragraph
began to design reinforced-concrete structures at around,Paragraph
"the same time: his unrealized Village Bank project of 1901,",Paragraph
"and the E-Z Polish factory and Unity Temple, completed in",Paragraph
Chicago in 1905 and 1906 respectively.,Paragraph
"Meanwhile, in Paris, Perret Freres had begun to design",Paragraph
"and build their first all-concrete structures, beginning with",Paragraph
Auguste Perret’s seminal Rue Franklin apartment block of,Paragraph
1903 and his Théatre des Champs-Elysées of 1913. At about,Paragraph
"the same time, Henri Sauvage explored the expressive",Paragraph
‘plastic’ potential of this new monolithic material in his set-,Paragraph
"back apartments in the Rue Vavin, completed in 1912. By",Caption
this date the reinforced-concrete frame had become a,Paragraph
"normative technique, and from now on most of the",Paragraph
development was to lie in the scale of its application and in,Paragraph
its assimilation as an expressive element. While its first use,Paragraph
on a megastructural scale was in Matté Trucco’s 40-hectare,Paragraph
"(100-acre) Fiat Works, begun in Turin in 1915 [21], its",Paragraph
appropriation as the primary expressive element of an,Paragraph
architectural language came with Le Corbusier’s ‘Maison,Paragraph
Dom-Lno’ proposal of around the same date. Where the one,Paragraph
clearly demonstrated that flat concrete roofs could sustain,Paragraph
the vibration of dynamic moving loads - the Fiat factory has,Paragraph
a test track on its roof - the other postulated the,Paragraph
"Hennebique system as a ‘patent’ primal structure to which,",Paragraph
"after the manner of Laugier’s primitive hut, the",Paragraph
development of the new architecture would have to refer.,Paragraph
"21 Trucco, Fiat Works, Turin, 1915-21.",Caption
"From an engineering standpoint, this period was to reach",Paragraph
its most sublime expression in the early work of the,Paragraph
engineers Robert Maillart and Eugéne Freyssinet. By 1905 in,Paragraph
"his Rhine Bridge at Tavanasa, the great Swiss engineer",Paragraph
Maillart had already arrived at his characteristic bridge form,Paragraph
"- a three-hinged arch of hollow box section, with triangular",Caption
openings cut into its sides to reduce unnecessary weight,Paragraph
and to impart a light and expressive character to the overall,Paragraph
"form. By 1912, Maillart had achieved the first beamless floor",Paragraph
"slab in Europe, in a five-storey warehouse that he built in",Paragraph
Altdorf. His beamless system seems to have been an,Paragraph
advance over the mushroom slab construction developed,Title
slightly earlier by the American engineer Claude Allen Porter,Caption
"Turner. In Turner’s ‘four-way’ reinforcement, as opposed to",Paragraph
"Maillart’s ‘two-way’ system, the bars were required to pass",Paragraph
"over all column heads, with the consequence that the steel",Paragraph
could not be accommodated within an economic depth if the,Paragraph
tendency of the column to punch through the slab was to be,Paragraph
"resisted. The floor structure in the Turner system was, in",Paragraph
"effect, a network of heavily reinforced flat beams with large",Paragraph
column heads to resist the resulting shear. The beamless,Paragraph
‘two-way’ Maillart system was lighter and generated far less,Paragraph
"shear, with a corresponding reduction in the dimensions of",Paragraph
both the slab and the column heads.,Paragraph
In his Aare Bridge at Aarburg (1911) Maillart succeeded,Paragraph

formed at the instigation of the brothers Dante Gabriel and,Paragraph

Millais in 1848.,Paragraph
In 1851 Ruskin became spiritually affiliated to this,Paragraph
"movement, which had as its aim the foundation of a school",Paragraph
of painting which would be expressive of profound ideas and,Paragraph
emotions. The ideal was to create an art form derived,Paragraph
directly from nature and not from artistic conventions of,Paragraph
"Renaissance origin. This eminently anti-Classical, Romantic",Paragraph
attitude was propagated in 1850 in the Pre-Raphaelite,Paragraph
"magazine, The Germ. Yet the brotherhood lacked the",Paragraph
monastic strictness and conviction of the Nazarenes. Both it,Paragraph
"and its magazine were too individualistic to last for long,",Paragraph
and by 1853 Pre-Raphaelitism as a collective movement was,Paragraph
defunct.,Paragraph
"The second, craft-orientated, phase of Pre-Raphaelite",Paragraph
activity turns upon the meeting of William Morris and,Paragraph
"Edward Burne-Jones when undergraduates at Oxford, in",Paragraph
1853. Oxford exposed them to the lectures of Ruskin and to,Paragraph

him in 1857 on murals for the Union Society building at,Caption

position in the Oxford office of the Gothic Revivalist,Paragraph

"career as a designer dates from his decision, late in 1856, to",Paragraph
abandon architecture for painting; but that had to wait upon,Paragraph
"the furnishing of his rooms in London, for which he designed",Paragraph
his first ‘intensely medieval furniture ... as firm and as,Paragraph
"heavy as a rock’. These unpretentious pieces, no doubt",Paragraph
"inspired by the craft ideals of Ruskin, were designed under",Paragraph
"the guidance of Philip Webb, with whom Morris had",Paragraph
previously worked in Street’s office. In 1858 Pre-Raphaelite,Paragraph
"domestic culture was crystallized, as it were, in Morris’s only",Paragraph
"known easel work, a portrait of his wife, Jane Burden, as",Paragraph
"Queen Guinevere or La Belle Iseu/t, wearing ornate clothes",Paragraph
in an ideal Pre-Raphaelite interior. Morris then gave up,Paragraph
painting entirely and addressed himself to the task of,Paragraph
"furnishing his new home, the Red House [25, 26], which",Paragraph
"Philip Webb built for him in 1859 at Bexleyheath, Kent, in a",Caption
style which except for minor details was close to the work of,Paragraph

"25, 26 Webb, Red House, Bexleyheath, Kent, 1859. View, and plans of ground",Caption

In the Red House (so called on account of its brickwork),Paragraph
Webb established the principles which were soon to inform,Paragraph
the work of his brilliant contemporaries William Eden,Paragraph
"Nesfield and Richard Norman Shaw, and for which he was to",Paragraph
be known throughout his career - his concern for structural,Paragraph
integrity and his desire to integrate buildings into their site,Paragraph
and into the local culture. These aims he achieved through,Paragraph
"practical design, sensitive site layout and the use of local",Title
"materials, coupled with a profound respect for traditional",Paragraph
"building methods. Like Morris, his first client and lifelong",Paragraph
"colleague, Webb had an almost mystical respect for the",Paragraph
sacredness of craftsmanship and for the earth in which both,Paragraph
life and architecture were ultimately founded. Even more,Paragraph
"than Morris, he was against any excessive use of ornament.",Paragraph
"According to his biographer, W.R. Lethaby, Webb once",Paragraph
complained that an overelegant grate was ‘hardly fit for the,Paragraph
holy fire’. Such a sentiment could hardly be further removed,Paragraph
from the mannered interpretation that his approach was to,Paragraph

"had its origin in the creation of the Red House. At all events,",Paragraph
this work was Catalytic in launching Morris on his destined,Paragraph
"career, and two years later he organized an association of",Paragraph
"Pre-Raphaelite artists, including Webb, Rossetti, Burne-Jones",Paragraph
"and Ford Madox Brown, into an atelier which would design",Paragraph
and execute on commission anything from murals to stained,Paragraph
"glass and furniture, from embroidery to metalwork and",Title
"carved wood. The aim, as in Pugin’s extensive furnishings",Paragraph
designed for the Houses of Parliament in the 1830s and,Paragraph
"1840s, was the creation of a total work of art. This much,",Paragraph
"with all modesty, the prospectus of the firm made clear: ‘It",Paragraph
is anticipated that by such co-operation ... the work must,Paragraph
necessarily be of a much more complete order than if any,Paragraph
single artist were incidentally employed in the usual,Paragraph
"manner.’ Apart from the precedent established by Pugin, the",Paragraph
foundation of this atelier may well have been influenced by,Paragraph
"the Art Manufactures organization, started by Henry Cole",Paragraph
under the pseudonym of Felix Summerly in 1845. In any,Paragraph
"event, the Pre-Raphaelite craft work that had hitherto",Paragraph
occurred spontaneously now took on a public character. It is,Paragraph
fitting that the first work to be sold at the London premises,Paragraph
of the firm was glass tableware designed by Webb.,Paragraph
"With the prospering of the atelier, Morris was",Paragraph
paradoxically compelled to leave the idyllic Red House in,Paragraph
1864 and to move permanently to London. A year later he,Paragraph
"gave over the management of the firm to Warrington Taylor,",Paragraph
in order to devote himself exclusively to two-dimensional,Paragraph
"design and to literature, the two activities which were to",Paragraph
consume the rest of his life. The first Morris wallpapers date,Paragraph
"from this period, as do the earliest works in stained glass by",Paragraph
himself and Burne-Jones. Morris’s models varied from,Paragraph
"Persian décor, illustrated in Owen Jones’s Grammar of",Paragraph
"Ornament of 1856, to the medieval style which he naturally",Paragraph
adopted for his stained-glass work - a product for which,Paragraph
"there was a steady, if limited, demand throughout his life.",Paragraph
"Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. achieved public recognition",Paragraph
in 1867 with the Green Dining Room or tea room that Webb,Paragraph
designed for the South Kensington (now the Victoria and,Caption
Albert) Museum in London. The room was entirely furnished,Paragraph
and decorated by Morris and the artist-craftsmen of his firm.,Paragraph
"After this date, Webb started to design and execute large",Paragraph
"domestic commissions on his own, culminating in his last",Paragraph
"great house, Standen, built near East Grinstead, Sussex",Caption
"(1891-94), with furnishings provided - as was usually the",Paragraph
case - by Morris’s firm. Morris became increasingly involved,Paragraph
"with literature, from which he attempted fanatically to",Paragraph
"expunge all words of Latin origin, producing by the mid-",Paragraph
"1870s extensive translations of Icelandic sagas, in addition",Paragraph
to numerous volumes of his own Romantic poetry. At that,Paragraph
time it would seem as if medieval Iceland was the final,Paragraph
"‘Nowhere’ that his idealistic spirit pined for, while it",Paragraph
remained sequestered within the industrial reality of the,Paragraph
19th century.,Paragraph
The year 1875 was a watershed in Morris’s life. The firm,Paragraph
was dissolved and reorganized as Morris & Co. under his,Paragraph
"sole control, and he began to increase the number of crafts",Paragraph
in which he and hence the firm could work. He taught,Paragraph
"himself dyeing and carpet weaving and, in 1877,",Paragraph
established a London showroom as a prime commercial,Paragraph
"outlet. From then on, aside from the management of the",Paragraph
firm and the design and production of a whole range of,Paragraph
"wallpapers, hangings and carpets, Morris’s concerns",Paragraph
gradually became increasingly public and less ‘poetic’ and,Paragraph
craft-orientated. He seems to have felt it his duty to take up,Paragraph
"publicly the socialist and preservationist causes of Ruskin,",Paragraph
"who was by now mentally ill. Thus, in 1877 he wrote his first",Paragraph
political pamphlet and founded the Society for the,Paragraph
"Protection of Ancient Buildings, in a successful attempt to",Paragraph
"foil Sir George Gilbert Scott’s intentions to restore, or rather",Paragraph
"partly to rebuild, Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire.",Caption
"In the decade following his reorganization of the firm,",Paragraph
"Morris divided his life equally between politics and design,",Paragraph
"producing during this period, according to his first",Paragraph
"biographer, Mackail, over 600 designs for various fabrics. In",Paragraph
"1883, however, Morris began to read the works of Karl Marx",Paragraph
"and joined the Social Democratic Federation, headed by",Paragraph
"Engels, in the company of such committed socialists as",Paragraph
Eleanor Marx and Edward Aveling. Two years later he left the,Paragraph
"Federation and founded the Socialist League, shifting",Paragraph
virtually all of his energies from design to politics. At,Paragraph
"frequent intervals, until his death in 1896, he wrote and",Paragraph
"published essays on the related themes of socialism, culture",Paragraph
"and society, beginning with his Fourierist essay of 1885",Paragraph
"entitled How We Live and How We Might Live, and",Paragraph
"culminating in his famous utopian romance, News from",Paragraph
"Nowhere, of 1891.",Paragraph
"To the coming generations, to Morris’s associate Walter",Paragraph
"Crane, to Ruskin’s protégé Mackmurdo and to the principal",Paragraph
"pupils of Shaw, namely Lethaby, E.S. Prior and Ernest",Paragraph
"Newton, even to Shaw himself, and to relative outsiders",Paragraph
"such as Ashbee and Voysey, Morris’s somewhat",Paragraph
contradictory position was patently clear. Above all there,Paragraph
"was his utopian vision of ‘Nowhere’, a land where the state",Paragraph
had withered away according to Marxist prophecy and,Paragraph
where all distinction between town and country had,Paragraph
disappeared. The city no longer existed as a dense physical,Paragraph
entity and the great engineering achievements of the 19th,Title
century had been dismantled: wind and water were once,Paragraph
"more the sole sources of power, and the waterway and the",Paragraph
road were the sole means of transport. A society without,Paragraph
"money or property, without crime or punishment, without",Paragraph
"prison or parliament, where social order depended solely",Paragraph
upon the free association of family groups within the,Paragraph
"structure of the commune. Finally, a society where work was",Paragraph
"based on the banded workshop, the guild or Werkbund, and",Paragraph
where education was free and like labour itself unforced.,Paragraph
This single-minded socialist vision stood out in strong,Paragraph
contrast to the context of Morris’s own life and to the latent,Paragraph
inconsistency of his thought. There was his prosperous firm,Paragraph
"itself, a laissez-faire phenomenon par excellence, whose",Paragraph
diverse luxury goods were consumed by the upper middle,Paragraph
"class; then there was his highly radical socialism, largely",Paragraph
unintegrated with his innate anarchic leanings - a,Paragraph
revolutionary socialism totally unacceptable to the more,Title
"liberal of his followers, such as Ashbee; and finally, for",Paragraph
"Fabian Socialists and architects alike, there was within",Paragraph
Morris’s theory and practice the ameliorative suggestion of,Paragraph
the garden city as a form of settlement to be based on the,Paragraph
"craft guild or cooperative, as a means for achieving not only",Paragraph
"work, but also evolutionary social reform and re-education,",Paragraph
"and so, by degrees, some public recognition for both. In",Paragraph
contrast to this progressive (if somewhat disturbing) breadth,Paragraph
"of concern, there was the latent phobic quality of Morris’s",Paragraph
own design and - more critical still - there was his stubborn,Paragraph
refusal to come to terms with industrial method and his,Paragraph
"ambiguous, not to say hostile, attitude to all architecture",Paragraph
after the 15th century. Not only was the Classical past,Paragraph
condemned but even sympathetic contemporary work was,Paragraph
indifferently received: Webb’s fine designs singularly failed,Paragraph
to draw from Morris any public recognition. Could it be that,Paragraph
Webb's eclecticism was finally too much for Morris; that the,Paragraph
Classical and Elizabethan elements that were incorporated,Paragraph
into his houses between 1879 and 1891 were sufficient,Paragraph
cause for disaffection?,Title
"In the event, the historicism of the period was hardly",Paragraph
capable of sustaining Morris’s anti-Classical line. By the,Paragraph
early 1870s worldly architects like Shaw were already,Paragraph
"manipulating and classicizing, in an urban context, the",Paragraph
"Queen Anne style that he, Webb and Nesfield had",Paragraph
developed out of the English and Dutch domestic traditions.,Paragraph
Before his wholesale conversion to Neo-Georgian in the,Paragraph
"early 1890s, Shaw established a respectable precedent for",Paragraph
"adopting a classic, if mannered, format in town, such as",Paragraph
"Swan House, Chelsea, of 1875-77, and a free, Picturesque,",Paragraph
"convenient one in the country, such as Pierrepoint, at",Paragraph
"Frensham in Surrey, of 1876-78.",Caption
"Despite his sophistry, Shaw was influenced by Ruskinian",Paragraph
"sociocultural concerns. In 1877 he began to design, for the",Paragraph
"artistic property speculator Jonathan T. Carr, houses for the",Caption
"first garden suburb, located on the western outskirts of",Paragraph
London. The red brick and tile-hung style of this upper-,Paragraph

Shaw took over in 1877 and a number of different architects,Paragraph
"worked there under his influence over the next decade,",Paragraph
"including at the tail end Voysey, who built a remarkable",Paragraph
house in The Parade in 1890.,Paragraph
"In 1878, Shaw published his Sketches for Cottages and",Paragraph
Other Buildings. This highly influential book illustrated,Paragraph
numerous designs for workers’ houses of various sizes. It,Paragraph
also included the essential public building typology for a,Paragraph

"village hall, an almshouse and a cottage hospital. In the",Caption
following year the first of the paternalistic garden cities,Paragraph
"appeared: Bournville, Birmingham, founded by George",Caption
Cadbury and designed by Ralph Heaton and others. It was,Paragraph
largely the Bedford Park model that W.H. Lever followed,Paragraph
"when, less than ten years later in 1888, he founded Port",Paragraph
Sunlight.,Paragraph
The evolution of the garden city movement in the last,Title
decade of the century was intimately linked to the,Paragraph
development of the Arts and Crafts movement. As,Paragraph
"presented by Ebenezer Howard in 1898, its social policy",Paragraph
combined urban dispersal with rural colonization and,Paragraph
decentralized government. As a complement to the co-,Paragraph
"operative movement, it advocated that such a city should",Paragraph
derive its revenue from a balanced combination of industry,Paragraph
and agriculture. Howard postulated trade union backing for,Paragraph
"the financing of housing, co-operative ownership of land,",Paragraph
comprehensive planning and temperance reform. He fixed,Paragraph
"the optimum size of the garden city at 32,000, to be",Paragraph
restricted from further growth by an isolating green belt.,Paragraph
Each city was to be regionally located as a satellite,Paragraph
settlement and linked to a major centre by means of a,Paragraph
railway. In this form the garden city complemented,Paragraph
"continuing attempts to improve, by social reform, the living",Paragraph
and working conditions of the industrial proletariat. On his,Paragraph
"return from America in 1876, Howard had become involved",Paragraph
in those socialist circles frequented by Bernard Shaw and,Paragraph
"Sidney and Beatrice Webb, a group which later, as Fabian",Paragraph
"Socialists, initially rejected the garden city idea. Howard’s",Paragraph
"position, in accordance with the spirit if not with the letter of",Paragraph
"Fabianism, was at once practical and ameliorative. The very",Paragraph
"title of his book of 1898, Tomorrow: a Peaceful Path to Real",Paragraph
"Reform, announced his position as a man of compromise.",Paragraph
Howard was committed to free enterprise within the limits of,Paragraph
social control and favoured a piecemeal approach to reform,Paragraph
rather than revolutionary action. Apart from Ruskin’s St,Paragraph
"George’s Guild of 1871, Howard was to depend for the",Paragraph
socio-political model of his city on thinkers as diverse as the,Paragraph
anarchist Peter Kropotkin and the American economist,Title
"Henry George, who in his Progress and Poverty of 1879 had",Paragraph
advocated a single tax on all ground rent. Howard was,Paragraph
equally eclectic in deriving the diagrammatic form of his city,Paragraph
from sources as varied as James Silk Buckingham’s ideal,Paragraph
"town, Victoria, of 1849 and Paxton’s Great Victorian Way",Title
proposal of 1855.,Paragraph
It is hard to imagine anything further removed from,Paragraph
Howard’s initial diagram than the realization of Letchworth,Paragraph
"Garden City, begun in 1904. The railway bisects the city, the",Paragraph
"shopping area is exposed to the weather, and industry is",Paragraph

Following in the Arts and Crafts tradition of Cole and,Paragraph
"Morris, Mackmurdo founded the Century Guild in 1882. Once",Paragraph
again this comprised a group of artists who were to engage,Paragraph
in the design and production of domestic objects. From the,Paragraph
outset Mackmurdo worked with equal facility as a graphic,Paragraph
artist and as a wallpaper and furniture designer. He,Paragraph
"publicized his views in collaboration with Selwyn Image,",Paragraph
founding the Century Guild design group in 1882 and its,Paragraph
"magazine, The Hobby Horse, in 1884. In his applied art of",Paragraph
"the early 1880s Mackmurdo developed a unique style,",Paragraph
"anticipatory of the Art Nouveau: a style which, deriving",Paragraph
"directly from William Blake, was spiritually at variance with",Paragraph
the elegant but severe forms of his architecture. This found,Paragraph
its most strict expression in the highly original flat-roofed,Paragraph
"house that he built at Enfield about 1883, and in his more",Paragraph
gratifying Century Guild Exhibition Stand of 1886.,Caption
"In 1887, Ashbee followed the well-established guild",Paragraph
model with his foundation in the East End of London of the,Paragraph
"Guild of Handicraft, which incorporated into its programme",Paragraph
the goal of direct social reform. His guild was established for,Paragraph
the express purpose of usefully employing and training,Paragraph
"London journeymen and their apprentices, who would",Paragraph
"otherwise have remained unemployed. Ashbee, as we may",Paragraph
judge from the house that he built for himself in Chelsea in,Paragraph
"1904, was a more delicate and correct designer than",Paragraph
Mackmurdo. With his postgraduate Toynbee Hall tutoring,Paragraph
"experience, he was also more committed to direct social",Paragraph
"action as a means of reform. However, although profoundly",Paragraph
"influenced by Morris and Ruskin, he took issue with both for",Paragraph
their dogmatic antipathy to the machine and for their,Paragraph
revolutionary socialism. In opposition to his more radical,Paragraph
predecessors Ashbee styled himself a Constructive Socialist.,Paragraph
"After his meeting with Frank Lloyd Wright, around the turn of",Paragraph
"the century, he was confirmed in his belief that the",Paragraph
resolution of the cultural dilemma posed by modern industry,Title
"depended on a proper use of the machine. Like Howard,",Paragraph
Ashbee was a man committed to compromise. He,Paragraph
advocated the decentralization of existing urban,Paragraph
"concentrations and their institutions, thereby lending further",Paragraph
support to a link between the Arts and Crafts movement and,Paragraph
"the garden city idea. Again following Howard, Ashbee",Paragraph
remained opposed to the nationalization of land. Convinced,Paragraph
that the cultural function of craftwork was to be that of,Paragraph
"human ‘individuation’, Ashbee feared the reductionist",Paragraph
aspects of radical socialism. Thus later in life he welcomed,Paragraph
the foundering of the Socialist International on the ‘rock of,Paragraph
"race’. In its place, he favoured a somewhat dated Disraeli",Paragraph
style of social reform and in consequence was unduly,Paragraph
sanguine about the virtues of British imperialism. A strong,Paragraph

elude most of his contemporaries. Voysey derived his style,Paragraph
from Webb's principles of respect for traditional methods,Title
"and local materials, rather than from Shaw’s inventiveness",Paragraph
and spatial virtuosity. In an unrealized house project of,Paragraph
"1885, intended for his own occupation, Voysey formulated",Paragraph
(despite Shavian half-timbering) the essential components,Paragraph
"of his style: a slate roof with overhanging eaves, wrought-",Paragraph
"iron gutter brackets, and rendered rough-cast walls pierced",Caption
by horizontal windows and marked at intervals by battered,Paragraph
buttresses and chimneys. These features were to,Paragraph
"characterize his work for the next thirty years. Stylistically,",Paragraph
Voysey’s manner was a direct attempt to recover the basic,Paragraph
"merits of English yeoman building. However, his early",Paragraph
association with Mackmurdo introduced a flowing and highly,Paragraph
sophisticated element into his work which became manifest,Paragraph
in his wallpaper and metalwork designs of about 1890.,Paragraph
These details provided accents in Voysey’s otherwise,Paragraph
"austere interiors. Unlike Morris, Voysey was possessed by a",Paragraph
"sense of restraint, almost to a fault. Thus he stipulated that",Paragraph
"either the fabrics or wallpapers should be patterned, but",Paragraph
"never both. His own house, The Orchard, built at Chorley",Paragraph
"Wood, Hertfordshire, in 1899, exemplifies the lively restraint",Paragraph
"of his interior style: gridded balusters flooded with light, low",Paragraph
"picture rails, tiled fireplace surrounds, plain oak furniture",Caption
and thick carpets. While these elements were repeated with,Paragraph
"little variation throughout his career, his designs became",Paragraph
"less figurative as the years advanced, and where his early",Paragraph
"furniture tended towards the organic, his later pieces are",Paragraph
based on Classical themes.,Paragraph
Between 1889 and 1910 Voysey designed some forty,Paragraph
"houses, a number of which transcended the latent",Paragraph
historicism of his style. Among these are the artist’s,Paragraph
"residence for J.W. Forster built in Bedford Park in 1890, the",Paragraph
"Sturgis House in Guildford of 1896, and Broadleys [29] on",Caption
"Lake Windermere, his finest house, realized in 1898.",Paragraph
"Nowhere else did he equal the clarity of its plan, the",Paragraph
"generosity of its layout and landscaping, and the boldness",Paragraph
"of its massing and fenestration. In all this, Voysey’s",Paragraph
"influence was as extensive as his career, Charles Rennie",Paragraph
"Mackintosh, C.H. Townsend, and the Viennese architects",Caption
Joseph Maria Olbrich and Josef Hoffmann being among the,Paragraph
architects influenced by his work.,Paragraph
"29 Voysey, Broadleys, Cumbria, 1898.",Caption
During the first phase of Voysey’s career the English Arts,Paragraph
and Crafts movement became firmly institutionalized:,Paragraph
initially with the foundation in 1884 of the Art Workers’,Paragraph
"Guild, at the instigation of Lethaby and other members of",Paragraph
"Shaw's office, then in 1887 with the establishment of the",Paragraph
"Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, presided over by Morris’s",Paragraph
"protégé, Walter Crane. The last twenty-five years of the",Paragraph
movement prior to the outbreak of the First World War are,Paragraph
inseparable from the career of Lethaby. After serving for,Paragraph
"twelve years as Shaw's chief assistant, he set up on his own",Paragraph
"in 1895 with the design of Avon Tyrrell, a large mansion in",Paragraph
the New Forest in southern England. Five years later he was,Paragraph
"installed, jointly with George Frampton, as the first principal",Paragraph
"of the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. Thus,",Paragraph
"apart from his very brief career as a designer, Lethaby’s role",Paragraph
within the Arts and Crafts movement turned upon his,Paragraph
marked abilities as a teacher. In 1892 he published his first,Paragraph
"book, Architecture, Mysticism and Myth, in which he",Paragraph
demonstrated how architecture in the past had always been,Paragraph
universally informed by cosmic and religious paradigms. He,Paragraph
"attempted to incorporate such symbolism into his own work,",Paragraph
while his general argument seems to have had an impact on,Paragraph
"the work of his close colleague, E.S. Prior, whose famous",Paragraph
"‘butterfly plan’ house, The Barn, built at Exmouth, Devon, in",Caption
"1897, exhibited certain features that were decidedly",Paragraph
symbolic. (Similar butterfly-plan forms were proposed by,Paragraph
"M.H. Baillie Scott, for Yellowsands in 1902 and for",Caption
Hampstead Garden Suburb in 1908.),Paragraph
"With his entry into teaching, Lethaby shifted his attention",Paragraph
from poetic content to the problem of developing the correct,Paragraph
"method for the evolution of form. Thus, by 1910, he argued",Paragraph
against his 1892 thesis that one cannot instil magic into,Paragraph
architecture when it is totally absent in the society.,Paragraph
"For Lethaby, the tradition of which he had been a part",Paragraph
appeared quite suddenly to be played out. The last in a long,Paragraph
"line of ‘Gothic Revival’ socialists, he was by the turn of the",Paragraph
"century arguing for pure functionalism. In 1915, while",Paragraph
helping to organize the foundation of the Design and,Paragraph
"Industries Association, he was urging his colleagues to look",Paragraph
to Germany and the Deutsche Werkbund for the way to the,Title
future.,Paragraph
"As the first waves of the 1914 war broke across Europe,",Paragraph
"that golden age of dreamlike English country houses,",Paragraph
"ushered in by Webb, Shaw and Nesfield and rendered at its",Paragraph
most exotic in the elaborate Country Life creations of Edwin,Paragraph
"Landseer Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll, came definitely to a",Paragraph
"close. Yet this era had effectively ended even earlier, in a",Paragraph
"spate of large Neo-Georgian houses, built, as Robert",Paragraph
"Furneaux Jordan has remarked, for ‘those aesthetic rich who",Paragraph
after the Boer War had beaten their swords into gold,Paragraph
shares’. Irrespective of this triumph of Neo-Palladianism in,Paragraph
Edwardian taste - Lutyens’s passion after the turn of the,Paragraph
century for what he called the ‘Wrenaissance’- it is unlikely,Paragraph
that the forms and ideals of the English Arts and Crafts,Paragraph
movement would have survived the socio-cultural trauma of,Paragraph
the first large-scale industrialized war. Something of this can,Paragraph
"be sensed from the fate of Liberty & Co. after the war, for",Paragraph
the holocaust of 1914-18 effectively divided the craft output,Paragraph
"of the firm like a guillotine. In the space of some five years,",Paragraph

degenerated style even in their new premises built in 1924,Paragraph

department store epitomized the so-called ‘Stockbroker’s,Paragraph
Tudor’ that in various debased domestic versions was to line,Paragraph
the newly built bypasses linking London to the suburban,Paragraph
commuter regions that were to become its life’s blood.,Paragraph
"In the interim, Lutyens, now elevated to the position of",Paragraph
"being the unofficial ‘architect laureate’ to the state, found",Paragraph
himself suspended in an aftermath that could not even,Paragraph
afford the relatively modest luxury of his early country,Paragraph
"houses, with their small but complex gardens designed by",Paragraph
Jekyll (e.g. his Prioresque Tigbourne Court of 1899). As the,Paragraph

"wittily expressed in his house, Nashdom, of 1905, was to",Paragraph
find its estranged fulfilment in the solemnity of his Somme,Paragraph

the superannuated monumentality of his masterly Viceroy’s,Paragraph

"brilliant Neo-Classical monuments, Lutyens ruthlessly",Paragraph

partnership of Adler and Sullivan. Before joining Dankmar,Paragraph
Adler as an assistant in 1879 (he was to become designing,Paragraph

where on each occasion he stayed for something under a,Paragraph

"critical to his career, not only because of his experience of",Paragraph
Furness’s ‘Orientalized’ Gothic manner - an episode which,Paragraph
had an enduring effect on his own approach to ornament -,Paragraph
but also because he met the young intellectual architect,Paragraph
"John Edelman, who introduced him, after 1875, to the",Paragraph
Chicago architectural establishment - first to William Le,Caption
"Baron Jenney, later to become the pioneer of steel-frame",Paragraph
"construction in his Fair Store [32] of 1892, and then to",Paragraph

"anarcho-socialist views, derived from Morris and Kropotkin,",Paragraph
exercised an influence over Sullivan’s theoretical,Paragraph
"development, evidenced in the latter’s Kindergarten Chats",Paragraph
of 1901.,Paragraph
"During their early careers, Adler and Sullivan were",Paragraph
preoccupied with meeting the urgent demands of a booming,Paragraph
"Chicago, then being rebuilt as the Midwestern capital after",Paragraph
"its destruction by fire in 1871. In the later 1870s, while Adler",Paragraph
"was still establishing his practice, Sullivan worked for",Paragraph
"Jenney, thereby becoming familiar with the technical",Paragraph
"aspects of Chicago construction. In his 1926 essay, The",Paragraph
"Autobiography of an Idea, Sullivan wrote of the powerful",Paragraph
forces that led to this method of building.,Paragraph
The tall commercial building arose from the pressure of land,Paragraph
"prices, the land prices from pressure of population, the",Paragraph
pressure of population from external pressure ... But an,Paragraph
office building could not rise above stairway height without,Paragraph
a means of vertical transportation. Thus pressure was,Paragraph
"brought on the brain of the mechanical engineer, whose",Paragraph
creative imagination and industry brought forth the,Paragraph
passenger elevator ... But it was inherent in the nature of,Paragraph
masonry construction to fix a new limit of height; as its ever-,Paragraph
thickening walls ate up ground and floor space of ever-,Paragraph
"increasing price, as the pressure of population rapidly",Paragraph
increased. ... [This] Chicago activity in erecting high,Paragraph
buildings finally attracted the attention of the local sales,Paragraph
managers of Eastern rolling mills; and their engineers were,Paragraph
set to work. The mills for some time past had been rolling,Paragraph
those structural shapes that had long been in use in bridge,Paragraph
work. Their own ground work was thus prepared. It was a,Paragraph
matter of vision in salesmanship based upon engineering,Title
"imagination and technique. Thus, the idea of a steel frame",Paragraph
which should carry all the load was tentatively presented to,Paragraph
Chicago architects ... the trick was turned; and there swiftly,Paragraph
came into being something new under the sun... The,Paragraph
architects of Chicago welcomed the steel frame and did,Paragraph
something with it. The architects of the East were appalled,Paragraph
by it and could make no contribution to it.?,Paragraph
"As Sullivan indicated, the Chicago architects of the 1880s",Paragraph
had no choice but to master advanced modes of,Paragraph
construction if they wanted to remain in practice; and while,Paragraph
the great fire had demonstrated the vulnerability of cast,Paragraph
"iron, the subsequent development of the fireproof steel",Paragraph
frame - with its ability to provide multistorey rentable space,Paragraph
- enabled speculators to develop downtown sites to the,Paragraph
absolute optimum. The contemporary critic Montgomery,Caption
"Schuyler remarked in 1899, ‘the elevator doubled the height",Paragraph
of the office building and the steel frame doubled it again’.,Paragraph
"Before 1886, Adler and Sullivan were occupied primarily",Paragraph
"with small office structures, warehouses and department",Paragraph
"stores, a commercial practice that was varied from time to",Paragraph
"time by residential commissions. These early buildings,",Paragraph
"limited to about six floors, afforded little scope, except for",Paragraph
"the expression of the frame, be it in iron, masonry ora",Paragraph
"mixture of the two, and one could do little save manipulate",Paragraph
"the Classical division of the facade into base, middle and",Paragraph
top.,Paragraph
All this was changed in 1886 by the commission to,Paragraph
"design the Auditorium Building [31, 33], a structure whose",Paragraph
overall contribution to Chicago culture was to be as much,Paragraph
technological as conceptual. The basic arrangement of this,Paragraph
multi-use complex was exemplary. The architects had been,Paragraph
"asked to install, within a half-block of the Chicago grid, a",Paragraph
large modern opera house flanked on two sides by eleven,Caption
"storeys of accommodation, to be given over in part to",Paragraph
offices and in part to a hotel. Their unique organization of,Paragraph
this brief incorporated such innovations as locating the hotel,Paragraph
kitchen and dining facilities on the roof so that the fumes,Paragraph
would not disturb the residents. At the same time the,Paragraph
auditorium itself offered plenty of scope for Adler’s,Paragraph
technological imagination. He met the demands for a,Paragraph
variable capacity by using folding ceiling panels and vertical,Paragraph
screens which could vary the auditorium from a concert size,Paragraph
"of 2,500 to a convention capacity of 7,000. The client’s faith",Paragraph
in Adler’s technical ability finds some reflection in Adler’s,Paragraph
own description of the hall:,Caption
"31 Chicago, 1898: view from Michigan Boulevard westwards. In the centre (no.",Caption
"2) is the Auditorium Building (see fig. 33, p. 60).",Paragraph

construction.,Paragraph
"33 Adler and Sullivan, Auditorium Building, Chicago, 1887-89. Longitudinal",Caption
section through the stage and auditorium.,Paragraph
The architectural and decorative forms found in the,Paragraph
auditorium are unconventional in the extreme and are,Paragraph
determined to a great extent by the acoustic effects to be,Paragraph
attained. ... A series of concentric elliptical arches effect the,Paragraph
lateral and vertical expansion of sound from the proscenium,Title
opening to the body of the house. The soffits and faces of,Paragraph
"these elliptical surfaces are ornamented in relief, the",Paragraph
incandescent electric lamps and... inlet openings of the,Paragraph

feet [3 metres] in diameter. ... This washes from the air,Paragraph
much dust and soot. ... Asystem of ducts carries the air into,Paragraph
different parts of the auditorium ... stage ... corridor foyers,Paragraph
and dressing-rooms. The general movement of air is from,Paragraph
the stage outward and from the ceiling downward ... Ducts,Paragraph
are carried to ... exhaust fans from openings in the risers of,Paragraph
all the steppings for the seats.>,Paragraph
Adler was possibly one of the last architect-engineers to,Paragraph
prove his competence over a wide technical range. He,Paragraph
mastered a multitude of difficulties: from the air,Paragraph
conditioning of the auditorium to the trussed steel girder,Caption
supporting its acoustical interior; from the accommodation,Paragraph
of a complex revolving stage to the provision of extensive,Paragraph
foyers to both the opera house and the hotel. The whole,Paragraph
complex was housed in a massive masonry and iron,Paragraph
"structure, ingeniously ballasted during construction so as to",Paragraph
compensate for the differential loading of its foundations.,Paragraph
The aesthetic of this eleven-storey complex was based,Paragraph
on an attenuation of the syntax of Richardson’s Marshall,Paragraph
Field Store. Where Richardson had used rusticated stone,Paragraph
"blocks throughout, Sullivan varied the facing material of the",Paragraph
Auditorium Building to modulate its greater height and,Paragraph
"mass, changing from rusticated blocks to smooth ashlar",Paragraph
"above the third floor. However, the bleakness and austerity",Paragraph
"of the final result dismayed Adler, who wrote in 1892:",Paragraph
It is to be regretted that the severe simplicity ... rendered,Paragraph
necessary by the financial policy of the earlier days of the,Paragraph
"enterprise, the deep impression made by Richardson's",Paragraph
‘Marshall Field Building’ upon the Directors of the,Paragraph
"Auditorium Association, and a reaction from a course of",Paragraph
indulgence in... highly decorative effects on the part of its,Paragraph
"architects, should have happened to coincide ... and thereby",Paragraph
deprive the exterior of the building of those graces ... so,Paragraph
characteristic of its internal treatment.4,Caption
"Nevertheless, there is something forceful, taut and",Paragraph
"rhythmic about its overall character, while the colonnade of",Paragraph
the hotel veranda on the lake front is echoed by similar,Paragraph
delicate motifs in the tower. The slight hint of orientalism in,Paragraph
this veranda anticipates the decidedly Turkish feeling of the,Paragraph
Charnley House in Chicago that Sullivan was to design in,Paragraph
"1892, in close collaboration with his assistant Frank Lloyd",Paragraph
Wright.,Paragraph
Richardson was to remain the ultimate determinant of,Paragraph
Sullivan’s early style. In Sullivan’s hands Richardson's finely,Paragraph
modulated use of the Romanesque became brutally,Paragraph
"simplified into an almost Neo-Classical manner, which was",Paragraph
first developed in his Walker Warehouse of 1888 and in his,Paragraph
"Dooly Block of 1890. These were surely those buildings,",Paragraph
"‘well formed and comely in the nude’, to which he referred",Paragraph
in Ornament in Architecture of 1892. From now on Sullivan’s,Paragraph
delimitation of mass depended on pronounced string-,Paragraph
courses and projecting cornices. Fenestration is grouped in,Paragraph
"elongated arcades, while smooth, flush facades are",Paragraph
articulated by taut decorative episodes. The Getty [34] and,Paragraph
"Wainwright tombs, designed in 1890 and 1892, epitomize",Paragraph
"the consolidation and refinement of this approach, which",Paragraph
"was rendered on a large scale in the Wainwright Building,",Paragraph
"completed in St Louis, Missouri, in 1891. As in the work of",Paragraph
"the Viennese architect Otto Wagner, the basic austerity of",Paragraph
Sullivan’s stereometric structures was in opposition to the,Paragraph
ornamentation by which they were enriched and articulated.,Paragraph
"Yet, in contrast to Wagner’s flowing ornament, there is",Paragraph
always something decidedly Islamic about Sullivan’s,Paragraph
disposition of decoration. Even where his ornament is not,Paragraph
intrinsically geometric it is almost always contained by,Paragraph
geometric form. In this recourse to the aesthetic and even,Paragraph
"the symbolic content of the East, Sullivan sought to",Paragraph
reconcile that schism in Western culture between the,Paragraph
"intellectual and the emotional, poles which he was to",Paragraph
associate later with the Greek and the Gothic. Between the,Paragraph
"Auditorium and the Wainwright Building, the character of",Paragraph
Sullivan’s ornament alternates from being organically free to,Paragraph
conforming to the outline of a precise geometry. In the,Paragraph
Transportation Building for the Chicago World’s Columbian,Caption
"Exposition of 1893, it becomes predominantly geometric, or,",Paragraph
"where free, strictly contained within a geometric grid. As",Paragraph
"Frank Lloyd Wright wrote in his book, Genius and the",Paragraph
"Mobocracy (1949), this ‘crystallization’ finally arrived at its",Paragraph
"definitive form in Sullivan’s Guaranty Building at Buffalo,",Paragraph
"New York, of 1895.",Paragraph
"34 Sullivan, Getty tomb, Graceland cemetery, Chicago, 1890.",Caption
Neither Sullivan nor Jenney can be credited with the,Paragraph
"invention of the skyscraper, if by that term one simply",Paragraph
"means a multistorey structure of great height, since such",Paragraph
heights had already been achieved in load-bearing brick just,Paragraph
"prior to Sullivan’s Wainwright structure, most notably in",Paragraph
"Burnham and Root’s sixteen-storey Monadnock Block,",Paragraph
"Chicago (1889-92). Sullivan, however, may be credited with",Paragraph
the evolution of an architectural language appropriate to the,Paragraph
high-rise frame. The Wainwright Building is the first,Paragraph
"statement of this syntax, in which the suppression of the",Paragraph
transom already evident in Richardson’s Marshall Field,Paragraph
"Warehouse is taken to its logical conclusion. The facade, no",Paragraph
"longer arcaded, is articulated by gridded piers, clad in brick,",Paragraph
while transoms are recessed and faced in terracotta so as to,Paragraph
fuse with the fenestration. The piers rise out of a taut two-,Paragraph
storey stone base and terminate abruptly at a massive and,Paragraph
ornate terracotta cornice. Four years later Sullivan refined,Caption
"this expressive formula in his second masterwork, the",Paragraph
Guaranty Building [35].,Caption
"35 Adler and Sullivan, Guaranty Building, Buffalo, 1895.",Caption
The Guaranty Building is Sullivan at the height of his,Paragraph
powers: it is without doubt the fullest realization of the,Paragraph
"principles that he outlined in his essay of 1896, The Tall",Paragraph
Office Building Artistically Considered. |n this thirteen-storey,Caption
office building Sullivan created a decorative structure in,Paragraph
"which, in his own words, ‘The ornament is applied in the",Paragraph
sense of being cut in or cut on... yet it should appear when,Paragraph
"completed, as though by the outworking of some",Paragraph
"beneficient agency, it had come forth from the very",Paragraph
substance of the material.’ Ornamental terracotta envelops,Paragraph
"the exterior in an opaque filigree, whose motifs penetrate",Paragraph
even into the ornate metalwork of the lobby. Only the,Paragraph
ground-floor plate-glass windows and marble walls were,Paragraph
"exempt from this intense, not to say delirious, treatment.",Paragraph
"Sullivan, like his pupil Frank Lloyd Wright, saw himself as",Paragraph
the lone creator of the culture of the New World. Nurtured,Paragraph
"on Whitman, Darwin and Spencer and inspired by Nietzsche,",Paragraph
he regarded his buildings as emanations of some eternal life,Paragraph
force. For Sullivan nature manifested herself in art through,Paragraph
"structure and ornamentation. His famous slogan, ‘form",Paragraph
"follows function’, found its ultimate expression in the",Paragraph
"concave cornice of the Guaranty Building, where the",Caption
ornamental ‘life force’ on the surface of the mullions,Paragraph
"expands in swirls around the circular attic windows,",Paragraph
metaphorically reflecting the mechanical system of the,Paragraph
"building which, to quote Sullivan, ‘completes itself and",Paragraph
"makes its grand turn, ascending and descending.’ This",Paragraph
organic metaphor was established in a more fundamental,Paragraph
form in the significance which Sullivan attached to the,Paragraph
"winged seed of the sycamore, the ‘germ’ featured on the",Caption
"first page of his discourse on architectural ornament, A",Paragraph
System of Architectural Ornament According with a,Paragraph
"Philosophy of Man's Powers, published in 1924, the year of",Paragraph
his death. Under this image Sullivan placed a Nietzschean,Paragraph
caption: ‘The Germ is the real thing; the seat of identity.,Paragraph
"Within its delicate mechanism lies the will to power, the",Paragraph
function of which is to seek and eventually to find its full,Paragraph
expression in form.’,Paragraph
"For Sullivan, as for Wright, this form could only evolve in",Paragraph
"a millennialistic, democratic America, where it would",Paragraph
emerge as ‘an art that will live because it will be of the,Paragraph
"people, for the people, and by the people’. As a self-",Paragraph
appointed cultural prophet of democracy Sullivan was,Paragraph
largely ignored. His overidealized egalitarian culture was,Paragraph
rejected by the people themselves. His morbid insistence on,Paragraph
the creation of a new civilization comparable to that of the,Paragraph
"Assyrians, particularly as expressed in the coexistent",Paragraph
"delirium and restraint of his orientalized architecture, left",Paragraph
them both confused and alienated. Uprooted in their very,Paragraph
essence and living through an economic depression on the,Paragraph

"of an imported Baroque, the ‘White-City’, East Coast",Paragraph
emblems of imperialistic fulfilment that were so seductively,Paragraph
presented to them in Daniel Burnham’s World's Columbian,Caption

"Sullivan’s morale, and despite a residual brilliance his",Paragraph
powers began to decline. Separated from his urbane,Paragraph

so that after the turn of the century he received few,Paragraph

These words written by Wright of the formative period that,Paragraph

the exotic vision that inspired his early career: the,Paragraph
transformation of industrial technique through art. Yet what,Paragraph
"form this transformation should take was for Wright, at the",Paragraph
"turn of the century, far from clear. Like his masters, Sullivan",Paragraph
"and Richardson, he oscillated between the authority of",Paragraph
Classical order and the vitality of asymmetrical form.,Paragraph
"Richardson, after the manorial and urban manner of Norman",Paragraph
"Shaw, had adopted an asymmetrical style for domestic",Paragraph
settings while reserving the symmetrical mode for most of,Paragraph
his public institutions. Yet Richardson’s houses always,Paragraph
"display a unifying density, and wherever possible he tried to",Paragraph
adapt the Romanesque gravity of Vaudremer’s Second,Paragraph
Empire manner and turn it into an appropriate style for the,Paragraph
New World. Even in his early timber houses a certain feeling,Paragraph
"of weight pervades the shingled facades, while in his later",Paragraph
"domestic work, such as the Glessner House in Chicago of",Paragraph
"1885, where shingle gave way to stone, the asymmetrical",Paragraph
composition was imbued with an irrefutable monumentality.,Paragraph
This issue of monumentality seems to have been equally,Paragraph
problematic for both Sullivan and Wright. Sullivan had,Paragraph
already used monumental forms in his Getty and Wainwright,Paragraph
"tombs of the 1890s, but were they equally suitable to house",Paragraph
the living? The initial solution seems to have turned on the,Paragraph
"doubly articulated formula of Classical and stone if urban,",Paragraph
"and Gothic and shingle if rural. Wright, who was virtually in",Paragraph
"charge of Sullivan’s domestic work after 1890,",Paragraph
"demonstrated this dual principle first in his own house,",Paragraph
erected in 1889 in what was still the prairie of American,Paragraph
mythology - the nascent Chicago suburb of Oak Park - and,Paragraph
"then in the orientalizing, Italianate Charnley House that he",Paragraph
designed with Sullivan for downtown Chicago in 1892.,Caption
"Wright’s own house was derived in both profile and plan, as",Paragraph
"Vincent Scully has shown, from the cruciform and T-plan",Paragraph
Richardsonian pyramid-shaped houses that Bruce Price was,Paragraph
"then building in Tuxedo Park, New York.",Caption
"For Sullivan and Wright, the young, egalitarian culture of",Paragraph
the New World could not be based on something so,Paragraph
ponderous and conventionally Catholic as Richardson’s,Paragraph
Romanesque. In consequence they turned to the work of a,Paragraph
"fellow Celt, Owen Jones, whose Grammar of Ornament had",Paragraph
first been published in 1856. Over sixty per cent of Jones’s,Paragraph
"ornamental examples were exotic, that is of Indian, Chinese,",Paragraph
"Egyptian, Assyrian or Celtic origin, and it was to such",Paragraph
"sources, all removed from the West, that Sullivan and Wright",Paragraph
resorted in their search for an appropriate style in which to,Paragraph
embody the New World. This not only accounts for the,Paragraph
Islamic motifs to be found in Sullivan’s work but also for the,Paragraph

two distinctly different aspects to the building: the street or,Paragraph
"‘urban’ facade, being symmetrical and entered on axis, and",Paragraph
"the garden or ‘rural’ facade, being asymmetrical and",Paragraph
entered to one side. This anticipates the planning strategy,Paragraph
"of Wright’s Prairie Style, in which irregular distortions to the",Paragraph
rear of a formal facade conveniently accommodate awkward,Paragraph
ingredients such as service elements.,Paragraph
"36 Wright, Winslow House, River Forest, Illinois, 1893. View and site plan.",Caption
That the Winslow House was a transitional work is clearly,Paragraph
"confirmed by the mixed fenestration, part sash and part",Paragraph
"casement. Here, as Grant Carpenter Manson has written (in",Paragraph
"Frank Lloyd Wright to 1910, of 1958), Wright began ‘to",Paragraph
"discard the sash window in favour of the casement, to",Paragraph
prepare his work for the final change from fenestration in,Paragraph
spots to fenestration in strips’: while the characteristic,Paragraph
Wrightian low-hipped Prairie roof appears here for the first,Caption
"time, the animation of surfaces with Sullivanesque bands of",Paragraph
ornament and string courses testifies to the continued,Paragraph
influence of Wright’s master. The ornamented entrance,Caption
elevation clearly derives from Sullivan’s tombs of the early,Paragraph
"1890s, while the arcaded fireplace screen of the entry hall is",Paragraph
an introverted version of the facade of Sullivan’s Schiller,Caption
Theater.,Paragraph
This early emphasis on the fireplace testifies to another,Paragraph
"more critical influence, that of Japanese architecture, to",Paragraph
which Wright on his own admission had been subject since,Paragraph
"1890, and certainly since the Chicago World’s Columbian",Paragraph
"Exposition of 1893, when the Japanese Government housed",Paragraph
their national exhibit in a reconstruction of the Ho-o-den,Paragraph
Temple. The role that this structure may have played in,Paragraph
Wright’s evolution has been best characterized by Manson:,Paragraph
If we assume that actual confrontation with a Japanese,Paragraph
building was the necessary mechanism at a certain juncture,Paragraph
"in his career to give those concepts reality and direction,",Paragraph
then many of the steps in the evolution of his architecture,Paragraph
can be rationally explained. As examples: the translation of,Paragraph
"the tokonoma, the permanent element of a Japanese interior",Paragraph
"and the focus of domestic contemplation and ceremony,",Paragraph
"into its Western counterpart, the fireplace, but a fireplace",Paragraph
"expanded to unprecedented, animistic importance; the",Paragraph
frank revelation of the masonry of fireplace and chimney as,Paragraph
the one desired solid substance in an architecture of ever-,Paragraph
increasing movement; the opening out of interior spaces,Paragraph
away from the chimneybreast toward shifting planes of,Paragraph
glass at their further limits; the extension of the great eaves,Paragraph
beyond these planes to modify and control the intensity of,Paragraph
light which they admit and to protect them from weather;,Paragraph
the subdivision of interior space by suggesting rather than,Paragraph
"partition, acknowledging and accommodating the",Paragraph
fluctuating human uses to which it is put; the elimination of,Paragraph
all sculptured and varnished trim in favor of flat surfaces,Paragraph
and natural wood - all these and more could have been,Paragraph
adduced from the lesson of the Ho-o-den.?,Paragraph
Irrespective of the final provenance of the tokonama,Paragraph
"motif, by the time of the Winslow House, the fireplace,",Paragraph
"despite the provision of central heating, had become even",Paragraph
more of a ceremonial core to the home than it had been in,Paragraph
Wright’s own Oak Park house of four years before. Yet in,Paragraph
"1893 Wright remained uncommitted, for he could still",Paragraph
design a thoroughly Classical facade for the Milwaukee,Caption
Library. Two years later he extended his own home with a,Paragraph
studio in that quasi Pre-Columbian manner which we have,Paragraph
"come to regard, after Manson, as his Froebel style: a",Paragraph
geometric proclivity supposedly influenced by the impact of,Paragraph
Froebel toys on his education. About 1895 he also produced,Paragraph
"two surprisingly radical designs, his Luxfer Prism offices,",Paragraph
"faced entirely in glass, and the McAfee House, which was an",Paragraph
ingenious reinterpretation of Richardson's parti for the Winn,Paragraph
Memorial Library of 1878.,Paragraph
Wright appears almost desperate at this point to break,Paragraph
"through to a new style: his public work is still part Italianate,",Paragraph
"part Richardsonian, while his domestic work is now",Paragraph
"consistently characterized by low-pitched roofs, poised at",Paragraph
various heights over elongated asymmetrical plans. Typical,Paragraph
of these two modes are his Francisco Terrace apartments,Paragraph
"and his Heller and Husser Houses, all built in Chicago",Paragraph
between 1895 and 1899.,Paragraph
It was to take Wright two more years to resolve all these,Paragraph
various influences into that integrated domestic style with,Paragraph
"which he was to express his myth of the Prairie, and of",Paragraph
which he was to write in 1908: ‘The Prairie has a beauty of,Paragraph
its own and we should recognize and accentuate this natural,Paragraph
"beauty, its quiet level. Hence ... sheltering overhangs, low",Paragraph
"terraces and out reaching walls, sequestering private",Paragraph
gardens.’,Paragraph
The final emergence of the Prairie Style coincided with,Paragraph
"Wright’s theoretical maturity, as manifest in his famous",Paragraph
"lecture of 1901, ‘The Art and Craft of the Machine’, which",Paragraph
"was first delivered, appropriately enough, at Jane Addams’s",Paragraph
Hull House Settlement in Chicago. Taking as his point of,Paragraph
departure his youthful despair on reading Victor Hugo’s,Paragraph
"Notre Dame de Paris (1832), in which the author had",Paragraph
concluded that printing would eventually eliminate,Paragraph
"architecture, Wright countered that the machine could be",Paragraph
"intelligently used, in accordance with its own laws, as an",Paragraph
agent for abstraction and purification - processes by which,Paragraph
architecture may be redeemed from the ravages of,Paragraph
industrialization. He led his audience to contemplate the,Paragraph
"awe-inspiring panorama of Chicago as a giant machine, and",Paragraph
concluded with the exhortation that this was ‘the thing into,Paragraph
which the forces of Art are to breathe the thrill of ideality! A,Paragraph
SOUL!’,Title
"From the early 1890s on, the sculptor Richard Bock",Paragraph
"served as the iconographer of this ‘soul’, that is to say as",Paragraph
"the image-maker of Wright’s Prairie Style. Bock’s early work,",Paragraph
"in its nature symbolism, was close to the European",Paragraph
Secession Style and complemented the residual,Paragraph
"Sullivanesque aspects in Wright’s work. After 1900,",Paragraph
"however, under Wright’s influence, Bock’s sculpture became",Paragraph
"increasingly abstract, as is evident from the ‘Muse’ that he",Paragraph
"created for Wright’s Dana House of 1902 [37]. This figure,",Paragraph
"situated in the entrance hall, was depicted as assembling",Paragraph
"the abstract elements of an exotic machine culture, piece by",Paragraph
piece.,Paragraph
"37 Bock, ‘Muse’ for Wright’s Dana House, Springfield, Illinois, 1902.",Caption
Wright’s Prairie Style crystallized finally in the house,Paragraph
plans designed for the Ladies’ Home Journal in 1900 and,Caption
1901. Its elements were now established: an open ground,Paragraph
plan contained within a horizontal format comprising low-,Paragraph
pitched roofs and low bounding walls - the low profile being,Paragraph
"integrated deliberately into the site, in strong contrast to",Paragraph
the vertical chimneys and internal double-height volumes.,Caption
"Yet Wright is still hesitant about the profile at this point,",Paragraph
oscillating between the Richardsonian density of his,Paragraph
Heurtley House of 1902 and the lightweight Japanese,Title
"framing of his Hickox House, completed at Kankakee, Illinois,",Caption
two years before.,Paragraph
This split between a monolithic versus an articulate,Paragraph
expression resolved itself when Wright started to work for,Paragraph
the entrepreneurial Martin family in Buffalo. The Larkin,Paragraph
"Building and the Martin House [38], both built in 1904 for",Paragraph
"Darwin D. Martin, owner of the Larkin Mail Order Co.,",Caption
represent the emergence of Wright’s mature style. They,Paragraph
were followed at once by Wright’s first visit to Japan in 1905,Paragraph
"and by the realization of his first concrete building, the Unity",Paragraph
"Temple at Oak Park, Illinois, in 1906. By now the Classical",Paragraph
"base, overlaid with the exotic, had been transformed into a",Paragraph
"style that was Wright’s own, a unique manner soon to be",Paragraph
made available in Europe through the portfolios of his work,Paragraph
issued by Wasmuth in Berlin in 1910 and 1911.,Paragraph
"38 Wright, Martin House, Buffalo, 1904.",Caption
"The masterpieces of 1904-06, a house, a church and an",Paragraph
"office building, all display essentially the same architectural",Paragraph
system. The Martin House is the first work by Wright to be,Paragraph
consistently based on a modulated tartan plan form. Similar,Paragraph
gridded articulations of support and void occur in the main,Paragraph
"volumes of the Unity Temple and the Larkin Building,",Caption
although where the church is centralized about two axes the,Paragraph
office building is structured around one. Both these public,Paragraph
"buildings comprise a single internal space, top-lit and",Paragraph
surrounded by galleries on all four sides served by stairways,Paragraph
"at each of the four corners [39, 40]. The elevations of the",Paragraph
"church are effectively the same on all sides, symbolizing",Paragraph
"‘unity’, whereas those of the Larkin Building differ on the",Paragraph
longer and shorter sides. Apart from being monumental,Paragraph
"variations of the same architectural parti, both buildings",Paragraph
pioneered ingenious systems of environmental control. The,Paragraph
Unity Temple was equipped with built-in ducted hot-air,Paragraph
"heating, while the Larkin Building was one of the first ‘air-",Paragraph
"conditioned’ office structures, inasmuch as its air was",Paragraph
cooled as well as heated.,Paragraph
"39 Wright, Unity Temple, Oak Park, Illinois, 1904-06.",Caption
"40 Wright, Larkin Building, Buffalo, 1904. Glazed central space.",Caption
"In these works Wright, the Unitarian, appeared to imbue",Paragraph
"his vision of a new life with a universal sense for the sacred,",Paragraph
running from the sacrament of the family hearth through to,Title
the sacrament of work and to the house of religious,Title
"assembly. His goal, like that of many of his European",Paragraph
"contemporaries, was the achievement of a total",Paragraph
"environment, embracing and affecting the whole of society.",Paragraph
This would explain his obsessive exaltation of the hearth as,Paragraph
"the moral and spiritual centre to be projected, with the aid",Paragraph
"of well-placed inscriptions, into the more public realms of",Paragraph
worship and work. It would also in part account for Wright’s,Paragraph
"disappointment when, having designed the Larkin office",Paragraph
"furniture, he was not permitted to restyle the telephones. It",Paragraph
is this same intent that embellished the main entrance to,Paragraph
"the building, where employees entered dutifully past a",Paragraph
cascade of water falling from a symbolic relief by Bock,Caption
bearing the paternalistic inscription: ‘Honest labour needs,Paragraph
"no master, simple justice needs no slaves.’ The same",Paragraph
idealistic spirit is manifest in Wright’s disgust at changes,Paragraph
made to the Larkin structure during the course of its daily,Paragraph
"use. ‘They’, he wrote bitterly of the management, ‘never",Paragraph
hesitated to make sense-less changes ... it was just one of,Paragraph
"their factory buildings.’ Despite his artistic patronage,",Paragraph
Martin was obviously unable to place restrictions on the,Paragraph
"organization and management of his offices, and where the",Paragraph
"home could be preserved in all its purity, the workplace",Paragraph
remained vulnerable to the dictates of production.,Paragraph
In these fertile years Wright carefully assembled an,Paragraph
atelier of technicians and artist-craftsmen to design and,Paragraph
"realize his vision of a Gesamtkunstwerk, a ‘total work of art’.",Paragraph
"This team included the engineer Paul Mueller, the landscape",Paragraph
"architect Wilhelm Miller, the cabinet-maker George",Title
"Niedecken, the mosaic designer Catherine Ostertag, the",Paragraph
"sculptors Richard Bock and Alfonso lanelli, and the talented",Paragraph
"Orlando Giannini, who served as Wright's fabricator of glass",Paragraph
and textiles from 1892.,Paragraph
By 1905 the syntax of the Prairie Style was firmly,Paragraph
"established. Its expression, however, constantly oscillated",Paragraph
"between two poles, the one rambling, asymmetric and",Paragraph
"picturesque, as exemplified in the Avery Coonley House of",Paragraph
"1908, and the other compact, gridded, symmetrical and",Paragraph

"Hotel in Tokyo, it constituted the last attempt by the early",Paragraph
Wright to establish his vision as a universal expression. Built,Paragraph
in the short time of ninety days by the ever-ingenious,Paragraph
"Mueller, Midway Gardens was, as Wright put it, ‘a social",Paragraph
response to the dance craze’. Based on the German beer,Paragraph
"garden, it was the embodiment of a new social institution,",Paragraph
"and took the form of a sequence of stepped terraces,",Paragraph
focused axially on an orchestra shell at one end and linked,Paragraph
by flanking arcades to a galleried restaurant and winter,Caption
"garden complex at the other [42, 43]. It was in many",Paragraph
respects Wright’s most cogent attempt at a popular culture.,Paragraph
As such it afforded full scope to the rhetoric of his Prairie,Paragraph
"Style, with Bock and lanelli designing figures, finials and",Paragraph
reliefs and Giannini providing the glass. Inside there were,Caption
large reliefs and abstract murals comprising concentric,Caption
"circular elements, which were reminiscent of Wright’s",Paragraph
fanciful idea of decorating the gardens with gas-filled,Paragraph
coloured balloons moored to the roof.,Caption
"42, 43 Wright, Midway Gardens, Chicago, 1914. Above, longitudinal section,",Caption
"showing the restaurant and bandshell; befow, general view of the beer gardens",Caption
in their heyday.,Paragraph
Wright's Prairie subculture played itself out as a hermetic,Paragraph
style in the building of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo during the,Caption
years 1916-22. This structure derived in both plan and,Paragraph
section from Midway Gardens. The restaurant/winter garden,Caption
of the Chicago complex reappeared as the auditorium and,Paragraph
"lobby of the hotel, while the flanking arcades of the gardens",Paragraph
were transformed into its residential wings. The internal,Paragraph
"murals and reliefs also extended Midway themes, while the",Paragraph
galleried accessways of the hotel recalled the café terraces,Paragraph
of the Midway layout.,Paragraph
"Removed from an American context, Wright sought",Paragraph
affinities with the local masonry tradition by employing a,Paragraph
"battered and castellated profile, executed in brick and",Caption
dressed in Oya stone. Internally this lava stone was,Paragraph
"modelled so as to allude to Pre-Columbian profiles, as had",Paragraph
been done with the blockwork of Midway Gardens. Such,Paragraph
exotic references were to become a theatrical formula in,Paragraph
Wright’s Hollywood houses of the 1920s. In the Imperial,Paragraph
Hotel they amounted to a petrification of his New World,Paragraph
culture.,Paragraph
"As it happened, the Imperial Hotel was to be valued as",Paragraph
"much for its structural ingenuity as for its architecture,",Paragraph
much of the credit for its miraculous survival amid the ruins,Paragraph
of the 1922 Tokyo earthquake disaster going to the,Paragraph
"engineer, Mueller. Nevertheless, it was fitting that this final",Paragraph
work in the first phase of Wright’s brilliant career should be,Paragraph
"praised by Sullivan, who just before his death in 1924 wrote",Paragraph
"in mystical terms of its survival: ‘it stands today, uninjured,",Paragraph
because it was thought-built so to stand. It was not an,Paragraph
"imposition upon the Japanese, but a free will contribution to",Paragraph
the finest elements in their culture.’,Paragraph

For the great French architectural theorist Eugéne Viollet-le-,Paragraph
"Duc these principles, first outlined in his lectures at the",Paragraph
"Ecole des Beaux-Arts in 1853, clearly precluded the",Paragraph
architectural tradition of French Classical Rationalism. In,Paragraph
"place of an ‘abstract’ international style, Viollet-le-Duc",Paragraph
advocated a return to regional building. His illustrations to,Paragraph
"the Entretiens, which in certain aspects anticipated Art",Paragraph
"Nouveau, ostensibly indicated the kind of architecture that",Paragraph
would evolve from his principles of Structural Rationalism.,Paragraph
"To the envy of Ruskin, Viollet-le-Duc provided more than a",Paragraph
moral argument. He proffered not only models but also a,Paragraph
method which would theoretically free architecture from the,Paragraph
"eclectic irrelevancies of historicism. In this way, his",Paragraph
Entretiens came to serve as an inspiration to the avant,Paragraph
"garde of the last quarter of the 19th century, his method",Paragraph
penetrating to those European countries where French,Paragraph
cultural influence was strong but the tradition of Classicism,Paragraph
"was weak. Eventually his ideas spread even to England,",Paragraph
"where they influenced men such as Sir George Gilbert Scott,",Paragraph
Alfred Waterhouse and even Norman Shaw. Outside France,Caption
"his thesis, in particular its implicit cultural nationalism, had",Paragraph
its most pronounced impact on the works of the Catalan,Paragraph
"Antoni Gaudi, the Belgian Victor Horta and the Dutch",Title
architect Hendrik Petrus Berlage.,Caption
"The writings of Viollet-le-Duc, Ruskin and Richard Wagner",Title
were all part of Gaudi’s adopted cultural background. Aside,Paragraph
"from these extra-Mediterranean influences, his achievement",Paragraph
"seems to have sprung from two rather antithetical impulses,",Paragraph
the desire to revive indigenous architecture and the,Paragraph
compulsion to create totally new forms of expression. In,Paragraph
"this, of course, save for his unusual powers of fantasy,",Paragraph
"Gaudi was hardly unique. This antithesis, latent in the whole",Paragraph
"of the Arts and Crafts movement, was reflected in the Irish",Paragraph
Celtic literary revival which exercised such a strong,Paragraph
influence on the Glasgow School in the 1890s. A comparable,Paragraph
Catalan revival had arisen in Barcelona as early as the,Paragraph
"1860s, when Madrid asserted its sovereignty over Catalonia",Paragraph
by prohibiting the use of the Catalan language. First,Paragraph
"confined to sociopolitical reform, the revival soon sued for",Paragraph
"Catalan independence and, although such a status was",Paragraph
"never granted, the claim to autonomy re-emerged as a",Paragraph
powerful factor in the Spanish Civil War and is alive again,Paragraph
today. In the second half of the 19th century the Church,Paragraph
"supported Catalan claims to sovereignty and social reform,",Paragraph
so that Gaudi was free from any conflict between his faith,Paragraph
and his political allegiances.,Paragraph
"Both Gaudi and his patron, the textile manufacturer and",Paragraph
"shipping magnate Eusebio GUell Bacigalupi, grew to their",Paragraph
maturity under the influence of the Catalan separatist,Paragraph
movement. Although this movement had its conservative,Paragraph
"aspects, it nonetheless supported various programmes for",Paragraph
"social reform, which were largely the work of the Catalan",Paragraph
intelligentsia. Gaudi had in fact been subject to socialist,Paragraph
ideas before his meeting with GUell in 1882. Immediately,Paragraph
after his graduation he had been involved with the Mataré,Paragraph
"Workers’ Co-operative, who commissioned him to design a",Paragraph
"workers’ settlement comprising houses, a community",Paragraph
"structure and a workshop, of which only the last was built, in",Paragraph
1878.,Paragraph
"Soon after this, Gaudi began to work for the bourgeoisie,",Paragraph
building the exotic Casa Vicens in a quasi-Moorish style in,Paragraph
"1878. This house, like most of Gaudi’s work, testified to the",Paragraph
"influence of Viollet-le-Duc, in particular the latter’s L’Art",Paragraph
"russe (1870), where the constituent elements of a national",Paragraph
style were seen as being contingent on the principles of,Paragraph
"Structural Rationalism. In the Casa Vicens, Gaudi first",Paragraph
"formulated the essence of his style, which while Gothic in",Paragraph
"structural principle was Mediterranean, not to say Islamic, in",Paragraph
"much of its inspiration. As Ary Leblond wrote in 1910, Gaudi",Paragraph
"sought ‘a Gothic which was full of sunlight, structurally",Paragraph
"related to the great Catalan cathedrals, employing colour as",Paragraph
"both the Greeks and the Moors did, logical for Spain; a",Paragraph
"Gothic, half maritime, half continental, enlivened by",Paragraph
Pantheistic richness’. The result in the Casa Vicens was a,Paragraph
"Mudéjar pastiche planned around a conservatory, which in",Paragraph
"its banded brick, glazed tiles and decorative ironwork was",Paragraph
more exuberant than any house of comparable date,Paragraph
"(compare Shaw’s Pierrepoint, at Frensham in Surrey, of",Paragraph
1876). Yet the structure transcended its exotic expression;,Paragraph
for this was the first occasion on which Gaudi used the,Paragraph
"traditional Catalan or Roussillon vault, in which archlike",Paragraph
forms are achieved through corbelling out laminated layers,Paragraph
"of tiles. This vault became a key feature of his style,",Paragraph
appearing in its most delicate form in the thin shell structure,Paragraph
"of his Sagrada Familia School, Barcelona, of 1909.",Caption
The initial achievements of Gaudi’s career are,Paragraph
inseparable from the various works that he and his,Paragraph
"colleague, Francesc Berenguer, designed for Eusebio GUell.",Paragraph
"Count Guell was a progressive, and his house in Barcelona,",Paragraph
"the Palau Giell [45], which Gaudi designed for him in 1888,",Paragraph
became a Mecca for the intelligentsia of the 1890s. As the,Paragraph
"Casa Vicens had been built around a conservatory, so the",Paragraph
"Palau Guell was built around a music room, an organ loft",Paragraph
and chapel. This composite space echoed the form of the,Paragraph
typical Islamic court and ran through the entire upper,Paragraph
section of the house.,Paragraph
Prominent among Guell’s enthusiasms were Ruskin and,Paragraph
"Wagner, and Gaudi seems to have been as much affected",Paragraph
by the theories of the one as by the music-dramas of the,Paragraph
other. At any event Ruskin’s reputation was at its height at,Paragraph
"the turn of the century, and his dictum, so compatible with",Paragraph
"Wagner, that the architect who was not a sculptor or a",Paragraph
painter was ‘nothing but a framemaker on a large scale’,Paragraph
would clearly have appealed to Gaudi.,Paragraph
For GUuell the transformation of society at large was to be,Paragraph
effected through the garden city. To this end in 1891 he,Paragraph
commissioned Gaudi and Berenguer to design a workers’,Paragraph
"community for his textile plant at Santa Coloma de Cervelld,",Paragraph
later known as the Colonia GUell. This was to be followed by,Paragraph
"a commission in 1900 for a middle-class suburb, the Park",Paragraph
"GUell, situated on the Montafia Pelada overlooking",Paragraph
"Barcelona, a project eventually realized without its",Paragraph
perimeter of houses between 1903 and 1914. In the,Paragraph
meantime Berenguer continued with the sporadic,Paragraph
"development of the Colonia Guell, until Gaudi succeeded",Paragraph
"him there in 1908, to complete the work on the chapel. By",Paragraph
then Gaudi’s career as an ecclesiastical architect had,Paragraph
"already begun, since he had taken over the building of the",Paragraph
Sagrada Familia Church [44] in Barcelona from Juan,Caption
Martorell in 1906.,Paragraph
"44 Gaudi, three progressive stages of the Sagrada Familia Church, Barcelona",Caption
"(left to right, 1898, 1915, 1918) and (far right) Viollet-le-Duc, plan for a",Caption
"cathedral, from his L’Art russe, 1870.",Caption
"45 Gaudi, Palau Guell, Barcelona, 1888.",Caption
Gaudi’s Park GUell emerged as the uninhibited,Paragraph
crystallization of his ecstatic vision. For all that the park,Paragraph
"commanded a spectacular view, the only buildings to be",Paragraph
"completed there were the gatehouse, the grand stairway",Paragraph
leading to the covered market above and Gaudi's own,Paragraph
house. The irregularly shaped undulating vault of the market,Caption
"was carried on sixty-nine grotesque Doric columns, while its",Paragraph
"roof, bounded by a continuous serpentine bench, was",Paragraph
intended to function as an arena or open-air stage. This,Paragraph
"exotic, mosaic-faced perimeter terminated in an esplanade,",Paragraph
which in turn merged into the naturalistic random rubble,Paragraph
construction of the rest of the park. The park itself was,Paragraph
"structured by serpentine pathways which, where necessary,",Paragraph
"were supported on vaulted buttresses, shaped so as to",Paragraph
suggest petrified tree trunks.,Paragraph
The Park GUell is the first of Gaudi’s works to evoke,Paragraph
"directly, through the undulating profile of its arena, the",Paragraph
obsessive image of his life - the famous mountain near,Paragraph
Barcelona known as Montserrat. According to the medieval,Paragraph
"legend, celebrated by Wagner in Parsifal, the Holy Grail was",Paragraph
"concealed in the castle of Montsalvat, a site later identified",Paragraph
"with Montserrat and its monastery, housing the patron saint",Paragraph
"of Catalonia. Gaudi, who first worked for the monastery in",Paragraph
"1866, remained haunted by the serrated profile of the",Paragraph
mountain for the whole of his life.,Paragraph
The peaks and chimneys of the Casa Mila [46] rise out of,Paragraph
the rational grid of Barcelona as the crown of an undulating,Paragraph
"cliff face, a cyclopean gesture whose overwhelming sense of",Paragraph
weight seems to contradict its free and delicate organization,Paragraph
about three irregularly shaped courts. This contradiction,Paragraph
finds its parallel in the perverse suppression of the,Paragraph
building’s steel structure behind massive stone facing. As in,Paragraph
"the Park GUell, the articulation of the structure has been",Paragraph
sacrificed to the evocation of some primal force. Nothing,Paragraph
"could have been further from Viollet-le-Duc, for neither the",Paragraph
fabric nor its mode of assembly was explicitly rendered.,Paragraph
"Instead, huge blocks were laboriously worked so as to",Paragraph
suggest a rock face eroded by time. A similar cosmic,Paragraph
"reference seems to be intended in the iron balconies,",Paragraph
wrought by the Gaudi atelier in such a way as to suggest,Paragraph
petrified strands of storm-tossed seaweed. Departing from,Paragraph
"the principles of Viollet-le-Duc, Gaudi finally transformed his",Paragraph
"raw material into an assembly of powerful images, whose",Paragraph
emotive force recalls the operatic genre of Wagner. Seen in,Paragraph
"retrospect, the Casa Mila seems to anticipate something of",Paragraph
the ethos of the Expressionism that was soon to emerge in,Paragraph
"Central Europe. In 1910, its symbolic solemnity served to",Paragraph
"isolate Gaudi, not only from the tradition of Structural",Paragraph
"Rationalism, but also from the lighter aspects of Symbolism,",Paragraph
those flutters of ‘farewells in space’ that constitute the,Paragraph
general tenor of Catalan ‘Modernismo’.,Paragraph
"46 Gaudi, Casa Mila, Barcelona, 1906-10.",Caption
The situation in Brussels at the end of the century was,Paragraph
similar in many respects to that in Barcelona. In the Flemish,Paragraph
capital a comparable accumulation of industrial wealth was,Paragraph
paralleled by an equally obsessive preoccupation with,Paragraph
"national identity, although in Belgium the wealth was more",Paragraph
evenly distributed and the nationalism mitigated by actual,Paragraph
"independence. All the same, Belgian architects were quite",Paragraph
as anxious as the Catalans for the evolution of a truly,Paragraph
modern but nonetheless national style. The architectural,Paragraph
avant garde of the 1870s accused the Beaux-Arts architect,Paragraph
Joseph Poelaert of cultural mendacity for his Neo-Classical,Paragraph
"Palais de Justice, completed in 1883: not only was it",Paragraph
"Piranesian and megalomaniacal, but it evoked a past which",Paragraph
was international and hence by definition un-Flemish. As far,Paragraph
"as they were concerned, the model for a new ‘native’",Paragraph
architecture could be found in the local 16th-century brick,Paragraph
"traditions, in which the principles of Viollet-le-Duc could",Paragraph
flourish.,Paragraph
"One year after the publication of Entretiens, the newly",Paragraph
formed Société Centrale d’Architecture de Belgique started,Paragraph
to campaign vigorously in their magazine L’Emulation for a,Paragraph
new national style. The issue of 1872 declared: ‘We are,Paragraph
"called to create something which is our own, something to",Paragraph
which we can give a new name. We are called upon to,Paragraph
"invent a style.’ E. Allard, the major theorist of L’Emulation,",Paragraph
later wrote: ‘We must try first and foremost to create,Paragraph
Belgian artists - we must free ourselves from foreign,Title
influences.’ Throughout the 1870s L’Emulation continued to,Paragraph
propagate the principles of a hypothetical style that was,Paragraph
more constrained in its Structural Rationalism than that,Paragraph
adopted by Gaudi. ‘Nothing is beautiful in architecture,Paragraph
unless true.’ ‘Shun painted plaster and stucco.’ ‘Architecture,Paragraph
is drifting towards decadence; towards a veritable,Paragraph
cacophony.’,Paragraph
"Despite these exhortations, a convincing style took its",Paragraph
"time to materialize, and nothing of consequence was",Paragraph
"achieved in Belgium until 1892, when Victor Horta began his",Paragraph
mature career with the realization of the Hétel Tassel in,Paragraph
"Brussels [47]. In this narrow-fronted, three-storey town",Paragraph
"house of traditional terrace format, Horta went beyond the",Paragraph
achievement of his early career to become one of the first,Paragraph
architects to make an extensive use of iron in domestic,Paragraph
architecture. He treated iron as though it were an organic,Paragraph
filament insinuated into the fabric to subvert the inertia of,Paragraph
"stone. Other than the works of Eiffel and Contamin, which",Paragraph
"he would have seen at the Paris Exhibition of 1889, the most",Paragraph
influential image behind Horta’s peculiar ‘strapwork’ style,Paragraph
was the contemporary graphic work of the Dutch-Indonesian,Paragraph
artist Jan Toorop. This connection underlines the importance,Paragraph
of painting in the Belgian Art Nouveau. Toorop was a,Paragraph
"member of that influential Post-Impressionist group, Les XX,",Paragraph

"In the open planning of the Hétel Tassel, Horta exploded",Paragraph
the 18th-century Parisian hdéte/ formula. As the octagonal,Paragraph
vestibule on the ground floor rose upwards through a half-,Paragraph

adjacent foyer space covered by an iron superstructure. The,Paragraph
"free-standing columns of this space, embellished with iron",Caption

of the metalwork. From the balustrades to the light fittings,Paragraph
"the same aesthetic is dominant, a linear exuberance that is",Paragraph
delicately echoed in the mosaic floor and wall finishes and,Paragraph
in the coloured glass panels of the door to the salon. Yet for,Paragraph

native style prescribed by the French theorist as conforming,Paragraph
"to usage, climate and national spirit and ‘to the progress",Title
which has been made in science and practical knowledge’.,Paragraph
Thus we find him writing in 1903:,Paragraph

"will perform a true, sound and useful work.2",Paragraph
"We may assume that what Guimard, like Gaudi and",Paragraph
"Horta, had in mind was the evolution of the ‘constituent",Paragraph
elements’ of a national style as advocated by Viollet-le-Duc.,Paragraph
Yet by the turn of the century there were at least three,Paragraph
"versions of Guimard’s own style: a loose, rustic, mixed-",Paragraph
"media expression, as found in the country chalets that he",Paragraph
"built between 1899 and 1908, of which his Castel Henriette",Paragraph
of 1900 is typical; an urban style of precisely assembled,Paragraph
brick and dramatically sculptured stonework such as we find,Paragraph
"in his own house in the Avenue Mozart, Paris, of 1910; and",Paragraph
finally a spidery ferrovitreous manner which was mass-,Paragraph
"produced soon after 1899, when he was awarded the",Paragraph
commission for the Paris Métro stations. The entrances were,Paragraph
"made up of interchangeable standard iron pieces, cast in",Paragraph
the form of naturalistic elements and framing enamelled,Paragraph
"steel and glass. Paradoxically, they were closer to the linear",Paragraph
expressiveness of Horta than to the moral rigour of de,Paragraph
Baudot; and Guimard even treated the typography and,Paragraph
illumination of these structures as the sinuous continuation,Paragraph
"of their form. Thereafter, over the next four years, these",Paragraph

"career, his Humbert de Romans concert hall [50], completed",Paragraph
in Paris in 1901 and demolished in 1905. Like Horta’s Maison,Paragraph

Throughout the two decades that spanned the turn of the,Paragraph
"century, there remained quietly in the background the",Paragraph
"Dutch architect Hendrik Petrus Berlage, who contrived to",Paragraph
practise in a consistent manner until his death in 1934.,Paragraph
"Unlike Horta, Berlage did not allow his principles to become",Paragraph
"compromised by the acquired, ‘alien’ tastes of an arriviste",Paragraph
"middle class. In Holland, in any case, the middle class was",Paragraph
"fully integrated into the general society, social co-operation",Paragraph
being second nature in a country that was constantly,Paragraph
threatened with inundation. In such a stable context Berlage,Paragraph
"enjoyed almost fifty years of uninterrupted practice, over a",Paragraph
period that due to Dutch neutrality was not even disturbed,Paragraph
by the hostilities of the First World War.,Paragraph
Berlage received his professional education at the,Paragraph
"Eidgendssische Technische Hochschule, Zurich, in the late",Caption
1870s. There he studied under the immediate followers of,Paragraph
"Gottfried Semper, from whom he would have received an",Paragraph
extremely rational and typological education. On his return,Paragraph
to Amsterdam in 1881 he began to associate with PJ.H.,Paragraph
"Cuijpers, nearly thirty years his senior, who was already a",Paragraph
disciple and correspondent of Viollet-le-Duc. In accordance,Paragraph
"with the principles of Structural Rationalism, Cuijpers sought",Paragraph
to rationalize his own eclecticism in an effort to evolve a,Paragraph
"new national style, an attempt which culminated in his Neo-",Paragraph
"Flemish Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, of 1885. This work",Caption
strongly influenced Berlage’s entry for the Amsterdam,Paragraph
"Exchange competition of 1883, which he designed in",Paragraph
association with Theodorus Sanders in a similar turreted and,Paragraph
gabled manner.,Paragraph
Twelve years later Berlage received the commission for,Paragraph
"the Exchange, despite the fact that he had only been",Paragraph
awarded fourth place in the competition. At once he began,Paragraph
to rework the design after an arched brick syntax that he,Paragraph
"had developed in the interim, first in a villa built at",Paragraph
"Groningen in 1894, and then in an office building erected in",Paragraph
"The Hague in the following year. These crenellated, Neo-",Paragraph
"Romanesque brick structures, influenced without doubt by",Paragraph
"Richardson’s work in the United States, were vehicles for an",Paragraph
"architecture of explicit construction, a fact that was most",Paragraph
evident in the brick-vaulted stair complex of the office,Caption
building. Yet for all the profundity of these early essays,Paragraph
(reminiscent in their structural probity of the rigour of de,Paragraph
Baudot) the final formulation of the Berlage idiom was to,Paragraph
depend on the realization of the Exchange.,Paragraph
"The four versions of the Exchange [51, 52] that followed",Paragraph
the initial project represent different stages in an arduous,Paragraph
process of simplification. In this development Berlage seems,Paragraph
"to have been guided by a complex of theoretical ideas,",Paragraph
"some drawn from Viollet-le-Duc, some from Semper and",Paragraph
"some from his colleague Jan Hessel de Groot, who was the",Paragraph
originator of the Amsterdam school of mathematical,Paragraph
"aesthetics. After the Exchange was opened in 1903, Berlage",Paragraph
began to publish his own synthesis of these ideas in a series,Paragraph
"of theoretical studies, first in his Gedanken uber den Stil in",Paragraph
der Baukunst (‘Thoughts on Style in Architecture’) of 1905,Paragraph
and then in his Grundlagen und Entwicklung der Architektur,Paragraph
(‘Principles and Evolution of Architecture’) of 1908. As,Paragraph
"Reyner Banham has observed, the salient principles",Paragraph
"stressed in these writings were ‘the primacy of space, the",Paragraph
importance of walls as creators of form and the need for,Paragraph
systematic proportion’. The distillation of the Exchange into,Paragraph
its final form takes on a richer significance once we become,Paragraph
"aware of Berlage’s views on the essential role of masonry,",Paragraph
as first set forth in these texts. ‘Before all else the wall must,Paragraph
be shown naked in all its sleek beauty and anything fixed on,Paragraph
"it must be shunned as an embarrassment.’ Or again, ‘The",Paragraph
"art of the master builder lies in this, in the creation of space,",Paragraph
not the sketching of facades. A spatial envelope is,Paragraph
"established by means of walls, whereby a space ... is",Paragraph
manifested according to the complexity of the walling.’,Paragraph
"51, 52 Berlage, Exchange, Amsterdam. Above, second design, 1896-97; be/ow,",Caption
"as built, 1897-1903.",Paragraph
"In his gradual refinement of the Exchange, Berlage",Paragraph
largely retained the original plan of three top-lit rectangular,Paragraph
"volumes, one for each exchange, housed in an orthogonal",Paragraph
matrix of four-storey perimeter walls. The progressive aim,Paragraph
was to simplify this parti and its structure into an extremely,Paragraph
"astringent form, and to this end he gradually reduced the",Paragraph
number of gables and turrets and slowly eliminated all,Paragraph
lanterns and every trace of banded stonework. At one stage,Paragraph
the scheme vaguely resembled Gustav Gull’s,Paragraph
"Landesmuseum, then nearing completion in Zurich, while at",Paragraph
the penultimate stage the reduced forms attained their final,Paragraph
definition through the superimposition of a diagonal lattice,Paragraph
derived from De Groot. After this all subsequent changes,Paragraph
were largely confined to the design of the main entrance,Paragraph
"and its adjacent tower, which were conceived by Berlage as",Paragraph
the prime representative elements of both the institution,Paragraph
and the city.,Paragraph
The load-bearing brick structure of Berlage’s Exchange,Caption
was precisely articulated in accordance with the principles,Paragraph
"of Structural Rationalism. Inside, a mosaic frieze or a",Paragraph
filigreed lamp are but inflections within large brick volumes,Paragraph
"where granite abutments, quoins, corbels and cappings",Paragraph
consistently mark the points of structural transference and,Paragraph
bearing [53]. The same dressed stones which in one,Paragraph
instance are corbelled out to receive a steel truss in another,Paragraph
articulate the keying of an arch. In this way the ethos and,Paragraph
the logic of Viollet-le-Duc pervade the entire fabric as in no,Paragraph
other structure of the 19th century.,Paragraph
"53 Berlage, Exchange, Amsterdam, 1897-1903. Main hall.",Caption
To this achievement the philosophical tenor of Berlage’s,Paragraph
thought added dimensions which went beyond any single,Paragraph
"structure, first into the immediate urban context and then,",Paragraph
"by extension, into the body politic at large. His model for an",Paragraph
ideal urban society was first outlined in a set of essays,Paragraph
"published in 1910, of which one in particular, Kunst en",Paragraph
"Maatschappij (‘Art and Society’), most clearly reveals the",Paragraph
depth of his socio-political commitment. While socialism for,Paragraph
"Berlage was a prime article of faith, he nonetheless",Paragraph
subscribed to Hermann Muthesius’s view that the general,Paragraph
level of a culture could only be raised through the,Paragraph
"production of high-quality, well-designed objects. On the",Paragraph
"other hand, he remained convinced as to the supreme",Paragraph
"cultural importance of the city, and deplored the",Paragraph
disurbanizing tendency of the English garden city.,Paragraph
In 1901 Berlage was given an opportunity to put his,Paragraph
"urban theory into practice, when the city of Amsterdam",Paragraph
commissioned him to prepare a plan for Amsterdam South.,Paragraph
"For Berlage the street was essentially an outdoor room, the",Paragraph
necessary consequence of the housing lining its length. This,Paragraph
"insistence on enclosure, prefigured in the medieval city, had",Paragraph
already been postulated by Berlage in his design for the,Paragraph
Exchange. After Alphand and the theories of the German,Paragraph
"planner StUbben, the qualities of the street spaces in",Paragraph
Amsterdam South vary according to their width and,Paragraph
furnishing. The wider streets were furnished with parterres,Paragraph
and flanking avenues of trees; the narrower ones were,Paragraph
simply lined with trees and paving. At the major,Paragraph
intersections centralized spaces were created somewhat,Paragraph
after the principles of Stubben and Camillo Sitte (see p. 29).,Paragraph
The whole was fed by a modern system of mass transit in,Paragraph
the form of the electric tram.,Paragraph
In 1915 Berlage totally revised his plan [54] to,Paragraph
"incorporate avenues of Haussmann-like scale, two of which,",Paragraph
"converging at a sector known as Amstellaan, were",Paragraph
completed with their environs in the early 1920s. Their,Paragraph
"realization, which unequivocally demonstrated Berlage’s",Paragraph
concern for the physical continuity of the urban,Paragraph
"environment, eventually brought him into conflict with the",Paragraph
anti-street polemic of the Congrés Internationaux,Title
"d’Architecture Moderne (CIAM), founded in 1928. Yet today",Paragraph
the value of his urban achievement seems to be more,Paragraph
"pertinent than ever, for as Giorgio Grassi has written of",Paragraph
Amstellaan:,Title
"54 Berlage, revised development plan for Amsterdam South, 1917.",Caption
"it is still the key point on the outskirts of Amsterdam, the",Paragraph
point where one finds expressed most clearly the concept of,Paragraph
"collective living, where the civic value of single parts blends",Paragraph
into a unified vision that - being less concerned with the,Paragraph
"optimum dwellings of certain rationalist experiments - has,",Paragraph
"in its nuclear concept of housing, well expressed the values",Paragraph
of the city. And it has recognized not only the physical need,Paragraph
"of the dwellers for recreation and rest, but their impulse to",Paragraph

Throughout Mackintosh’s unique and highly influential,Paragraph
"development, Lethaby’s Architecture, Mysticism and Myth of",Paragraph

"architectural symbolism but also because, coming from",Paragraph
"Lethaby’s hand, it formed a bridge between the other-",Paragraph
worldliness of Celtic mysticism and the more pragmatic Arts,Title
and Crafts approach to the creation of form. With regard to,Paragraph
"this last, Mackintosh took the traditionalist Ruskinian line",Paragraph
"and argued that modern materials, such as iron and glass,",Paragraph
‘will never worthily take the place of stone because of this,Paragraph
"defect, the want of mass’.",Paragraph
There was to be no want of mass in the Glasgow School,Paragraph

every effort to incorporate ingenious and up-to-date,Paragraph
"systems for environmental control, such as the system of",Paragraph
"ducted heating and ventilation, built into the school from",Paragraph
the beginning.,Paragraph
"Following the Gothic Revival tradition, Mackintosh",Paragraph
designed the main body of the school as a loose-fitting,Paragraph
"envelope, with the bulk of the studio space being stacked on",Paragraph

"storeys throughout the length of the main facade, was",Paragraph
complemented by ancillary elements (such as the library,Paragraph

"The result was an E plan-form [55], with an eccentrically",Paragraph
"counterbalanced main elevation, in which subtle",Paragraph
displacements in both the main entrance and the forecourt,Paragraph
railings simultaneously engendered symmetrical and,Paragraph

This west facade as finally completed represented,Paragraph
Mackintosh at the height of his power. In no other work was,Paragraph

attempt to fuse the ornamental with the gauche was often,Paragraph
"far from successful, and the houses appear somewhat",Paragraph
chaotic and unresolved when compared to the magnificent,Paragraph
and highly influential ‘Haus eines Kunst-freundes’ (‘House,Paragraph
"for an Art-lover’), which Mackintosh designed as his entry to",Paragraph
the limited competition organized in Darmstadt by,Paragraph
Alexander Koch in 1901.,Paragraph
"57 Mackintosh, Hill House, Helensburgh, 1902-03.",Caption
The unrealized ‘House for an Art-lover’ and the Glasgow,Paragraph
School of Art represent Mackintosh’s essential contribution,Paragraph
to the mainstream of 20th-century architecture. In the,Paragraph
house he created a work which passed well beyond the,Paragraph
constraints of the traditional Voysey model to display a,Paragraph
formal plasticity of almost Cubist affinity. The organization of,Paragraph
the house around a number of countervailing axes and its,Paragraph
division into two major longitudinal masses that appear to,Paragraph
be on the point of sliding past each other resulted in a tense,Paragraph
"but consolidated composition, and the enrichment of its",Paragraph
otherwise plain surface with precisely proportioned windows,Paragraph
and occasional accents of embossed ornament suggests at,Paragraph
once the strong influence it must have exercised over Josef,Paragraph
"Hoffmann, in particular on his design for the Palais Stoclet,",Paragraph

further from the yeoman rusticity of the winning design by,Paragraph
Baillie Scott.,Paragraph
It is ironic that Mackintosh should have begun and ended,Paragraph
his career as an independent architect with the Glasgow,Paragraph
"School of Art, the effective years of his practice being from",Paragraph
1897 to 1909. In 1914 the Mackintoshes moved from,Paragraph
"Scotland to England, where Mackintosh, suddenly and",Paragraph
"somewhat inexplicably discouraged as an architect, turned",Paragraph
"to painting. In 1916, however, he made a brief comeback",Paragraph
with the brilliant remodelling of a small terrace house for,Paragraph
"W.J. Bassett-Lowke, No. 78 Derngate in Northampton. The",Caption
"rich, abstract interiors are equal to any Continental work of",Paragraph
comparable date. The plain geometrical bedroom furniture,Paragraph
and the striped graphic décor bonding the twin beds,Paragraph
"together were well in advance of their time, inasmuch as",Paragraph
they anticipated the spatial and plastic devices to be,Paragraph
employed by the Continental avant garde after the First,Paragraph

independently for some fifteen years before receiving his,Paragraph

"did not bring him wide acclaim, so that when in 1886 he",Paragraph
built his own Italianate version of the Rosenhaus at,Paragraph

"established. Four years later, however, he had not only",Paragraph
arrived artistically but had achieved some worldly success,Paragraph
with the building of a small but lavish town house in Vienna,Paragraph

Wagner's influence as a teacher dates from his,Paragraph

the school of architecture in the Academy of Fine Arts in,Paragraph
"Vienna. In 1896, at the age of fifty-four, he published his",Paragraph
"first theoretical work, Moderne Architektur. This was",Paragraph
followed in 1898 by the first publication of the work of his,Paragraph
"students, given under the title Aus der Wagnerschule.",Paragraph
Having been formed in Berlin by one of Schinkel’s prime,Paragraph
"pupils, Wagner’s architectural affinities at this time seem to",Paragraph
have lain somewhere between the rationalism of the,Paragraph
Schinkelschuler and the more rhetorical manner of those,Paragraph
"last great architects of the Ringstrasse, Gottfried Semper",Caption
"and Karl von Hasenauer, whose State Museums,",Paragraph
Burgtheater and Neue Hofburg were under construction in,Paragraph
the Ring throughout the last quarter of the century.,Paragraph
Wagner's polytechnical education had left him acutely,Paragraph
aware of the technical and social realities of his epoch. At,Paragraph
"the same time, his romantic imagination was drawn towards",Paragraph
the radical stirrings of his more talented pupils - to the anti-,Paragraph
academic art movement co-founded by his assistant Joseph,Paragraph
"Maria Olbrich and by his most brilliant pupil, Josef Hoffmann,",Paragraph
who had graduated with a Prix de Rome in 1895. These men,Paragraph
"were not only influenced by the work of the Glasgow Four,",Paragraph
"then being illustrated in The Studio, but were also under the",Paragraph
"spell of the exotic vision of two young Viennese painters,",Paragraph
Gustav Klimt and Koloman Moser. Under the leadership of,Paragraph
"Klimt, Olbrich, Hoffmann and Moser banded together in their",Paragraph
"revolt against the Academy and in 1897, with Wagner’s",Paragraph
"blessing, they founded the Vienna Secession. In the",Paragraph
following year Wagner declared his own sympathies for the,Paragraph
Secession through the creation of a florid abstraction in,Paragraph
faience for the facade of his pseudo-ltalianate Majolica,Caption
"House in Linke Wienzeile, and in 1899 he scandalized the",Paragraph
establishment by becoming a full member of the Secession.,Paragraph
"In 1898 Olbrich built the Secession building [58],",Paragraph
"apparently after a sketch by Klimt, who was to remain the",Paragraph
prime mover of the revolt. From Klimt came the battered,Paragraph
"walls, the axiality and especially the laurel motif - with its",Paragraph
dedication to Apollo - the last being rendered by Olbrich as,Paragraph
"a perforated metal dome, suspended between four short",Caption
pylons and set above planar masses whose severe,Paragraph
modelling recalls the work of such British architects as,Paragraph
Voysey and Charles Harrison Townsend. A comparable,Paragraph
symbol of organic vitality occurred on the cover of the first,Paragraph
issue of Ver Sacrum - an ornamental shrub whose vital roots,Paragraph
were depicted bursting through its tub into the earth,Paragraph
"beneath. Such was Olbrich’s symbolic point of departure, a",Paragraph
"conscious return to the fertility of the unconscious, from",Paragraph
"which, ever subject to the influence of Voysey and",Paragraph
"Mackintosh and the claims of Klimt’s pan-eroticism, he",Paragraph
began to evolve a style of his own.,Paragraph
"58 Olbrich, Secession building, Vienna, 1898.",Caption
"This evolution took place largely in Darmstadt, where",Paragraph
Olbrich had been invited by the Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig in,Paragraph
"1899. Later in that year he was joined by six other artists,",Paragraph
"the sculptors Ludwig Habich and Rudolf Bosselt, the painters",Paragraph
"Peter Behrens, Paul BUrck and Hans Christiansen, and the",Paragraph
"architect Patriz Huber. Two years later, this artists’ colony",Paragraph
"exhibited its life style and ‘habitat’ as a total work of art,",Paragraph
under the title ‘Ein Dokument deutscher Kunst’. The,Paragraph
exhibition was opened in May 1901 by a mystical ceremony,Paragraph
"called ‘Das Zeichen’ (‘The Sign’), which took place on the",Paragraph
steps of Olbrich’s Ernst Ludwig House. In this ceremony an,Paragraph
‘unknown’ prophet descended from the golden portal of the,Paragraph
"building to receive a crystalline form, as a symbol of base",Paragraph
"material transformed into art, just as carbon may be",Paragraph
changed into the brilliance of a diamond.,Paragraph
"The Ernst Ludwig House [60], built in 1901, was",Paragraph
undoubtedly the most progressive work that Olbrich,Paragraph
designed during his nine-year residence in Darmstadt.,Paragraph
"Consisting of eight studio living spaces, four on each side of",Paragraph
"a common meeting hall, it was in effect the colony’s initial",Paragraph
"focus, around which a number of individual artists’ houses",Paragraph
"were eventually built. With its high, blank, horizontally",Paragraph
"fenestrated facade, shielding north lights to the rear, and its",Paragraph
"ornate, recessed circular entrance flanked by giant statues",Caption
"carved by Habich, it was the ultimate monumentalization of",Paragraph
themes that Olbrich had broached in the Secession building.,Paragraph
Between this early masterpiece and the final,Paragraph
‘classicization’ of his style in 1908 - the year of his,Paragraph
premature death - Olbrich continued his search for a,Paragraph
uniquely expressive mode. Throughout the last decade of,Paragraph
"his life he created works of exceptional originality,",Paragraph
culminating in his cryptic and brooding Hochzeitsturm or,Paragraph
"Wedding Tower, which, with the adjacent exhibition",Paragraph
"buildings [59], was completed on the MathildenhGhe in",Paragraph
Darmstadt for the Hessische Landesausstellung of 1908.,Paragraph
"With its pyramidal composition the Mathildenhéhe complex,",Paragraph
"built on top of a reservoir, was in effect a ‘city crown’ whose",Paragraph
form anticipated the symbolic centre of Bruno Taut’s,Paragraph
‘Stadtkrone’ of 1919. Girded by a series of tiered concrete,Caption
"pergolas, it was drawn by Olbrich as a mountainous",Paragraph
"labyrinth of dense foliage, whose colour would change with",Paragraph
the seasons from green to russet brown. Rising from the,Paragraph
"high ground like a mystical mountain, it consciously",Paragraph
opposed the Edenic serenity of the formal plane-tree,Paragraph
"garden, or Platanenhain, on which it fronted.",Paragraph
"59 Olbrich, Hochzeitsturm and exhibition buildings, Darmstadt, 1908.",Caption
"60 Olbrich, Ernst Ludwig House, Darmstadt. ‘Das Zeichen’, May 1901.",Caption
Over the whole of Olbrich’s career there stood the,Paragraph
"challenging figure of Peter Behrens, initially a graphist and",Paragraph
"painter, who had come to Darmstadt from the Munich",Paragraph
Secession in 1899. He emerged as an architect and a,Paragraph
designer with the building and furnishing of his own house,Paragraph
at Darmstadt in 1901. In their rivalry as Gesamtkunstler to,Paragraph
the house of Hesse-Darmstadt it was Olbrich rather than,Paragraph
"Behrens who was to be the brilliant designer of objects,",Paragraph
"while in their careers outside Darmstadt, as architects, it",Paragraph
was Behrens who became the more powerful creator of,Paragraph
form. Above all it was he who anticipated their common,Paragraph
return to the kind of crypto-Classicism that characterizes,Paragraph
"the work of Olbrich’s final years, his Tietz department store",Paragraph
in Dusseldorf and the mansion that he built for the cigar,Paragraph
"manufacturer Feinhals in Cologne, both completed in 1908.",Paragraph
In 1899 Josef Hoffmann began to teach at the applied art,Paragraph
school attached to the Austrian Museum for Art and Industry,Paragraph
"in Vienna (which had been founded, in accordance with",Paragraph
"Semper’s educational programme, some thirty-five years",Paragraph
"before). A year later, he replaced Olbrich as the designer of",Paragraph
"the élite Hohe Warte suburb on the outskirts of Vienna,",Paragraph
building four villas there between 1901 and 1905. He had,Paragraph
"succeeded Olbrich as the leading architect to the Secession,",Paragraph
"and his first work on this site, designed in the manner of",Paragraph
"English Free Architecture, was for Koloman Moser. By 1902,",Paragraph
"however, Hoffmann was already beginning to move towards",Paragraph
"a more planar and Classical mode of expression, based",Paragraph
"largely on the post-1898 work of Otto Wagner, that is",Paragraph
towards a handling of mass and surface which was far,Paragraph
"removed from the British preoccupation with medieval,",Paragraph
yeoman form.,Paragraph
"By the time of the Vienna Secession Exhibition of 1900,",Paragraph
at which Mackintosh’s actual work was shown in Austria for,Paragraph
"the first time, Hoffmann had already arrived at a furnishing",Paragraph
style of refined rectilinear form. This was his initial move,Paragraph
away from the obsessive curvilinearity of his ‘Apollo’ shop in,Paragraph
Vienna of the previous year. By 1901 he was preoccupied,Paragraph
with the possibilities for abstract form in design. ‘| am,Paragraph
"particularly interested in the square as such,’ he wrote, ‘and",Paragraph
"in the use of black and white as dominant colours, because",Paragraph
these clear elements have never appeared in earlier styles.’,Paragraph
"Together with Moser and other Secessionists, he became",Paragraph
interested in the craft production of decorative and applied,Paragraph
"art objects, along the lines of Ashbee’s Guild of Handicraft.",Paragraph
"By 1902, with his setting for Klinger’s Beethoven statue,",Paragraph
"exhibited in the Secession Building, he had arrived at his",Paragraph
"own abstract style, in which certain contours or proportions",Paragraph
are emphasized through the use of projecting beads and,Paragraph
"clusters of small squares. A year later, in 1903, with the",Paragraph
"backing of Fritz Warndorfer, the Hoffmann/Moser Wiener",Paragraph
"Werkstatte was started for the design, production and",Paragraph
marketing of high-quality domestic objects. This,Paragraph
organization and its output had achieved world fame by the,Paragraph
time of its precipitate and inexplicable closure by Hoffmann,Paragraph
in 1933.,Paragraph
The last issue of Ver Sacrum was published in 1903: with,Paragraph
its demise the high period of the Secession was over. In,Paragraph
"1904, Hoffmann and Josef August Lux started to edit a new",Paragraph
"periodical, entitled Hohe Warte, named after the garden",Paragraph
suburb. From the outset it was dedicated to the propagation,Paragraph
"of ‘back to nature’ garden city values, and later, in less",Paragraph
"liberal times, it became the garden city platform of the",Paragraph
"Austrian National Socialist movement. Unlike Hoffmann, Lux",Paragraph
was quick to react against its chauvinistic exaggeration of,Paragraph
"folklorish values, resigning his editorship in protest against",Paragraph
its Heimatstil policy as early as 1908.,Paragraph
By 1903 Hoffmann had moved closer to the style of his,Paragraph
"master Wagner, particularly in the design of the Classical",Paragraph
"and austere Purkersdorf Sanatorium, which was to have",Paragraph
such an influence on Le Corbusier’s early development. In,Paragraph
"1905 Hoffmann began to work on his masterpiece, the",Paragraph
"Palais Stoclet, built in Brussels between 1905 and 1910 [61,",Caption
"62]. As in Perret’s Théatre des Champs-Elysées, its reduced",Paragraph
Classical decoration paid veiled homage to the Symbolist,Paragraph
"aesthetic of the Belle Epoque. But, unlike Perret’s theatre,",Paragraph
the Palais Stoclet is (as Eduard Sekler has observed),Paragraph
essentially atectonic: its thin white marble facing with its,Paragraph
metal seams has all the mannered and handcrafted,Paragraph
elegance of a Wiener Werkstatte object on a large scale. Of,Paragraph
its conscious denial of structure and mass Sekler wrote:,Paragraph
"61, 62 Hoffmann, Palais Stoclet, Brussels, 1905-10.",Caption
A strongly linear element is introduced by these articulated,Paragraph
"metal bands but it has nothing to do with ‘lines of force’, the",Paragraph
way linear elements did in the architecture of Victor Horta.,Paragraph
"At the Stoclet house, we have fines which occur equally",Paragraph
along horizontal and vertical edges - they are tectonically,Paragraph
neutral. At the corners ... where two or more of these,Paragraph
"parallel mouldings come together, the effect tends towards",Paragraph
a negation of the solidity of the built volumes. A feeling,Paragraph
persists as if the walls had not been built in a heavy,Paragraph
"construction but consisted of large sheets of thin material,",Paragraph
joined at the corners with metal bands to protect the,Paragraph
edges.2,Paragraph
"These bands, which issue from the apex of the stair",Paragraph
"tower, where four male figures support a Secessionist dome",Paragraph
"of laurels, are vaguely reminiscent of Wagner’s stylized",Paragraph
"cable mouldings, and serve as they cascade down over the",Paragraph
corners to unite the whole building through the continuity of,Paragraph
the seam.,Paragraph
"Wagner’s mature style dates from his sixtieth year, with",Paragraph
the completion of his Vienna Stadtbahn network in 1901.,Paragraph
Not a trace of his Italianate manner remains in his Die Zeit,Paragraph
"telegraph office of 1902, or in his Kaiserbad Dam Works of",Paragraph
"1906, both of which seem to relate in their engineered",Paragraph
elegance and punctilious revetment to the atectonic style of,Paragraph
Hoffmann. Yet the dematerialization of the Palais Stoclet,Paragraph
seems to have been anticipated by Wagner’s own,Paragraph
"masterwork, his Imperial Post Office Savings Bank built in",Paragraph
"Vienna in 1904 [63]. Wagner, unlike his Secessionist pupils,",Paragraph
always built for the reality of the present rather than for,Paragraph
some remote Symbolist utopia that looked towards the,Paragraph
aesthetic redemption of man. Thus his ‘Grosstadt’ plan of,Paragraph
"1910, with its hierarchy of neighbourhood units, was",Paragraph
projected as a rationally planned and realizable,Paragraph
metropolitan future. In all his public work Wagner built with,Paragraph
great technical precision for a bureaucratic state which he,Paragraph
could only regard as lasting indefinitely. Crowned by an,Paragraph
honorific pergola hung with laurel wreaths and flanked by,Paragraph
"winged Victories whose arms are raised skywards, the Post",Paragraph
Office Savings Bank represented the republican,Title
benevolence of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the height,Paragraph
of its power.,Paragraph
"63 Wagner, Post Office Savings Bank, Vienna, 1904. Detail of facade.",Caption
"Like the Palais Stoclet, the Post Office Savings Bank",Paragraph
"resembles a gargantuan metal box, an effect due in no",Paragraph
small measure to the thin polished sheets of white Sterzing,Paragraph
marble that are anchored to its facade with aluminium,Paragraph
"rivets. Its glazed canopy frame, entrance doors, balustrade",Caption
"and parapet rail are also of aluminium, as are the metal",Paragraph
"furnishings of the banking hall itself [64]. Faced in ceramic,",Caption
lit from above and resting in its turn on a suspended,Paragraph
"concrete floor, studded with glass lenses for the illumination",Caption
"of the basement, this hall existed until recently in its original",Paragraph
"form. Its unadorned, riveted steelwork was formally related",Paragraph
to the industrial lighting standards and the aluminium,Title
heating cowls which flanked its perimeter. As Stanford,Paragraph
"Anderson has observed,",Paragraph

The details of an engineered building are not placed before,Paragraph
us in the sachlich manner of nineteenth-century exhibition,Paragraph
halls or railway sheds; the concept of an engineered,Paragraph
building is revealed to us instead through the building’s own,Paragraph
"modernist symbols of exposed industrial materials, structure",Paragraph
and equipment.?,Paragraph
By 1911 the ‘classicization’ of the Secession was,Paragraph
"complete, and for all his continuing interest in the evolution",Paragraph
"of an appropriate Hejmatstil, Hoffmann represented Austria",Paragraph
at the Rome International Art Exhibition of that year with a,Paragraph
pavilion design whose atectonic Classicism anticipated the,Paragraph
rhetorical monumentality of Mussolini's New Rome. Equally,Paragraph
prophetic was Behrens’s representation of Prussia in St,Paragraph
Petersburg with an embassy whose solemnity would point,Paragraph
towards the official rhetoric of the Third Reich. In such a,Paragraph
climate it fell to Wagner to close the Secession as it had,Paragraph
"begun, with the vigour of his extremely austere yet",Paragraph
"elegantly proportioned second villa, built in HUtteldorf in",Caption

Futurism had proclaimed itself as being fundamentally,Paragraph

could hardly have excluded architecture.,Paragraph
"In 1910, with the crucial contribution of the artist",Paragraph
"Umberto Boccioni, Futurism began to extend its ‘anti-",Paragraph

"produced two Futurist manifestos on painting in that year,",Paragraph
and they were followed in April 1912 by his Manifesto,Paragraph
tecnico della scultura futurista (Technical Manifesto of,Paragraph

"with just as much pertinence, to the post-1904 work of",Paragraph
Secessionist architects such as Joseph Olbrich and Alfred,Paragraph
Messel - the former for his Tietz department store in,Paragraph
Dusseldorf and the latter for his Wertheim store in Berlin.,Paragraph
Boccioni wrote: ‘We find in Germanic countries a ridiculous,Paragraph
obsession with a Hellenized Gothic style that is,Paragraph
industrialized in Berlin and enervated in Munich.’ By the,Paragraph
same token Boccioni’s positive concern to extend the field,Paragraph
of the sculptural object to incorporate its immediate milieu,Paragraph
had connotations which were intrinsically architectural. This,Paragraph
he made explicit as a converse principle in his preface to,Paragraph
the catalogue of the first exhibition of Futurist sculpture in,Paragraph
1913: ‘The search for naturalistic form removes sculpture,Title
(and painting also) from both its origins and its ultimate,Paragraph
end: architecture.’,Paragraph
"In his concern for a non-naturalistic expression, Boccioni",Paragraph
developed a plastic aesthetic that was entirely removed,Paragraph
from the concerns of the 1896 Secession. Again in his,Paragraph
catalogue preface of 1913 he wrote:,Paragraph
"In sculpture, therefore, we are not necessarily looking for",Paragraph
"pure form, but for pure plastic rhythm, not the construction",Paragraph
"of an object, but the construction of an object’s action. We",Paragraph
have abolished pyramidal architecture to arrive at spiral,Paragraph
architecture ...,Paragraph
"We must, therefore, raise the concept of the object to",Paragraph
that of a plastic whole: object + environment. In this way we,Paragraph
shall have the object extended into the rays of light which,Paragraph
"shine on to it, by uniting atmospherical blocks with",Paragraph
elements of a more concrete reality.‘,Paragraph
"To achieve this sculptural simultaneity, Boccioni had",Paragraph
"already recommended, in his sculpture manifesto of 1912,",Paragraph
that sculptors henceforth exclude the nude and exalted,Paragraph
subject matter and the use of honorific materials such as,Paragraph
marble or bronze in favour of heterogeneous media:,Paragraph
"‘Transparent planes of glass or celluloid, strips of metal,",Paragraph
"wire, interior or exterior electric lights can indicate the",Paragraph
"planes, the tendencies, the tones and half tones of a new",Paragraph
"reality.” Paradoxically, this concept of a spirally structured,",Paragraph
"non-monumental, mixed-media object to be extended into",Paragraph
the immediate environment was to have more influence on,Paragraph
Russian Post-Revolutionary ‘Cubo-Futurist’ Constructivism,Title
than on the evolution of Futurist architecture.,Paragraph
"Nevertheless, Boccioni’s sculpture manifesto of 1912 and",Paragraph
Marinetti’s La Solendeur Géométrique et Mécanique,Title
(Geometric and Mechanical Splendour and the Numerical,Title
Sensibility) of 1914 jointly gave the intellectual and,Paragraph
aesthetic frame of reference within which a Futurist,Paragraph
architecture could be postulated. Marinetti wrote: ‘Nothing,Paragraph
in the world is more beautiful than a great humming power-,Paragraph
"station, holding back the hydraulic pressures of a whole",Paragraph
"mountain range, and the electric power for a whole",Paragraph
"landscape, synthesized in control panels bristling with levers",Paragraph
and gleaming commutators.’ This pristine vision of,Paragraph
mechanical splendour was fittingly paralleled by the young,Paragraph
Italian architect Antonio Sant’Elia’s power-station designs of,Paragraph
the same date.,Paragraph
Prior to 1912 Sant’Elia was still relatively isolated from,Paragraph
"the Futurists, and involved with the Italian Secessionist",Paragraph
movement. This so-called ‘Stile Floreale’ was to enjoy an,Paragraph
"extensive, if brief, national popularity after the resounding",Paragraph
success of Raimondo D’Aronco’s flamboyant pavilion for the,Paragraph
Exhibition of Decorative Arts held in Turin in 1902.,Paragraph
"Thereafter, in Udine, D’Aronco continued to follow the lead",Paragraph
"of Olbrich, while the Milanese architects of the ‘Stile",Paragraph
Floreale’ attempted to integrate their taste for the Neo-,Paragraph
Baroque with motifs drawn from the Wagnerschule. In Milan,Paragraph
this impulse found its most powerful synthesis in the works,Paragraph
"of Giuseppe Sommaruga, who seems to have exercised a",Paragraph
particular influence over Sant’Elia’s early development.,Paragraph
Many of the characteristic elements of Sant’Elia’s,Paragraph
dinamismo architettonico were surely anticipated in,Paragraph

The official Manifesto dell’architettura futurista,Title
"(Manifesto of Futurist Architecture), published in July 1914,",Paragraph
seems to have had as its prime goal the public recognition,Paragraph
of Sant’Elia as a Futurist. It amounted to a new version of,Paragraph
"the Messaggio, edited, to all appearances, by Marinetti and",Paragraph
signed by Sant’Elia alone. Apart from the interjection of the,Caption
"word ‘Futurist’ on every possible occasion, this text added",Paragraph
little to the original save a number of militant propositions,Paragraph
"at the end, including the contradictory opposition to any",Paragraph
"kind of permanence, the assertion that ‘our houses will last",Paragraph
less time than we do and that every generation will have to,Paragraph
make its own’.,Paragraph
By now Sant’Elia was fully involved in Futurism and in,Paragraph

military career that ended with his front-line death in 1916.,Paragraph
With the loss of Boccioni two months before (in a riding,Paragraph
accident) the generative period of Futurism was brought to,Paragraph
"an abrupt end, ironically divested of its major talent in part",Paragraph
"by the first industrialized war. Out of this Futurist holocaust,",Paragraph
"Marinetti survived to remind his fellow Futurists, such as",Paragraph
"Balla, Carra, Severini and Russolo, of their duty to lead the",Paragraph
post-war generation towards the final fulfilment of Italian,Paragraph
nationalism in the triumph of a Fascist state.,Paragraph
"Typical of the confusion of Futurism in its decline, which",Paragraph
undoubtedly paralleled Mussolini’s rapprochement with the,Paragraph
"Vatican, was Marinetti’s 1931 Manifesto of Sacred Futurist",Paragraph
"Art, where he urged that church candlelight ‘must be",Paragraph
replaced by powerful electric bulbs of brilliant white and,Paragraph
"blue light’, that ‘for the representations of Hell, Futurist",Paragraph
painters must depend on their memories of shell-scarred,Paragraph
"battlefields’, and that ‘only Futurist artists ... can give form",Paragraph
"to interpenetrated space-time, to the super-rational",Paragraph

That this absurd bravado had been anticipated in the,Paragraph
initial manifesto (with its violence reminiscent of Georges,Paragraph
Sorel) does not entirely account for the state of decadence,Paragraph
to which Futurist ‘culture’ had descended by 1931. After,Paragraph
"1919 it was the revolutionary Russian Constructivists, and",Paragraph

"studies at the Dresden College of Technology, he left for the",Paragraph
United States in 1893 - apparently to visit the World’s,Paragraph
Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Although he seems not to,Paragraph
have found work as an architect during his three-year stay,Paragraph
"in the States, he nonetheless became familiar with the",Paragraph
pioneer achievements of the Chicago School and with the,Paragraph
"theoretical writings of Louis Sullivan, in particular with",Paragraph
"Sullivan’s essay Ornament in Architecture (1892), which",Paragraph
patently influenced his own essay Ornament und,Paragraph
"Verbrechen (Ornament and Crime), published sixteen years",Paragraph
later.,Paragraph
"After his return to Vienna in 1896, Loos began his career",Paragraph
by designing interiors and writing articles for the liberal,Paragraph
"Neue Freie Presse, on a wide variety of topics ranging from",Paragraph
clothes to architecture and from manners to music. In 1908,Paragraph
"he published Ornament and Crime, in which he elaborated",Paragraph
the nature of his quarrel with the artists of the Viennese,Paragraph
"Secession, an argument that he had already enjoined by",Paragraph
"1900 in the form of an anti-Gesamtkunstwerk fable, ‘The",Paragraph
Story of a Poor Rich Man’. There Loos portrayed the fate of a,Paragraph
wealthy businessman who had commissioned a Secessionist,Paragraph
"architect to design a ‘total’ house for him, including not only",Paragraph
the furnishings but also the clothes of the occupants:,Paragraph
Once it happened that he was celebrating his birthday. His,Paragraph
wife and children had given him many presents. He liked,Paragraph
their choice immensely and enjoyed it all thoroughly. But,Paragraph
"soon the architect arrived to set things right, and to take all",Paragraph
the decisions in difficult questions. He entered the room.,Paragraph
"The master greeted him with pleasure, for he had much on",Paragraph
his mind. But the architect did not see the man’s joy. He had,Paragraph
discovered something quite different and grew pale. ‘What,Paragraph
kind of slippers are these you've got on?’ he ejaculated,Paragraph
painfully. The master of the house looked at his embroidered,Paragraph
slippers. Then he breathed in relief This time he felt quite,Paragraph
guiltless. The slippers had been made to the architect's,Paragraph
original designs. So he answered in a superior way. ‘But Mr,Paragraph
Architect! Have you already forgotten? You yourself,Paragraph
"designed them!’ ‘Of course,’ thundered the architect, ‘but",Paragraph
for the bedroom! They completely disrupt the mood here,Paragraph
with these two impossible spots of colour. Can’t you see,Paragraph
that??,Paragraph
The Belgian artist Henry van de Velde is as much the,Paragraph
unidentified cultural martinet of this sardonic piece as,Paragraph
Joseph Maria Olbrich. For it was he and not Olbrich who,Paragraph
designed special clothes for his wife to harmonize with the,Paragraph
"lines of their house, built at Uccle in 1895 (see p. 105).",Paragraph
"Nonetheless, Olbrich remained the essential focus of Loos’s",Paragraph
anti-Secessionist attacks throughout the next decade: he,Paragraph
was even cited by name in Ornament and Crime as the,Paragraph
progenitor of illegitimate ornament. ‘Where will Olbrich’s,Paragraph
work be in ten years’ time?’ wrote Loos. ‘Modern ornament,Paragraph
"has no forebears and no descendants, no past and no",Paragraph
future. It is joyfully welcomed by uncultivated people to,Paragraph
"whom the true greatness of our time is a closed book, and",Paragraph
after a short time is rejected.’,Paragraph
Loos’s ultimate argument against ornament was not only,Paragraph
"that it was wasteful in labour and material, but that it",Paragraph
invariably entailed a punitive form of craft slavery that could,Paragraph
be justified only for those to whom the highest,Paragraph
achievements of bourgeois culture were inaccessible - for,Paragraph
those craftsmen who could find their aesthetic fulfilment,Paragraph
only in the spontaneous creation of ornament. Loos justified,Paragraph
the ornamentation of his bespoke footwear - which he would,Paragraph
have preferred to be plain - in the following terms: ‘We go to,Paragraph
Beethoven or Tristan after the cares of the day. My,Paragraph
shoemaker can’t. | must not take away his joy as | have,Paragraph
nothing to replace it with. But whoever goes to the Ninth,Paragraph
Symphony and then sits down to design a wallpaper is,Paragraph
either a rogue or a degenerate.’,Paragraph
Such challenging ethical and aesthetic pronouncements,Title
isolated Loos not only from the Secession and his,Paragraph
"conservative contemporaries, but also from his true",Paragraph
"successors, those latter-day ‘purists’ who even now have",Paragraph
yet to comprehend fully the profundity of his insights. By the,Paragraph
"time of his critical essay Architektur of 1910, Loos had",Paragraph
already begun to sense the full force of a modern,Paragraph
"predicament, which persists to this day. Given, as Loos",Paragraph
"argued, that the architect from the city was uprooted by",Paragraph
definition and hence categorically alienated from the innate,Paragraph
"agrarian (or alpine) vernacular of his distant forebears, then",Paragraph
it followed that he could not compensate for this loss by,Paragraph
pretending to inherit the aristocratic culture of Western,Paragraph
Classicism. For the urban bourgeoisie - whence he,Paragraph
"invariably came and whom he naturally served - were,",Paragraph
"whatever else they might be, patently not aristocrats. That",Paragraph
much was already clear to Loos in 1898 when he wrote in,Paragraph
"Die potemkinsche Stadt, his satire on the Ringstrasse:",Paragraph
"Whenever | stroll along the Ring, | always feel as if a modern",Paragraph
Potemkin had wanted to make somebody believe he had,Paragraph
been transported into a city of aristocrats. All that the Italian,Paragraph
Renaissance could produce in noble mansions had been,Paragraph
plundered in order to conjure up for her Highness the,Paragraph
common people a New Vienna which only people ina,Title
position to own an entire palace from the cellars to the,Paragraph
chimney-pots could inhabit. ... Viennese landlords were,Paragraph
delighted with the idea of owning a mansion and the,Paragraph
tenants were equally pleased to be able to live in one.?,Paragraph
"Loos’s solution to this dilemma, as posited in Architektur,",Paragraph
was to argue that most modern building tasks were,Paragraph
appropriate vehicles for bui/ding rather than architecture:,Paragraph
‘Only a very small part of architecture belongs to art: the,Paragraph
"tomb and the monument. Everything else, everything that",Paragraph
"serves a purpose, should be excluded from the realms of",Paragraph
art.’,Paragraph
At the same time Loos considered that all culture,Paragraph
"depended on a certain continuity with the past, above all,",Paragraph
on a consensus as to a typification. He could not accept the,Paragraph
romantic notion of the highly gifted individual transcending,Paragraph
the historical limits of his own epoch. Instead of self-,Paragraph
"conscious ornamental design, Loos favoured understated",Paragraph
"dress, anonymous furniture and efficient plumbing of the",Paragraph
Anglo-Saxon middle class. Naturally in this respect he had,Paragraph
America in mind rather than England. In this he anticipated,Paragraph
"Le Corbusier's notion of the objet-type, the refined,",Paragraph
"normative object, spontaneously produced by the craft-",Paragraph
"based industries of the society. To this end, objects of Anglo-",Paragraph
"Saxon affinity, such as clothing, sportswear and personal",Paragraph
"accessories, appeared as advertisements in Loos’s short-",Paragraph
"lived periodical Das Andere (‘The Other’) of 1903 [69],",Paragraph
which was significantly subtitled ‘A Journal for the,Paragraph
Introduction of Western Civilization into Austria’.,Paragraph
"Despite all his Anglophilia, the ‘vernacular’ of the English",Paragraph
Arts and Crafts movement (as documented in Hermann,Title
Muthesius’s book Das Englische Haus of 1904) presented,Paragraph
Loos with a problem: where was one to draw a line between,Paragraph
"such architecture, however sensible and convenient, and",Paragraph
"the self-conscious, craft-based, hermetic fantasies of the",Paragraph
Secession? Since for Loos the last Western architect of,Paragraph
"stature had been Schinkel, his self-imposed predicament",Paragraph
seems to have been how to combine the informal comfort of,Paragraph
the Anglo-Saxon interior with the asperities of Classical,Paragraph
form.,Paragraph
"Until 1910, Loos’s practice was largely confined to the",Paragraph
conversion of existing interiors. His best works of this period,Paragraph
were the luxury shops that he designed in Vienna around,Paragraph
"the turn of the century, and his famous Karntner or",Paragraph
"American Bar of 1907. Externally these works, designed for",Caption
"the purveyors of Anglocentric civilization, were finished in",Paragraph
"elegant, unobtrusive materials, while internally the style",Paragraph
varied from the Japanese ambience of his first interior for,Paragraph
Goldman & Salatsch [68] in the Graben (1898) to the,Paragraph
classicized club-room elegance of the Karntner Bar.,Paragraph

"11). The original caption read: ‘Brooding about art, the most modern man walks",Paragraph
through the streets. Suddenly he stops transfixed. He has found that for which,Paragraph
he has searched so long.’,Paragraph
"69 Cover of Das Andere, edited by Loos, Vienna, 1903.",Caption
In Loos’s domestic interiors the expression was even,Paragraph
"more eclectic, reflecting the fundamental split in his work",Paragraph
between a comfortable rusticity on the one hand and a,Paragraph
severe monumentality on the other. He invariably panelled,Paragraph
his walls up to dado or picture-rail level in polished stone or,Paragraph
wood; above this they were either left blank or topped with,Paragraph
an ornamental pattern or Classical frieze in plaster. (In,Paragraph
"Ornament and Crime, Loos had admitted the eclectic",Paragraph
"appropriation of archaeological ornament, while",Paragraph
categorically excluding the invention of modern decoration.),Paragraph
"Ceilings, where public, were often blank; where private, they",Paragraph
"were coffered in wood or metal. On other occasions,",Paragraph
"particularly in dining spaces, they might be relieved by",Paragraph
"Richardsonian timber beams, which were often of grotesque",Paragraph
"proportions, as in the Steiner House in Vienna of 1910 [70,",Paragraph
71]. Floors were generally of stone of parquet and always,Paragraph
"covered with oriental carpets, while fireplace surrounds,",Paragraph
"frequently of brick, stood out in textured contrast to the",Paragraph
"highlights invariably provided by vitrines, mirrors, lamps and",Paragraph
sundry metalware. As far as possible furniture was always,Paragraph
"built in. Otherwise it was selected by the client, although",Paragraph
"where it was movable and the building public, Loos",Paragraph
"restricted himself to standard Thonet bentwood furniture, as",Paragraph
in his somewhat Wagner-like Café Museum of 1899. In his,Paragraph
essay on the abolition of furniture he wrote: ‘The walls of a,Paragraph
building belong to the architect. There he rules at will. And,Paragraph
as with walls so with any furniture that is not movable.’ Of,Paragraph
"movable pieces he wrote: ‘The wrought-iron bedstead, table",Paragraph
"and chairs, hassocks and occasional chairs, desks and",Paragraph
smoking stands - all items made by our craftsmen in the,Paragraph
modern idiom (never by architects); everyone may buy,Paragraph
these for himself according to his own taste and inclination.’,Paragraph
This categorical anti-Gesamtkunstwerk attitude was,Paragraph
complemented by Loos’s passion for rich materials of which,Paragraph
he wrote in the vein of Semper: ‘Rich material and good,Paragraph
workmanship should not only be considered as making up,Paragraph
"for lack of decoration, but as far surpassing it in",Paragraph
sumptuousness.’,Paragraph
"70, 71 Loos, Steiner House, Vienna, 1910. Below, dining room.",Caption
The Steiner House initiated a series of houses in which,Paragraph
Loos gradually evolved his conception of the Raumplan or,Paragraph
"‘plan of volumes’, a complex system of internal organization",Paragraph
that culminated in the split-level houses realized towards,Paragraph
the end of his life: the Moller House in Vienna and the Miller,Title
"House near Prague. By the time of the Steiner House, Loos",Paragraph
had already arrived at a highly abstract external idiom - his,Paragraph
"white unadorned prism, which anticipated by at least eight",Paragraph
years the so-called ‘International Style’. He began to,Paragraph
"elaborate his Raump/an concept in his Rufer House, Vienna",Caption
"(1912), where, in contrast to his later houses, the openings",Paragraph
"are quite freely disposed, following the free disposition of",Paragraph
the internal volumes - an elevational counterpoint that,Paragraph
anticipated the canonical works of De Stijl.,Paragraph
Loos’s Raumplan reached its apotheosis in his last,Paragraph
"domestic works, the Moller and Muller houses of 1928 and",Paragraph
1930. As anticipated in the open stair hall of the Rufer,Caption
"House, both these works are organized about displacements",Paragraph
"in the respective levels of their principal floors, elisions that",Paragraph
serve not only to create spatial movement but also to,Paragraph
differentiate one living area from the next. The typically,Paragraph
"irregular Gothic Revival plan, documented in Muthesius’s",Paragraph
"Das Englische Haus, clearly inspired Loos’s wholly",Paragraph
"unprecedented development of the Raumpi/an, yet with his",Paragraph
Classical predilection for cubic form he could not accept the,Paragraph
picturesque massing that was its natural consequence. From,Paragraph
"this, no doubt, came the tortuous manipulation of the",Paragraph
available volume of the prism as though it were just so,Paragraph
much raw material from which to create a dynamic,Paragraph
composition in section.,Paragraph
Such plastic intentions were basically incompatible with,Paragraph
an architecture of consistent distinction between structural,Paragraph
"and non-structural elements, and while Loos strove to",Paragraph
"maintain such distinctions in his public work, at a domestic",Paragraph
"level he gave primacy to the sensation of space, rather than",Paragraph
to the revelation of architectonic structure. The principles of,Paragraph
"Viollet-le-Duc were in any event alien to him, since he",Paragraph
deliberately contorted plans for the sake of providing an,Paragraph
architectural promenade of sensual significance as Le,Paragraph
Corbusier was to do. In almost all his domestic work,Paragraph
"structural junctions are invariably masked by revetment,",Paragraph
either with the aim of hiding unresolved conditions or out of,Paragraph
a desire to provide an appropriate level of decorum.,Paragraph
During his tenure as chief architect to the Housing,Paragraph
"Department of Vienna, from 1920 to 1922, in the austere",Paragraph
"aftermath of the war, Loos applied his as yet undeveloped",Paragraph
Raumplan to the problem of mass housing. The result was a,Paragraph
"number of remarkable housing studies, in which his",Paragraph
"preferred form, the cube, became transformed into a",Paragraph
stepped terrace section. In 1920 he designed a brilliant and,Paragraph
"economical housing scheme, known as the Heuberg Estate",Paragraph
[72]. Terrace houses were integrated with greenhouses and,Paragraph
"allotments, in which the occupants were expected to grow",Paragraph
their own food - a typical urban survival strategy of the,Paragraph
"inflationary post-war period, which became adopted as",Paragraph
general policy in many German housing settlements during,Paragraph
the 1920s.,Paragraph
"72 Loos, Heuberg Estate, Vienna, 1920, showing conservatories and allotments.",Caption
"It is one of the paradoxes of Loos’s career that he, the",Paragraph
"bourgeois architect and man of taste, should create his",Paragraph
most sensitive larger projects in the service of the,Paragraph
underprivileged. His disillusioned resignation as housing,Paragraph
"architect in 1922 and his subsequent migration to Paris, at",Paragraph
the invitation of the Dadaist poet Tristan Tzara - for whom,Paragraph
he was to design a house in 1926 - restored him to the,Paragraph
cosmopolitan circles of the high bourgeoisie. There he,Paragraph
became part of the fashionable world that surrounded the,Paragraph
"dancer Josephine Baker, for whom he designed a rather",Paragraph
ostentatious villa in 1928. Save for Tzara and his old,Caption
"Viennese client, the internationally famous tailor Knize, for",Paragraph
"whom he had first designed a store in Vienna in 1909, none",Paragraph
of his Parisian patrons had either the resources or the faith,Paragraph
to realize any of the large-scale projects that he designed,Paragraph
"during his expatriate years. In 1928 he returned to Vienna,",Paragraph
"five years before his death, his career virtually at an end.",Paragraph
In the final analysis Loos’s significance as a pioneer,Paragraph
depended not only on his extraordinary insights as a critic of,Paragraph
"modern culture, but also on his formulation of the Raumplan",Paragraph
as an architectural strategy for transcending the,Paragraph
"contradictory cultural legacy of bourgeois society which,",Paragraph
"having deprived itself of the vernacular, could not claim in",Paragraph
exchange the culture of Classicism. No one was better,Paragraph
prepared to receive this hyperconscious sensibility than the,Paragraph
"post-war Parisian avant garde, in particular the circle editing",Paragraph
"L’Esprit Nouveau, namely the proto-Dadaist poet Paul",Paragraph
Dermée and the Purist painters Amédée Ozenfant and,Title
"Charles-Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier), who in 1920",Paragraph
reprinted the 1913 French translation of Ornament and,Paragraph
Crime. And while (as Reyner Banham has observed) the,Paragraph
roots of Purism lay in the abstract classicizing tendencies of,Paragraph
"Parisian culture, notwithstanding the ‘ready-made’",Paragraph
"sensibility of Marcel Duchamp, there is little reason to doubt",Paragraph
that the influence of Loos was decisive in refining the,Paragraph
typological programme of Purism: that impulse to,Title
"synthesize, at every conceivable scale, the ‘type-objects’ of",Paragraph
the modern world.,Paragraph
"Above all, Loos must now be seen as the first to",Paragraph
postulate the problem that Le Corbusier was eventually to,Paragraph
resolve with his full development of the free plan. The,Paragraph
typological issue posited by Loos was how to combine the,Paragraph
propriety of Platonic mass with the convenience of irregular,Paragraph
volume. This proposition was never more lyrically stated,Paragraph
"than in his 1923 project for a villa on the Lido in Venice [73,",Paragraph
74]; and this house was destined to become the type-form,Paragraph
"for Le Corbusier’s canonical Purist villa, his villa at Garches",Paragraph
of 1927.,Paragraph

strikingly sculptural pieces that recalled that Anglo-Japanese,Paragraph
"style, developed some twenty years before by Edward",Paragraph
Godwin and Christopher Dresser.,Paragraph
Van de Velde made his début as an architect and as a,Paragraph
"designer in 1895, when he designed and built a house for",Paragraph
himself at Uccle near Brussels. This without question was,Paragraph
intended to demonstrate the ultimate synthesis of all the,Paragraph
"arts, for apart from integrating the house with all its",Paragraph
"furnishings, including the cutlery, Van de Velde attempted to",Paragraph
consummate the whole Gesamtkunstwerk through the,Paragraph
flowing forms of the dresses that he designed for his wife.,Paragraph
"The fall, cut and decoration of these clothes [75] already",Paragraph
exhibited that energetic serpentine line that was to be Van,Paragraph
de Velde’s prime contribution to the vocabulary that he,Paragraph
"inherited from Serrurier-Bovy. Derived from Gauguin, it was",Paragraph
used as an expressive device for imparting a more vigorous,Paragraph
profile to the formal legacy of the Arts and Crafts.,Paragraph
"75 Van de Velde’s wife, Maria Sethe, wearing a dress to his design, c. 1898.",Caption
For Van de Velde the ameliorative thrust of the English,Caption
Arts and Crafts movement was complemented by the more,Paragraph
anarchic but equally reformist visions of Tolstoy and,Paragraph
Kropotkin. While he could share with the Pre-Raphaelites,Paragraph
"their intense antipathy to all architecture after the Gothic,",Paragraph
he could not accept their conscious drive towards the,Paragraph
"medievalization of the present. As a socialist, he was more",Paragraph
influenced by the young militants of the Belgian Socialist,Paragraph
"Party, with whom he had been in contact since the mid-",Paragraph
"1880s: Emile Vandervelde, the socialist client of Horta’s",Caption
"Maison du Peuple, and the poet-critic Emile Verhaeren,",Paragraph
"whose critical study of urbanization, Les Villes tentaculaires,",Paragraph
had been published in 1895. Yet in spite of these radical,Paragraph
"affiliations, Van de Velde still believed in the reform of",Paragraph
"society through the design of the environment; that is, he",Paragraph
still adhered to a sensationalist faith in the primacy of,Paragraph
"physical form over programmatic content. For him, as for",Paragraph
"the whole of the Arts and Crafts tradition, the single family",Paragraph
house was the prime social vehicle through which the values,Paragraph
"of the society could be gradually transformed. ‘Ugliness’, he",Paragraph
"held, ‘corrupts not only the eyes but also the heart and",Paragraph
"mind.’ In his fight against ugliness, Van de Velde",Paragraph
concentrated on the design of every aspect of the domestic,Paragraph
"environment [76, 77]. He was ill-equipped, either by",Paragraph
"temperament or training, to think at an urban scale: in his",Paragraph
"layout for the Hohenhagen garden colony, built at Hagen in",Caption
"Germany for Karl Ernst Osthaus in 1906, he singularly failed",Paragraph
to demonstrate how the individual house might be,Paragraph
aggregated into larger and more significant social units. And,Paragraph
he was no more successful than William Morris in reconciling,Paragraph
the contradictions between his socialist commitments and,Paragraph
his patronage by the upper middle class.,Paragraph

"From the mid-1890s on, Van de Velde was profoundly",Paragraph
influenced by the aesthetic theories of the Viennese art,Paragraph
historian Alois Rieg] and the Munich psychologist Theodor,Title
Lipps. Where the one stressed the creative primacy of the,Paragraph
"individual Kunstwollen or ‘will to form’, the other postulated",Paragraph
Einfahlung or ‘empathy’ as the quasi-mystical projection of,Paragraph
the creative ego into the art object. These complementary,Paragraph
ideas had already been given a more specific context in,Paragraph
"Nietzsche’s essay of 1871, Die Geburt der Tragédie aus dem",Title
"Geiste der Musik, wherein the Apollonian and the Dionysian",Title
"were seen as the irreducible duality of Hellenic culture, the",Paragraph
former aspiring to the typical and freedom within the law,Title
and the later to superabundance and pantheistic,Title
"expression. These loosely related ideas, which vaguely",Paragraph
"informed Van de Velde’s work after 1896, found a certain",Paragraph
synthesis in Wilhelm Worringer’s Abstraktion und Einfuhlung,Paragraph
"(Abstraction and Empathy), published in 1908. Van de Velde",Paragraph
studied Worringer’s text assiduously and found that his own,Paragraph
work seemed to combine in a single entity the two,Paragraph
antagonistic aspects of Worringer’s cultural model - on the,Paragraph
one hand the impulse towards the empathetic expression of,Paragraph
"vital psychic states, and on the other the tendency towards",Paragraph
achieving transcendence through abstraction.,Paragraph
While Van de Velde strove for an empathetic and vital,Paragraph
"culture of form, he was nonetheless aware of the innate",Paragraph
tendency of all architecture towards abstraction. In this,Paragraph
"context, his lifelong respect for the Gothic may be regarded",Paragraph
as a nostalgia for an architecture in which the immediate,Paragraph
vitality of the form-force would come to be transcended by,Paragraph
the sublime structural abstraction of the whole. The,Paragraph
embodiment of such a force was the mainspring of his own,Paragraph
"aesthetic, from its initial appearance in the so-called",Paragraph
‘Yachting Style’ suite of furniture that he designed in 1895,Paragraph
for Samuel Bing’s Maison de I|’Art Nouveau in Paris to his,Paragraph
"theoretical formulation in 1902, in Weimar, of the principles",Paragraph
of what he called ‘structurally linear ornament’.,Paragraph
Van de Velde maintained a subtle distinction between,Paragraph
"ornamentation and ornament, arguing that the former, by",Paragraph
"virtue of being applied, was unrelated to its object, while the",Paragraph
"latter, by virtue of being functionally (i.e. structurally)",Paragraph
"determined, was integrated into it. This definition of",Paragraph
functional ornament was inseparable from the importance,Paragraph
"that Van de Velde attached to the gestural ‘crafted’ line, as",Paragraph
the necessary anthropomorphic trace of human creation.,Paragraph
"‘The line’, he wrote in 1902, ‘carries the force and the",Paragraph
energy of that which has traced it.’ For him the ‘quasi-erotic’,Paragraph
impluses governing the course of a line were to be regarded,Paragraph
as a literature without an alphabet.,Paragraph
The powerful anti-decorative tendency of this purist view,Paragraph
of culture was reinforced in 1903 when Van de Velde,Paragraph
"returned from a tour of Greece and the Middle East,",Paragraph
overwhelmed by the power and the purity of Mycenaean,Paragraph
and Assyrian form. From this point on he tried to avoid both,Paragraph
the gestural fantasy of the Secession and the rationality of,Paragraph
"Classicism. He attempted to create ‘pure’ organic form, such",Paragraph
"form as could be found, in his opinion, only in the cradle of",Paragraph
civilization or in the monumental cryptic gestures of,Paragraph
Neolithic man. This no doubt accounts for the telluric forms,Paragraph
of the houses that he built in Chemnitz and in Hagen,Paragraph
between 1903 and 1906. Yet despite the curious megalithic,Paragraph
"quality of these works, there remained in all of Van de",Paragraph
Velde’s work after 1903 a trace of Classicism that was not,Paragraph
entirely mediated by his feeling for the archaic. This is most,Paragraph
evident in the domestic objects that he designed between,Paragraph
"1903 and 1915, pieces that seem to reflect his passionate",Paragraph
"reaction to the classic, not to say ineffable, qualities that he",Paragraph
found in the Parthenon:,Paragraph
On the Acropolis the living standing columns teach us that,Paragraph
"they do not exist, that they do not carry load, or rather that",Paragraph
they are interspaced according to and end very different,Paragraph
from that for which they were apparently erected. Even,Paragraph
"where they are still joined by an entablature, they proclaim",Paragraph
in evidence that the columns around the Parthenon do not,Paragraph
"exist, but that between them gigantic perfect vases are",Paragraph
"poised, containing life, space and sun, sea and mountains,",Paragraph
night and the stars. The entasis of the columns is,Paragraph
transformed until the resultant space between one and the,Paragraph
"other has attained a perfect, eternal form.?",Paragraph
"Van de Velde’s Apollonian conversion, so to speak,",Paragraph
coincided with the climax of his career at Weimar. After,Paragraph
having been consultant to the craft industries of the Grand,Paragraph
"Duchy of Saxe-Weimar since 1901, he was nominated in",Paragraph
1904 to serve as the professor to the newly created Grand,Paragraph
Ducal School of Arts and Crafts. This appointment gave him,Paragraph
the commission to design new premises for both the school,Paragraph
and the existing Academy of Fine Art - the nucleus that,Paragraph
fourteen years later would become the Weimar Bauhaus.,Paragraph
"Prior to the opening of these buildings in 1908, Van de Velde",Paragraph
continued to lecture in Weimar and to give his Kunstseminar,Paragraph
for the cultural instruction of trained artisans. Yet this most,Paragraph
triumphant moment of his entire career was overshadowed,Paragraph
"by profound inner doubts, in which he began to question the",Paragraph
artist’s prerogative to determine the form of objects. In,Paragraph
1905 he wrote: ‘At what point do | have this right to impose,Paragraph
on the world a taste and a wish which is so personal.,Paragraph
Suddenly | no longer see the ties between my ideal and the,Paragraph
world.’,Paragraph
"After Gottfried Semper and Peter Behrens, Van de Velde",Paragraph
had always sought to strengthen such socio-cultural ties,Paragraph
"through the agency of the theatre, conceiving its union of",Paragraph
actors and spectators as the highest form of social and,Paragraph
spiritual life. Directly influenced by scenographers such as,Paragraph
"Max Reinhardt and Gordon Craig, he devoted himself to the",Paragraph
"development of the tripartite stage, first formulated in a",Paragraph
project for the Dumont Theatre in Weimar in 1904. He,Paragraph
returned to this theme in 1911 in his compromise design for,Paragraph
"the Théatre des Champs-Elysées, Paris (realized by Auguste",Caption
"Perret in a modified form in 1913), and again in his Cologne",Paragraph
Werkbund Exhibition Theatre of 1914 [78]. The highly,Paragraph
expressive but short-lived Werkbund Theatre was the,Paragraph
apotheosis of all his pre-war work. Erich Mendelsohn wrote,Paragraph
"of it: ‘Only Van de Velde, with his theatre, is really searching",Paragraph
"for new form. Concrete used in the Art Nouveau style, but",Paragraph
strong in conception and expression.’ Its surging masses,Paragraph
demonstrated Van de Velde’s masterly control over form in,Paragraph
a manner that later served as a model for the profiling of,Paragraph
"Mendelsohn’s Einstein Tower, built at Potsdam in 1919.",Caption
"78 Van de Velde, Werkbund Exhibition Theatre, Cologne, 1914.",Caption
The much admired Werkbund Theatre was to be the last,Paragraph
formulation of Van de Velde’s ‘form-force’ aesthetic. Fusing,Paragraph
"actor with audience and auditorium with landscape, as in",Paragraph
"the open-air arenas of Neolithic man, it appeared as a",Paragraph
unique empathetic expression. Such expression could of,Paragraph
course find no place in the modest modular prefabricated,Paragraph
house that Van de Velde built for himself after the First,Paragraph
World War. The Werkbund dream of a world transformed by,Paragraph
gute Form and industrial monopoly had proven just as vain,Paragraph
as the reformist hopes of the socially conscious bourgeoisie,Paragraph
whose fifty-year-old patronage of the Arts and Crafts and Art,Paragraph
Nouveau had been brought to an abrupt end by the first,Paragraph
industrialized war. One could no longer fantasize about a,Paragraph
"society transformed through art, industrial design and the",Paragraph
"theatre, at a time when the provision of minimum shelter",Paragraph
was a matter of the greatest urgency.,Paragraph

Industrial City 1899-1918,Title
The city is imaginary: let us assume that the towns of Rive-,Paragraph
"de-Gier, St-Etienne, St-Chaumond, Chasse and Givors have",Paragraph
conditions similar to those of this town. The site of this,Paragraph
"study is located in a region of southeast France, and",Paragraph
regional materials have been used in its construction.,Paragraph
Determining factors in the establishment of a similar city,Paragraph
"should be the proximity of raw materials, or the existence of",Paragraph
"a natural force capable of being used for energy, or the",Paragraph
convenience of methods of transportation. In our case the,Paragraph
determining factor in the location of the city is the force of,Paragraph
the tributary river that is the power source; there are also,Paragraph
"mines in the region, but they could be located further away.",Paragraph
"The tributary is dammed, a hydroelectric plant",Paragraph
"distributes power, light, and heat to the factories and to the",Paragraph
entire city. The principal factories are situated in the plain at,Paragraph
the confluence of the river and its tributary. A mainline,Paragraph
"railroad passes between the factories and the town, which is",Paragraph
located above the factories on a plateau. Higher still are,Paragraph
"placed the hospitals; they, as well as the city, are sheltered",Paragraph
"from cold winds, and have their terraces oriented to the",Paragraph

hospitals) is isolated so that it can expand. ...,Paragraph

Tony Garnier,Title
"Preface to Une Cité industrielle, 19171",Caption
It would be hard to imagine a more concise statement of the,Paragraph
basic economic and technical precepts for the foundation,Title
and organization of a modern city. The very lucidity of this,Paragraph
outline - the sole theoretical statement of Garnier’s career -,Paragraph
reflects in its tone and content the fundamentally radical,Paragraph
nature of his life and work. Born in Lyons in 1869 and raised,Paragraph
"in a radical workers’ quarter, he remained consistently",Paragraph
committed to the socialist cause up to his death in 1948.,Paragraph
Garnier’s education and the commitment of his,Paragraph
professional career are both inseparable from the city of,Paragraph
Lyons. The radical syndicalism and socialism that Lyons,Title
nurtured stemmed from the fact that it was one of the most,Paragraph
"progressive industrial centres in 19th-century France, with",Paragraph
its silk and metallurgical industries well established by the,Paragraph
time of Garnier’s birth. In addition to its favourable location,Paragraph
"in the Rhéne-Sa6ne corridor, the growth of Lyons had been",Paragraph
stimulated soon after mid-century by one of the first main,Paragraph
"railway links in France. By the 1880s, with the electrification",Paragraph
"of its trams and local railway systems, it was well placed to",Paragraph
become a main centre for technical and industrial,Paragraph
"innovation. Photography, cinematography, hydroelectric",Paragraph
"generation, automobile production and aviation all saw their",Paragraph
first beginnings there between 1882 and the turn of the,Paragraph
century. The influence of this technical milieu certainly,Paragraph
found its reflection in Garnier’s project for a ‘Cité,Paragraph
"Industrielle’, first exhibited in 1904, a project which",Paragraph
demonstrated his belief that the cities of the future would,Paragraph
have to be based on industry.,Paragraph
Other aspects of Lyons culture were also featured in the,Paragraph
"plans of Garnier’s Cité, most notably the French regionalist",Paragraph
"movement in favour of reviving local culture, which was as a",Paragraph
result committed to the broader political policies of,Paragraph
federalism and decentralization. Thus Garnier included an,Paragraph
old medieval town within the confines of his industrial city.,Paragraph
The importance that he attached to such foundations is,Paragraph
reflected in his location of the main railway station in close,Paragraph
proximity to this regional centre.,Paragraph
"The municipality of Lyons was also important, even in",Paragraph
"Garnier’s youth, for its progressive approach to",Paragraph
urbanization. Its streets had been regularized between 1853,Paragraph
and 1864; after 1880 - as part of a slum clearance,Paragraph
programme - the city began to improve its water and,Paragraph
sanitation systems; and about 1883 it began to provide a,Paragraph
"range of welfare facilities, such as schools, workers’",Paragraph
"housing, baths, hospitals and abattoirs.",Paragraph
"Entering the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, first at Lyons in 1886",Paragraph
"and then at Paris in 1889, Garnier came under the influence",Paragraph
"of Julien Guadet who, as Professor of Theory after 1894,",Paragraph
taught not only the precepts of Rational Classicism but also,Paragraph
programmatic analysis and the classification of building,Title
types. Guadet’s E/éments et théories de I’architecture of,Paragraph
1902 was a programmatic updating of Durand’s methods of,Paragraph
1805 for the rational combination of typified architectural,Caption
"forms, and it was this common elemental approach to",Paragraph
design that was to inform the careers of Guadet’s foremost,Paragraph
"pupils, Garnier and Auguste Perret. These two men,",Paragraph
"however, were to have very different careers, for while",Paragraph
"Garnier, after ten years in Paris, won the Prix de Rome in",Paragraph
1899 and spent another four years at the French Academy,Paragraph
"in the Villa Medici, Perret left the Beaux-Arts in 1897 after",Paragraph
only three years of formal education to work for his father.,Paragraph
"Thus when the Cité Industrielle was first exhibited, in 1904,",Paragraph
Perret had already made his mark as an architect and a,Paragraph
builder with his pioneer reinforced-concrete-frame,Paragraph
apartment building in the Rue Franklin.,Caption
From the time when Garnier was first a /ogiste for the Prix,Paragraph
"de Rome in 1892, he had been immersed in the increasingly",Paragraph
"radical climate of Paris, presided over by the figure of Jean",Paragraph
"Jaurés, who became a socialist deputy in 1893. The Parisian",Paragraph
political scene was galvanized after 1897 by the Dreyfus,Paragraph
"affair, an event which converted Emile Zola into a",Paragraph
passionate advocate of radical reform. Out of this came,Paragraph
"Zola’s first utopian socialist novel, Fécondité, which was",Paragraph
serialized in 1899 in the socialist journal L’Aurore. Given,Paragraph
Garnier’s long-standing affiliation with the Société des Amis,Paragraph
"d’Emile Zola, it is certain that he would have read these",Paragraph
"excerpts. In any event, the early sketches for the industrial",Paragraph
city that he made in the same year seem to reflect Zola’s,Paragraph
"vision of a new socio-economic order, which the writer was",Paragraph
"to elaborate in his second utopian socialist novel, Travail",Paragraph
(1901).,Paragraph
"Against great opposition at the Villa Medici, Garnier",Paragraph
continued to work on his city project throughout his stay. For,Paragraph
the required ‘testimony of academic study’ he prepared an,Paragraph
imaginative and equally unprecedented reconstruction of,Paragraph
the Roman hill city of Tusculum. Tusculum and the first,Paragraph
version of the Cité Industrielle were jointly exhibited in Paris,Paragraph
"in 1904, the year when Garnier returned in triumph to",Paragraph
Lyons. Over the next thirty-five years he was to work,Paragraph
"exclusively in and for this city, largely at the command of",Paragraph
"the progressive mayor, Edouard Herriot, and it was in Lyons,",Paragraph
"at the beginning of his public career, that Le Corbusier first",Paragraph
met him in 1908.,Paragraph
"Set on a river escarpment, in a mountainous landscape",Paragraph
"that corresponded generally to that of the Lyons region,",Paragraph
"Garnier’s industrial city of 35,000 inhabitants was not only a",Paragraph
"regional centre of medium size, sensitively related to its",Paragraph
"environment, but also an urban organization that",Paragraph
anticipated in its separate zoning the principles of the CIAM,Paragraph
"Athens Charter of 1933 [79]. It was above all a socialist city,",Paragraph
"without walls or private property, without church or",Paragraph
"barracks, without police station or law courts, a city where",Paragraph
all the unbuilt surface was public parkland. Within the built,Paragraph
area Garnier eventually established a varied and,Paragraph
"comprehensive housing typology, in accordance with strict",Paragraph
"standards for the provision of light, ventilation and green",Paragraph
Space. These codes and the combinational patterns they,Paragraph
generated were inflected by a hierarchy of tree-lined streets,Paragraph
"of varying widths. At an average height of only two storeys,",Paragraph
"such an open layout yielded a low density, and Garnier",Paragraph
supplemented a 1932 edition of his scheme with residential,Paragraph
sectors at a higher density. Integral to the residential,Paragraph
"quarters were different categories of schools, sited to serve",Paragraph
"specific districts, while facilities for technical and",Paragraph
professional education were located between the residential,Paragraph
and industrial sectors.,Paragraph
"79 Garnier, Cité Industrielle: schematic plan, 1904-17. Below the hospitals is the",Caption
"administrative/cultural centre, flanked by housing.",Paragraph
It has recently been shown that Garnier did not arrive at,Paragraph
"the concept of his city in isolation, and that among the",Paragraph
remarkable young pensionnaires who were his colleagues at,Paragraph

"Jaussely, whose Prix de Rome entry of 1903, ‘A Metropolitan",Paragraph

rendered as a ‘space of public appearance’ where a,Paragraph
"museum, a library, a theatre, a stadium and a vast public",Paragraph
indoor swimming pool or hydrothérapie building are grouped,Paragraph
around the axis of an assembly complex [81]. The prime,Paragraph
"organizing principle of this last, lozenge-shaped structure is",Paragraph
a peristyle of reinforced-concrete columns which enclose a,Paragraph

various kinds of assembly would have taken place here,Paragraph
beneath the rationalistic image of a twenty-four-hour clock,Paragraph
and an entablature which bore Courbet-like reliefs and was,Paragraph
inscribed with two quotations from Zola’s Travail. The first of,Paragraph
these texts alluded to the Saint-Simonian programme for,Paragraph
achieving international harmony through industrial,Title

It was resolved that the feast would take place in the,Paragraph

"corn sheaves stood, like the symmetrical columns of a giant",Paragraph
"temple, the colour of gold under the clear sun. The",Paragraph
"colonnade stretched to infinity, to the far horizon, sheaves",Paragraph

"the good smell of the ripe corn, in the middle of the",Paragraph
"immense fertile plain, from which the labour of men,",Paragraph
"reconciled at last, obtained enough bread for the happiness",Paragraph
of all.2,Paragraph
This last passage directly evoked that Classical arcadian,Paragraph
life and landscape that Garnier had first fully understood,Paragraph
"after his visit to Greece in 1903. Like the agora, of which it",Paragraph
"was intended to be the modern counterpart, Garnier’s",Paragraph
assembly building was depicted as being populated by,Paragraph
shadowy figures whose latter-day Biedermeier clothing,Paragraph
evoked an appropriately Classical atmosphere. Their houses,Paragraph
"were to be equally plain, without cornices and mouldings",Paragraph
and in many instances planned around courtyards and,Paragraph
"drained by impluvia. In short, despite its use of advanced",Paragraph
"constructional methods, its adoption of reinforced-concrete",Paragraph
construction throughout (Hennebique) and its use of large,Paragraph
"steel spans in the industrial sector, after Contamin’s Galerie",Paragraph
"des Machines of 1889, the Cité Industrielle remained above",Paragraph
all else the vision of a Mediterranean socialist arcadia.,Paragraph
For all that Garnier in Rome had been influenced by other,Paragraph
"important French urbanists, such as Léon Jaussely and",Paragraph
"Eugéne Hénard, whose first articles on urban transformation",Paragraph
"appeared in 1903, the unique contribution of his city lay as",Paragraph
much in the extraordinary level of detail to which it was,Paragraph
developed as in the ‘modernity’ of its vision. Garnier’s,Paragraph
project not only stipulated the principles and the layout for a,Paragraph
"hypothetical industrial city; it also delineated, at many",Paragraph
"different scales, the specific substance of its urban typology,",Paragraph
while giving at the same time precise indications as to the,Paragraph
mode of its construction in concrete and steel. Nothing as,Paragraph
comprehensive as this had been attempted since Claude-,Paragraph
Nicolas Ledoux’s ideal city of Chaux of 1804. While Une Cité,Paragraph
"industrielle was not published until 1917, its author’s",Paragraph
contribution to contemporary urbanism was already being,Paragraph
"acknowledged by 1920, when Le Corbusier published",Paragraph
material from the Cité folio in the Purist review L’Esprit,Caption
Nouveau.,Paragraph
Despite the obvious impact of the Cité on the urbanistic,Paragraph
"thought of Le Corbusier, its overall influence was limited",Paragraph
"since, aside from Garnier’s isolated works in Lyons, its basic",Paragraph
propositions were never tested or extensively published.,Paragraph
"Unlike Ebenezer Howard's garden city model of 1898, which",Paragraph
was realized as a developmental strategy at Letchworth,Paragraph
"Garden City in 1903, it could hardly be referred to as a",Paragraph
proven model. These two alternatives could not in fact have,Paragraph
"been more opposed, for where Garnier’s Cité was inherently",Paragraph
expandable and graced with a certain autonomy due to its,Paragraph
"base in heavy industry, Howard’s Rurisville was limited in",Paragraph
"size and economically dependent, with its base in light",Paragraph
industry and small-scale agriculture. And where Garnier’s,Paragraph
"Cité, in conjunction with Jaussely’s Barcelona project of",Paragraph
"1904, was to influence the theoretical planning models",Paragraph
"developed during the first decade of the Soviet Union,",Paragraph
Howard's schema was to lead to the reformist proliferation,Paragraph
of ‘garden city’ communities and eventually to the equally,Paragraph
pragmatic New Town programme that emerged in England,Title
after the Second World War.,Paragraph
Garnier’s urbanistic thought was expressed in his Grands,Paragraph

"either side. All this, however, contradicted the Structural",Paragraph
"Rationalist canon, for it was patently not the architecture of",Paragraph
articulate structure such as had been advocated by Viollet-,Paragraph
le-Duc. Nor was it the naturally expressive and vernacular,Paragraph
use of structure which Perret had displayed in the Casino at,Paragraph
St Malo.,Paragraph
Two books seem to have been influential in bringing,Paragraph
Perret to adopt a trabeated concrete structure for his,Paragraph
apartment block in the Rue Franklin of 1903: Auguste,Caption
Choisy’s monumental Histoire de I’architecture (1899) and,Paragraph
"Paul Christophe’s text on the Hennebique system, Le Béton",Caption
armé et ses applications (1902). Where the first cited Greek,Paragraph
"trabeation as the Classical precedent for such structures,",Paragraph
the second provided a definitive technique for the,Paragraph
fabrication and design of a reinforced-concrete frame.,Paragraph
"Choisy, Professor of Architecture at the Ecole des Ponts",Paragraph
"et Chaussées, cultivated a deterministic view of history in",Paragraph
which he argued that the various styles had arisen not as,Paragraph
the sports of fashion but as the logical consequence of,Paragraph
developments in building technique. His preferred examples,Paragraph
of such technically determined styles were (after Viollet-le-,Paragraph
"Duc) the Greek and the Gothic, although it was, of course,",Paragraph
his reference to the former that made him the last,Paragraph
influential theorist of Classical Rationalism. Choisy,Caption
"succeeded a long line of such Rationalists, dating back like",Paragraph
Guadet and Labrouste to the 18th-century theorists,Paragraph
"Cordemoy and Laugier. Like most proponents of this school,",Paragraph
Choisy saw nothing irrational in the Greek transposition of,Paragraph
timber forms into the masonry components of the Doric,Paragraph
order.,Paragraph
Perret’s initial use of ferroconcrete accorded more closely,Paragraph
with Choisy’s characterization of the Gothic as an,Paragraph
"architecture of ribwork and infill. In compositional terms, the",Paragraph
Rue Franklin block compressed the format adopted one year,Paragraph
"earlier in the Avenue Wagram. In each case street facades,",Paragraph
"divided into five bays, with end bays corbelling out over the",Paragraph
"pavement, rise five or six storeys in height and terminate in",Paragraph
"an additional ‘capping’ floor, before setting back. This floor",Paragraph
in the Avenue Wagram is emphasized through an attached,Paragraph
"colonnade, while in the Rue Franklin its elemental character",Paragraph
"is stressed by the frame of two open loggias. There,",Paragraph
"however, all correspondence ends, for whereas the Wagram",Paragraph
"building is monolithic and horizontally expansive, the Rue",Paragraph
Franklin block is articulated and vertically attenuated [84].,Paragraph
The articulation of its columns and the rise of its high,Paragraph
pitched set-back roof give something of a Gothic feeling to,Paragraph
"this otherwise orthogonal structure, recalling the 17th-",Paragraph
century work of Mansart. This was the closest that Perret,Paragraph
was to come to the detailed prescription of Viollet-le-Duc.,Paragraph
"The reason for its hollow U-form front, so suggestive of the",Paragraph
"attentuations of the Gothic, was in fact eminently",Paragraph
pragmatic: Perret could get more floor area by providing the,Paragraph
"regulation court at the front, rather than the rear. With equal",Paragraph
"ingenuity, he clad the rear wall of the building with glass",Paragraph
lenses in order not to infringe an easement.,Paragraph
"84 Perret, 25 bis Rue Franklin, Paris, 1903.",Caption
"After 1903 Perret, like Choisy, regarded the charpente or",Paragraph
structural frame as the quintessential expression of built,Paragraph
form. The ferroconcrete frame of the Rue Franklin block was,Paragraph
tiled in such a way as to suggest post-and-lintel construction,Paragraph
in wood - the remainder being either windows or solid,Paragraph
panels faced in ceramic mosaic. While the tessellated,Paragraph
sunflowers of the latter gave the building that quality of,Paragraph
fossilized Art Nouveau so peculiar to the end of the Belle,Paragraph
"Epoque, the frame itself, and the open planning it",Paragraph
"permitted, pointed towards Le Corbusier's later",Paragraph
development of the free plan.,Paragraph
"The firm of Perret Fréres, consisting of Auguste and his",Paragraph
"brother Gustave, played an essential role in the",Paragraph
development of Perret’s style. In 1905 they erected a,Paragraph
remarkable four-storey mechanical stacking garage in the,Caption
Rue de Ponthieu. This was followed in 1912 by a house,Paragraph
"designed by Paul Guadet, Julien Guadet’s son. Executed in",Caption
reinforced concrete and rising in each instance to an attic,Paragraph
"floor or frieze capped by a projecting cornice, these works",Paragraph
"show the progressive refinement of a rational, trabeated",Paragraph
Perret ‘house-sty/e’. Where the former may be regarded as,Paragraph
having anticipated the format of Perret’s later ecclesiastical,Paragraph
"style, the latter must be seen as the prototypical Perret",Paragraph
"facade, a modulated format that was given its ultimate",Paragraph
expression in his reconstruction of Le Havre after the end of,Paragraph
the Second World War.,Paragraph
In 1911-13 came the tour de force of the Théatre des,Paragraph
"Champs-Elysées, following the unhappy confrontation",Paragraph
between Auguste Perret and Henry van de Velde.,Paragraph
"Commissioned by the theatrical director G. Astruc in 1910,",Paragraph
Van de Velde soon realized that on such a restricted site it,Paragraph
"was necessary to work in reinforced concrete, and he",Paragraph
therefore hired Perret Fréres as contractors. The decision,Paragraph
"was unfortunate, for Perret challenged the structural",Paragraph
"feasibility of his design, and proposed a similar scheme of",Paragraph
his own. Within six months Perret’s views had prevailed and,Paragraph
Van de Velde had been reduced in status from collaborating,Paragraph
architect to architecte-consultant.,Paragraph
While the plan and elevation of the Théatre des Champs-,Paragraph
"Elysées were essentially Van de Velde’s, its realization",Paragraph
proved both Perret’s mastery of detail and the technical,Paragraph
prowess of the firm of Perret Freres. The programme,Paragraph
"required three auditoria, seating 1,250, 500 and 150 people",Paragraph
"respectively, with full ancillary space comprising stage,",Paragraph
"backstage, foyers, cloakrooms, etc., all on a site some 37",Caption
metres wide and 95 metres deep (120 by 310 feet). Perret,Paragraph
suspended his main circular auditorium [85] within a,Paragraph
"perimeter of eight columns and four bowspring arches, both",Paragraph
elements being integral with a continuous monolithic frame,Paragraph
that rose from a raft foundation. The basic matrix of the,Paragraph
skeleton was augmented by the intelligent application of,Paragraph
"cantilevers and trussed girders, so that the required",Paragraph
volumes could be accommodated exactly within the,Paragraph
confines of the site. Little of this dynamic structure is,Paragraph
"expressed on the exterior, which at the back and sides is",Paragraph
generally rendered as a trabeated frame filled with brick.,Paragraph
"The main facade, however, is Classically treated, being",Paragraph
faced with stone in a regular manner which is only,Paragraph
tenuously related to the rich columnar subdivision of the,Paragraph
"foyer within. At the same time, the Symbolist culture of",Paragraph
"Paris, inherited from the Belle Epoque, still found a certain",Paragraph
expression - both internally and externally - in the low,Paragraph
"reliefs and friezes of Antoine Bourdelle, and in the mural",Caption
paintings of Maurice Denis. This nostalgia for a mythological,Paragraph
"antiquity found further reflection in the handrails, light",Paragraph
fittings and furnishings designed by Perret himself.,Caption
"85 Perret, Thédtre des Champs-Elysées, Paris, 1911-13. Section of the large",Caption
"auditorium, with reliefs by Bourdelle.",Caption
In the decade following the inauguration of this theatre in,Paragraph
"1913, Perret Freres were occupied with a remarkable series",Paragraph
"of utilitarian ferroconcrete structures, including dock",Paragraph
buildings in Casablanca and various workshops in the,Paragraph
"vicinity of Paris. Then suddenly, in 1922, came Auguste",Paragraph
"Perret’s first church commission, Notre-Dame du Raincy,",Paragraph
completed in 1924. Here Perret arrived at the most pure,Paragraph
"formulation of his ferroconcrete style, almost twenty years",Paragraph
after it first appeared in the Rue Franklin. The church was,Paragraph
important not only for its elegant proportions and syntactic,Paragraph
refinement but also for its formulation of the cylindrical,Paragraph
column articulated within a non-load-bearing envelope. The,Paragraph
"precepts of Choisy were respected throughout, from the",Paragraph
"perforated, prefabricated wall screens to the fluted, tapered",Caption
columns - each component reduced to its most explicit,Paragraph
structural essence.,Paragraph
Immediately after Le Raincy there came two temporary,Paragraph
structures which were the climax of Perret’s early career: his,Paragraph
"art gallery, the Palais de Bois, built in 1924 of standard",Caption
"timber scantlings which were reused after dismantling, and",Paragraph
his small arena theatre in the Exposition des Arts Décoratifs,Paragraph
"of 1925 [86]. Whereas the art gallery, like the Le Raincy",Paragraph
"church, was one of Perret’s most articulate structures, the",Paragraph
temporary theatre of lightweight construction was designed,Paragraph
to simulate a heavy monolithic frame. The actual structure,Paragraph
consisted of circular timber columns carrying a grid of steel-,Paragraph
reinforced light-weight clinker beams. The whole was,Paragraph
finished internally in lathe and plaster and clad externally in,Caption
synthetic stone. As such it was certainly removed from the,Paragraph
structural purity that had always been essential to the,Paragraph
Rationalist thesis. This ‘deception’ was excused by the,Paragraph
designer on the grounds that had it been permanent he,Paragraph
would have built it in reinforced concrete.,Paragraph
"86 Perret, theatre, Exposition des Arts Décoratifs, Paris, 1925.",Caption
"For all its impurity, the Arts Décoratifs theatre was the",Paragraph
most lucid and lyrical statement that Perret ever made.,Paragraph
Eight internal free-standing columns supported a ceiling,Caption
‘ring’ beam which through ingenious transformations across,Paragraph
its four diagonal corners supported a gridded and coffered,Paragraph
skylight over the cruciform arena. The transverse loads of,Paragraph
this inner structure were to be transferred to a perimeter,Paragraph
"beam, supported by a system of free-standing columns",Paragraph
regularly spaced around the outside of the auditorium.,Paragraph
"Externally, however, the expression remained awkward and",Paragraph
these apparently ‘redundant’ columns that articulated the,Paragraph
blank exterior reflected Perret’s preoccupation with the,Paragraph
"creation of a new ‘national-classical’ style, an obsession that",Paragraph
was severely to limit the development of his later work.,Paragraph
"Apart from the lucidity of his architecture, and the",Paragraph
"extraordinary refinement attained in his built work, Perret’s",Paragraph
"significance as a theoretician lay in his aphoristic, dialectical",Paragraph
turn of mind - in the importance that he attached to such,Paragraph
"polarities as order versus disorder, frame versus infill,",Paragraph
"permanent versus impermanent, mobile versus immobile,",Paragraph
"reason versus imagination, and so on. Comparable",Paragraph
oppositions may be found throughout the entire corpus of Le,Paragraph
Corbusier’s work. In the Exposition des Arts Décoratifs of,Paragraph
"1925, however, the ways of these two figures had already",Paragraph
"begun to diverge, and not only in their respective exhibition",Paragraph
"structures, but also at the level of theory, for nothing could",Paragraph
have been more removed from Perret’s precepts than Les 5,Paragraph

With the Prussian suppression of the Saxon Revolt in 1849 -,Paragraph
a revolt in which both Mikhail Bakunin and Richard Wagner,Paragraph
"played prominent roles - Gottfried Semper, architect and",Paragraph
"liberal revolutionary, fled from Dresden, first to Paris, and",Paragraph
"then two years later, as the result of a special commission,",Paragraph
"to London. There, on the occasion of the 1851 Exhibition, he",Paragraph
"wrote his famous essay Wissenschaft, Industrie und Kunst",Paragraph
"(Science, Industry and Art), published in German in 1852,",Paragraph
where he examined the impact of industrialization and mass,Paragraph
consumption on the entire field of applied art and,Paragraph
architecture. A decade before William Morris and his,Paragraph
"associates produced their first domestic objects, Semper",Paragraph
crystallized his critique of industrial civilization: ‘We have,Paragraph
artists but no actual art.’ In tough-minded opposition to the,Paragraph
"Pre-Raphaelite dream of returning to a pre-industrial era,",Paragraph
Semper took the view that,Paragraph
Unremittingly science enriches itself and life with newly,Paragraph
discovered useful materials and natural powers that work,Paragraph
"miracles, with new methods and techniques, with new tools",Paragraph
and machines. It is already evident that inventions no longer,Paragraph
"are, as they had been in earlier times, means for warding off",Paragraph
"want and for helping consumption; instead, want and",Paragraph
consumption are the means to market the inventions. The,Paragraph
order of things has been reversed.”,Paragraph
"Later in the same text, he analyzed the impact on design",Paragraph
of new methods and materials:,Title
The hardest porphyry and granite are cut like chalk and,Paragraph
polished like wax. Ivory is softened and pressed into forms.,Paragraph
Rubber and gutta-percha are vulcanized and utilized in a,Paragraph
"thousand imitations of wood, metal and stone carvings,",Paragraph
exceeding by far the natural limitations of the material they,Paragraph
purport to represent. ... The abundance of means is the first,Paragraph
great danger with which art has to struggle. This expression,Paragraph
"is illogical, | admit (there is no abundance of means but only",Paragraph
"inability to master them); however, it is justified in that it",Paragraph
correctly describes the inverted state of our conditions.>,Paragraph
He then went on to ask:,Paragraph
Where will the depreciation of material that results from its,Paragraph
"treatment by machines, from substitutes for it from so many",Paragraph
"new inventions, lead? And where the depreciation of labour,",Paragraph
"of paintings, of fine art and furnishings, which originates",Paragraph
from the same causes ... How will time or science bring law,Paragraph
and order into this until now thoroughly confused state of,Paragraph
affairs? How will it prevent the general devaluation from,Paragraph
expanding into the area of work which is executed by hand,Paragraph
"in the true old fashion, so that one may find in it more than",Paragraph
"affection, antiquarianism, superficial appearance and",Paragraph
obstinacy?,Title
In this militant and incisive manner Semper raised the,Paragraph
"prime issues of the century, and touched on a range of",Paragraph
cultural problems which even today are far from resolved.,Paragraph
His ideas gradually became integrated into 19th-century,Paragraph
"German cultural theory, largely through the publication of",Paragraph
"his major theoretical text, Der Stil in den technischen und",Paragraph
tektonischen Ktinsten oder praktische Asthetik (‘Style in,Paragraph
industrial and structural arts or practical aesthetics’) of,Paragraph
1860-63.,Caption
His general thesis of the socio-political influence on style,Paragraph
was misunderstood until after the intense industrial,Paragraph
expansion that occurred in Germany during the last quarter,Paragraph
of the century. At the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition of,Caption
1876 German industrial and applied art products were,Title
regarded as inferior to those from England and America.,Paragraph
"Franz Reuleaux, a mechanical engineer, who by then had",Paragraph
been Semper’s colleague for ten years at the,Paragraph
"Eidgendssische Technische Hochschule in Zurich, wrote from",Paragraph
Philadelphia in 1877 that German products were ‘cheap and,Paragraph
nasty’. ‘German industry must relinquish the principles of,Paragraph
competition in price alone’ and instead use ‘the intellectual,Paragraph
power and the skill of the worker to refine the product and,Paragraph
this to a greater degree the more it approaches art’.,Paragraph
For twenty years after the unification of Germany in,Paragraph
"1870, German industry had neither the time nor the cause",Paragraph
to heed such criticism. Under Bismarck’s stable leadership it,Paragraph
was concerned solely with the task of development and,Paragraph
expansion. A crucial factor in this development was the,Paragraph
founding by Emil Rathenau in 1883 of the Allgemeine,Paragraph
Elektricitats Gesellschaft (AEG) in Berlin. This electrical,Paragraph
"company grew, in the space of seven years, into a vast",Paragraph
"industrial combine, with a wide range of products and",Paragraph
interests extending all over the world.,Paragraph
"After the resignation of Bismarck in 1890, a great change",Paragraph
occurred in the cultural climate of Germany. Numerous,Paragraph
critics held that improved design in both craft and industry,Paragraph
"was essential to future prosperity, and that Germany,",Paragraph
without a cheap source of materials or a ready outlet for,Paragraph
"inexpensive goods, could only begin to compete for a share",Paragraph
of the world market with products of exceptionally high,Paragraph
quality. This argument was enlarged upon by the nationalist,Paragraph
and Christian-Social Democract Friedrich Naumann in his,Paragraph
1904 essay Die Kunst im Maschinenzeitalter (‘Art in the,Caption
"Epoch of the Machine’). There he argued, in opposition to",Paragraph
"William Morris’s Luddism, that such quality could only be",Paragraph
"economically achieved by an artistically cultivated people,",Paragraph
orientated towards machine production.,Paragraph
This spur of industrialism and pan-German nationalism,Title
made the Prussian bureaucracy react against the,Paragraph
Philistinism of Wilhelmine Germany and encourage the,Paragraph
incipient Arts and Crafts revival of an ‘intrinsic’ Germanic,Paragraph
"culture. To this end, in 1896, Hermann Muthesius was sent",Paragraph
"to London as an attaché to the German Embassy, with a",Paragraph
charge to study English architecture and design. He,Paragraph
returned to Germany in 1904 and took up the post of privy,Paragraph
"councillor to the Prussian Board of Trade, with a special",Paragraph
assignment to reform the national programme of education,Title
in applied art. This official Kunstgewerbeschule (school of,Paragraph
arts and crafts) reform movement had been anticipated by,Paragraph
Karl Schmidt’s foundation in 1898 of the Dresdner,Paragraph
Werkstatten fur Handwerkskunst (Dresden Workshop for,Paragraph
Manual Art) at Dresden. In 1903 the whole movement had,Paragraph
gained considerable impetus from the appointment of Peter,Paragraph
Behrens as principal of the Dusseldorf Kunstgewerbeschule.,Paragraph
In 1904 Muthesius propagated his ideal model of a native,Paragraph
craft culture in his book Das Englische Haus. For him the,Paragraph
importance of British Arts and Crafts architecture and,Title
furniture lay in its demonstration of craftsmanship and,Paragraph
economy as the basis of good design.,Paragraph
"Two years later, in 1906, as Arbeitskommissar to the third",Paragraph
"German Exhibition of Arts and Crafts in Dresden, Muthesius",Caption
aligned himself with Naumann and Schmidt against the,Paragraph
conservative and protectionist group of artists and,Title
craftsmen known as the Alliance for German Applied Arts by,Paragraph
"severely criticizing the state of applied art in Germany,",Paragraph
while at the same time advocating the adoption of mass,Paragraph
production. In the following year the three men founded the,Paragraph
"Deutsche Werkbund, whose initial membership comprised",Paragraph
twelve independent artists and twelve craft firms. The,Paragraph
"individuals were Peter Behrens, Theodor Fischer, Josef",Paragraph
"Hoffmann, Wilhelm Kreis, Max Laeuger, Adelbert Niemeyer,",Caption
"J. M. Olbrich, Bruno Paul, Richard Riemerschmid, J. J.",Caption
"Scharvolgel, Paul Schultze-Naumburg and Fritz Schumacher.",Paragraph

"Handwerk Munchen, Werkstatten flr deutschen Hausrat",Caption
"Theophil Muller Dresden, Wiener Werkstatten, Wilhelm & Co.",Caption
and Gottlob Wunderlich.,Paragraph
The Werkbund members dedicated themselves to the,Paragraph
betterment of craft education and to the establishment of a,Paragraph
centre for advancing the aims of their institution. As one,Paragraph
might suspect from the heterogeneous nature of the,Paragraph
"founding group, the Werkbund was by no means totally",Paragraph
committed to Muthesius’s ideal of normative design for,Paragraph
industrial production. It is significant that the site first,Paragraph
proposed for the founding ceremony of the Werkbund was in,Paragraph
Nuremburg - the setting of Wagner’s guild opera Die,Title
Meistersinger.,Paragraph
"The subsequent development of the Werkbund,",Paragraph
"particularly in its relationship to industry, is inseparable",Paragraph
from that phase of Behrens’s career which started in 1907,Paragraph
"with his appointment as architect and designer to AEG, for",Paragraph
whom he was to evolve a house style ranging from graphics,Paragraph
to product design and industrial plant [87]. He brought to,Paragraph
this challenging task his innate graphic ability and his,Paragraph
experience as a precocious Jugendstil designer during his,Paragraph
period at the Darmstadt colony in 1899-1903. His,Paragraph
Darmstadt style was to be transformed under the influence,Paragraph
"of the Beuronic monastic school of geometrical proportion,",Paragraph
"as then practised by the Dutch architect J.L.M. Lauweriks,",Paragraph
who joined Behrens in Dusseldorf when the latter became,Paragraph
principal of the applied arts school there in 1903.,Paragraph
"87 Behrens, poster for AEG bulbs, before 1910.",Caption
"Behrens’s ‘empathetic’ manner, his so-called",Paragraph
"‘Zarathustrastil’, was epitomized in his Vorhalle for the Turin",Paragraph
International Exhibition of 1902. Here energetic sinuous line,Paragraph
and expressive arcuated form were combined in an attempt,Paragraph
to evoke the Nietzschean ‘will to form’. This rhetoric gave,Paragraph
"way, under the influence of Lauweriks, to an airless",Paragraph
"atectonic style, first manifest in the pavilions that Behrens",Paragraph
built at Oldenburg in 1905. This Neo-Quattrocento-Beuronic,Paragraph
manner was elaborated by Behrens in his design for a,Paragraph
"crematorium built at Hagen in 1906 and adapted, with Neo-",Paragraph
"Classical overtones, to the pavilion he designed for AEG at",Paragraph
the Berlin shipbuilding exhibition of 1908.,Paragraph
"On joining AEG, Behrens was confronted with the brute",Paragraph
fact of industrial power. In exchange for his youthful visions,Paragraph
of revitalizing German cultural life through an elaborately,Paragraph
"staged mystic ritual, he had to accept industrialization as",Paragraph
"the manifest destiny of the German nation, or, as he",Paragraph
"conceived of it, as the composite issue of Zeitgeist and",Paragraph
"Volksgeist, to which it was his duty as an artist to give form.",Paragraph
Thus the Turbine Factory that he built for AEG in 1909 was a,Paragraph
deliberate reification of industry as the one vital rhythm of,Paragraph
"modern life [88, 89]. Far from being a straightforward",Paragraph
design in iron and glass (such as the 19th-century railway,Paragraph
"shed), Behrens’s Turbine Factory was a conscious work of",Paragraph
"art, a temple to industrial power. While accepting the",Paragraph
ascendancy of science and industry with pessimistic,Title
"resignation, Behrens sought to bring the factory under the",Paragraph
rubric of the farm - to restore to factory production that,Paragraph
"sense of common purpose innate in agriculture, a feeling for",Paragraph
which the newly urbanized semi-skilled labour of Berlin,Paragraph
would supposedly still have a certain nostalgia. How else,Paragraph
should one account for the faceted gable roof of the Turbine,Paragraph
Hall or for the Sittesque farmyard layout of the AEG,Caption
"Brunnenstrasse complex of 1910? On joining AEG, Behrens",Paragraph
"had modified his Oldenburg manner, retaining its formal",Paragraph
strength but dispensing with its rigid geometry. Thus the,Paragraph
light steel frame of the street facade of the Turbine Factory,Caption
is terminated at the ends by solid battered corner elements,Paragraph
whose surfaces are rendered in such a way as to deny any,Paragraph
capacity for sustaining load. This atectonic formula of,Paragraph
flanking light trabeated frames with massive corners,Paragraph
characterizes virtually all the industrial structures that,Paragraph
Behrens designed for AEG. Where the skeletal frame was,Paragraph
"not a functional prerequisite, as in his Neo-Classical German",Paragraph
"Embassy in St Petersburg of 1912, this Schinkelesque corner",Paragraph
emphasis is evident but less pronounced.,Paragraph
"88 Behrens, AEG Factory complex, Berlin, in 1912. Left, the high-voltage works;",Caption
"right, the assembly plant.",Paragraph
"89 Behrens, AEG Turbine Factory, Berlin, 1908-09.",Caption
In 1908 Behrens revealed his essentially conservative,Paragraph
nature in an essay entitled Was ist monumentale Kunst?,Paragraph
"(‘What is Monumental Art?’), where he defined such art as",Paragraph
an expression of the dominant power group in any given,Paragraph
epoch. In this same text he took issue with Semper’s,Paragraph
theoretical derivation of environmental form from technical,Paragraph
and material exigencies. He rejected the importance which,Paragraph
Semper attached to the typical tectonic element - to the,Paragraph
expressive load-bearing column as it appears in Classical,Paragraph
architecture. Instead Behrens was profoundly influenced by,Paragraph
Alois Riegl’s élitist theory of the Kunstwollen or ‘will to form’,Paragraph
which acts through the agency of talented individuals as an,Paragraph
ordained ‘atectonic’ principle. For Riegl this force was,Paragraph
destined to oppose the specific technical propensities of an,Paragraph
"epoch. Consistent with this thesis, Behrens’s contribution to",Paragraph
AEG product design was to be in the realm of style rather,Paragraph
than technique.,Paragraph
"This split between Norm and Form, between type and",Paragraph
"individuality, was soon to preoccupy the Deutsche",Paragraph
Werkbund. The issue came to a head with Hermann,Paragraph
Muthesius’s address to the Werkbund assembly on the,Paragraph
"occasion of the Deutsche Werkbund Exhibition, held in",Paragraph
"Cologne in 1914. Muthesius’s ten-point programme, highly",Paragraph
"influenced by the writings of Naumann, concentrated on the",Paragraph
need for refining typical objects (compare Le Corbusier’s,Paragraph
objet-type). In points 1 and 2 he argued that architecture,Paragraph
and industrial design can attain significance only through,Paragraph
"the development and refinement of types (7Typisierung), and",Paragraph
in points 3-10 he dealt with the national need for products,Paragraph
"of high standard, so that these could be readily sold on the",Paragraph
world market. Point 9 dealt with mass production: ‘A,Paragraph
"precondition for export is the existence of efficient big firms,",Paragraph
whose taste is impeccable. Particular single objects,Paragraph
designed by artists would not even cover the demand in,Paragraph
Germany.’,Paragraph
This opportunistic emphasis on designing cultural objects,Paragraph
for an international middle class was immediately,Paragraph
"challenged by Henry van de Velde who, in presenting his",Paragraph
"counter-thesis, at once rejected ‘export’ art and proclaimed",Paragraph
the essential creative sovereignty of the individual artist. For,Paragraph
"him, as for Behrens, only the natural process of Riegl’s",Paragraph
Kunstwollen could gradually bring about the evolution of a,Paragraph
"civilized Norm. Despite much controversy over this issue,",Paragraph
"there was enough support for Van de Velde’s position, from",Paragraph
"figures as diverse as Walter Gropius and Karl Ernst Osthaus,",Paragraph
for Muthesius to be forced to withdraw his programme. In,Paragraph
his ten-point presentation Muthesius had elaborated his idea,Paragraph
of type as follows: ‘The way from individualism to the,Paragraph
"creation of types is the organic way of development’, he",Paragraph
"argued. ‘This is, today, the way in manufacture, where the",Paragraph
"product ... is steadily being improved’. Again, he declared:",Paragraph
"‘Essentially, architecture tends towards the typical. The type",Paragraph
discards the extraordinary and establishes order.’ Thus for,Paragraph
"Muthesius, as for Semper before him, ‘type’ had two",Paragraph
connotations: the ‘product object’ gradually refined through,Paragraph
"use and production, and the ‘tectonic object’, which was an",Paragraph
irreducible building element functioning as a basic unit of,Paragraph
architectural language.,Paragraph
"The need for such a syntax, in the face of the sudden",Paragraph
"collapse of the Jugendstil, brought most of the architects at",Paragraph
"the 1914 Deutsche Werkbund Exhibition, including",Paragraph
"Muthesius, Behrens and Hoffmann, to express themselves in",Paragraph
the language of a reinterpreted Neo-Classicism. The only,Paragraph
two exceptions to this were Van de Velde’s Werkbund,Paragraph
"Theatre, endowed by his form-force aesthetic with a",Paragraph
"quasitheosophical aura, and its close rival, Bruno Taut’s",Paragraph
"Glass Pavilion, which evoked the ritualistic mysticism of",Paragraph
Behrens’s Turin Vorhalle of 1902.,Paragraph
The 1914 Exhibition introduced to a wide public a new,Paragraph
"generation of Werkbund artists, including in particular",Paragraph
"Gropius and Adolf Meyer, who up to 1910 had worked",Paragraph
together in the office of Behrens. Gropius’s activity between,Paragraph
1910 and 1914 followed along the lines of Behrens’s Berlin,Paragraph
career. In March 1910 he submitted to Emil Rathenau of AEG,Paragraph
"a memorandum on rationalized house production, as",Paragraph
exemplified by workers’ houses that he had projected for,Paragraph
"Janikow in 1906. This text, written by Gropius at the age of",Paragraph
"twenty-six, remains even today one of the most exhaustive",Paragraph
and lucid expositions ever made of the essential,Paragraph
"preconditions for the successful prefabrication, assembly",Paragraph
and distribution of standardized housing units. In 1911 the,Paragraph
new partnership of Gropius and Meyer was commissioned,Paragraph
"by Karl Benscheidt to design the Fagus shoe-last factory, at",Paragraph
Alfeld-an-der-Leine. In 1913 the Deutsche Werkbund,Paragraph
"Jahrbuch carried an article by Gropius on industrial building,",Paragraph
illustrated by grain silos and multistorey factories taken,Caption
from the industrial vernacular of the New World. In the same,Paragraph
"year he started to work as an industrial designer, designing",Paragraph
the bodywork and layout of a diesel locomotive and then,Paragraph
"the interior of a railway sleeping car. Finally, he and Meyer",Paragraph
designed a model factory for the Werkbund Exhibition of,Caption
1914.,Paragraph
"In the Faguswerk, Gropius and Meyer adapted the syntax",Paragraph

Behrens’s corners are invariably of masonry here they are of,Paragraph
"glass. The vertical panels of glazing, set forward from the",Caption
"battered brick facing, give the illusion of being miraculously",Paragraph
suspended from the upstand at roof level. This ‘pendant’,Paragraph
"effect, plus the translucent corner, inverts the composition",Paragraph
"of the Turbine Factory, the sheer planar quality of the",Paragraph
vertical glass facade being accentuated by the ‘Classical’,Paragraph
entasis of the brick-faced frame. Despite such,Paragraph
"transpositions, the Faguswerk, with its atectonic glazing and",Paragraph

to characterize all the public work of Gropius and Meyer up,Paragraph
to Gropius’s design for the Dessau Bauhaus in 1924.,Paragraph
Certainly it was the stratagem adopted in their model,Paragraph
factory complex designed for the Werkbund Exhibition of,Paragraph
1914 [90]. Here the corporeality of the glass skin was,Paragraph
developed as a continuous membrane to embrace spiral,Paragraph
staircases at either end of the building. Within this sheer,Paragraph
"glass envelope stood a brick armature, its separateness",Paragraph
"being accentuated by two end pavilions, each capped by a",Paragraph
flat roof overhang after the style of Frank Lloyd Wright. In,Paragraph
spite of this dramatic reversal of the roles of glass and,Paragraph
"masonry, the factory layout was highly conventional, not",Paragraph
only in its axiality but also in its hierarchic and syntactical,Paragraph
separation into ‘administrative’ and ‘productive’ elements.,Paragraph
"The public, ‘Classical’, ‘white-collar’ fagade was placed to",Paragraph
"the fore, thus screening the private, utilitarian, ‘blue-collar’",Paragraph

to Behrens.,Paragraph

The split between Muthesius and Van de Velde effectively,Paragraph
exposed the reactionary spirit that was already evident in,Paragraph
much of the Werkbund work by the time of the 1914,Paragraph
Exhibition. Whereas the yearbooks of 1913 and 1914 were,Paragraph
"respectively devoted to ‘Art in Industry and Trade’, and",Paragraph
‘Transport’ recording the design of the furnishing of,Paragraph
"industrial structures, rolling stock, shipping and aircraft, the",Title

"War Year’, and nostalgically devoted its pages to the",Paragraph
predominantly Neo-Biedermeier work of the 1914 Exhibition.,Paragraph
That the promise and triumph of a progressive industrial,Paragraph
state would soon be consumed by an industrialized war,Paragraph
seems hardly to have been foreseen. This tragedy was not,Paragraph
to be transcended by the quality of the war graves that the,Paragraph
"Werkbund artists were commissioned to design, which",Paragraph
formed the exclusive subject of the Werkbund yearbook,Paragraph
issued in 1916/17.,Paragraph
"After the war Behrens was a changed man, for the",Paragraph
Volksgeist was patently no longer the same. Accordingly he,Paragraph
gave up his frigid Classicism and his preoccupation with,Paragraph
symbolizing the authority of industrial power. His renewed,Paragraph
search for an art of building which would express the true,Paragraph
"spirit of the German people led back, via the pages of Bruno",Paragraph
"Taut’s magazine Fruhlicht, beyond Behrens’s own Neo-",Paragraph
Romantic Nietzschean past to forms of medieval origin and,Paragraph
"association. However, his faith in the redeeming power of",Paragraph
Riegl’s ‘will to form’ remained unshaken. When I.G. Farben,Paragraph
commissioned him to design their new premises at,Paragraph
Frankfurt-Héchst in 1920 he attempted in a brick and stone,Paragraph
structure to reinterpret the lost syntax of medieval civic,Paragraph
architecture. The building has at its core a mystic space of,Paragraph
public ritual and renewal (going back to Behrens’s Turin,Title
Vorhalle of 1902) in the form of a faceted five-storey hall of,Paragraph
"corbelled brickwork, capped by a crystalline roof light. This",Paragraph
was an allusion to that theatrical space of public,Paragraph
"appearance which had inspired his youth, to the",Paragraph
"Kultursymbol that obsessed, with equal intensity, the",Paragraph
members of Bruno Taut’s Glass Chain (see Chapter 13). A,Paragraph
similar impulse informed his small exhibition structures of,Paragraph
the 1920s - his steeply pitched Dombauhitte (cathedral,Paragraph
"masons’ lodge) with its diagonal banded brickwork,",Paragraph
"designed for the Munich Kunstgewerbeschau of 1922, and",Paragraph
his Wrightian glass conservatory built for the Paris,Paragraph
Exposition des Arts Décoratifs in 1925. From then on,Paragraph
"Behrens’s work was to remain close to the Art Deco style,",Paragraph
while the future of the Deutsche Werkbund was to be,Paragraph
"inseparable from the Neue Sachlichkeit movement, which",Paragraph

Paul Scheerbart,Title
"Glasarchitektur, 19141",Caption
The poet Paul Scheerbart’s vision of a culture elevated,Paragraph
through the use of glass served to consolidate those,Paragraph
aspirations towards a non-repressive sensibility that had,Paragraph
first emerged in Munich in 1909 with the foundation of the,Paragraph
Neue Kunstler Vereinigung. This proto-Expressionist art,Paragraph
"movement, led by the painter Wassily Kandinsky, gained",Paragraph
immediate support in the following year from two anarchist,Paragraph
"publications, Herwarth Walden’s journal Der Sturm and",Paragraph
Franz Pfemfert’s paper Die Aktion. These Berlin journals,Paragraph
"promoted a counterculture, in opposition to the state culture",Paragraph
that had been initiated with the foundation of the Deutsche,Paragraph
Werkbund. In 1907 Scheerbart had independently proffered,Paragraph
a ‘science-fiction’ image of a utopian future that was equally,Paragraph
inimical to both bourgeois reformism and the culture of the,Paragraph
industrial state.,Paragraph
The Cologne Werkbund Exhibition in 1914 gave,Paragraph
expression to an ideological split within the Werkbund,Paragraph
between the collective acceptance of normative form,Title
"(Typisierung), on the one hand, and the individually",Paragraph
"asserted, expressive ‘will to form’ (Kunstwollen) on the",Paragraph
"other. This opposition, reflected in the contrast between",Paragraph
Behrens’s Neo-Classical Festhalle and the organic form of,Paragraph
"Van de Velde’s theatre, was comparable in many respects to",Paragraph
the difference between the Gropius and Meyer model,Paragraph
factory and Bruno Taut’s phantasmagoric pavilion for the,Paragraph
"glass industry [91], a parallelism which confirms that the",Paragraph
split affected more than one generation of Werkbund,Paragraph
designers. Where Behrens and Gropius tended towards the,Paragraph
"normative mode, that is, the Classical, Van de Velde and",Paragraph
Taut in their buildings manifested a freely expressed,Paragraph
Kunstwollen.,Paragraph
"91 Taut, Glass Pavilion, Werkbund Exhibition, Cologne, 1914. Elevation and plan.",Caption
The aphoristic text of Scheerbart’s Glasarchitektur was,Paragraph
"dedicated to Taut, whose Glass Pavilion was inscribed with",Paragraph
Scheerbart’s aphorisms: ‘Light wants crystal’; ‘Glass brings,Paragraph
a new era’; ‘We feel sorry for the brick culture’; ‘Without a,Paragraph
"glass palace, life becomes a burden’; ‘Building in brick only",Paragraph
does us harm’; ‘Coloured glass destroys hatred’. These,Paragraph
words dedicated Taut’s pavilion to the light that filtered,Paragraph
through its faceted cupola and glass-block walls to,Paragraph
"illuminate an axial seven-tiered chamber, lined with glass",Caption
"mosaic. According to Taut this crystalline structure,",Paragraph
"modelled after his Leipzig Steel Pavilion of 1913, had been",Paragraph
designed in the spirit of a Gothic cathedral. It was in effect a,Paragraph
"Stadtkrone or ‘city crown’, that pyramidal form postulated",Paragraph
"by Taut as the universal paradigm of all religious building,",Paragraph
which together with the faith it would inspire was an,Paragraph
essential urban element for the restructuring of society.,Paragraph
The socio-cultural implications of Scheerbart’s vision,Title
were enlarged on in 1918 by the architect Adolf Behne:,Paragraph
lt is not the crazy caprice of a poet that glass architecture,Paragraph
will bring a new culture. It is a fact! New social welfare,Paragraph
"organizations, hospitals, inventions, or technical innovations",Title
and improvements - these will not bring a new culture- but,Paragraph
"glass architecture will. ... Therefore, the European is right",Paragraph
when he fears that glass architecture might become,Paragraph
"uncomfortable. Certainly, it will be so. And that is not its",Paragraph
least advantage. For first of all the European must be,Paragraph
wrenched out of his cosiness.?,Paragraph
"With the armistice of November 1918, Taut and Behne",Paragraph
"began to organize the Arbeitsrat fur Kunst, which eventually",Paragraph
merged with the somewhat larger Novembergruppe formed,Paragraph
at the same time. This Workers’ Council for Art declared its,Paragraph
basic aims in Taut’s Architektur-programm of December,Paragraph
"1918, which argued for a new total work of art, to be",Paragraph
created with the active participation of the people. In the,Paragraph
spring of 1919 the manifesto of the Arbeitsrat fur Kunst,Title
reasserted this general principle: ‘Art and people must form,Paragraph
"an entity. Art shall no longer be a luxury of the few, but",Paragraph
should be enjoyed and experienced by the broad masses.,Paragraph

The suppression of the Spartacist Revolt in 1919 put an,Paragraph
"end to the overt activities of the Arbeitsrat fiir Kunst, and",Paragraph
the energies of the group were channelled into a series of,Paragraph
"letters, known as ‘Die Glaserne Kette’ or the Glass Chain.",Paragraph
"This was Bruno Taut’s ‘Utopian Correspondence,’ which",Paragraph
began in November 1919 after his suggestion that,Paragraph
‘everyone of us will draw or write down at brief intervals of,Paragraph
"time, informally and as the spirit moves him ... those ideas",Paragraph
which he would like to share with our circle.’ The,Paragraph
"correspondence involved fourteen people, of whom only",Paragraph
about half created works of enduring importance. Apart,Paragraph
"from Taut, who called himself G/as, there was Gropius",Paragraph
"(Mass), Finsterlin (Prometh), and Bruno Taut’s brother Max,",Paragraph
who wrote under his own name. This inner circle was,Paragraph
complemented by architects who had previously only had a,Paragraph
"peripheral involvement with the Arbeitsrat, notably the",Paragraph
brothers Hans and Wassili Luckhardt and Hans Scharoun.,Paragraph
Apart from providing material for Taut’s magazine Fruihlicht,Paragraph
"(‘Early Light’), the Utopian Correspondence served to",Paragraph
expose and develop the various attitudes represented by,Paragraph
the circle. Taut and Scharoun especially stressed the,Paragraph
"important creative role of the unconscious, Scharoun writing",Paragraph
in 1919:,Title
We must create just as the blood of our ancestors brought,Paragraph
on waves of creativity; and we shall be content if we are,Paragraph
ourselves thereafter able to reveal a complete,Paragraph
comprehension of the character and the causality of our,Title
creations.°,Paragraph
"By 1920, however, the solidarity of the Glass Chain",Paragraph
"began to break, with Hans Luckhardat’s recognition that free",Paragraph
unconscious form and rational prefabricated production,Title
were in certain respects incompatible. In that year he wrote:,Paragraph
Opposite to this profoundly spiritual striving is the trend,Paragraph
toward automatic processes. The invention of the Taylor,Paragraph
System is a typical characteristic of this. It would be,Paragraph
completely erroneous to refuse to recognize this tendency,Paragraph
"of the time, as it is a historic fact. Moreover, it can in no way",Paragraph
be proven to be hostile toward art.®,Paragraph
While Luckhardt’s rationalism had the effect of returning,Paragraph
the debate to the issues that had divided the Werkbund in,Paragraph
"1914, Taut maintained the Scheerbartian views first",Paragraph
expressed in books such as Alpine Architektur and Die,Paragraph
"Stadtkrone of 1919, publishing his famous Die Auflésung der",Paragraph
Stadte (‘The dissolution of cities’) in 1920. In common with,Paragraph
"the socialist planners of the Russian Revolution, he",Paragraph
recommended the break-up of cities and the return of the,Paragraph
"urbanized population to the land. At his most practical, he",Paragraph
attempted to formulate models for agrarian and handicraft-,Paragraph
"based communities; at his most fantastic, he projected the",Paragraph
building of glass temples in the Alps. Typical of Taut’s,Paragraph
"Kropotkinian propositions was his model of a circular,",Paragraph
"radially subdivided, agricultural settlement. In its core were",Paragraph
"three separate residential sections, one for each class of",Paragraph
"citizen - Ktinder, Kunstler und Kinder (the ‘enlightened’,",Paragraph
artists and children) - each grouped around lozenge-shaped,Paragraph
courts. This tripartite organization led axially to the central,Paragraph
"crystalline ‘Haus des Himmels’ or ‘House of Heaven’, where",Paragraph
the governors of the community convened. It is one of the,Paragraph
"paradoxes of Taut’s anarchic socialism that the hierarchic,",Paragraph
"not to say authoritarian, social institutions imagined for",Paragraph
these communities contained the seeds of a fascism that,Paragraph
was soon to find its vulgarization in the ‘blood and soil’,Paragraph
culture of the National Socialist movement.,Paragraph
"After becoming city architect to Magdeburg in 1921, Taut",Paragraph
attempted to realize his Stadtkrone in the form of a,Paragraph
"municipal exhibition hall, designed in the following year. By",Caption
"that date, however, the movement propagated by Frehlicht",Paragraph
"was losing its impetus. Taut, like Hans Luckhardt before him,",Paragraph
was beginning to come to terms with the harsh reality of the,Paragraph
"Weimar Republic, where pragmatic social need gave little",Paragraph
scope for the achievement of Scheerbart’s glass paradise.,Paragraph
"This much became explicit in 1923, when he started to work",Paragraph
with his brother on the design of the first low-cost housing,Paragraph
schemes commissioned by the government.,Paragraph
"Paradoxically, it was not Taut but Hans Poelzig who was",Paragraph
to realize the quintessential image of the crystalline ‘city,Paragraph
"crown’. The 5,000-seat theatre that he designed for Max",Paragraph
Reinhardt in Berlin in 1919 [92] came closer to Scheerbart,Paragraph
"in its scintillating, luminous dissolution of form and space",Paragraph
than any post-war achievement by Taut. Of its fantastic,Paragraph
"stalactite interior, Wassili Luckhardt wrote:",Paragraph
"92 Poelzig, Grosse Schauspielhaus, Berlin, 1919.",Caption
The interior of the large dome is hung with an infinite,Paragraph
variety of pendants which are given a softly curving,Paragraph
movement by the hollow of the cupola onto which they are,Paragraph
fastened so that especially when light is thrown against the,Paragraph
"tiny reflectors on each tip, the impression of a certain",Paragraph
dissolution and infinity results.’,Paragraph
After establishing himself as an architect in Breslau in,Paragraph
"1911, Poelzig had realized two seminal works which",Paragraph
anticipated the later formal language of both Taut and,Paragraph
Mendelsohn: a water tower for Posen (a Stadtkrone image if,Caption
"ever there was one) and an office building for Breslau, which",Paragraph
led to the architectural format of Mendelsohn’s Berliner-,Paragraph
"Tageblatt building of 1921. In addition, Poelzig’s highly",Paragraph
articulated brick chemical plant built at Luban in 1912 came,Paragraph
close to rivalling the industrial style that Behrens had just,Paragraph
invented for AEG.,Paragraph
"After the war, in his address as chairman of the",Paragraph
"Werkbund in 1919, Poelzig returned to the controversy over",Paragraph
Typisierung and effectively argued yet again for the,Paragraph
"principle of the Kunstwollen. A year later, he announced his",Paragraph
"affinity with the artists of the Glass Chain, in his Salzburg",Paragraph
Festspielhaus project where his newly invented pendentive,Paragraph
motif was piled up into a Stadtkrone image of heroic,Paragraph
proportions. As in his Istanbul ‘Freundschaftshaus’ (House of,Paragraph
"Friendship) project of 1917, these arched forms were",Paragraph
assembled in such a way as to create a ziggurat whose,Paragraph
interior was a prismatic cavern made up entirely of,Paragraph
pendentive elements. Apart from his sets for Paul Wegener’s,Paragraph
"film The Golem (1920), the Schauspielhaus for Reinhardt",Caption
"was Poelzig’s last fully Expressionist work. By 1925, with his",Paragraph
"Capitol Cinema for Berlin, he had already returned to the",Paragraph
crypto-Classical fold.,Paragraph
Mendelsohn realized his own version of the Stadtkrone in,Paragraph
the observatory that he built for Albert Einstein at Potsdam,Paragraph
in 1917-21 [93]. Combining as it did the sculptural forms of,Paragraph
Van de Velde’s Werkbund Theatre and the overall profile of,Paragraph
"Bruno Taut’s Glass Pavilion, the design’s point of departure",Paragraph
"lay in the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition. In its final silhouette,",Paragraph
"however, the Einstein Tower displayed a certain formal",Paragraph
affinity to the thatched-roof vernacular of the Dutch,Paragraph
"architects Eibink and Snellebrand, who, with Theo",Paragraph
"Wijdeveld, represented the extreme organic wing of Dutch",Paragraph
"Expressionism, centred around Wijdeveld’s magazine",Paragraph
"Wendingen (‘Turnings’). It is hardly surprising, therefore,",Paragraph
that soon after the completion of the observatory,Paragraph
"Mendelsohn visited Holland, at Wijdeveld’s invitation, to see",Paragraph
the work of the Wendingen circle for himself. In Amsterdam,Caption
he visited a number of Expressionist housing schemes which,Paragraph
"were then under construction, as part of Berlage’s plan for",Paragraph
"Amsterdam South, including Michel de Klerk’s Eigen Haard",Paragraph
(1913-19) and Piet Kramer’s De Dageraad (1918-23).,Paragraph
"Executed in moulded brickwork and tile hanging, they",Paragraph
exemplified a much more structural approach than the,Paragraph
highly plastic and folkish preoccupations of Wijdeveld’s,Paragraph
‘vernacular’ architects. Outside the Amsterdam School of,Paragraph
"Wijdeveld, De Klerk and Kramer, Mendelsohn met and was",Paragraph
influenced by a number of Dutch architects of quite different,Paragraph
"persuasion, such as the rationalist Rotterdam architect J.J.P.",Paragraph
"Oud and the Wrightian architect W.M. Dudok, practising in",Paragraph
"Hilversum. In a letter to his wife, Mendelsohn explained how",Paragraph
neither the Amsterdam nor the Rotterdam school met with,Paragraph
his full approval:,Paragraph
"93 Mendelsohn, Einstein Tower, Potsdam, 1917-21. Front and side elevations",Caption
and half-plan.,Paragraph
Analytical Rotterdam refuses vision; visionary Amsterdam,Title
does not understand objectivity. Certainly the primary,Paragraph
element is function but function without sensibility remains,Paragraph
mere construction. More than ever | stand by my,Paragraph
"reconciliatory programme. ... Otherwise, Rotterdam will",Paragraph
"pursue the way of mere construction, with deathly chill in its",Paragraph
"veins, and Amsterdam will be destroyed by the fire of its",Paragraph
own dynamicism. Function plus dynamics is the challenge.®,Paragraph
"As this letter suggests, the more structural of the Dutch",Paragraph
Expressionists had an immediate impact on Mendelsohn’s,Paragraph
own development: after his visit to Holland he turned from,Paragraph
the plasticity of his Potsdam observatory towards a concern,Paragraph
for the intrinsic structural expressiveness of materials. The,Paragraph
hat factory that he built at Luckenwalde in 1921-23 [94],Caption
reflects this influence. Its ridged and pitched-roofed dye,Paragraph
"shop and production sheds, modelled in the manner of De",Paragraph
"Klerk, stood in strong contrast to the smooth flat-roofed",Paragraph
power house whose layered ‘cubist’ expression in brick and,Paragraph
concrete recalls the early work of Dudok. The principle,Paragraph
"established here, of setting dramatic tall pitched industrial",Paragraph
"forms against horizontal administrative elements, was",Paragraph
repeated by Mendelsohn in his Leningrad textile mill project,Paragraph
"of 1925. In this instance, however, a further step was taken,",Paragraph

anticipated the profiling of his metropolitan department,Paragraph
"stores, built in Breslau, Stuttgart, Chemnitz and Berlin",Paragraph
"between 1927 and 1931 [95]. From now on, as Reyner",Paragraph

"In the masterwork of Hugo Haring, the farm complex at",Paragraph
"Garkau near Lubeck built in 1924 [96], we find a somewhat",Paragraph
similar expressive use of pitched-roof forms contrasted with,Paragraph
bulky tectonic elements and rounded corners. A few years,Paragraph
"earlier, Haring had shared an office in Berlin with Ludwig",Paragraph
"Mies van der Rohe, who was four years his junior, and there",Paragraph
is evidence that for a brief while the two men exercised a,Paragraph
certain influence on each other. This is particularly,Paragraph
noticeable in their entries to the famous Friedrichstrasse,Paragraph
"office building competition of 1921, where they adopted a",Paragraph
similar organic approach to the genesis of form. As one,Paragraph
"might expect, however, it was Mies rather than Haring who",Paragraph
put forward a structure made entirely of glass. Mies’s,Paragraph
Scheerbartian obsession with the reflectivity of this material,Paragraph
also manifested itself in an extraordinary project for a glass,Paragraph
skyscraper which was published in 1922 in the last issue of,Paragraph
Taut’s magazine Frtihlicht.,Paragraph
"96 Haring, farm at Garkau, 1924. Buildings for animals (upper left) and barns.",Caption
"Although Haring, like Mendelsohn, believed in the",Paragraph

primitive nature of mere utility by evolving his forms from a,Paragraph
more profound understanding of the programme. Like,Paragraph
"Scharoun, however, his attitude to massing was often",Paragraph
"naively imitative of biological form. In this respect, one may",Paragraph
see Scharoun’s Home and Work Exhibition building at,Caption
Breslau of 1928 as influenced by Haring’s Prinz Albrecht,Paragraph
Garten residential project of 1924. Despite an overtly,Paragraph
"Expressionist tendency, Haring remained preoccupied with",Paragraph
"the inner source of form, with that which he termed the",Paragraph
"Organwerk or the programmatic essence of the ‘organism’,",Paragraph
as opposed to its surface expression or Gesta/twerk. Of this,Paragraph
duality he wrote:,Paragraph
We now attempt not to allow our attitudes towards function,Paragraph
"to conflict with our needs for expression, but to keep them",Paragraph
side by side. We try to relate our ideas about expression to,Paragraph
"life, creation, movement and nature; for in our creation of",Paragraph
functional forms we follow the path of nature. In nature form,Paragraph
is the result of the organisation of many individual entities in,Paragraph
"space in order that life can unfold and action take place, a",Paragraph
"fulfilment of both part and whole, (whereas in the world of",Paragraph
geometrical cultures form is derived from laws of geometry).,Paragraph
lf we prefer to search for shapes rather than to impose,Paragraph

are in harmony with nature and act with her rather than,Paragraph
against her?,Title
At the Berlin Secession Exhibition in 1923 Hans and,Paragraph
"Wassili Luckhardt, with Mies and some of his",Paragraph
"contemporaries, had begun to show a more functional and",Paragraph
"objective mode of building, a development which led in the",Paragraph
"following year to their formation of the Zehnerring. By 1925,",Paragraph

"In 1928, however, when this battle had been won,",Paragraph
Haring’s concern for the ‘organic’ naturally led him into,Paragraph
"conflict with Le Corbusier when, as secretary of Der Ring, he",Paragraph
participated in the foundation of the Congrés Internationaux,Paragraph
"d’Architecture Moderne, at La Sarraz, Switzerland. While Le",Caption
Corbusier here proclaimed an architecture of functionalism,Paragraph
"and pure geometrical form, Haring tried in vain to win the",Paragraph
Congress over to his own conception of ‘organic’ building.,Paragraph
"His failure to do so not only emphasized the non-normative,",Paragraph
‘place’-orientated nature of his approach but also denoted,Paragraph
the final eclipse of the Scheerbartian dream. For all that,Paragraph

This anarchic reworking of the Gesamtkunstwerk ideal,Paragraph
was elaborated by Gropius first in the pamphlet written in,Paragraph
"April 1919 for the ‘Exhibition of Unknown Architects’,",Caption
"organized by the Arbeitsrat fur Kunst, and then in his",Paragraph
Bauhaus Proclamation of about the same date. Where the,Paragraph
one called on all fine artists to reject salon art and to return,Paragraph
to the crafts in the service of a metaphorical cathedral of,Paragraph

tales ... and build in fantasy without regard for technical,Paragraph
difficulty’ - the other exhorted the members of the Bauhaus,Paragraph
"‘to create a new guild of craftsmen, without the class",Paragraph
distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between,Paragraph
craftsman and artist’.,Paragraph
"Even the word Bauhaus, which Gropius persuaded the",Paragraph
reluctant state government to adopt as the official title of,Paragraph
"the new institution, intentionally recalled the medieval",Paragraph
Bauhutte or masons’ lodge. That such connotations were,Paragraph
deliberate is confirmed by a letter written by Oskar,Paragraph
Schlemmer in 1922:,Title
Originally the Bauhaus was founded with visions of erecting,Paragraph
the cathedral of socialism and the workshops were,Paragraph
established in the manner of the cathedral building lodges,Paragraph
[Dombauhttten]. The idea of the cathedral has for the time,Paragraph
being receded into the background and with it certain,Paragraph
definite ideas of an artistic nature. Today we must think at,Paragraph
"best in terms of the house, perhaps even only think so. ... in",Paragraph
"the face of the economic plight, it is our task to become",Paragraph
"pioneers of simplicity, that is, to find a simple form for all",Paragraph
"life’s necessities, which at the same time is respectable and",Paragraph
genuine.2,Paragraph
For the first three years of its existence the Bauhaus was,Paragraph
dominated by the charismatic presence of the Swiss painter,Paragraph
"and teacher Johannes Itten, who arrived in the autumn of",Paragraph
1919. Three years earlier he had started his own art school,Paragraph
"in Vienna, under the influence of Franz Cizek. In a highly",Paragraph
"charged milieu, coloured by the anarchic anti-Seccessionist",Paragraph
activities of the painter Oskar Kokoschka and the architect,Paragraph
"Adolf Loos, Cizek had developed a unique system of",Paragraph
instruction based on stimulating individual creativity,Title
through the making of collages of different materials and,Paragraph
textures. His methods had matured in a cultural climate,Paragraph
"impregnated with progressive educational theory, from the",Paragraph
systems of Froebel and Montessori to the ‘learning-through-,Paragraph
"doing’ movement, initiated by the American John Dewey",Paragraph
and vigorously propagated in Germany after 1908 by the,Paragraph
educational reformer Georg Kerschensteiner. The teaching,Paragraph
"in Itten’s Viennese school and in the Vorkurs, or preliminary",Paragraph
"course, that he initiated in the Bauhaus was derived from",Paragraph
"Cizek, although Itten enriched the method with the form and",Paragraph
colour theory of his own master Adolf Hélzel. The aims of,Paragraph
"Itten’s foundation course, mandatory for all first-year",Paragraph
"students, were to release individual creativity and to enable",Paragraph
each student to assess his own particular ability.,Paragraph
"Up to 1920, when, at Itten’s request, the artists",Paragraph
"Schlemmer, Paul Klee and Georg Muche joined the Bauhaus,",Paragraph
"he taught, single-handed, four separate craft courses in",Paragraph
"addition to the Vorkurs, while Gerhard Marcks and Lyonel",Paragraph
Feininger gave marginal courses in ceramics and printing,Paragraph
respectively. Itten’s anarchic position at the time may be,Paragraph
gleaned from his 1922 response to a referendum on the,Paragraph
provision of state welfare for artists:,Title
The mind stands outside any organization. Where it has,Paragraph
"nevertheless been organized (religion, church), it has",Paragraph
become estranged from its innate nature. ... The state,Paragraph
should take care that none of its citizens starve but it should,Paragraph
not support art.3,Title
"Itten’s anti-authoritarian, even mystical, position was",Paragraph
substantially reinforced in 1921 by his extended stay in the,Paragraph
Mazdaznan centre at Herrliberg near Zurich [98]. He,Paragraph
returned in the middle of the year to convert his pupils and,Paragraph
his colleague Muche to the rigours of this updated version of,Paragraph
an archaic Persian religion. The cult demanded an austere,Paragraph
"lifestyle, periodic fasting, and a vegetarian diet flavoured",Paragraph
with cheese and garlic. The physical and spiritual well-being,Paragraph
deemed to be essential to creativity was further assured by,Paragraph
breathing and relaxation exercises. Of this inner-directed,Paragraph
orientation Itten later wrote:,Paragraph
"98 Itten, in the Mazdaznan work costume that he designed, 1921.",Caption
The terrible losses and horrible events of World War | and a,Title
close study of Spengler’s Decline of the West made me,Paragraph
realize that we had reached a crucial point in our scientific-,Paragraph
"technological civilization. For me, it was not enough to",Paragraph
"embrace the slogans ‘return to craft’ or ‘art and technology,",Paragraph
"hand in hand’. | studied Eastern philosophy, delved into",Paragraph
"Persian Mazdaism and Indian yoga teachings, and compared",Paragraph
them with early Christianity. | reached the conclusion that,Paragraph
we must counter-balance our externally-orientated scientific,Paragraph
research and technological speculation with inner-directed,Title
"thought and practice. | searched for something, for myself",Paragraph
"and my work, on which to base a new way of life.",Paragraph
The growing division between Gropius and Itten was,Paragraph
exacerbated by the appearance in Weimar of two equally,Paragraph
powerful personalities: the Dutch De Stijl artist Theo van,Title
"Doesburg, who took up residence in the winter of 1921, and",Paragraph
"the Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, who joined the",Paragraph
"Bauhaus, at Itten’s instigation, in the summer of 1922.",Paragraph
"Where the former postulated a rational, anti-individualist",Paragraph
"aesthetic, the latter taught an emotive and ultimately",Paragraph
mystical approach to art. Although the two men did not,Paragraph
"come into direct conflict, Van Doesburg’s extramural De Stijl",Paragraph
polemic instantly appealed to many Bauhaus students. His,Paragraph
teaching not only had an immediate impact on the,Paragraph
"production of the workshops, but also directly challenged",Paragraph
the open-ended precepts of the original Bauhaus,Paragraph
programme. His influence was even reflected in the,Paragraph
"furnishing of Gropius’s own office, and in the asymmetrical",Paragraph
composition [99] of Gropius’s entry for the 1922 Chicago,Caption
"Tribune competition, designed with Adolf Meyer.",Paragraph
"99 Gropius and A. Meyer, project for the Chicago Tribune Building, 1922.",Caption
"In 1922, after Van Doesburg had been proselytizing for",Paragraph
"nine months, the generally critical socio-economic situation",Paragraph
brought Gropius to modify the craft orientation of the,Paragraph
original programme. His initial attack on Itten appeared in,Paragraph
"his circular to the Bauhaus masters, where he indirectly",Paragraph
criticized Itten’s monastic rejection of the world. This text,Paragraph
was in effect a draft for his essay /dee und Aufbau des,Paragraph
Staatlichen Bauhauses Weimar (‘The Theory and,Title
"Organization of the Bauhaus’), published on the occasion of",Paragraph
the first Bauhaus exhibition held in Weimar in 1923. He,Paragraph
wrote:,Title
The teaching of craft is meant to prepare for designing for,Paragraph
mass production. Starting with the simplest tools and least,Paragraph
"complicated jobs, he [the Bauhaus apprentice] gradually",Paragraph
acquires ability to master more intricate problems and to,Paragraph
"work with machines, while at the same time he keeps in",Paragraph
touch with the entire process of production from start to,Paragraph
finish.4,Paragraph
This carefully worded argument by Gropius for the,Paragraph
reconciliation of craft design and industrial production,Title
brought about Itten’s immediate resignation.,Paragraph
His position on the faculty was immediately filled by the,Paragraph
Hungarian artist and social radical Laszl6 Moholy-Nagy. On,Caption
his arrival in Berlin in 1921 (as a refugee from the short-,Paragraph
"lived Hungarian revolution), Moholy-Nagy had come into",Paragraph
"contact with the Russian designer El Lissitzky, who was then",Paragraph
in Germany for the preparations of the Russian Exhibition of,Paragraph
1922. This encounter encouraged him to pursue his own,Paragraph
"Constructivist leanings, and from this date forward his",Paragraph
"paintings featured Suprematist elements, those modular",Paragraph
crosses and rectangles soon to become the substance of his,Paragraph
"famous ‘telephone’ pictures, executed in enamelled steel.",Caption
Of these he wrote:,Paragraph
In 1922 | ordered by telephone from a sign factory five,Paragraph
paintings in porcelain enamel. | had the factory’s colour,Paragraph
chart before me and | sketched my paintings on graph,Paragraph
paper. At the other end of the telephone the factory,Paragraph
supervisor had the same kind of paper divided into squares.,Paragraph
He took down the dictated shapes in the correct position.>,Paragraph
This spectacular demonstration of programmed art,Title
"production seems to have impressed Gropius, for in the",Paragraph
following year he invited Moholy-Nagy to take over both the,Paragraph
preliminary course and the metal workshop. Under Moholy-,Caption
Nagy’s leadership the products of the latter were at once,Paragraph
"orientated towards a ‘Constructivist Elementarism’, which",Paragraph
was tempered over the years by a mature concern for the,Paragraph
convenience of the objects produced. In the meantime he,Paragraph
"introduced into the preliminary course, which he shared with",Paragraph
"Josef Albers, exercises in equilibrium structures in a variety",Paragraph
"of materials, including wood, metal, wire and glass. The aim",Paragraph
was no longer to demonstrate a feeling for contrasting,Paragraph
"materials and forms, usually assembled as reliefs, but rather",Paragraph
to reveal the statical and aesthetic properties of free-,Paragraph
standing asymmetrical structures. The epitome of such,Paragraph
‘exercises’ was the building of his own ‘Light-Space,Paragraph
"Modulator’, on which he was to be occupied from 1922 to",Paragraph
1930.,Paragraph
"The ‘Constructivist Elementarist’ style, which Moholy-",Paragraph
Nagy had partly derived from the Vkhutemas (Higher,Paragraph
"Technical and Artistic Studios) of the Soviet Union, was",Paragraph
complemented elsewhere in the Bauhaus by the De Stijl,Paragraph
influence of Van Doesburg and by a post-Cubist approach to,Paragraph
"form, as evidenced in the sculpture workshops under",Paragraph
Schlemmer’s direction from 1922. An early manifestation of,Paragraph
"this ‘Elementarist’ aesthetic, instantly adopted as a house",Paragraph
"style after Itten’s resignation, was the sans serif typography",Paragraph
used by Herbert Bayer and Joost Schmidt for the Bauhaus,Paragraph
Exhibition of 1923.,Paragraph
"Two model houses, largely built and furnished by the",Paragraph
"Bauhaus workshops, characterize this period of transition,",Paragraph
revealing common elements and striking dissimilarities.,Paragraph
"They are the Sommerfeld House, designed by Gropius and",Paragraph
"Meyer and completed in Berlin-Dahlem in 1922, and the",Paragraph
"Bauhaus ‘Versuchshaus’ or Experimental House, designed",Paragraph
by Muche and Meyer for the Bauhaus Exhibition of 1923,Caption
[100]. Where the first was designed as a traditional,Paragraph
"Heimatstil log house, with an interior enriched with carved",Caption
"wood and stained glass so as to create a Gesarntkunstwerk,",Paragraph
"the second was conceived as a sachlich, smoothly rendered",Paragraph
"object, furnished with the latest labour-saving devices so as",Paragraph
"to be a Wohnmaschine, or living machine. This minimum-",Paragraph
circulation house was organized around an ‘atrium’ - not an,Paragraph
open court but a clerestory-lit living-room surrounded on all,Paragraph
sides by bedrooms and other ancillary spaces. Each of these,Paragraph
"perimeter rooms was equipped in an austere manner, with",Paragraph
"exposed metal radiators, steel windows and door frames,",Caption
"elemental furniture, and unshaded tubular light fittings.",Paragraph
While most of these pieces were handmade in the Bauhaus,Paragraph
"workshops, Adolf Meyer, in his report on the house in",Paragraph
"Bauhausbucher 3 (1923), emphasized its furnishing with",Paragraph
standard bathroom and kitchen equipment and its,Title
construction with entirely new materials and methods.,Paragraph
"100 Muche and A. Meyer, Experimental House, Bauhaus Exhibition, Weimar,",Caption
1923.,Paragraph
The changing ideology of the Bauhaus was further,Paragraph
demonstrated in an article by Gropius in the same issue of,Paragraph
"Bauhausbucher, entitled ‘Wohnhaus-Industrie’, it illustrated",Paragraph
"a remarkable round house projected by Karl Fieger, the",Paragraph
"centralized, light-weight conception of which anticipated",Paragraph
"Buckminster Fuller’s Dymaxion House of 1927. In addition,",Paragraph
"Gropius published his own ‘Serienhauser’, or extending",Paragraph
"house units, intended as prototypes for the",Paragraph
"Bauhaussiedlung, a housing estate which he hoped to build",Paragraph
on the outskirts of Weimar. These serial houses were finally,Paragraph
realized as masters’ residences built at the Dessau Bauhaus,Paragraph
in 1926.,Paragraph
After 1923 the Bauhaus approach became extremely,Paragraph
"‘objective’, in the sense of being closely affiliated to the",Paragraph
"Neue Sachlichkeit movement. This affiliation, which was",Paragraph
"reflected, despite their rather formalistic massing, in the",Paragraph
"buildings for the Dessau Bauhaus itself, was to become",Paragraph
more pronounced after Gropius’s resignation in 1928. The,Paragraph
last two years of Gropius’s tenure were distinguished by,Paragraph
three major developments: the politically enforced and well-,Paragraph
"orchestrated move from Weimar to Dessau, the completion",Paragraph
"of the Dessau Bauhaus [101, 102], and finally the gradual",Paragraph
"emergence of a recognizable Bauhaus approach, in which a",Paragraph
greater emphasis was placed on deriving form from,Paragraph
"productive method, material constraint and programmatic",Title
necessity.,Paragraph

"light fittings [103, 104] from the metal workshop, were",Paragraph
used to furnish the interior of the new Bauhaus buildings,Paragraph
[105]. By 1927 the ‘licensed’ industrial production of such,Paragraph
"Bauhaus designs was in full swing, including the Breuer",Paragraph
"furniture, the textured fabrics of Gunta Stadler-Stélzl and",Paragraph
"her colleagues, and the elegant lamps and metalware of",Paragraph
"Marianne Brandt. In that year too, Bauhaus typography",Paragraph
finally matured with Bayer’s austere layout and sans serif,Paragraph
"type, about to become world famous for its exclusion of",Paragraph
upper-case letters. The year 1927 also saw the formation of,Paragraph
"the architectural department, under the leadership of the",Paragraph
Swiss architect Hannes Meyer. A number of Breuer’s,Paragraph
prefabricated house designs of around this time reflect the,Paragraph
immediate impact of Meyer’s influence. Meyer brought with,Paragraph
"him his talented colleague Hans Wittwer who, like him, had",Paragraph
been a member of the left-wing ABC group in Basle (see p.,Paragraph
142).,Paragraph

produced under the direction of H. Meyer.,Paragraph
"105 Gropius, Bauhaus, Dessau, 1925-26. Main hall with Breuer furniture.",Caption
Early in 1928 Gropius tendered his resignation to the,Paragraph
Mayor of Dessau and appointed Meyer as his successor. The,Paragraph
"relative maturity of the institution, the unremitting attacks",Paragraph
on himself and the growth of his practice all convinced him,Paragraph
that it was time for a change. This move radically,Paragraph
"transformed the Bauhaus and, paradoxically enough, given",Paragraph
"the growing reactionary climate of Dessau, shifted its",Paragraph
orientation still further left and even closer to the Neue,Paragraph
"Sachlichkeit position. For a variety of reasons Moholy-Nagy,",Paragraph
Breuer and Bayer followed Gropius’s lead and resigned. As,Paragraph
"Moholy-Nagy indicated in his letter of resignation, he",Paragraph
disliked Meyer’s immediate insistence on the adoption of a,Paragraph
rigorous design method:,Title
| can’t afford a continuation on this specialized purely,Paragraph
objective and efficient basis - either productively or,Paragraph
humanly. ... Under a programme of increased technology |,Paragraph
can only continue if | have a technical expert as my aide.,Paragraph
For economic reasons this will never be possible.,Paragraph
Largely liberated from the inhibiting influence of,Paragraph
"Gropius’s star faculty, Meyer was able to steer the work of",Paragraph
the Bauhaus towards a more ‘socially responsible’ design,Paragraph
"programme. Simple, demountable, inexpensive, plywood",Paragraph
furniture came to the fore and a range of wallpaper was,Paragraph
produced. More Bauhaus designs were being manufactured,Paragraph
"than ever before, although the emphasis was now placed on",Paragraph
social rather than aesthetic considerations. Meyer organized,Paragraph
the Bauhaus into four major departments: architecture (now,Paragraph
"called ‘building’ for polemical reasons), advertising, wood",Paragraph
"and metal production, and textiles. Supplementary scientific",Paragraph
"courses, such as industrial organization and psychology,",Paragraph
"were introduced into all departments, while the building",Paragraph
section shifted its emphasis to the economic optimization of,Paragraph
plan arrangements and to methods for the precise,Title
"calculation of light, sunlight, heat loss/gain and acoustics.",Paragraph
"This ambitious programme required an increase in faculty,",Paragraph
so that Wittwer’s appointment as a technician was soon,Paragraph
complemented by that of the architect-planner Ludwig,Paragraph
"Hilberseimer, the engineer Alcar Rudelt, and a studio staff",Paragraph
"comprising Alfred Arndt, Karl Fieger, Edvard Heiberg and",Paragraph
Mart Stam.,Paragraph
Despite Meyer’s concern to prevent the Bauhaus from,Paragraph
becoming a tool of left-wing party politics (he resisted an,Paragraph
"attempt to form a student Communist cell), a remorseless",Paragraph
campaign against him finally forced the mayor to demand,Paragraph
his resignation. Meyer revealed his understanding of the,Paragraph
"situation in an open letter to the mayor, Fritz Hesse:",Paragraph
lt was no use explaining [to you] that a ‘Bauhaus Dessau’,Paragraph
group of the German Communist Party was an impossibility,Paragraph
"from the party organization point of view, no use my",Paragraph
assuring you that my political activities were of a cultural,Paragraph
and never a party character. ... Municipal politics wants you,Paragraph
"to provide resounding Bauhaus successes, a brilliant",Paragraph
Bauhaus facade and a prestigious Bauhaus director.®,Paragraph
Municipal politics and German right-wing reaction in the,Paragraph
event required considerably more. They required the,Paragraph
Bauhaus closed and its sachlich fagade capped by an,Paragraph
‘Aryan’ pitched roof. They required the Marxists impeached,Paragraph
and the liberal émigrés banished along with their obscure,Paragraph
art works - later to be designated as decadent. The,Paragraph
desperate attempt of the Mayor of Dessau to shore up the,Paragraph
"Bauhaus, in the name of liberal democracy, through the",Paragraph
"patriarchal directorship of Mies van der Rohe, was doomed",Paragraph
to failure. The Bauhaus remained in Dessau for but two,Paragraph
more years. In October 1932 what was left of it moved into,Paragraph
"an old warehouse on the outskirts of Berlin, but by now the",Paragraph
"floodgates of reaction were open, and nine months later the",Paragraph
Bauhaus was finally closed [106].,Paragraph

The New Objectivity:,Title
"Germany, Holland and",Title
Switzerland 1923-33,Title
The expression Neue Sachlichkeit was in fact coined by me,Paragraph
in the year 1924. A year later came the Mannheim,Paragraph
exhibition which bore the same name. The expression ought,Paragraph
really to apply as a label to the new realism bearing a,Paragraph
socialist flavour. It was related to the general contemporary,Paragraph
feeling in Germany of resignation and cynicism after a,Paragraph
period of exuberant hopes (which had found an outlet in,Paragraph
expressionism). Cynicism and resignation are the negative,Paragraph
"side of the Neue Sachlichkeit, the positive side expresses",Paragraph
itself in the enthusiasm for the immediate reality as a result,Paragraph
of a desire to take things entirely objectively on a material,Paragraph
basis without immediately investing them with ideal,Paragraph
implications. This healthy disillusionment finds its clearest,Paragraph
expression in Germany in architecture.,Paragraph
G.F. Hartlaub,Caption
"Letter to Alfred H. Barr, Jr, July 19291",Caption
The term Sachlichkeit had been current in German cultural,Paragraph
"circles long before 1924, when the art critic G.F. Hartlaub hit",Paragraph
upon the phrase ‘die neue Sachlichkeit’ (‘the new,Paragraph
objectivity’) to identify a post-war school of anti-,Paragraph
Expressionist painting. Sachlichkeit seems to have been first,Paragraph
used in an architectural context in a series of articles written,Paragraph
by Hermann Muthesius for the journal Dekorative Kunst,Caption
between 1897 and 1903. These articles attributed the,Paragraph
quality of Sachlichkeit to the English Arts and Crafts,Title
"movement, particularly as manifest in the handicraft guilds",Paragraph
(such as that of Ashbee) and the early garden suburbs.,Paragraph
Sachlichkeit for Muthesius seems to have meant an,Paragraph
"‘objective’, functionalist and eminently yeoman attitude to",Paragraph
"the design of objects, tending towards the reform of",Paragraph
industrial society itself. The term was given somewhat,Paragraph
"different connotations by Heinrich W6lfflin, in his book,",Paragraph
Kunstgeschichtliche Grundbegriffe (The Principles of Art,Title
"History) of 1915, when he wrote of the ‘linear’ vision of",Paragraph
1800: ‘The new line comes to serve a new objectivity.’,Paragraph
Sachlichkeit had thus been qualified by the objective ‘new’,Paragraph
well before Hartlaub gave the title ‘Die Neue Sachlichkeit’ to,Paragraph
his 1925 exhibition in Mannheim of ‘Magical Realist’,Paragraph
"painters, artists who since the First World War had depicted",Paragraph
both the appearance and the essence of an austere social,Paragraph
"reality. Yet, as Fritz Schmalenbach has observed,",Paragraph
"In reality, it was not the ‘objectivity’ of the new painting",Paragraph
which the term was intended in the first place and above all,Paragraph
"to formulate, but something more universal underlying this",Paragraph
"objectivity and of which it was the expression, a revolution",Paragraph
"in the general mental attitude of the times, a general new",Paragraph
Sachlichkeit of thought and feeling.”,Paragraph
"By the early 1930s, the expression had achieved wide",Paragraph
"circulation and had come to connote, as Hartlaub had",Paragraph
"intended, an unsentimental approach to the nature of",Paragraph
society. In 1926 the phrase was first used to designate a,Paragraph
‘new-objective’ and explicitly socialist attitude to,Paragraph
"architecture, although, as Schmalenbach has noted, this",Paragraph
transference did not derive from a community of style,Paragraph
between Magical Realism and the new architecture. The first,Paragraph
polemical post-1918 use of the word ‘object’ (Gegenstana),Paragraph
"in Germany came directly from a Russian source, and this",Paragraph
interjected into the development of Neue Sachlichkeit,Paragraph
architecture a specific set of sociopolitical connotations.,Paragraph
With the advent of the Russian Revolution in 1917 and,Paragraph
"the military collapse of Germany in the following year,",Paragraph
Russia and Germany both found themselves confronted by,Paragraph
hostile Western powers. While the Soviet Union had to,Paragraph
contend with foreign intervention in the midst of a civil war,Paragraph
"and with the deprivations of an economic blockade,",Paragraph
Germany was crippled by the punitive reparation,Paragraph
agreements of Versailles. The end of the Russian Civil War in,Paragraph
1921 and the easing of foreign pressure induced Lenin to,Paragraph
"proclaim his new Economic Policy, designed to attract",Paragraph
foreign capital into corporate partnership with the Soviet,Title
Union. Soon afterwards Germany ratified a series of earlier,Paragraph
"negotiations with the Soviets, signing in 1922 the Treaty of",Paragraph
"Rapallo, which re-established diplomatic relations and",Paragraph
pledged both countries to economic co-operation. With the,Paragraph
"opening up of Russo-German relations at the end of 1921, El",Paragraph
Lissitzky and Ilya Ehrenburg came to Berlin as unofficial,Paragraph
"cultural ambassadors of the Soviet Union, their immediate",Paragraph
task being to organize an official exhibition of Russian,Paragraph
avant-garde art. In May 1922 they published the first,Paragraph
"number of a trilingual art review, Veshch/Gegenstand/Objet,",Paragraph
which featured on its cover two significant images: a,Paragraph
"photograph of a snow plough locomotive, and the basic",Caption
"icons of Suprematism, a black square and a black circle",Title
[107]. Veshch thus invoked the sachlich engineered object,Paragraph
and the Suprematist ‘non-objective’ world.,Paragraph
"107 Lissitzky, cover of Veshch/Gegenstand/Objet, 1922.",Caption
In 1923 Lissitzky became further involved with such,Paragraph
"cultural propaganda, editing, with Hans Richter and Werner",Title
"Graeff, the first issue of the Berlin magazine G (for",Paragraph
"Gestaltung, ‘Form’) and demonstrating his architectural",Paragraph
ideas in the Prounenraum built for the Grosse Berliner,Paragraph
Kunstausstellung of that year. By his invented term ‘Proun’,Paragraph
"(from Pro-Unovis, ‘for the school of the new art’), Lissitzky",Paragraph
evoked a new realm of art somewhere between painting and,Paragraph
"architecture. Of the Proun room, comprising a small",Caption
"rectilinear cell, articulated and animated by a continuous",Paragraph
"relief extending over the floor and ceiling, Lissitzky wrote:",Paragraph
The room ... is designed with elementary forms and,Paragraph
materials ... and with surfaces which are spread flat on to,Paragraph
the wall (colour) and surfaces which are perpendicular to,Paragraph
the wall (wood) ... the equilibrium which | seek to attain in,Paragraph
the room must be elementary and capable of change so,Paragraph
that it cannot be disturbed by a telephone or a piece of,Paragraph
standard furniture. The room is there for the human being -,Paragraph
not the human being for the room.?,Paragraph
"Here, as on the cover of Veshch, Suprematist abstraction",Paragraph
is seen as being compatible with standard objects. Unlike,Paragraph
"Frank Lloyd Wright in the Larkin Building, Lissitzky did not",Paragraph
feel any need to restyle such manufactured objects as,Paragraph
"telephones, although as early as 1920 he had rejected the",Paragraph
‘anti-art’ utilitarianism proclaimed by Tatlin’s Productivist,Paragraph
Group. While he recognized that empirically engineered,Paragraph
(sachlich) structures could possess both spatial beauty and,Paragraph
"symbolic significance, his Lenin Tribune of 1920 exemplified",Paragraph
his own subtle combination of engineering and,Paragraph
Suprematism: the basic structure consisted of an inclined,Paragraph
"lattice girder, with Lenin photomontaged into position at its",Paragraph
"crown, while the rostrum and the base were treated as",Paragraph
"Elementarist forms, miraculously suspended in space. This",Paragraph
"incongruous juxtaposition of abstract, non-objective",Paragraph
elements with empirically engineered form was to,Paragraph
characterize Lissitzky’s work until the early 1930s. Although,Paragraph
this synthesis was not strictly compatible with the notion of,Paragraph
"Sachlichkeit, Lissitzky’s approach came to be a point of",Paragraph
departure for an international and ‘objective’ style of,Paragraph
building.,Paragraph
"In 1922 the Dutch architect Mart Stam, then twenty-three",Paragraph
"years old, went to work for Max Taut in Berlin. There, while",Paragraph
working independently on a competition for an office block,Title
"in K6nigsberg, he met Lissitzky and for the rest of their stay",Paragraph
in Berlin the two men remained in close contact. In 1923,Paragraph
"Lissitzky projected his ‘suspended’ office block for Moscow,",Paragraph
"the ‘Wolkenbugel’, of which two separate versions were",Paragraph
"eventually produced, one by Lissitzky alone and the other in",Paragraph
"conjunction with Stam. When, late in 1923, Lissitzky",Paragraph
"contracted tuberculosis and was forced to move to Zurich,",Paragraph
Stam went with him. During the next year they acquired a,Paragraph
"Swiss following and in 1925, largely at Lissitzky’s instigation,",Paragraph
"they formed the left-wing ABC group, centred on Basle. The",Paragraph
Swiss members of the group included Emil Roth of Zurich,Paragraph
"and Hans Schmidt, Hannes Meyer and Hans Wittwer of",Paragraph
Basle. These men dedicated themselves to the design of,Paragraph
socially relevant buildings in accordance with scientific,Paragraph
principles.,Paragraph
In 1924 the ABC group began to propagate their views in,Paragraph
"the magazine ABC: Beitrage zum Bauen, edited by Stam,",Caption
Schmidt and Lissitzky in collaboration with Roth. Although,Paragraph
"they did not adopt the phrase ‘Neue Sachlichkeit’, they",Paragraph
nonetheless made their sachlich orientation explicit. The,Paragraph
first number contained Stam’s essay ‘Kollektive Gestaltung’,Paragraph
"(‘Collective Design’) and Lissitzky’s seminal text, ‘Element",Paragraph
"und Erfindung’ (‘Element and Invention’), in which he",Paragraph
"outlined the duality of his approach, his synthesis of",Paragraph
functional structure with abstract elements. The second,Paragraph
issue introduced the group’s characteristic preoccupation,Paragraph
"with normative standards, particularly in Paul Artaria’s essay",Paragraph
"on the standardization of paper sizes, while Nos 2 and 3, a",Paragraph
"double issue, included an essay on reinforced-concrete",Paragraph
"construction, as exemplified in Le Corbusier’s ‘Dom-Ino’",Paragraph
"system of 1914-15, as well as in Mies van der Rohe’s glass",Paragraph
skyscraper projects of 1922 and Stam’s K6nigsberg block,Title
and extendable house proposals of the same date. By,Paragraph
dramatically comparing the relative weights and thicknesses,Paragraph
of metal and wooden window frames the magazine stressed,Paragraph
the intrinsic economy of modern building technology. Soon,Paragraph
afterwards the ABC group summed up its distaste for,Paragraph
massive architecture in the equation: ‘building x weight =,Paragraph
monumentality’.,Paragraph
With the publication of Meyer and Wittwer’s Petersschule,Paragraph
"project for Basel of 1926 [109], the ABC group crystallized",Paragraph
its Functionalist and anti-monumental programme. Meyer’s,Paragraph
description reveals the ABC preoccupation with precise,Paragraph
"calculation and social relevance, both to be made manifest",Paragraph
through light-weight technique:,Title
The ideal would be to skylight all the rooms ... and to set,Paragraph
aside a new site as part of a planned development of the,Paragraph
town. At present there appears to be no prospect of such,Paragraph
demands being realized and the following is a compromise,Paragraph
solution on the basis of the old building. ...,Paragraph
The School itself is raised as far as possible above the,Paragraph
ground to a level where there is sunlight and fresh air.,Paragraph
On the ground floor there is only the swimming bath and,Paragraph
the gymnasium in an enclosed space. The remaining area of,Paragraph
the playground is released for public traffic and parking.,Paragraph
"Instead of a playground, two open spaces (suspended",Paragraph
platforms) and all the flat roofs of the building are assigned,Paragraph
to the children for recreation. ... The dead weight of the,Paragraph
building is used to carry on four cables the unsupported,Paragraph
stee/ structure of the two suspended platforms.‘,Paragraph
This steel-frame ‘Constructivist’ work recalls a Soviet,Paragraph
"Vkhutemas project for a suspended restaurant, published by",Caption
Stam in the ABC magazine in 1924. The machine-like,Paragraph
"furnishing of the Petersschule proposal, its steel windows,",Paragraph

"1926-27. (Compare Le Corbusier’s entry, p. 174.)",Caption

The claim by Meyer and Wittwer that their League of,Paragraph
Nations design was a scientific solution merits examination.,Paragraph
"Structurally the assertion appears tenable, inasmuch as",Paragraph
their use of a standard module throughout would have been,Paragraph
highly suitable for prefabrication. As in Paxton’s Crystal,Paragraph
"Palace, the modular extension or contraction of any section",Title
would have been possible without altering the basic order of,Paragraph
the building. The raising of the assembly building on,Paragraph
columns was more than adequately justified by the,Paragraph
provision of parking beneath. Meyer’s much-proclaimed,Paragraph
‘objectivity’ also found reflection in the determination of the,Paragraph
auditorium profile through elaborate acoustical calculation.,Paragraph
But one may question the designer’s ‘objectivity’ when,Paragraph
elevator shafts are glazed (after Russian Constructivist,Paragraph
models) so as to reveal the ‘machine aesthetic’ in action.,Paragraph
Further doubts arise when one considers the undeniably,Paragraph
picturesque qualities of the composition. And although,Paragraph
Meyer claimed in his report that ‘our building symbolizes,Paragraph
"nothing’, and that its objective indifference to the site lay",Paragraph
"beyond aesthetic evaluation, he disclosed a certain",Paragraph
symbolizing intent when he wrote:,Paragraph
"If the intentions of the League of Nations are sincere, then it",Paragraph
cannot possibly cram such a novel social organization into,Paragraph
the straitjacket of traditional architecture. No pillared,Paragraph
reception rooms for weary monarchs but hygienic work-,Paragraph
rooms for the busy representatives of their people. No back,Paragraph
corridors for backstairs diplomacy but open glazed rooms,Caption
for public negotiation of honest men.°,Paragraph
The latent symbolism of Meyer’s functional approach also,Paragraph
finds expression in his proposal to classify the users of the,Paragraph
assembly building by their parking position and to conduct,Paragraph
them inconspicuously from this point to their assigned,Paragraph
places in the auditorium above.,Paragraph
The ABC commitment to an objective approach to both,Paragraph
building and life arose out of a determination to serve only,Paragraph
"collective necessity, of which Stam wrote in ‘Kollektive",Paragraph
Gestaltung’:,Title
"The dualistic view of life - heaven and earth, good and evil -",Paragraph
"the idea that there is an eternal inner conflict, has thrown",Paragraph
the emphasis on the individual and drawn him away from,Paragraph
society. ... The individual's isolation has led him to be,Paragraph
dominated by his emotions. But the modern outlook ... sees,Paragraph
life as the single reaching out of a single force. This means,Paragraph
that what is special and individual must yield to what is,Paragraph
common to all.®,Paragraph
Meyer expressed a similar view in his essay ‘Die neue,Paragraph
Welt’ (‘The New World’) published in Das Werk (1926):,Paragraph
The standardization of our requirements is shown by: the,Paragraph
"bowler hat, bobbed hair, the tango, jazz, the co-op product,",Paragraph
"the DIN standard size, etc. ... Trade union, co-operative,",Paragraph
"Ltd., Inc., cartel, trust, and the League of Nations are the",Paragraph
forms in which today’s social conglomerations find,Paragraph
"expression, and the radio and the rotary press are their",Paragraph
media of communication. Co-operation rules the world. The,Paragraph
community rules the individual.’,Paragraph

"mushroom-columned Van Nelle Factory, completed in 1929",Caption
"[110, 111]. If the Meyer/Wittwer project for the League of",Caption
Nations can be regarded as the canonical work of the ABC,Paragraph
"group, then the Van Nelle tobacco, tea and coffee packing",Paragraph
plant may be considered as the realization of similar,Paragraph
technical and aesthetic premises. As in the Meyer/Wittwer,Paragraph
"design, the structure and the movement systems were",Paragraph
"explicitly revealed, although naturally in a packing process",Paragraph
"the prime movers were not elevators but glazed conveyors,",Paragraph
running diagonally between the curtain-walled packing,Paragraph
block and the canal warehouse. The significance of such an,Paragraph
open and dynamic expression was not lost on an observer,Paragraph
"as sensitive as Le Corbusier, who saw it as a confirmation of",Paragraph
"his own utopian socialist convictions, and wrote in 1931:",Paragraph

"is of enormous significance to all those who are working, on",Paragraph
all eight floors inside. ... The Van Nelle tobacco factory in,Paragraph
"Rotterdam, a creation of the modern age, has removed all",Paragraph
the former connotations of despair from that word,Paragraph
"‘proletarian’, And this deflection of the egoistic property",Paragraph
instinct towards a feeling for collective action leads to a,Paragraph
most happy result: the phenomenon of personal,Title
participation in every stage of the human enterprise.®,Paragraph
"Despite Stam’s major participation in this design, the role",Paragraph
"of Van der Vlugt cannot be discounted, particularly as he",Paragraph
later designed a work of comparable ‘objectivity’ without,Paragraph
"the aid of Stam - his Existenzminimum Bergpolder flats,",Paragraph
built in Rotterdam in 1933. Nonetheless Stam must be,Paragraph
credited for introducing the polemic of objectivity into Dutch,Paragraph
"architecture, for all that J.J.P. Oud had by this date already",Paragraph
built extensive amounts of flat-roofed Functionalist workers’,Paragraph
"housing, most particularly his Kiefhoek Estate in Rotterdam,",Paragraph
"under construction by 1925. In all this work Oud, as",Paragraph
"Rotterdam City Architect, remained committed to Berlage’s",Paragraph
"traditional urban precept of the street, regarded as an",Paragraph
"enclosed, external room.",Caption
The full measure of Stam’s revolt against this tradition,Title
may be judged from his 1926 project for the Rokin district of,Paragraph
"Amsterdam, where the continuity of the existing street is",Paragraph
"vitiated by a continuously elevated office block, served by",Paragraph
"escalator access and an aerial railway, the ground being",Paragraph
"reserved for traffic parking, display and pedestrian",Paragraph
movement. This provocative yet economically questionable,Paragraph
project was typical of Stam’s preoccupation with the,Paragraph
subversion of the traditional urban pattern. It epitomized his,Paragraph
concept of the ‘open city’.,Paragraph
Stam’s extreme materialism served to isolate him from,Paragraph
"the Functionalist Opbouw group, already established in",Paragraph
Rotterdam by 1920. Despite their commitment to the,Paragraph
"‘Nieuwe Zakelijkheid’ (‘New Objectivity’), Opbouw members",Paragraph
such as Brinkman and Van der Vlugt and their industrialist,Paragraph
client Kees van der Leeuw sought to transcend ‘objectivity’,Paragraph
through a concern for universal ‘spiritual’ values. This they,Paragraph
expressed through their participation in the Dutch,Paragraph
"theosophical movement and through their building, in 1930,",Paragraph
of a small retreat at Ommen for Krishnamurti and his,Paragraph
followers.,Paragraph
Similar spiritual aspirations were inherent in the work of,Paragraph
"Johannes Duiker and Bernard Bijvoet, who departed from",Paragraph
their initial Wrightian manner in the boarded house that,Paragraph
"they built at Aalsmeer in 1924 [112]. This asymmetrical,",Paragraph
monopitched house initiated the Zakelijkheid period of,Paragraph
"Duiker’s career, a period that culminated in two reinforced-",Paragraph

character - his Zonnestraal Sanatorium at Hilversum of,Paragraph

"programmatic distortion, as in the asymmetrical gymnasium",Paragraph
"wing of the Open Air School, Duiker’s latent idealism found",Paragraph
expression in his preference for symmetrical organization.,Paragraph
Only at the end of his life did he begin to abandon his,Paragraph
"characteristic ‘butterfly’ parti, in favour of the more serial,",Paragraph
aformal approach of Stam. This came with his Cineac,Paragraph

The emergence of the Neue Sachlichkeit in Germany was,Paragraph

"blocks to the terraces, which ran north-south, thereby",Paragraph
"creating a series of L-shaped green courts, extending out",Paragraph
into adjacent allotments. These allotments were subdivided,Paragraph
into family plots for the cultivation of food (compare Adolf,Paragraph
"Loos’s Heuberg Estate, Vienna, of 1926). At Georgsgarten,",Caption
"Haesler also evolved the basic apartment type, of which he",Paragraph
was to design many variations throughout his career. His,Paragraph
"typical apartment, stacked on three floors, with staircase",Paragraph
"access in pairs, consisted of a living/dining room, a small",Paragraph
"kitchen, a WC, and three to six bedrooms. The replacement",Paragraph
of the traditional Wohnktiche by a separate kitchen was a,Paragraph
"radical departure in mass housing, and had the critical",Paragraph
social impact of shifting the household focus towards an,Paragraph
austerity version of the bourgeois ‘salon’. Haesler was to,Paragraph
upgrade his typical apartment in the Siedlung Friedrich,Paragraph
"Ebert-Ring at Rathenow, built in 1929, where a separate",Paragraph
bathroom was introduced into the standard walk-up unit.,Paragraph
Both these early settlements were equipped with,Paragraph
"communal facilities such as laundries, meeting rooms,",Paragraph
"libraries, sports fields, etc., while Georgsgarten was further",Paragraph
"provided with a kindergarten, a café and a hairdresser. The",Paragraph
"sparse furnishing of these spaces, with their standard",Paragraph
"Thonet furniture and bare light bulbs, relieved by carefully",Paragraph
"detailed pipework and electrical conduit, synthesized the",Paragraph
typical Neue Sachlichkeit interior: cold and austere and yet,Paragraph
at the same time scintillating. Such qualities were echoed,Paragraph
"on the exterior, where plain rendered surfaces, steel",Paragraph
"windows, patent glazing and metal railing were combined to",Paragraph
create the universal sachlich syntax.,Paragraph
Despite the national and ideological divergence of the,Paragraph
"seventeen architects involved - including, from Germany",Paragraph
"alone, figures as diverse as Behrens, Décker, Gropius,",Paragraph
"Hilberseimer, Rading, Scharoun, Schneck, Mies van der Rohe",Caption
and the brothers Taut - this objective mode of expression,Paragraph
was more or less universally adopted in the Deutsche,Paragraph
"Werkbund Weissenhofsiedlung, erected outside Stuttgart in",Caption
1927.,Paragraph
"In the subsequent development of his own work, Haesler",Paragraph
began to move away from the expression of the Sied/ung as,Paragraph
a corporate entity to the assertion of the terraced block as a,Paragraph
"free-standing, infinitely repeatable unit. His initial plan of",Paragraph
1929 for the Siedlung Rothenberg at Kassel is typical in this,Paragraph
"respect, not only of his own work, but of most other Neue",Paragraph
Sachlichkeit housing of comparable date.,Paragraph
With May’s appointment as City Architect of Frankfurt in,Paragraph
"1925, the building of workers’ settlements began there on",Paragraph
"an unprecedented scale. Yet, owing to his early training with",Paragraph
both Theodor Fischer in Munich and Raymond Unwin in,Paragraph
"England, May’s rationalism was tempered by a feeling for",Paragraph
tradition. Whereas Haesler had created an indented but,Paragraph
continuous form at Georgsgarten and a serried open-ended,Paragraph
"layout at Rothenburg, May (like Bruno Taut and Martin",Paragraph
Wagner in their contemporary Berlin-Britz housing) was,Paragraph
more concerned with the creation of self-contained urban,Paragraph
"space, after the model of the traditional Prussian Anger",Paragraph
"village. Thus May’s first work for Frankfurt, his",Paragraph
"Bruchfeldstrasse development of 1925 [115], designed with",Paragraph
"C.H. Rudloff, consisted of a large courtyard of ‘zigzag’",Paragraph
"housing, enclosing an elaborately landscaped communal",Paragraph
"garden. This unique layout, formally reminiscent of the Cité",Paragraph
"Moderne designed by Victor Bourgeois for Brussels in 1922,",Paragraph
gave way to a more generalized approach in May’s master,Paragraph

"The 15,000 units completed under May’s direction",Paragraph
account for more than ninety per cent of the housing built in,Paragraph
Frankfurt over the entire period. This impressive figure could,Paragraph
hardly have been achieved without May’s insistence on,Paragraph
efficiency and economy in both design and construction.,Paragraph
"Such an objective approach, reinforced by the realities of",Paragraph
"building costs, led inevitably to the formulation of",Paragraph
"‘existence-minimum’ space standards, which became the",Paragraph
contentious theme of the CIAM Frankfurt Congress of 1929.,Paragraph
In contrast to Le Corbusier’s ‘idealistic’ appeal for an,Paragraph
"‘existence-maximum’, May’s minimum standards were",Paragraph
dependent on the extensive use of ingenious built-in,Paragraph
"storage, foldaway beds and above all on the development of",Paragraph
"the ultra-efficient, laboratory-like kitchen, the Frankfurter",Paragraph
"Kdche, designed by the architect G. SchUtte-Lihotzky [116].",Caption

Walter Gropius’s Bauhaus complex of 1926 and his Térten,Title
housing of 1928 [117] represent two stages in his gradual,Paragraph
conversion to the principles of the Neue Sachlichkeit. While,Paragraph
the ‘railroad’ layout of Térten reflected not only the,Paragraph
standardization of its units but also the linear process of,Paragraph
"their prefabricated assembly by travelling crane, the Dessau",Paragraph
Bauhaus still amounted to a formalist composition of,Paragraph
"asymmetrical elements. Its centrifugal, pinwheeling form,",Paragraph
"reminiscent of De Stijl planning, had first been attempted by",Paragraph
Gropius and Meyer in their Chicago Tribune project of 1922,Paragraph
"(fig. 99, p. 135) and reformulated by them as an",Paragraph
"asymmetrical, horizontal distribution of masses in their",Paragraph
Erlangen Academy design of 1924. While the expression of a,Paragraph
comparable aesthetic in the Dessau Bauhaus necessitated,Paragraph
"the wilful suppression of its structural frame, this was",Paragraph
compensated for by the sachlich detailing of its secondary,Paragraph
"components, such as the radiators, the fenestration, the",Paragraph
"balustrading and the light fittings. All the same, the ultimate",Paragraph
articulation of these large intersecting masses could not be,Paragraph
achieved without recourse to changes in colour or toa,Paragraph
shallow modelling of the facade that effectively recalled the,Paragraph
Neo-Classical modenature of the Gropius and Meyer,Title
Werkbund Building of 1914.,Caption
"117 Gropius, rationalized housing, Dessau-Térten, 1928. The site layout is",Caption
apparently organized around tower crane tracks.,Paragraph
Gropius’s most unequivocal Neue Sachlichkeit work was,Paragraph
"his 1927 Total Theatre project, designed for Erwin Piscator’s",Paragraph
Volksbuhne in Berlin. Piscator had founded his Proletarian,Paragraph
Theatre in 1924 after the model of the Russian revolutionary,Paragraph
"producer Vsevolod Meyerhold, whose October Theatre had",Paragraph
been proclaimed in Moscow in 1920. Thus Gropius’s,Paragraph
‘PiscatorbUhne’ was largely designed to satisfy the,Paragraph
"requirements of a biomechanical stage, to provide the space",Paragraph
for a ‘theatre of action’ as outlined by Meyerhold and his,Paragraph
Proletkult colleagues. The actor-acrobat was the ideal type,Paragraph
"for such a theatre, in which a circus-like mechanized",Paragraph
performance was presented on an apron stage.,Paragraph
"In his remarkably elegant and flexible solution, Gropius",Paragraph
provided Piscator with an auditorium which could be rapidly,Paragraph
"transformed into any one of the three ‘classic’ stage forms,",Paragraph
"the proscenium, the apron or the arena [118]. How this",Paragraph
"provision was to be made, and to what theatrical ends, has",Paragraph
"been best described in Gropius’s own words. In 1934, ata",Paragraph
"conference in Rome, he stated:",Paragraph
"118 Gropius, Total Theatre project, 1927. View from above, and alternative plans",Caption
"showing proscenium, apron and arena stages.",Caption
A complete transformation of the building occurs by turning,Paragraph
the stage platform and part of the orchestra through 180°.,Paragraph
Then the former proscenium stage becomes a central arena,Paragraph
entirely surrounded by rows of spectators! This can even be,Paragraph
"done during the play. ... This attack on the spectator,",Paragraph
moving him during the play and unexpectedly shifting the,Paragraph
"stage area, alters the existing scale of values, presenting to",Paragraph
the spectator a new consciousness of space and making him,Paragraph
participate in the action.2,Title
The convertible auditorium was also equipped with a,Paragraph
"peripheral stage, on which the action could encircle the",Paragraph
audience. Alternatively this Spie/ring could be sealed off by,Paragraph
"a segmented back-projection screen, for the display of",Paragraph
cinematic images complementary to the action on the,Paragraph
stage. A similar demountable cyclorama was also available,Paragraph
for the stage itself. The adaptability of this auditorium was,Paragraph
to be further augmented by the provision for acrobatic,Paragraph
"display, just above the central arena. This aerial stage",Paragraph
would have had the effect of transforming Gropius’s egglike,Paragraph
"void into a truly three-dimensional ‘play’ space, with the",Paragraph
audience either surrounding or surrounded by the action on,Paragraph
"every side. Finally, the auditorium itself was a transparent",Paragraph
"box, through which its basic structure could be easily",Paragraph
"perceived, the open lattice of the ovoid roof being",Paragraph
ingeniously reconciled with the column nodes of its elliptical,Paragraph
‘ring’ support (compare the Meyer/Wittwer League of,Paragraph
Nations auditorium).,Paragraph
Of approximately the same date as the Total Theatre,Paragraph
were the Haselhorst housing and Elberfield Hospital,Paragraph
"projects, designed by Marcel Breuer and Gustav",Paragraph
"Hassenpflug in 1928, and Hannes Meyer’s Trades Union",Paragraph
"School, completed at Bernau in 1930. Breuer’s unrealized",Paragraph
Elberfeld project and Meyer’s Bernau school were,Paragraph
"comparable sachlich works, inasmuch as they each",Paragraph
"comprised asymmetrical sequences of repeated elements,",Paragraph
"arranged in stepped formation, responding ‘simultaneously’",Paragraph
"to the respective demands of the programme, orientation",Paragraph
"and topography. Where the ward units of the sanatorium,",Paragraph
"supported on a concrete superstructure, were set back to",Paragraph
"provide a stepped sequence of sun decks, one for each",Paragraph
"ward, the bulk of Meyer’s school was made up of three-",Paragraph
"storey residential blocks, set back at their corners in such a",Paragraph
way as to break up the overall length. Both these buildings,Paragraph
"were stepped in relation to gently sloping sites, and yet both",Paragraph
were freely and functionally related to their major atypical,Paragraph
"elements, such as operating suites and x-ray units in the",Paragraph
sanatorium or lecture halls and common facilities in the,Paragraph
case of the school.,Paragraph
After his resignation from the Bauhaus at the end of,Paragraph
"1927, Gropius became increasingly involved with the",Paragraph
"problem of housing [119], so that apart from the extensive",Paragraph
low-cost schemes that he designed and saw built in the late,Paragraph
"1920s, in Dessau, Karlsruhe and Berlin, he became",Paragraph
theoretically concerned with the improvement of housing,Paragraph
standards and the development of the housing block into a,Title
classless system for community settlement. His unrealized,Paragraph
housing projects for Berlin of 1929 were a significant,Paragraph
"advance over his previous work, offering higher living",Paragraph
"standards and more comprehensive social services, while",Paragraph
"his 1931 proposal for high-rise middle-class housing, on the",Paragraph
"Wannsee near Berlin, constituted his first attempt at a self-",Paragraph
contained commune block equipped with a restaurant and a,Paragraph
gymnasium-solarium on the roof. Gropius’s views in the late,Caption
"1920s lay to the left of the Social Democratic position, as his",Paragraph
"essay, Die Soziologischen Grundlagen der Minimalwohnung",Title
"(The Sociological Bases of Minimum Housing), of 1929",Paragraph
makes clear. There he put forward the familiar socialist,Paragraph
argument in favour of state involvement in the provision of,Paragraph
housing:,Title
"119 Gropius, diagram presented at CIAM in 1930 demonstrating the increased",Paragraph
density and open space to be obtained by using high-rise slabs.,Paragraph
Since technology operates within the frame-work of industry,Paragraph
and finance and since any cost reduction achieved must,Paragraph
"first of all be exploited for the benefit of private industry, it",Paragraph
will only be able to provide cheaper and more varied,Paragraph
dwellings if the government increases private industry’s,Paragraph
interest in dwelling construction by increased welfare,Title
"measures, If the minimum dwelling is to be realized at rent",Paragraph
"levels which the population can afford, the government",Paragraph
must therefore be requested to: (1) prevent the waste of,Paragraph
public funds for apartments of excessive size ... for which an,Paragraph
upper limit of apartment size must be established; (2),Paragraph
reduce the initial cost of roads and utilities; (3) provide the,Paragraph
building sites and remove them from the hands of,Paragraph
"speculators, (4) liberalize as far as possible the zoning",Paragraph
regulations and building codes.'°,Paragraph
These prescriptions were only barely in advance of the,Paragraph
"official housing policy of the Weimar Republic, which,",Paragraph
"between 1927 and 1931, was to subsidize publicly through",Paragraph
social insurance and property tax the design and erection of,Title
around one million dwellings - about seventy per cent of the,Paragraph
new housing starts made over the entire period.,Paragraph
"Such an extensive welfare state system could not,",Paragraph
"however, be maintained in the face of the stock market",Paragraph
"collapse, which accompanied the world economic",Paragraph
"depression of 1929. Foreign trade slumped, loans were",Paragraph
"called in, and Germany was once more plunged into",Paragraph
economic and political chaos. This had the effect of,Paragraph
"swinging the opinion of the country to the right, and with",Paragraph
this political shift the fate of the German Neue Sachlichkeit,Paragraph
architects was more or less sealed. Nothing remained for,Paragraph
"them but to emigrate, and this they did, each according to",Paragraph

Introduction to the Art of the Avant-Garde in Czechoslovakia,Title
"1918-1938, 19931",Title
The two most salient aspects of the Czech avant garde in,Paragraph
the 20th century were the Poetism of the Devétsil,Paragraph
association of artists and the Constructivism advocated by,Title
the Left Front political movement. The latter was culturally,Paragraph
"complex, poised between the Neue Sachlichkeit (New",Paragraph
Objectivity) of German-speaking Europe and the more,Paragraph
utopian drive of Russian Constructivism as projected by,Paragraph
Soviet avant-garde architects between 1918 and 1932. The,Paragraph
key Czech critic mediating between Devétsil and,Paragraph
Constructivism was the polemical polymath Karel Teige.,Paragraph
"During the first half of the 1920s, Teige was an advocate of",Paragraph
"the ‘picture poem’ collages of Poetism, an amalgam of",Paragraph
"graphics, typography and photography that veered into",Paragraph
kinetic art and film. Jaroslav Andel informs us that another,Paragraph
"key figure at this time was Zdenék PeSanek, whose drive",Paragraph
towards a more dynamic form of art split the Devétsil,Paragraph
"movement into its surrealist and functionalist factions, with",Paragraph
the latter tending towards Constructivism in architecture.,Paragraph
This last line was advanced by the journal Stavba,Paragraph

"Kysela, Tyl, Jan Koula, FrantiSek Libra and Josef Fuchs.",Paragraph

compares it to the Neo-Plastic formalism of the Rietveld-,Paragraph

the former through his Olympic and Jednota buildings and,Paragraph
"the latter through his Lindt and Bata department stores,",Paragraph
erected next to each other in the centre of Prague (see pp.,Caption

an elegant café dansant at ground level. This combination of,Paragraph
commercial space with cultural amenities testifies to the,Paragraph
urbanity of the Prague bourgeoisie.,Paragraph
One of the most notable aspects of the Czech,Paragraph
architectural avant garde between the wars was the wide,Paragraph
"scope of their production, with regard not only to the broad",Paragraph
"spectrum of the society they served, but also to their",Paragraph
conceptual and technological capacity. They were able not,Paragraph
only to conceive but also to construct the necessary,Paragraph

"Electricity Board Headquarters of 1935 [124, 125]. This was",Paragraph
"an atrium office complex built around a seven-storey, top-lit",Paragraph
monumental stair hall. This last was roofed by a concrete,Paragraph

employed the same technique as the reinforced-concrete,Paragraph
shell vaults covering the city arcades. This is surely the lost,Paragraph

engineers of the interwar period. A typical arcade in this,Paragraph
regard was Oldrich Tyl’s Bondy Passage completed in Prague,Paragraph
two years before.,Paragraph

Dutch architect Mart Stam also designed a house in the,Paragraph
"Baba estate. However, this impulse to build housing stock",Paragraph
comparable to that of the Weimar Republic was undercut by,Paragraph
the worldwide stock market crash of 1929. This fundamental,Paragraph
change in the cultural and political climate was summed up,Paragraph
in 1993 by Alena Kubova when she wrote:,Paragraph
"In its quest for a social function for architecture, the",Paragraph
"development of which would define its modernity, European",Paragraph
avant-garde theory had come up with the ideal of minimal,Paragraph
housing. Teige thought instead of modernity in terms of,Paragraph
Class struggle ... This became clear in 1929 when Devetsil,Paragraph
was replaced by Leva fronta (Left Front) and Czech,Paragraph
functionalism became intimately bound up with housing.,Paragraph
The Left Front dispatched its plans for a collective dwelling,Paragraph
to CIAM’s third congress.,Paragraph
The one Czech architect whose work transcended the,Paragraph
post-1929 economic and ideological crisis was the architect-,Paragraph
"cum-industrial designer Ladislav Zak, whose Villa Hain of",Paragraph
1933 [126] was realized for an aeronautical engineer. As,Paragraph
"Vladimir Slapeta has remarked, Zak’s work as an architect",Paragraph
went beyond the principles of instrumental economic,Paragraph
production to engage in a more comprehensive approach to,Paragraph
"psycho-physiological needs. According to Slapeta, this",Paragraph
approach was inspired by Honzik’s theory of biotechnics and,Paragraph
seems to have been close to similar theories then being,Paragraph
advanced by Moholy-Nagy. The Villa Hain was as ergonomic,Paragraph
"as possible within the confines of a tight prism, combining",Paragraph
horizontal double-glazed windows with built-in ventilation,Caption
grilles and integrated curtain tracks. The cantilevered,Caption
sunbathing terrace at the end of the house was equipped,Paragraph
with roller blinds in order to shade it from the sun and to,Paragraph
ensure privacy. This house may be seen as a kind of,Paragraph
"technological architecture parlante, as the cantilevered",Paragraph
viewing platform on top of the house enabled the engineer,Paragraph
to view his prototypes taking off from Prague’s Ruzyné,Paragraph
"Airport, completed to the designs of Adolf Bens between",Paragraph
1932 and 1934. The other prolific architect of the period,Paragraph
"based in Brno was the local architect Bohuslav Fuchs, whose",Paragraph
most accomplished work was the narrow fronted Hotel Avion,Paragraph
built in the downtown of the city in 1928. The modern,Paragraph
"architecture of Brno rivalled that of Prague, as was made",Paragraph
"evident in the Brno Exhibition of 1928, designed in part by",Paragraph
Fuchs.,Paragraph
"126 Zak, Villa Hain, Prague, 1933.",Caption
Situated to the political left of Fuchs was the architect Jiri,Paragraph
"Kroha, who, as a professor of architecture at Brno Technical",Paragraph
"University, was affiliated with Karel Teige’s Marxist-",Paragraph
Constructivist position. This led him to initiate a programme,Paragraph
of rigorous research within the architectural school. With,Paragraph
Hannes Meyer and Mart Stam coming frequently to Brno and,Paragraph
"Kroha visiting the Soviet Union in 1930, contacts between",Paragraph
"the Czech progressive figures, the German left and the",Paragraph
Soviet Union were particularly intense during this period. All,Paragraph
this activity led to the foundation in 1933 of the Czech,Paragraph
"Union of Socialist Architects, with Kroha at its head. In the",Paragraph
following year Kroha’s radical politics led to his,Paragraph
imprisonment for publically proclaiming Communist,Title
sympathies. Although he was restored to his professorship,Paragraph
"in 1937, he was arrested yet again in 1938 by the Gestapo",Paragraph
and sent to a concentration camp soon after the annexation,Paragraph
of Czechoslovakia by Germany in that year.,Paragraph

the painters Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg and the,Paragraph
cabinetmaker and architect Gerrit Rietveld. The other artists,Paragraph
"who constituted the original formation, in 1917, under Van",Paragraph
"Doesburg’s leadership - the painters Bart van der Leck,",Paragraph
"Georges Vantongerloo and Vilmos Huszar, the architects",Caption
"J.J.P. Oud, Robert van ‘t Hoff and Jan Wils, and the poet",Title
Antony Kok - soon departed in their various ways from the,Paragraph
"main line of the movement. All, however, with the exception",Paragraph
"of Van der Leck and Oud, were signatories of the eight-point",Paragraph
manifesto published in 1918 in the second issue of the,Paragraph
"magazine De Stijl. This, the first manifesto of De Stijl, called",Paragraph
for a new balance between the individual and the universal,Title
and for the liberation of art from both the constraints of,Paragraph
tradition and the cult of individuality. Influenced as much by,Paragraph
the philosophical thought of Spinoza as by the Dutch,Paragraph
"Calvinistic background from which they all came, they",Paragraph
sought a culture that would transcend the tragedy of the,Paragraph
individual by its emphasis on immutable laws. This universal,Paragraph
and utopian aspiration was succinctly summed up by their,Paragraph
"aphorism: ‘The object of nature is man, the object of man is",Paragraph
style.’,Paragraph
By 1918 the movement had already been influenced by,Paragraph
"the Neo-Platonic, not to say theosophical, philosophy of the",Paragraph
"mathematician M.H. Schoenmaekers, whose major works,",Paragraph
Het nieuwe Wereldbeeld (‘The New Image of the World’) and,Paragraph
Beeldende Wiskunde (‘The Principles of Plastic,Title
"Mathematics’), had been published in 1915 and 1916",Paragraph
respectively. Schoenmaeker’s metaphysical world view was,Paragraph
complemented by more concrete attitudes and concepts,Paragraph
"drawn directly from Berlage and Wright, the latter having",Paragraph
become known in Europe through the publication in 1910,Paragraph
and 1911 of the two famous Wasmuth volumes dedicated to,Paragraph
"his work. Berlage, on the other hand, was more influential",Paragraph
"for his sociocultural criticism, and it was from him that the",Paragraph
"De Stijl artists had appropriated the title ‘The Style’, which",Paragraph
he in turn had probably taken from Gottfried Semper’s,Paragraph
"critical study, Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen",Title
"Kdnsten oder praktische Asthetik, of 1860.",Caption
The appearance of Mondrian’s first post-Cubist,Paragraph
"compositions, consisting largely of broken horizontal and",Paragraph
"vertical lines, coincided with his return to Holland from Paris",Paragraph
in July 1914 and with the period that he and Van der Leck,Paragraph
spent in Laren in almost daily contact with Schoenmaekers.,Paragraph
From Schoenmaekers came the term ‘Neo-Plasticism’ - from,Paragraph
his coinage of nieuwe beelding - and from him too came the,Paragraph
restriction of the palette to the primary colours of whose,Paragraph
cosmic significance he wrote in Het nieuwe Were/dbeela:,Paragraph
"‘The three principal colours are essentially yellow, blue and",Paragraph
red. They are the only colours existing ... yellow is the,Paragraph
movement of the ray (vertical) ... blue is the contrasting,Paragraph
colour to yellow (horizontal firmament) ... red is the mating,Paragraph
of yellow and blue.’ Elsewhere in the same text he provided,Paragraph
a comparable justification for limiting Neo-Plastic expression,Paragraph
"to orthogonal elements: ‘The two fundamental, complete",Paragraph
contraries which shape our earth and all that is of the earth,Paragraph
"are: the horizontal line of power, that is the course of the",Paragraph
"earth around the sun, and the vertical, profoundly spatial",Paragraph
movement of rays that originate in the centre of the sun.’,Paragraph
For all his formative influence Schoenmaekers played no,Paragraph
direct role in the aesthetic evolution of De Stijl. This was left,Paragraph
"to Van der Leck and Vantongerloo, whose very",Paragraph
independence as artists caused them to split from Van,Paragraph
Doesburg at an early date. Yet without their contributions it,Paragraph
is doubtful if the characteristic De Stijl aesthetic could have,Paragraph
been formulated with such clarity in so short a time. It is,Paragraph
"obvious, for example, that Van Doesburg’s famous",Paragraph
"abstraction The Cow, of 1916, owes much to Van der Leck,",Paragraph
"while Vantongerloo’s sculpture /nterrelation of Masses, of",Paragraph
"1919, clearly anticipates the general massing of the Van",Paragraph
Doesburg and Cor van Eesteren house projects of 1923. And,Paragraph
"even the aloof Mondrian, in the last number of De Stij/",Paragraph
(1932) - dedicated to the memory of Van Doesburg -,Caption
"brought himself to acknowledge his debt to Van der Leck,",Paragraph
"for the latter’s use, as early as 1917, of saturated primary",Paragraph
colours.,Paragraph
"The years 1914-16 had seen Mondrian in Laren, in",Paragraph
frequent contact with Schoenmaekers. During this period he,Paragraph
"wrote his basic theoretical text, ‘De Nieuwe Beelding in de",Paragraph
"Schilderkunst’ (‘Neo-Plasticism in Painting’), which appeared",Paragraph
in 1917 in the first issue of De Stijl. The enforced seclusion,Paragraph
and meditation of the war years brought Mondrian to a new,Paragraph
point of departure. His work now comprised a series of,Paragraph
"compositions consisting of floating, rectangular, coloured",Paragraph
planes. Both he and Van der Leck had now arrived at what,Paragraph
they each considered to be a totally new and pure plastic,Paragraph
"order, with the much younger Van Doesburg closely",Paragraph
following their lead. Yet while Mondrian remained involved in,Paragraph
planar compositions set within the ‘shallow space’ of the,Paragraph
"picture plane, as represented in his Composition with",Paragraph
"Coloured Planes on a White Ground of 1917, Van der Leck",Caption
and Van Doesburg were to arrive at a linear structuring of,Paragraph
"the picture plane itself, through the use of narrow bars of",Paragraph
"colour, etched in a white field. Van Doesburg’s The Cow",Caption
"dates from this period, as does his Rhythm of a Russian",Paragraph
"Dance of 1918, both works being influenced by Van der",Paragraph
Leck.,Paragraph
The first architectural work associated with De Stijl was,Paragraph
"created by Robert van ‘t Hoff, who had seen Wright’s work",Paragraph
on a visit to America before the war and in 1916 built a,Paragraph
remarkably convincing Wrightian villa on the outskirts of,Paragraph
Utrecht. Aside from this pioneering reinforced-concrete,Paragraph
house at Huis ter Heide and a number of less elegant,Paragraph
"Wrightian works by Wils, there was comparatively little",Paragraph
"architectural activity in the early phases of De Stijl. Oud,",Paragraph
"who became City Architect to Rotterdam in 1918, at the age",Paragraph
"of twenty-eight, was never wholeheartedly affiliated with",Paragraph
the movement. After abstaining from the 1918 manifesto he,Paragraph
took pains to establish his artistic independence. He seems,Paragraph
to have found in the compositions of the Austrian architect,Paragraph
Josef Hoffmann a means for detaching himself from the,Paragraph
more ‘structural’ interests of De Stijl. The single exception to,Paragraph
"this was his Purmerend factory project of 1919, wherein",Paragraph
Neo-Plastic elements were rather diffidently applied to an,Paragraph
"otherwise bland assembly of masses. There was, in effect,",Paragraph
"very little Neo-Plastic architecture before 1920, when it",Paragraph
made its first appearance in the work of Rietveld. Prior to,Paragraph
1915 Rietveld had taken courses with the architect PJ.,Paragraph
"Klaarhamer, who, while never associated with De Stijl, was",Paragraph
collaborating at the time with Van der Leck.,Paragraph
The year 1917 saw the creation of the famous Red/Blue,Paragraph
"chair designed by Rietveld. This simple piece of furniture,",Paragraph
"based on a traditional folding bed-chair, provided the first",Paragraph
occasion for a projection of the Neo-Plastic aesthetic into,Paragraph
"three dimensions. In its form, the bars and planes of Van der",Paragraph
Leck’s compositions were now realized as articulated and,Paragraph
"displaced elements in space. Aside from its articulation, the",Paragraph
chair was distinguished by its exclusive use of primary,Paragraph
colours in conjunction with a black frame - a combination,Paragraph
"which, with grey and white added, was to become the",Paragraph
standard colour scheme of the De Stijl movement. Its,Paragraph
structure enabled Rietveld to demonstrate an open,Paragraph
architectonic organization that was manifestly free from the,Paragraph
"influence of Wright. It still predicated a Gesamtkunstwerk,",Paragraph
but one that was free from the biological analogies of 19th-,Paragraph
"century synthetic Symbolism, that is to say, from Art",Paragraph
Nouveau.,Paragraph
"Few, if any, of Rietveld’s colleagues could have foreseen",Paragraph
the full potential of the modest pieces of furniture that he,Paragraph
went on to design between 1918 and 1920 - the buffet,Paragraph
"[127], baby cart and wheelbarrow which, as direct",Paragraph
"developments of the Red/Blue chair, were assembled from",Paragraph
"rectilinear wooden spars and planes, simply dowelled",Paragraph
"together. None of these pieces, however, fully anticipated",Paragraph
the architectural environment attempted by Rietveld in his,Paragraph
"design for Dr Hartog’s study, built at Maarssen in 1920. In",Paragraph
"this work each piece of furniture, including the suspended",Paragraph
"light fitting, appeared to be ‘elementarized’, and the effect",Paragraph
"was to imply, like Mondrian’s later paintings, an infinite",Paragraph
series of coordinates in space.,Paragraph
"127 Rietveld, buffet, 1919.",Caption
In many respects Van Doesburg embodied the movement,Paragraph
"in himself, for by 1921 the composition of the group had",Paragraph
"radically altered. Van der Leck, Vantongerloo, Van ‘t Hoff,",Caption
"Oud, Wils and Kok had all by then disassociated themselves",Paragraph
"from De Stijl, while Mondrian had re-established himself as",Paragraph
an independent artist in Paris. This Dutch defection,Paragraph
convinced Van Doesburg that it was necessary to proselytize,Paragraph
for De Stijl abroad. The fresh blood brought into the,Paragraph
movement in 1922 reflected his international orientation. Of,Paragraph
"the new members of that year only one was Dutch, the",Paragraph
architect Van Eesteren; the others were Russian and,Paragraph
"German - the architect, painter and graphic designer El",Title
Lissitzky and the film-maker Hans Richter. It was at Richter’s,Paragraph
"invitation that Van Doesburg first visited Germany in 1920,",Paragraph
and from this visit followed an invitation from Gropius to,Paragraph
come to the Bauhaus in the following year. Van Doesburg’s,Paragraph
brief stay in Weimar in 1921 engendered a crisis within the,Paragraph
"Bauhaus, the repercussions of which have since become",Paragraph
"legendary, for the impact of his ideas on the students and",Paragraph
"faculty was both immediate and marked. Even Gropius who,",Paragraph
"under the circumstances, had reason to be apprehensive,",Paragraph
designed in 1923 a suspended light for his own study which,Paragraph
displayed an undeniable affinity to the Rietveld fitting,Paragraph
designed for Hartog.,Caption
Of greater importance for the second phase of the De,Paragraph
"Stijl movement, lasting until 1925, was Van Doesburg’s",Paragraph
meeting with Lissitzky. Just two years before this meeting,Paragraph
Lissitzky had developed his own form of Elementarist,Paragraph
"expression, evolved in collaboration with Kasimir Malevich",Paragraph
at the Suprematist school in Vitebsk. Although Russian and,Paragraph
Dutch Elementarism had quite independent origins - the,Paragraph
"one Suprematist, the other Neo-Plastic - Van Doesburg’s",Paragraph
"work was transformed. After 1921, under the impact of",Paragraph
"Lissitzky’s Proun compositions, both he and Van Eesteren",Paragraph
"began to project, as axonometric drawings, a series of",Paragraph
"hypothetical architectural constructs, each comprising an",Paragraph
asymmetrical cluster of articulated planar elements,Caption
suspended in space about a volumetric centre. Van,Caption
Doesburg invited Lissitzky to become a member of De Stijl,Paragraph
and in 1922 Lissitzky’s abstract-typographic children’s fable,Paragraph
"of 1920, ‘The Story of Two Squares’, appeared in the pages",Paragraph
of the magazine. It is significant that the magazine itself,Paragraph
"changed its format at this juncture, Van Doesburg replacing",Paragraph
the frontal composition and woodcut logotype designed by,Paragraph
"Huszar with an asymmetrical, Elementarist layout and a",Paragraph
‘Constructivist’ logo.,Paragraph
In 1923 Van Doesburg and Van Eesteren managed to,Paragraph
crystallize the architectural style of Neo-Plasticism in an,Paragraph
"exhibition of their work, at L€once Rosenberg’s Paris gallery,",Caption
‘L’Effort moderne’. This show was an immediate success,Paragraph
and in consequence was restaged elsewhere in Paris and,Paragraph
later in Nancy. Apart from the axonometric studies,Paragraph
previously mentioned it included their project for a house for,Paragraph
"Rosenberg and two other seminal works, their study for the",Paragraph
interior of a university hall and their project for an artist’s,Caption
house [128].,Paragraph
"128 Van Eesteren and Van Doesburg, preparing for the Rosenberg exhibition in",Caption
"Paris, 1923, with a model of their ‘artist’s house’.",Caption
"Meanwhile in Holland, Huszar and Rietveld collaborated",Paragraph
on the design for a small room to be built as part of the,Paragraph
"Grosse Berliner Kunstausstellung of 1923, Huszar designing",Caption
"the environment and Rietveld the furniture, including the",Paragraph
"important Berlin chair. Simultaneously, Rietveld began to",Paragraph
work on the design and detailing of the Schréder-Schrader,Caption
"House in Utrecht [L29, 130]. This house, built at the end of",Caption
"a late 19th-century terrace, was in many respects a",Paragraph
realization of Van Doesburg’s Naar een beeldende,Paragraph
"architectuur (‘16 points of a Plastic Architecture’), published",Paragraph
"at the time of its completion. It fulfilled his prescription,",Paragraph

"‘transformable plan’, exemplified, despite its traditional",Paragraph
"brick and timber construction, his postulation of a dynamic",Paragraph
architecture liberated from the encumbrance of load-,Paragraph
bearing walls and the restrictions imposed by pierced,Title
openings. Van Doesburg’s eleventh point reads like an,Paragraph
idealized description of the house:,Paragraph

"The new architecture is anti-cubic, that is to say, it does not",Paragraph
try to freeze the different functional space cells in one,Paragraph
"closed cube. Rather, it throws the functional space cells (as",Paragraph
"well as the overhanging planes, balcony volumes, etc.)",Paragraph
centrifugally from the core of the cube. And through this,Paragraph
"means, height, width, depth, and time (/.e. an imaginary",Paragraph
four-dimensional entity) approaches a totally ‘new plastic,Paragraph
expression in open spaces’. In this way architecture acquires,Paragraph
"a more or less floating aspect that, so to speak, works",Paragraph
against the gravitational forces of nature.?,Paragraph
"The third and last phase of De Stijl activity, lasting from",Paragraph
"1925 to 1931, was announced by a dramatic rift between",Paragraph
Mondrian and Van Doesburg over the latter’s introduction of,Paragraph
"the diagonal into his paintings, in a series of ‘counter-",Paragraph
compositions’ that he had completed in 1924. By now the,Paragraph
"initial unity had been lost, as much by Van Doesburg’s",Paragraph
incessant polemical activity as by his arbitrary modification,Paragraph
of the Neo-Plastic canon. From his association with Lissitzky,Paragraph
he had come to regard social structure and technology as,Paragraph
"among the prime determinants of form, irrespective of any",Paragraph
concerns he might still entertain for the De Stijl ideal of,Paragraph
universal harmony. By the mid-1920s he realized that,Paragraph
"universality could, by itself, only produce an artificially",Paragraph
"delimited culture, which by virtue of its antipathy to",Paragraph
everyday objects could only be against the initial De Stijl,Paragraph
concern - subscribed to even by Mondrian - for the,Paragraph
unification of art and life. Van Doesburg seems to have,Paragraph
"opted for a Lissitzkian solution to this dilemma, whereby",Paragraph
both the environmental scale and status of the object,Paragraph
should determine the degree to which it may be,Paragraph
manipulated in accordance with an abstract conception.,Paragraph
"Thus, while furniture and equipment as produced by the",Paragraph
society at large ought to be accepted as the ready-made,Paragraph
"objects of the culture, the built environment itself could and",Paragraph
indeed should still be made to conform to a higher order.,Paragraph
Van Doesburg and Van Eesteren gave an idealized,Paragraph
version of this position in their essay Vers une construction,Paragraph
"collective (‘Towards a Collective Construction’), published in",Paragraph
"1924, in which they tended towards a more objective and",Paragraph
technical solution to the problem of architectural synthesis:,Paragraph
We must realize that life and art are no longer separate,Paragraph
domains. That is why the ‘idea’ of ‘art’ as an illusion,Paragraph
separate from real life must disappear. The word ‘Art’ no,Paragraph
longer means anything to us. In its place we demand the,Paragraph
construction of our environment in accordance with creative,Title
"laws based upon a fixed principle. These laws, following",Paragraph
"those of economics, mathematics, technique, sanitation,",Paragraph
"etc., are leading to a new plastic unity.?",Paragraph
"Later one reads, under the seventh point of the",Paragraph
"manifesto, the essence of the spirit that was to inform Van",Paragraph
"Doesburg’s last major work, the Café L’Aubette of 1928:",Paragraph
We have established the true place of colour in architecture,Paragraph
"and we declare that painting, without architectural",Paragraph
"construction (that is, easel painting), has no further reason",Paragraph
for existence.*,Paragraph
Rietveld had little association with Van Doesburg after,Paragraph
"1925. Nonetheless, his work developed in a similar",Paragraph
"direction, away from the Elementarism of the Schréder",Paragraph
"House and his early orthogonal furniture, towards more",Paragraph
‘objective’ solutions arising out of the application of,Paragraph
technique. Rietveld started in this direction by redesigning,Paragraph
"the seats and backs of his chairs as curved planes, not only",Paragraph
"because such shapes were more comfortable, but also",Paragraph
because they possessed greater structural strength. This led,Paragraph
naturally to the technique of wood lamination and from,Paragraph
"there it was but a step, once the inhibiting Neo-Plastic",Paragraph
"aesthetic had been relinquished, to moulding a chair out of",Paragraph
a single sheet of plywood. Rietveld’s two-storey chauffeur’s,Caption
"house, built in Utrecht in 1927, was largely the product of a",Paragraph
"similar approach, where despite - or rather because of - its",Paragraph
"use of advanced technique, little of the original De Stijl",Paragraph
"aesthetic was left. Instead of primary colours, the exposed",Paragraph
"steel frame and concrete panels were painted black, and the",Paragraph
surface of the panels themselves overpainted with a grid of,Paragraph
white squares. Removed from Van Doesburg’s conception of,Caption
anti-cubic space as set out in his ‘16 Points of a Plastic,Paragraph
"Architecture’, it was more determined by technique than by",Paragraph
any drive towards universal form.,Paragraph
"The Café L’Aubette in Strasbourg, designed in 1928,",Paragraph
comprised a sequence of two large public rooms and,Paragraph
ancillary spaces set within an 18th-century shell. These,Paragraph
rooms were designed and realized by Van Doesburg in,Paragraph
association with Hans Arp and Sophie Tauber Arp. While Van,Paragraph
Doesburg controlled the general theme each artist was free,Paragraph
to design his or her own room. With the single exception of,Paragraph
"Arp’s mural, all the rooms were modulated by shallow",Paragraph
"abstract wall reliefs, colour, lighting and equipment being",Paragraph
integrated into each composition. Van Doesburg’s own,Paragraph
"scheme [131] was, in effect, a reworking of his 1923 project",Paragraph
"for a university hall, in which a diagonal Elementarist",Paragraph
composition had been deliberately imposed on all the,Paragraph
surfaces of a partially orthogonal space. Van Doesburg’s,Paragraph
interior in L’'Aubette was similarly dominated and distorted,Paragraph
by the lines of a huge diagonal relief or counter-,Paragraph
"composition, passing obliquely over all the internal surfaces.",Paragraph
This fragmentation through relief - an extension of,Paragraph
Lissitzky’s Proun room approach of 1923 - was,Paragraph
complemented by the fact that the furnishing was free of,Paragraph
any Elementarist pieces. In their place Van Doesburg,Paragraph
designed ‘standard’ bentwood chairs and elsewhere,Caption
employed extremely objective detailing. The tubular railing,Paragraph
"throughout was simply welded, while the main lighting",Paragraph
consisted of bare light bulbs bracketed off two metal tubes,Paragraph
suspended from the ceiling.,Paragraph
"131 Van Doesburg, Café L’Aubette, Strasbourg, 1928-29.",Caption
"L’Aubette, finished in 1929, is the last Neo-Plastic",Paragraph

uniting the arts and transcending the division of art and life,Paragraph
had been relinquished and returned to its origins in abstract,Paragraph
"painting, to the art concert of Van Doesburg’s counter-",Paragraph

Van Doesburg’s conscious concern for a universal order,Paragraph

"concret (1930), he wrote: ‘If the means of expression are",Paragraph
"liberated from all particularity, they are in harmony with the",Paragraph
"ultimate end of art, which is to realize a universal language.’",Paragraph
How these means were to become liberated in the case of,Paragraph
"applied art, such as furniture and equipment, was not made",Paragraph
"clear. A year later, at the age of forty-eight, Van Doesburg",Paragraph
"died in a sanatorium in Davos, Switzerland, and with him",Paragraph
died the moving force of Neo-Plasticism. Of the original De,Paragraph
Stijl artists only Mondrian seems to have remained,Paragraph
"committed to the strict principles of the movement, to the",Paragraph
orthogonal and the primary colours which were the,Paragraph
constituent elements of his mature work. With these he,Paragraph
continued to represent the harmony of an unrealizable,Paragraph
utopia. As he wrote in his Plastic and Pure Plastic Art (1937):,Paragraph
‘Art is only a substitute while the beauty of life is still,Paragraph
"deficient. It will disappear in proportion, as life gains in",Paragraph

The absolutely central and seminal role played by Le,Paragraph

sufficient cause for us to examine his early development in,Paragraph

only becomes apparent when it is seen against the,Paragraph

which may well have been the origin of his ‘dialectical’ habit,Paragraph

"opposites - with the contrast between solid and void,",Paragraph
"between light and dark, between Apollo and Medusa - that",Paragraph
permeates his architecture and is evident as a habit of mind,Paragraph
in most of his theoretical texts.,Paragraph
Le Corbusier was born in 1887 in the Swiss watchmaking,Paragraph
"town of La Chaux-de-Fonds, which is situated in the Jura,",Paragraph
close to the French frontier. One of the prime images of his,Paragraph
adolescence must have been this highly rational gridded,Paragraph
industrial town that had been rebuilt after its destruction by,Paragraph
fire some twenty years before his birth. During his training,Paragraph
"as a designer-engraver at the local school of arts and crafts,",Paragraph
Charles Edouard Jeanneret (as he then was) became,Paragraph
involved in his late teens in the last phases of the Arts and,Paragraph
"Crafts movement. The Jugendstil manner of his first house,",Paragraph
"the Villa Fallet of 1905, was a crystallization of all that he",Paragraph
"had been taught by his master, Charles L’Eplattenier,",Paragraph
director of the cours supérieur at the applied art school in La,Caption
Chaux-de-Fonds. L’Eplattenier’s own point of departure had,Paragraph
"been Owen Jones, whose book The Grammar of Ornament",Paragraph
(1856) was a definitive compendium of decorative art.,Paragraph
L’Eplattenier aimed to create a native school of applied art,Paragraph
"and building for the Jura region and, after Jones, he taught",Paragraph
his students to derive all ornament from their immediate,Paragraph
natural environment. The vernacular type and décor of the,Paragraph
Villa Fallet were exemplary in this respect: its overall form,Paragraph
was essentially a variation on the wood and stone,Paragraph
"farmhouses of the Jura, while its decorative elements were",Paragraph
derived from the flora and fauna of the region.,Paragraph
"Despite his admiration for Owen Jones, for the Budapest-",Paragraph
trained L’Eplattenier the cultural centre of Europe remained,Paragraph
"Vienna, and his one ambition was that his prime pupil",Paragraph
"should be apprenticed there to Josef Hoffmann. Accordingly,",Paragraph
in the autumn of 1907 Le Corbusier was dispatched to,Paragraph
"Vienna. He was cordially received, but he seems to have",Paragraph
rejected Hoffmann’s offer of work and with it the sophistries,Paragraph
of the now classicized Jugendstil. Certainly the designs that,Paragraph
"he made in Vienna for further houses, to be completed in La",Paragraph
"Chaux-de-Fonds in 1909, show little trace of Hoffmann’s",Paragraph
influence. This apparent disaffection with the Jugendstil in,Paragraph
its decline was encouraged by a meeting with Tony Garnier,Paragraph
"in Lyons, in the winter of 1907, just as Garnier was",Paragraph
beginning to amplify his 1904 project for a Cité Industrielle.,Paragraph
Le Corbusier’s utopian socialist sympathies and his,Paragraph
susceptibility to a typological - not to say Classical -,Paragraph
"approach to architecture certainly date from this meeting,",Paragraph
about which he wrote: ‘This man knew that the imminent,Paragraph
birth of a new architecture depended on social phenomena.,Paragraph
His plans displayed a great facility. They were the,Paragraph
consequence of one hundred years of architectural,Title
evolution in France.’,Paragraph
The year 1907 may be regarded as the turning point of,Paragraph
"Le Corbusier’s life, for in that year he not only met Garnier,",Paragraph
"but he also made a crucial visit to the Charterhouse of Ema,",Paragraph
in Tuscany. There he experienced for the first time the living,Paragraph
‘commune’ which was to become the socio-physical model,Paragraph
for his own reinterpretation of the utopian socialist ideas,Paragraph
that he had inherited in part from L’Eplattenier and in part,Paragraph
from Garnier. Later he was to describe the Charterhouse as,Paragraph
an institution in which ‘an authentic human aspiration was,Paragraph
"fulfilled: silence, solitude, but also daily contact with men.’",Paragraph
"In 1908, Le Corbusier obtained part-time employment",Paragraph
"with Auguste Perret in Paris, whose reputation had already",Paragraph
been made through his ‘domestication’ of the reinforced-,Paragraph
concrete frame in his apartment block built in the Rue,Caption
Franklin in 1904. The fourteen months that Le Corbusier,Paragraph
spent in Paris afforded him a totally new outlook on both life,Paragraph
and work. Aside from receiving a basic training in,Paragraph
reinforced-concrete technique the capital gave him the,Paragraph
chance to broaden his knowledge of French Classical,Paragraph
"culture, by visiting the museums, libraries and lecture halls",Title
"of the city. At the same time, much to the disapproval of",Paragraph
"L’Eplattenier, he became convinced through his contact with",Paragraph
"Perret, that béton armé was the material of the future. Aside",Paragraph
"from its malleable monolithic nature, durability and inherent",Paragraph
"economy, Perret valued the concrete frame as an agent for",Paragraph
resolving the age-old conflict between the structural,Paragraph
authenticity of the Gothic and the Humanist values of,Paragraph
Classical form.,Paragraph
The impact of all these diverse experiences may be,Paragraph
"gauged from the project that he made for his alma mater,",Paragraph
"on his return to La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1909. This building,",Paragraph
"evidently conceived in reinforced concrete, consisted of",Paragraph
"three stepped tiers of artists’ studios, each with its own",Paragraph
"enclosed garden, arranged around a central communal",Paragraph
space covered by a pyramidal glass roof. This free,Paragraph
"adaptation of the Carthusian cell form, with its connotations",Paragraph
"of communality, was the first instance in which Le Corbusier",Paragraph
reinterpreted a received type in order to accommodate the,Paragraph
programme of an entirely new type. Such typological,Paragraph
"transformations, with their spatial and ideological",Paragraph
"references, were to become an intrinsic part of his working",Paragraph
method. Since this synthetic procedure was impure by,Paragraph
"definition, it was inevitable that his works should become",Paragraph
charged with references to a number of different,Paragraph
antecedents at once. For all that this process may at times,Paragraph
"have been partly unconscious, the art school must be seen",Paragraph
as being as much an heir to Godin's Familistére of 1856 as it,Paragraph
was a reinterpretation of Ema. Nevertheless Ema was to,Paragraph
remain embedded in Le Corbusier’s imagination as an,Paragraph
"image of harmony to be reinterpreted innumerable times,",Paragraph
first on a large scale in his ‘Immeuble-Villa’ project of 1922,Paragraph
"and then, less directly, in the residential block types that he",Paragraph
"designed, throughout the next decade, for his hypothetical",Paragraph
city plans.,Paragraph
Le Corbusier went to Germany in 1910 ostensibly to,Paragraph
"further his knowledge of reinforced-concrete technique, but",Paragraph
while he was there he was commissioned by the art school,Paragraph
of La Chaux-de-Fonds to study the state of decorative art.,Paragraph
"This undertaking, which resulted in a book, brought him into",Paragraph
contact with all the major figures of the Deutsche,Paragraph
"Werkbund, above all with Peter Behrens and Heinrich",Paragraph
"Tessenow, the two artists who were to exercise a strong",Paragraph
influence on two of his later works in La Chaux-de-Fonds -,Paragraph
the Villa Jeanneret Pére of 1912 and the Scala Cinema of,Paragraph
"1916. Aside from this, the Werkbund contact made him",Paragraph
conscious of the achievements of modern production,Title
"engineering, the ships, automobiles and aircraft that were to",Paragraph
form the substance of his polemical essay ‘Des Yeux qui ne,Paragraph
"voient pas.’ At the end of the year, after five months in the",Paragraph
"office of Behrens, where he would certainly have met Mies",Paragraph
"van der Rohe, he left Germany to take up a teaching post at",Paragraph
"La Chaux-de-Fonds, offered him by L’Eplattenier. Before",Paragraph
"returning to Switzerland, however, he made an extensive",Paragraph
"tour of the Balkans and Asia Minor, and henceforth Ottoman",Paragraph
architecture was to be a muted but decided influence on his,Paragraph
"work. This much is evident from his lyrical record of the trip,",Paragraph
his Voyage d’Orient of 1913.,Paragraph
The five years prior to 1916 shaped the orientation of his,Paragraph
future career in Paris. His final break with L’Eplattenier and,Paragraph
"his simultaneous rejection of Frank Lloyd Wright, whose",Paragraph
work he would have known from the Wasmuth volumes of,Paragraph
"1910-11, enabled him to remain open to the possibilities for",Paragraph
rationalized production in reinforced concrete. In 1913 he,Paragraph
"established his own office in La Chaux-de-Fonds, ostensibly",Paragraph
to specialize in béton armé.,Paragraph
"In 1915, in conjunction with his boyhood friend, the Swiss",Paragraph
"engineer Max du Bois, he evolved two ideas that were to",Paragraph
inform his development throughout the 1920s - his,Paragraph
reinterpretation of the Hennebique frame as the Maison,Paragraph
"Dom-Ino, which was to be the structural basis of most of his",Paragraph
"houses up to 1935, and the ‘Villes Pilotis’, a city projected as",Paragraph
"being built on piles, the concept of the elevated street",Paragraph
evidently deriving from Eugéne Hénard’s ‘Rue Future’ of,Paragraph
1910.,Paragraph
The year 1916 saw the culmination of his early career in,Paragraph
"La Chaux-de-Fonds with the building of the Villa Schwob,",Paragraph
which was an extraordinary synthesis of all that he had,Paragraph
"experienced so far. It was, above all else, an elaborate",Paragraph
assimilation of the spatial potential of the Hennebique,Paragraph
"system, permitting its author to impose on a skeleton",Paragraph
"structure stylistic elements drawn from Hoffmann, Perret",Paragraph
and Tessenow. There was even an erotic evocation of a,Paragraph
"seraglio, from which the building took its nickname of ‘Villa",Paragraph
"Turque’. At the same time, it was the first occasion on which",Paragraph
"Le Corbusier conceived a house in honorific terms, that is,",Paragraph
as a palace. The alternately wide and narrow bay system,Paragraph
and the symmetrical organization of the plan bestowed on,Paragraph
the Villa Schwob a structure that was undeniably Palladian.,Paragraph
Similar Classical connotations were indicated in the text that,Paragraph
"accompanied its publication in L’Esprit Nouveau in 1921,",Paragraph
wherein Julien Caron wrote:,Paragraph
Le Corbusier had to resolve a delicate problem which was,Paragraph
"contingent upon making a pure work of architecture, as",Paragraph
postulated by a design in which the masses were of a,Paragraph
"primary geometry, the square and the circle. Such",Paragraph
speculation in building a house has rarely been attempted,Paragraph
except during the Renaissance.”,Paragraph
For the first time Le Corbusier employed ‘regulating,Paragraph
"lines’, that Classical device used to maintain proportional",Paragraph
"control over the facade, manifest for instance in the",Paragraph
disposition of the fenestration in accordance with the golden,Paragraph
"section. In the years that followed, this ‘house-palace’",Paragraph
theme saw its fulfilment in Le Corbusier’s work on two,Paragraph
"different scales, with related but separate socio-cultural",Paragraph
connotations. The first was the free-standing individual,Paragraph
"bourgeois villa of Palladian precedent, as exemplified in the",Paragraph
masterly houses of the late 1920s; the second was the,Paragraph
"collective dwelling, conceived as a Baroque palace that",Paragraph
could evoke through its ‘set-back’ plan the ideological,Paragraph
connotations of a phalanstery.,Paragraph
Soon after he moved to Paris in October 1916 to,Paragraph
"establish a practice, Le Corbusier had the good fortune to be",Paragraph
introduced by Auguste Perret to the painter Amédée,Paragraph
"Ozenfant, with whom he was to evolve the all-embracing",Paragraph
machine asthetic of Purism. Grounded in Neo-Platonic,Paragraph
"philosophy, Purism extended its discourse to cover all forms",Paragraph
of plastic expression from salon painting to product design,Title
and architecture. It was nothing less than a comprehensive,Paragraph
theory of civilization which strenuously advocated the,Paragraph
conscious refinement of all existing types. Hence it was as,Paragraph
much against what Le Corbusier and Ozenfant regarded as,Paragraph
the unwarranted distortions of Cubism in painting (see their,Paragraph
first joint polemic entitled Aprés /e Cubisme of 1918) as it,Paragraph
"was in favour of the ‘evolutionary’ perfection of, say, Thonet",Paragraph
bentwood furniture or standard café tableware. Their first,Paragraph
full formulation of this aesthetic came with their essay,Paragraph
"entitled ‘Le Purisme’, which appeared in 1920, in the fourth",Paragraph
"number of the magazine L’Fsprit Nouveau, a literary and",Paragraph
artistic journal which they were to continue to edit with the,Paragraph
poet Paul Dermée until 1925. Without doubt the most fertile,Paragraph
period of their collaboration came with the gestation of Vers,Paragraph
"une architecture which, prior to its publication as a book in",Paragraph
"1923, was published in part in L’Esprit Nouveau under the",Paragraph
double pseudonym of Le Corbusier-Saugnier.,Paragraph
This text - the credit for which in book form was,Paragraph
appropriated by Le Corbusier - articulated the conceptual,Paragraph
duality around which the rest of his work was to revolve: on,Paragraph
the one hand the imperative need to satisfy functional,Paragraph
"requirements through empirical form, and on the other the",Paragraph
impulse to use abstract elements to affect the senses and,Paragraph
"nourish the intellect. This dialectical view of form,",Paragraph
introduced under the heading ‘Esthétique et architecture de,Paragraph
"ingenieur’, was exemplified by the most advanced",Paragraph
"engineering structures of the epoch, by Eiffel’s Garabit",Caption
Viaduct of 1884 and by Giacomo Matté Trucco’s Fiat Works,Caption
of 1915 to 1921.,Paragraph
The other aspect of the Engineer’s Aesthetic - product,Paragraph
"design - was represented by the ships, automobiles and",Paragraph
aircraft which were featured as separate subsections under,Paragraph
the general heading ‘Des Yeux qui ne voient pas’. The third,Paragraph
section returned the reader to the antithesis of Classical,Title
"architecture, to the lucid poetry of the Athenian Acropolis,",Paragraph
which was appraised in the penultimate chapter under the,Paragraph
"title ‘Architecture, pure création de l’esprit’. Such was Le",Paragraph
Corbusier’s admiration of engineering exactitude that the,Paragraph
profiles of the Parthenon were presented as being analogous,Paragraph
to those now wrought by machine tools. He wrote: ‘All this,Paragraph
plastic machinery is realized in marble with the rigour that,Paragraph
we have learnt to apply in the machine. The impression is of,Paragraph
"naked, polished steel.’",Paragraph
"Over the first five years of his intense activity in Paris,",Paragraph
"during which he painted and wrote in all his spare time, Le",Paragraph
Corbusier earned his living during the day as the manager,Paragraph
of a brickworks and building materials plant at Alfortville. In,Paragraph
1922 he relinquished this position to enter into practice with,Paragraph
"his cousin Pierre Jeanneret, a contract which lasted until the",Paragraph
outbreak of the Second World War. One of the earliest,Paragraph
undertakings of the office was to advance the,Paragraph
‘constructional’ idea first touched on with du Bois during the,Paragraph
"early years of the First World War, namely the Maison Dom-",Paragraph
"Ino [132, 133] and the Villes Pilotis.",Paragraph
"132, 133 Le Corbusier, Maison Dom-Lno, 1915. Be/fow, structure of ‘Dom-Ino’",Caption
"unit; above, perspective and plan showing possible grouping.",Paragraph
The Dom-Ino prototype was evidently open to different,Paragraph
levels of interpretation. While on the one hand it was simply,Paragraph
"a technical device for production, on the other it was a play",Paragraph
"on the word ‘Dom-ino’ as a patent industrial name, denoting",Paragraph
a house as standardized as a domino. This play acquired the,Paragraph
force of a literal pun where the free-standing columns could,Paragraph
be regarded in plan as domino dots and where the zigzag,Paragraph
pattern of an aggregation of these houses resembled the,Paragraph
formations of dominoes in play. With their symmetrical,Paragraph
"arrangement, however, such patterns could also acquire",Paragraph
specific connotations by either resembling the typical,Paragraph
Baroque palace plan of Fourier’s phalanstery or alternatively,Caption
by recalling Eugene Hénard’s ‘Boulevard a Redans’ of 1903.,Paragraph
"With his own ‘rue a redents’ of 1920, Le Corbusier managed",Paragraph
to combine the image of the phalanstery with his own ‘anti-,Paragraph
corridor street’ polemic. At the same time he wished to see,Paragraph
"the Dom-Ino as a piece of equipment, analogous in its form",Paragraph
and mode of assembly to a typical piece of product design.,Paragraph
"Such elements were seen by Le Corbusier as objets-types,",Paragraph
whose forms had already become refined in response to,Paragraph
typical needs. In Vers une architecture he wrote:,Paragraph
lf we eliminate from our hearts and minds all dead concepts,Paragraph
"in regard to the house, and look at the question from a",Paragraph
"critical and objective point of view, we shall arrive at the",Paragraph
"‘House Machine’, the mass-production house, healthy (and",Paragraph
morally so too) and beautiful in the same way that the,Paragraph
working tools and instruments which accompany our,Paragraph
existence are beautiful.,Paragraph
The post-war attempt by the Voisin aeroplane company,Paragraph
to break into the French housing market with an assembly-,Paragraph
line production of timber houses was enthusiastically,Paragraph
acclaimed by Le Corbusier in the second issue of L’Esprit,Paragraph
Nouveau. Yet at the same time he realized that such,Paragraph
production could only be obtained through the exercise of,Paragraph
"high-grade skills under factory conditions, a combination of",Paragraph
circumstances rare in the building industry. He,Paragraph
acknowledged these limitations in his Maison Dom-Ino,Paragraph
proposal which aside from the formwork and the steel,Paragraph
reinforcement was designed to be built by unskilled labour.,Paragraph
As early as 1919 he had adopted a comparable ‘collagist’,Paragraph
"approach to construction, when he proposed to use",Paragraph
corrugated asbestos sheets as permanent shuttering for the,Paragraph
concrete vaulted roof of his Maison Monol.,Caption
In 1922 both the Maison Dom-Ino and the Villes Pilotis,Paragraph
were further developed as the ‘Maison Citrohan’ and the,Paragraph
"‘Ville Contemporaine’, both projects being exhibited in the",Paragraph
Salon d’Automne of that year. Where the latter was directly,Paragraph
"evolved, at least in section, out of Hénard’s Rue Future of",Paragraph
"1910, the former utilized the Hennebique frame to project a",Paragraph
"long rectilinear volume, open at one end, which",Paragraph
approximated to the traditional megaron form of the,Paragraph
Mediterranean. Within this basic type - designed in two,Paragraph
successive versions - Le Corbusier projected for the first,Paragraph
"time his characteristic double-height living space, complete",Paragraph
with a sleeping mezzanine and children’s bedrooms on the,Paragraph
"roof. Aside from its roots in the Greek vernacular, this type,",Paragraph
"which he first produced in 1920, seems to have been",Paragraph
"derived from a workers’ café in Paris, in the Rue de",Paragraph
Babylone where he lunched each day with his cousin. From,Paragraph
this small restaurant they took the section and the basic,Paragraph
arrangement of the Maison Citrohan [134]: ‘Simplification of,Paragraph
the light source; one single bay at each end; two lateral,Paragraph
bearing walls; a flat roof over; a veritable box which could,Paragraph
be used as a house.’,Paragraph
"134 Le Corbusier, Maison Citrohan, 1920. Perspective, ground and floor plans.",Caption
"While the Maison Citrohan, elevated on pilotis, came",Paragraph
close to anticipating Les 5 Points d’une architecture,Title
"nouvelle, which Le Corbusier finally formulated in 1926, it",Paragraph
was hardly applicable to anything other than ‘suburban’,Paragraph
development. He was soon to use a version of it to this end,Paragraph
in the garden city estates he built at Liege and Pessac in,Paragraph
1926 [136]. Among the 130 reinforced-concrete frame,Caption
"houses built at Pessac for the industrialist Henri Frugés,",Paragraph
there was one prevalent type known as the ‘skyscraper’ unit,Paragraph
which was in effect a combination of the Maison Citrohan,Paragraph
and the back-to-back units that he had designed for the,Paragraph
‘city’ of Audincourt in the same year. A true version of the,Paragraph
"Citrohan type was not realized, however, until his work at",Paragraph
"the Stuttgart Weissenhofsiedlung of 1927. Pessac, as its",Paragraph
"mixture of unit types would indicate, was a culmination of",Paragraph
his incessant attempts in the early 1920s to put his various,Paragraph
designs for the standardized dwelling into production. The,Paragraph
name ‘Citrohan’ was a play on the patent name of the,Paragraph
"famous automobile company, indicating that a house should",Paragraph
be as standardized as a car. Pessac showed the first,Paragraph
conscious integration of Purist colour displacements into,Paragraph
architecture. The architect observed at the time:,Paragraph
The site at Pessac is very dry. The grey concrete houses,Paragraph
"produce an insupportable compressed mass, lacking in air.",Paragraph
Colour is able to bring us space. Here’s how we have,Paragraph
established certain invariable points. Some facades are,Paragraph
painted in burnt sienna. We have made the lines of other,Paragraph
"houses recede, through clear ultramarine blue. Again we",Paragraph
have confused certain sections with the foliage of gardens,Paragraph
"and trees, through pale green facades.*",Paragraph
"Unlike his European contemporaries, Gropius [135] and",Paragraph
"Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier was anxious to develop the",Paragraph
urban connotations of his architecture. The Ville,Paragraph
Contemporaine for three million was the ultimate,Paragraph
demonstration of this aspect in his work up to 1922.,Paragraph
Influenced equally by the gridded skyscraper cities of the,Paragraph
United States and the image of the ‘city-crown’ as put,Paragraph
"forward by Bruno Taut in his book Die Stadtkrone (1919), Le",Paragraph
Corbusier projected the Ville Contemporaine as an élite,Paragraph
"capitalist city of administration and control, with garden",Paragraph
"cities for the workers being sited, along with industry,",Paragraph
beyond the ‘security zone’ of the green belt encompassing,Paragraph
the city.,Paragraph
"135 Gropius, Frau Gropius and Le Corbusier in a Paris café.",Caption
"136 Le Corbusier, Pessac housing estate, near Bordeaux, 1926, on opening day.",Caption
"The city itself, textured like an oriental carpet and some",Paragraph
"four times the surface area of Manhattan, consisted of",Paragraph
residential blocks some ten to twelve storeys in height plus,Paragraph
"twenty-four sixty-storey office towers in the centre, the",Caption
"whole surrounded by a Picturesque park which, like the",Paragraph
"traditional g/acis, maintained the class separation of the",Paragraph
urban élite from the suburban proletariat. The cruciform,Paragraph
office towers themselves - the so-called Cartesian,Paragraph
skyscrapers - were reminiscent in their serrated plan profile,Paragraph
of stepped Khmer or Indian temple forms and as such they,Paragraph
were evidently intended to replace as secular centres of,Paragraph
power the religious structures of the traditional city. That,Paragraph
such an authority was attributed to these forms is,Paragraph
suggested by their proportional relation to the grid of the,Paragraph
"city, where they take up a golden section of the surface area",Paragraph
"in plan, within the double square occupied by the city as a",Paragraph
whole.,Paragraph
None of this was lost on the Communist newspaper,Paragraph
"L’Humanité, which regarded the entire project as",Paragraph
reactionary. Their sense of Le Corbusier’s commitment to,Paragraph
Saint-Simonian methods of management and control was,Paragraph
entirely confirmed by the publication of his book Urbanisme,Paragraph
"(The City of Tomorrow) in 1925, its last plate depicting Louis",Paragraph
XIV supervising the building of the Invalides. Even Le,Paragraph
Corbusier was sufficiently embarrassed by this image to,Paragraph
place underneath its caption the rider that it was not to be,Paragraph
understood as support for the French Fascist party Action,Paragraph
Francaise.,Paragraph
The Ville Contemporaine was no less ideological in the,Paragraph
"detailed organization of its residential districts, which were",Paragraph
made up of two different block prototypes - the perimeter,Paragraph
block [137] and the ‘set-back’ or redent formation - each,Paragraph
postulating a different conception of the city. The former,Paragraph
was still committed to the idea of a ‘walled’ city made up of,Paragraph
"streets, while the latter pre-supposed a wall-less ‘open city’,",Paragraph
"that vision finally to be achieved in the Ville Radieuse, of a",Paragraph
dense city elevated above the surface of a continuous park.,Paragraph
The implicitly anti-street polemic of this vision was finally,Paragraph
made explicit in an essay on the street that Le Corbusier,Paragraph
wrote in 1929 for the Syndicalist newspaper L’/ntransigeant.,Paragraph
"137 Le Corbusier and Jeanneret, Ville Contemporaine, 1922. Cellular perimeter",Caption
block composed of Immeuble-Villa units.,Paragraph
Apart from providing the ‘essential joys’ of sunlight and,Paragraph
"green, the open city was supposed to facilitate locomotion,",Paragraph
in accordance with Le Corbusier’s entrepreneurial aphorism,Paragraph
that ‘A city made for speed is a city made for success.’ This,Paragraph
was part of the rhetoric that accompanied his ‘Plan Voisin’,Paragraph
proposal for Paris of 1925 [138] - the paradoxical notion,Paragraph
that the automobile having effectively destroyed the great,Paragraph
city could now be exploited as an instrument for its,Paragraph
"salvation. Notwithstanding their financial support, the",Paragraph
"car/aircraft cartel, Voisin was no doubt only too aware of the",Paragraph
economic and political impossibility of raising vast cruciform,Title
towers next to the lle de la Cité.,Caption
"138 Le Corbusier and Jeanneret, Plan Voisin proposal for Paris, 1925. The hand",Caption
points towards the new business centre of the city.,Paragraph
The most important and enduring contribution of the Ville,Paragraph
"Contemporaine was its Immeuble-Villa unit, an adaptation of",Paragraph
"the Maison Citrohan as a general type for high-rise, high-",Paragraph
"density living. These units, stacked up on six double floors,",Paragraph
"included garden terraces, one for each duplex, an",Paragraph
arrangement which today seems to be one of the few,Paragraph
acceptable solutions for high-rise family living. In the so-,Paragraph
"called ‘cellular’ perimeter blocks of the Ville Contemporaine,",Paragraph
these terraced duplexes opened at ground level to bounded,Paragraph
"rectangular green space, equipped with recreational",Paragraph
facilities for communal use. The marginal provision of,Paragraph
additional communal space within the block and around the,Paragraph
periphery of this area and the intended provision of hotel,Paragraph
service throughout situates this proposal somewhere,Paragraph
between the bourgeois apartment block and the socialist,Title
collective dwelling (compare the phalanstery and Borie’s,Paragraph
Aérodromes). The Immeuble-villa living unit was finally,Paragraph
worked out in detail and exhibited as a prototype in the form,Paragraph
"of the Pavillon de L’Esprit Nouveau, built for the Exposition",Caption
"des Arts Décoratifs held in Paris in 1925. Unfortunately,",Paragraph
"subsequent attempts to market this unit, both as a freehold",Paragraph
maisonette in the city and as a free-standing villa in the,Paragraph
"suburbs, did not meet with success. The Pavillon de L’Esprit",Paragraph

oriental rugs and South American pottery [139]. This finely,Paragraph
"balanced assembly of folk, craft and machine-made objects,",Paragraph

the patronage of the Minister for the Arts as a polemical,Paragraph
gesture against the Art Deco movement.,Paragraph

In 1925 Le Corbusier also returned to the theme of the,Paragraph
"bourgeois villa, first in his Maison Cook, completed in the",Paragraph
following year as a demonstration of Les 5 points d’une,Paragraph
"architecture nouvelle, which were published in 1926, and",Paragraph
"then in the project for the Villa Meyer, which anticipated the",Paragraph
"villa at Garches and the Villa Savoye at Poissy, completed in",Caption
1927 and 1929 respectively.,Paragraph
All these houses depended for their expression on the,Paragraph
syntax of the ‘five points’: (1) the pilotis elevating the mass,Paragraph
"off the ground, (2) the free plan, achieved through the",Paragraph
separation of the load-bearing columns from the walls,Paragraph
"subdividing the space, (3) the free facade, the corollary of",Paragraph

Rowe goes on to contrast the centralization of the Villa,Paragraph
Malcontenta with the centrifugality of the villa at Garches:,Paragraph
At Garches the central focus has been consistently broken,Paragraph

by a peripheral dispersion of incident. The dismembered,Paragraph

serial installation of interest round the extremities of the,Paragraph
plan.®,Paragraph
Aside from its Purist layering of frontalized planes in,Paragraph
space and its play with literal and phenomenal,Title
"transparency, remarked on by Rowe and Robert Slutzky,",Paragraph
Garches was significant for its resolution of a problem that,Paragraph
had first been posed by Loos: how to combine the comfort,Paragraph
and informality of the Arts and Crafts plan with the,Paragraph
"asperities of geometrical, if not Neo-Classical, form - how to",Paragraph
reconcile the private realm of modern convenience with the,Paragraph
public facade of architectural order. As Le Corbusier’s Four,Paragraph
"Compositions of 1929 would indicate, Garches was able to",Paragraph
"achieve this, with an elegance denied to Loos, through the",Paragraph
displacements afforded by the invention of the free plan.,Paragraph
"The disjunction, so to speak, of the complex interior was",Paragraph
"held away from the public front, by the elision of the free",Paragraph
facade.,Caption
"If Garches is to be associated with the Villa Malcontenta,",Paragraph

compared to Palladio’s Villa Rotonda. The almost square,Paragraph

"centralized ramp, may be read as a complex metaphor for",Paragraph
"the centralized and biaxial plan of the Rotonda. There,",Paragraph
"however, all similarity ends, Palladio insisting on centrality",Paragraph

"facile, pittoresque, mouvementé’; the second was shown as",Paragraph

With their 1927 entry to the international competition for,Paragraph
"the League of Nations (Société des Nations, or SdN)",Paragraph
"headquarters in Geneva [144], Le Corbusier and Pierre",Paragraph
Jeanneret produced their first design for a large public,Paragraph
structure. Their attention had hitherto been focused on the,Paragraph
house and on the concomitant simplicity of a basic prism.,Paragraph
Now they addressed themselves to the necessary,Paragraph
complexity of the ‘palace’ as a type. The competition's,Paragraph
"conditions stipulated two buildings, one for the secretariat",Paragraph
"and one for the assembly, and this programmatic duality led",Paragraph
the architects to take an Elementarist approach to the,Paragraph
design: the constituent ‘elements’ being first established,Title
and then manipulated in order to generate a number of,Paragraph
alternative arrangements. This extension of the,Paragraph
Elementarism professed at the turn of the century by the,Paragraph
Beaux-Arts master Julien Guadet would have come to Le,Paragraph
"Corbusier via Guadet’s pupils, Garnier and Perret. That he",Paragraph
was to adopt this approach generally when dealing with,Paragraph
large complexes is shown by his preliminary studies for the,Paragraph

There under eight alternative arrangements we read the,Paragraph
"caption: ‘the various stages of the project, wherein one sees",Paragraph

"project published in Le Corbusier’s Une Maison, Un Palais (‘A",Paragraph
"House, A Palace’) (1928). Under a symmetrical layout",Paragraph
"(evidently more rational, from an operational point of view),",Paragraph
we read: ‘alternative proposition employing the same,Paragraph
elements of composition’. The asymmetrical organization,Paragraph
finally adopted suggests a conflict between the circulatory,Paragraph
logic of the symmetrical layout and a Classical preference,Title
for an axial approach to the representative facade of the,Paragraph
principal building.,Paragraph

The SdN project is both the climax and the crisis point of,Paragraph
"Le Corbusier's early career: a moment of acclaim, denied (if",Paragraph
we are to believe him) by his disqualification on the grounds,Paragraph
that he had not submitted his entry in the appropriate,Paragraph
graphic medium. It represents the culmination of his Purist,Paragraph
"period, since it virtually coincides with the introduction into",Paragraph
his painting of figurative elements and of what he later,Paragraph
"called objets a réaction poétique, loosely translatable as",Paragraph
"‘objects evocative of poetic emotion’. From now on, while",Paragraph
"his painting became organic and figurative, his architecture,",Paragraph
"at a public level at least, became increasingly symmetrical.",Paragraph
In retrospect the League of Nations entry must be,Paragraph

seems to have had the effect of eventually arousing a,Paragraph
certain ideological mistrust.,Paragraph
Le Corbusier’s drive to resolve the dichotomy between,Paragraph
"the Engineer’s Aesthetic and Architecture, to inform utility",Paragraph
"with the hierarchy of myth, was bound to bring him into",Paragraph
conflict with the functionalist-socialist designers of the late,Paragraph
"1920s. His ‘Mundaneum’ or ‘Cité Mondiale’, designed in",Paragraph
"1929 for Geneva as a centre of world thought, provoked a",Paragraph
"sharp reaction from his Czech admirer, the left-wing artist",Paragraph
and critic Karel Teige. It was not the content but the form of,Paragraph
"the Cité that provoked Teige’s objections, particularly the",Paragraph
helicoidal ziggurat of the ‘Musée Mondial’. In 1927 Teige had,Paragraph
publicly supported Le Corbusier in the international dispute,Paragraph
over his League of Nations entry and had called on all other,Paragraph
"Czech artists to do the same. Now, barely two years later,",Paragraph
he attacked him with such vehemence that Le Corbusier,Paragraph
"was prompted to reply, in the essay entitled ‘The Defence of",Paragraph
"Architecture’, written for Teige’s journal, Stavba. In his",Paragraph
attack Teige had quoted from Hannes Meyer’s essay of,Paragraph
"1928, Bauen (‘Building’).",Caption
"All things in the world are a product of the formula, function",Paragraph
"times economics, so none of these things are works of art;",Paragraph
all art is composition and hence unsuited to a particular,Paragraph
"end. All life is function and therefore not artistic, the idea of",Paragraph
the composition of a dock is enough to make a cat laugh.,Paragraph
But how is a town plan designed or the plan of a dwelling?,Paragraph
Competition or Function? Art or Life®,Title
Le Corbusier placed this quotation at the head of his,Paragraph
"essay, Making it clear that his riposte was directed as much",Paragraph
to Meyer as to Teige. He then argued:,Paragraph
"Today amongst the avant garde of the Neue Sachlichkeit,",Paragraph
one has killed two words: Baukunst (Architecture) and Kunst,Paragraph
(Art). One has replaced them by Bauen (To Build) and Leben,Paragraph
"(To Live) ... Today, where mechanization brings us a gigantic",Paragraph
"production, architecture is above all in the battleship.",Paragraph
Monsieur Hannes Meyer; as in the conduct of war or in the,Paragraph
"shape of a pen, or in a telephone. Architecture is a",Paragraph
"phenomenon of creation, according to an arrangement.",Paragraph
"Whoever determines the arrangement, determines the",Paragraph
composition.?,Paragraph
In the same year as the Teige attack Le Corbusier,Paragraph
acknowledged in his book Précisions that the Mundaneum,Paragraph
"had been badly received by the German architectural Left,",Paragraph
but he saw no reason to modify his ultimate position and,Paragraph
therefore he maintained that,Paragraph
The buildings projected are strictly utilitarian - particularly,Paragraph

The plans of the Cité Mondiale bring to buildings which are,Paragraph

"another thing, from a simple response to a problem well",Paragraph
"stated,1°",Paragraph
"Nonetheless he could not, and indeed did not, deny that",Paragraph
the site layout of the Cité Mondiale had been determined by,Paragraph
"a network of tracés régulateurs, comparable to those used",Paragraph

Perret’s 25 bis Rue Franklin embodied the crystallization of,Paragraph
"Art Nouveau, which later morphed into the Art Deco",Paragraph
movement on the occasion of the Exposition Internationale,Paragraph
des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes of 1925 in Paris.,Caption
"This exhibition, originally scheduled for 1915, had to be",Paragraph
postponed for a decade owing to the outbreak of the First,Paragraph
World War. Although Perret was by no means opposed to,Paragraph
"ornament - particularly when it had a tectonic character, as",Paragraph
"seen in his Notre-Dame du Raincy, completed in 1924 - he",Paragraph
was unequivocally opposed to the idea of decorative art. He,Paragraph

which he argued that ‘Decorative art should be forbidden. |,Paragraph
would like to know who struck these two words together: art,Paragraph
"and decorative. Where there is true art, there is no need for",Paragraph
decoration.’,Paragraph
This antithesis between decorative art and architecture,Paragraph
was equally evident in the pavilions designed for the 1925,Paragraph
exhibition. They ranged from giant jewel boxes,Paragraph
"commissioned by Parisian department stores, such as Henri",Paragraph
"Sauvage’s pavilion for Le Printemps, to Perret’s structurally",Paragraph
"classical Théatre de l’Exposition des Arts Décoratifs, a",Paragraph
temporary structure built expressly for the exhibition and,Paragraph

showed how cubistic form could yield a sculpturally dynamic,Paragraph
architecture. Despite the fact that decorative artists were,Paragraph
"involved in the realization of this pavilion, including the",Paragraph
"metalworkers Jan and Joél Martel, the whole building could",Paragraph
be read as if it had been designed by a single hand. A final,Paragraph
decorative touch was provided by mannequins wearing,Paragraph
Sonia Delaunay’s ‘Simultané’ collection; they were,Paragraph
photographed in front of the pavilion against abstract,Caption

Paulette Pax wears an outfit designed for the occasion by Sonia Delaunay.,Paragraph
Mallet-Stevens had already established himself as an,Paragraph
architect for the high bourgeoisie two years earlier with the,Paragraph
design of a large villa for the Vicomte de Noailles at Hyéres.,Caption
He followed this with a series of equally large luxurious,Paragraph
"villas, culminating in a spectacular brick-faced house built at",Paragraph
"Croix in 1932. Alongside these set pieces, Mallet-Stevens",Paragraph
was also able to apply his modernist manner to such,Paragraph
typically 20th-century programmes as the Alfa-Romeo,Paragraph
"garage that he built in the Rue Marbeuf, Paris, in 1927. In",Paragraph
the same year he saw the completion of his civic set piece,Paragraph
"in the Auteuil quarter of the city, a syncopated sequence of",Paragraph
four- to five-storey cubistic town houses lining both sides of,Paragraph
a street that would thereafter bear his name [147]. Unlike,Paragraph
the interpenetrating spaces of the Maison Cook and the,Paragraph
"Rietveld Schréder House, Mallet-Stevens’s houses were",Paragraph
"relatively static. As in the typical Loosian Raumplan, the",Paragraph
rooms themselves were almost conventional and were it not,Paragraph
"for the occasional spiral stair, split level or double-height",Paragraph
"space, there would have been little spatial interplay within",Paragraph
the rather staid volumetric character of his work. This may,Paragraph
explain why Sigfried Giedion was reluctant to accept the,Paragraph
candidacy of Mallet-Stevens as the official French delegate,Paragraph
to CIAM when Le Corbusier proposed him as his replacement,Paragraph
in 1928.,Paragraph
"147 Rue Mallet-Stevens, view from one end of the street.",Caption
Although he was twenty years younger than Mallet-,Paragraph
"Stevens, André Lurcat made his debut at virtually the same",Paragraph
"time, so that by the time he was thirty-two, in 1926, he had",Paragraph
already built a number of artists’ houses in the Villa Seurat,Paragraph
"neighbourhood of Paris, together with the arresting form of",Paragraph
his Maison GuggenbUhl overlooking the Parc Montsouris.,Paragraph
Lurcat’s precocious talent finally became fully manifest in,Paragraph
"the Hétel Nord-Sud erected to his designs in Calvi, Corsica,",Paragraph
"in 1929, where a castellated, two-storey linear building,",Paragraph
"housing eight studio apartments, each with its own balcony",Paragraph
"facing the sea, was sensitively integrated into a rocky",Paragraph
coastline. There is a marked difference in this work between,Paragraph
the seaward versus the landward side: the latter maintained,Paragraph
the continuity of the form by remaining largely blank save,Paragraph
"for vertical slot windows, rhythmically articulating the long",Paragraph
facade.,Caption
The triumph of Lurgat’s early career was the design of,Paragraph
"the Karl Marx School [148], won in competition in 1930 and",Paragraph
"realized for the municipality of Villejuif, then under the",Paragraph
mayoralty of Paul Vaillant-Couturier. Lurgat’s mythical status,Paragraph
as the architectural champion of Léon Blum’s short-lived,Paragraph
Front Populaire (Popular Front) government in France is,Paragraph
surely in part due to his design for this radically modern,Paragraph
"school, conceived as a total antithesis of its typical 19th-",Paragraph
century predecessor. Envisaged as a civic community centre,Paragraph
"as much as a school, it incorporated an unusual programme,",Paragraph
"including a solarium, an aquarium and a stadium, as well as",Paragraph
"a series of airy, well-lit classrooms, within its long, three-",Paragraph
storey form. The Communist Vaillant-Couturier (in whose,Paragraph
memory Le Corbusier later designed a monument) saw the,Paragraph
"school as a ‘social-condenser’, and thereby arranged for its",Paragraph
"inauguration in 1933 with a socialist féte for 20,000 people.",Paragraph
During the 1930s it was publicized by the French Communist,Paragraph
Party throughout a series of photographs and films.,Paragraph
"148 Lurcgat, Karl Marx School, Villejuif, 1931-33, aerial view.",Caption
The year 1933 brought about a fundamental change in,Paragraph
Lurgat’s position as he reacted to attacks on modern,Paragraph
architecture in the French press. These came from such,Paragraph
"figures as Camille Mauclair, art critic of the bourgeois",Paragraph
"newspaper Le Figaro, and Waldemar George, who, shifting",Paragraph
"to the political right, advocated a regionalist-nationalist,",Paragraph
"proto-fascist architecture in his essay ‘Architecture, penser",Paragraph
"francais’ (‘Architecture, think French’) of 1934. It is",Paragraph
significant that this reactionary outburst coincided with the,Paragraph
emergence of the Third Reich in Germany and the Stalinist,Title
eclipse of the avant garde in the Soviet Union. In June 1934,Paragraph
Lurcat reacted against this French critique by reorganizing,Paragraph
"his studio as a collective and by visiting the Soviet Union,",Paragraph
assisted by the Association des Ecrivains et Artistes,Paragraph
Révolutionnaires (Association of Revolutionary Writers and,Title
Artists; AEAR). During this visit he was introduced by the,Paragraph
writer and critic Léon Moussinac to the major figures of the,Paragraph
"Russian cinematic and theatrical avant garde, including the",Paragraph
"cineastes Dziga Vertov, Vsevolod Pudovkin and Sergei",Title
"Eisenstein, and the creator of the biomechanical stage,",Paragraph
"Vsevolod Meyerhold. Despite these affinities, Lurcat adopted",Paragraph
"a critical line towards modern architecture, including that of",Paragraph
Le Corbusier regardless of his evident debt to the Franco-,Paragraph
"Swiss architect, not only for his epoch-making Vers une",Paragraph
architecture of 1923 - which influenced the line that Lurcat,Paragraph
would adopt in his own book L’Architecture of 1929 - but,Paragraph
also for the Purist ‘Five Points of a New Architecture’ of,Paragraph
"1926, which clearly influenced Lurcat’s own style. In his",Paragraph
"address to the Soviet Union of Architects, Lurgat denounced",Caption
Le Corbusier for his indifference towards the class struggle,Paragraph
"and for his emphasis on rationalized mass production, that",Paragraph
"is to say, the same technocratic emphasis of the German",Paragraph
refugee Marxist architects who by this date were already at,Paragraph
"work in the USSR. And yet, despite his warm reception of",Paragraph
the quasi-Classical syntax of Boris lofan’s winning design for,Paragraph
"the last Palace of the Soviets competition of 1931, Lurcat",Paragraph
continued to employ a variation of Neo-Purism in his own,Paragraph
work. This is evident from his design for a dom-kommuna,Paragraph
that he presented on his second visit to Moscow in 1934.,Paragraph
"Lurgat’s unpublished text of that year, ‘Neoclassicism ou",Paragraph
"Constructivism’, already outlined the cultural schism with",Paragraph
which he would be involved for the rest of his life. To this,Paragraph
"end, in his designs for the Moscow medical school, Lurgat",Paragraph
returned to a Classical rational order similar to that of Tony,Paragraph
"Garnier, an architect whom he admired throughout his life.",Paragraph
In the Paris of the 1930s a considerable number of,Paragraph
architects were of foreign origin and prominent among them,Paragraph
"was the Anglo-lrish architect Eileen Gray, who came to the",Paragraph
fore with her vacation house E-1027 of 1929 at Roquebrune-,Paragraph
Cap-Martin in the south of France [149]. She designed it,Paragraph
"with the Romanian émigré architect Jean Badovici, who first",Paragraph
encouraged Gray to venture beyond her successful career,Paragraph
as a furniture designer and into the field of architecture. In,Paragraph
1923 Badovici had been appointed editor of the magazine,Paragraph
"L’Architecture Vivante, which under his editorship became",Paragraph
the ultimate international record of the Modern Movement in,Paragraph
"Europe, between 1923 and 1933. Something of their",Paragraph
enigmatic relationship may be adduced from the name of,Paragraph
"the house, E-1027, which went beyond being a witty allusion",Paragraph
to an aircraft register number since it also encoded their,Paragraph
names: ‘E’ stood for Eileen and ‘10’ and ‘2’ respectively,Paragraph
represented the tenth and second letters of the alphabet -,Paragraph
"‘|’ and ‘B’ - and hence stood for Jean Badovici, followed by",Paragraph
‘7’ representing ‘G’ for Gray.,Paragraph
"149 Eileen Gray, Maison E-1027 at Cap Martin, 1929, axonometric.",Caption
"In E-1027, the lacquered screens and carpets that Gray",Paragraph
had produced in the 1920s are subtly integrated with,Paragraph
"pivoting, chromium-plated, tubular-steel equipment. The",Paragraph
overall interior alludes to romantic wanderlust of the,Paragraph
modern world: the name of Gray’s Transat chair refers to,Paragraph
transatlantic liners and the form of her Bibendum chair was,Paragraph
seemingly based on the mascot trademark of the Michelin,Paragraph

respond to the fluctuating vicissitudes of the Mediterranean,Paragraph
climate.,Paragraph
E-1027 was followed in the early 1930s by the,Paragraph

high-bourgeois interiors and this surely accounts to some,Paragraph
degree for the extremely hybrid character of the work.,Paragraph
"Chareau’s clients, Dr Jean Dalsace and his wife, Annie, had",Paragraph
intended to demolish an 18th-century three-storey town,Paragraph
house that stood on the site in order to erect their new,Paragraph
"residence in its place, but this proved to be impossible due",Paragraph
to the fact that the top floor of the existing building was,Paragraph
occupied by an elderly lady who refused to leave. This left,Paragraph
Chareau and Bijvoet with no alternative but to insert a steel,Paragraph
frame so that they could demolish the two storeys below,Paragraph
and construct a new three-storey residence within the,Paragraph
available volume. In order to allow sufficient light to,Paragraph
penetrate within such a deep space the forecourt and,Paragraph
garden elevations were faced throughout in translucent,Paragraph
"glass lenses, except for a fully glazed entrance hall facing",Caption
the forecourt and the occasional window or door opening to,Paragraph
the garden on the opposite side of the house. The resulting,Paragraph
"exotic atmosphere of the interior, permeated by light that",Paragraph
"became subaqueous in nature, was reinforced by the liberal",Paragraph
use of black lacquered storage cabinets on the second-floor,Caption
bedroom level overlooking the double-height salon of the,Paragraph
first floor. The translucent glass lenses making up the,Paragraph
envelope on both sides of the house were held in place by,Paragraph
"thin metal subframes, which, like the exposed two-storey",Paragraph
"steel columns of the salon, were finished in a standard red",Paragraph
"oxide paint, giving the interior a discernibly Japanese",Paragraph
"character. In this regard, the excessive number of bidets",Paragraph
distributed throughout the house surely suggests a kind of,Paragraph
unconscious irony given the fact that this was the residence,Paragraph
and the clinic of a leading gynaecologist. It is equally ironic,Paragraph
"that, although ostensibly conceived as a prototype for",Paragraph
"wholesale industrial prefabrication, the house should have",Paragraph
been largely handforged and painstakingly assembled piece,Paragraph
by piece.,Paragraph
"151 Chareau, Maison de Verre, Rue St-Guillaume, Paris, 1932. Axonometric.",Caption
"Subject to the ubiquitous influence of Le Corbusier, who",Paragraph
"allegedly visited the site during its construction, Chareau",Paragraph
and Bijvoet conceived of the house as a transformable,Paragraph
"machine a habiter (‘machine for living’), exploiting the",Paragraph
concept of the free plan not only to differentiate between,Paragraph
the partition walls subdividing the space and the largely,Paragraph
"free-standing supports of the exposed steel frame, but also",Paragraph
as a way of interconnecting the various spaces of the,Paragraph
interior so that they could be either ‘open’ or ‘closed’ to the,Paragraph
rest of the house through the manipulation of pivoting or,Paragraph

dating back to Victor Contamin’s Galerie des Machines of,Paragraph
"1889, had no followers prior to the Second World War,",Paragraph
except for the émigré architect Paul Nelson. He visited the,Paragraph
house soon after its completion and was so inspired as to,Paragraph
develop two significant projects in 1936: his somewhat,Paragraph
"surrealist Maison Suspendue and his canopied, extensively",Paragraph
"sunscreened proposal for a hospital in Ismailia, Egypt, for",Paragraph
"the Suez Canal Company, with its four operating theatres",Paragraph
encapsulated behind glass block walls [152]. Nelson,Caption
returned to certain aspects of this project in his Franco-,Paragraph
American hospital built at Saint-L6 (1948-56).,Paragraph

Other than the atelier of Le Corbusier and Pierre,Paragraph
"Jeanneret, three distinctly different practices continued to",Paragraph
be active in France throughout the 1930s. In the first,Paragraph
"instance was the atelier of Auguste Perret who, after",Paragraph
"realizing the Théatre de l’Exposition des Arts Décoratifs,",Paragraph
went on to produce the structurally Classical Musée National,Paragraph
"des Travaux Publics, Paris, under construction from 1936 to",Caption
"1939, but not finally completed until after 1945. Then there",Paragraph
was the more modernized Classical manner of Michel Roux-,Paragraph
"Spitz, who, having been a pupil of Garnier, was awarded the",Paragraph
"Grand Prix de Rome in 1920 and, following a mandatory",Paragraph
"period of study at the Villa Medici in Rome, opened his",Paragraph
practice with an ingenious infill apartment building erected,Paragraph
"in the Rue Guynemer, Paris, in 1925 [155]. Roux-Spitz was",Paragraph
particularly skilled at incorporating modern services -,Paragraph
including garages with car turntables and cleverly,Paragraph
integrated minimal kitchens - into such tightly packed infill,Paragraph
"apartment buildings with Classical formats, and he repeated",Paragraph
this exercise elsewhere in the city. In his residential work,Paragraph
"Roux-Spitz, like Ginsberg, displayed a preference for",Paragraph
elongated sash windows over Le Corbusier’s fenétre en,Caption
longueur. From 1932 onwards he received direct,Paragraph
"commissions from the French state, beginning with his",Paragraph
annexe to the Bibliotheque Nationale in Versailles.,Caption
The third most productive practice of the 1930s was that,Paragraph
"of Eugéne Beaudouin and Marcel Lods, in collaboration with",Paragraph
the designer-fabricator Jean Prouvé and the Russian émigré,Title
Vladimir Bodiansky. Together this team produced a,Paragraph
"prefabricated, light-weight metal, mobile building,",Caption
"comparable to Chareau’s Maison de Verre, but conceived for",Paragraph
an entirely different class of society. This exceptional,Paragraph
"structure, the Maison du Peuple, was completed in the",Paragraph
"working-class Paris suburb of Clichy in 1939 [153, 154].",Paragraph
"This building, wholly transformable not only in plan but also",Paragraph
"in section, was designed to function as a market hall during",Paragraph
"the day and as a 700-seat cinema or a 2,000-person",Paragraph
reception hall at night. The primary transformation of the,Paragraph
double-height market hall into a cinema depended on seven,Paragraph
"metal panels, normally stacked side by side, being lowered",Paragraph
into position from an overheard gantry in order to form the,Paragraph
elevated floor. This screening space was further enhanced,Paragraph
"by a light-weight metal, full-height, sliding-folding wall",Caption
panel system. The literal conception of the building as a,Paragraph
machine was taken one step further with its ferrovitreous,Paragraph
"roof, which could slide away in high summer, so as to create",Paragraph
an open-air theatre.,Paragraph

Nothing could be more removed from the work of,Paragraph

"Auguste Perret over the same period, for from the beginning",Paragraph
Perret’s Structural Classicism was predicated on the,Paragraph
"universality of a single material, namely reinforced",Paragraph
concrete. As Leonardo Benevolo put it in 1960:,Paragraph
The French tradition ... was based on the correspondence,Paragraph
between classical rules and building practice ... Perret,Paragraph
steeped in this tradition was naturally led to identify,Paragraph
concrete framework ... with the framework as it was to,Paragraph
appear on the outside of a building ... He probably believed,Paragraph
that he had discovered the structural system best suited to,Paragraph
the realization of traditional works since the unity of its,Paragraph
elements was real not apparent as in the classical orders,Paragraph
composed of several blocks of stone.?,Paragraph
This was still the ethos of the Perret atelier when it was,Paragraph
commissioned after 1945 to rebuild the totally bombed-out,Paragraph
"city of Le Havre, which was then still a major French",Paragraph
"transatlantic port. This work, amounting to the",Paragraph
"reconstruction of an entire city from scratch [156], was built",Paragraph
"around the major axis of the Avenue Foch, with the Hétel de",Paragraph
Ville at one end and the port at the other. The surrounding,Paragraph
fabric depended on a somewhat awkward interplay between,Paragraph
a bush-hammered jn situ concrete frame and prefabricated,Caption
concrete window surrounds and infill wall panels. Needless,Caption
"to say, the windows corresponded to Perret’s concept of /a",Paragraph
"porte fenétre (‘window door’). Throughout his career, from",Paragraph
"the turn of the century onwards, he saw this as literally",Paragraph
representing the presence of the human being framed by,Paragraph
the opening before the traditional full-height double doors of,Paragraph
a French window.,Caption

Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,Title
"(quoted by Peter Carter in Architectural Design, March",Caption
1961)?,Paragraph
"As the above quotation makes clear, Ludwig Mies - he later",Paragraph
"added his mother’s name, Van der Rohe - was as much",Paragraph
inspired by the work of the Dutch architect Hendrik Petrus,Paragraph
Berlage as by that Prussian school of Neo-Classicism to,Paragraph
"which he became the direct heir. Unlike his contemporary,",Paragraph
"Le Corbusier, he was not educated within the Arts and Crafts",Paragraph
ethos of the Jugendstil. At the age of fourteen he entered his,Paragraph
father’s stone-mason’s business and after two years at a,Paragraph
trade school and a subsequent period as a stucco designer,Paragraph
"for a local builder, in 1905 he left his native town of Aachen",Paragraph
for Berlin where he worked for a minor architect specializing,Paragraph
in timber construction. There followed a further period of,Paragraph
apprenticeship with the furniture designer Bruno Paul before,Paragraph
"he ventured briefly on his own in 1907, to build his first",Paragraph
"house in a restrained englische manner, reminiscent of the",Paragraph
work of the Werkbund architect Hermann Muthesius. In the,Paragraph
"following year he joined Peter Behrens, whose newly",Paragraph
established Berlin office was beginning to develop an overall,Paragraph
house style for the electrical combine AEG.,Caption
"During his three years in Behrens’s office, Mies became",Paragraph
"aware of the Schinkelschdler tradition, which, apart from its",Paragraph
"Neo-Classical affiliation, was committed to the idea of",Paragraph
"Baukunst, not only as an ideal of technical elegance but also",Paragraph
as a philosophical concept. Schinkel’s brick-faced,Paragraph
"Bauakademie in Berlin, with its warehouse-like detailing,",Paragraph
was later compared by Mies to the articulate construction of,Paragraph
"Berlage’s Amsterdam Beurs or Exchange, which he had first",Paragraph
seen when he visited Holland in 1912. On leaving Behrens’s,Paragraph
"employ in 1911, after a brief stint as site architect on",Paragraph
"Behrens’s German Embassy in St Petersburg, Mies opened",Paragraph
"his own office with the Perls Haus, completed in Berlin-",Paragraph
Zehlendorf in that year. This was the first of a series of five,Paragraph
Schinkelesque houses to be designed by Mies before the,Paragraph
outbreak of the First World War. In 1912 he succeeded,Paragraph
"Behrens as architect to Mrs H.E.L.J. Krdller, who wanted a",Paragraph
gallery and residence in The Hague to house the famous,Paragraph
Krdéller-Miller collection: the project was mocked up in,Paragraph
canvas and wood at full size before being inexplicably,Paragraph
abandoned. This year also saw his Boullée-like monument to,Paragraph
"Bismarck, which was to be the last significant project of his",Paragraph
pre-war career.,Paragraph
The defeat and collapse of the German military-industrial,Title
imperium at the end of the First World War reduced the,Paragraph
country to a state of economic and political turmoil and,Paragraph
"Mies, like every other architect who had fought in the war,",Paragraph
sought to create an architecture that was more organic than,Paragraph
that permitted by the autocratic canons of the Schinkel,Paragraph
tradition. In 1919 he began to direct the architectural,Paragraph
"section of the radical Novembergruppe, named after the",Paragraph
month of the Republican revolution and dedicated to the,Title
revitalization of the arts throughout Germany. This,Paragraph
association brought him into contact with the Arbeitsrat fur,Paragraph
Kunst and with the ideas of Taut’s Glass Chain (see Chapter,Title
"13), and there can be little doubt that his first skyscraper",Paragraph
project of 1920 was made in response to Paul Scheerbart’s,Paragraph
"Glasarchitektur of 1914. The same faceted, crystal",Caption
skyscraper theme occurred in his Friedrichstrasse,Paragraph
"competition entry of 1921 [157], and the publication of both",Paragraph
of these projects in the last issue of Taut’s magazine,Paragraph
Frdhlicht confirmed his post-war Expressionist affiliation.,Paragraph
Mies’s intent at this time was to render glass as a complex,Paragraph
reflective surface which would be constantly subject to,Paragraph
transformation under the impact of light. This much is clear,Paragraph
from the description that accompanied the first publication,Paragraph
of his Friedrichstrasse proposal:,Paragraph
"157 Mies van der Rohe, project for an office building in Friedrichstrasse, Berlin,",Caption
1919-21. First scheme.,Caption
In my project for a skyscraper at the Friedrich-strasse,Caption
Station in Berlin | used a prismatic form which seemed to,Paragraph
me to fit best the triangular site of the building. | placed the,Paragraph
glass walls at slight angles to each other to avoid the,Paragraph
monotony of over-large glass surfaces.,Paragraph
| discovered by working with actual glass models that the,Paragraph
important thing is the play of reflections and not the effect,Paragraph
of light and shadow as in ordinary buildings.,Paragraph
The results of these experiments can be seen in the,Paragraph
second scheme published here. At first glance the curved,Paragraph
"outline of the plan seems arbitrary. These curves, however,",Paragraph
were determined by three factors: sufficient illumination of,Paragraph
"the interior, the massing of the building viewed from the",Paragraph
"street, and lastly the play of reflections. | proved in the glass",Paragraph
model that calculations of light and shadow do not help in,Paragraph
designing an all-glass building.,Paragraph
It is instructive in this context to compare Mies’s entry,Paragraph
"with that of Hugo Haring. Where one is triangular,",Paragraph
"undulating and convex, the other is triangular, faceted and",Paragraph
concave. Otherwise the two solutions are similarly,Paragraph
"expressive, a coincidence that may be partly explained by",Paragraph
the fact that Haring shared an atelier with Mies throughout,Paragraph
the early 1920s.,Paragraph
Mies van der Rohe’s so-called ‘G’ period began in 1923,Paragraph
"with his participation in the first issue of the magazine G,",Paragraph
subtitled Material zur elementaren Gestaltung and edited by,Paragraph
"Hans Richter, Werner Graeff and El Lissitzky. His glass",Paragraph
"skyscrapers of the previous year, with their kinetic",Paragraph
"reflections on the surfaces of translucent forms, had already",Paragraph
anticipated something of the peculiar G sensibility which,Paragraph
seems to have combined a Constructivist objectivity with a,Paragraph
Dadaist feeling for chance. Yet the seven-storey office,Paragraph
building that Mies presented in the first issue of G broke,Paragraph
"different ground, for now the primary expressive material",Paragraph
"was not glass but concrete, projected in the form of",Paragraph
concrete ‘trays’ cantilevered off a reinforced-concrete,Caption
"frame. As in Frank Lloyd Wright’s Larkin Building of 1904,",Paragraph
the upstands of these ‘trays’ were high enough to,Paragraph
"accommodate standard built-in filing cabinets, set below a",Paragraph
band of recessed clerestory glazing. With this project Mies,Caption
declared himself against formalism and aesthetic,Paragraph
speculation and wrote with decidedly Hegelian overtones,Paragraph
that ‘Architecture is the will of the age conceived in spatial,Paragraph
"terms. Living, changing, new.’ At the same time he went on",Paragraph
to declare: ‘The office building is a house of work ... of,Paragraph
"organization, of clarity, of economy. Bright, wide,",Paragraph
"workrooms, easy to oversee, undivided except as the",Paragraph
undertaking is divided. The maximum effect with the,Paragraph
"minimum expenditure of means. The materials are concrete,",Paragraph
"iron, glass.’",Paragraph
Despite this objective advocacy of a ‘skin-and-bones’,Paragraph
"architecture reminiscent of Le Corbusier’s Dom-Ino proposal,",Paragraph
a vestige of academic tradition was visible in the project in,Paragraph
the widening of the end bays in order to ‘strengthen’ the,Paragraph
"corners of the building. This, however, was Mies’s last overt",Paragraph
reference to the Neo-Classical principles of Schinkel until his,Paragraph
"first gesture at a ‘new monumentality’ a decade later, with",Paragraph
his Reichsbank project of 1933.,Paragraph
Apart from the ever-present undertones of Neo-,Paragraph
"Classicism, Mies’s work after 1923 displays, to a varying",Paragraph
"degree, three main influences: (1) the Berlage brick",Paragraph
tradition and the dictum that ‘nothing should be built that is,Paragraph
not clearly constructed’; (2) the pre-1910 work of Frank,Paragraph
"Lloyd Wright, as filtered through the De Stijl group - an",Paragraph
influence acknowledged in the horizontal profiles extending,Paragraph
into the landscape of Mies’s brick country house of 1923,Caption
"[158]; and (3) Kasimir Malevich's Suprematism, as",Paragraph
interpreted through the work of Lissitzky. While the,Paragraph
Wrightian aesthetic could be readily absorbed within the,Paragraph
"Schinkelschdler tradition of Baukunst - that is, according to",Paragraph
the highest standards of European masonry practice -,Paragraph
Suprematism had the effect of encouraging Mies to develop,Paragraph
the free plan. Where Mies’s Baukunst ideal was fulfilled in,Paragraph
the Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg Monument (1926),Caption
"and in the Wolf House (1925-27), both built of brick, the free",Paragraph
"plan was to emerge fully armed, so to speak, in the",Paragraph
Barcelona Pavilion of 1929 [159].,Paragraph
"158 Mies van der Rohe, project for a brick country house, 1923.",Caption
"159 Mies van der Rohe, German Pavilion, World Exhibition, Barcelona, 1929.",Caption
"Despite these diverse and compelling influences, Mies",Paragraph
still seems to have experienced difficulty in relinquishing the,Paragraph
Expressionist aesthetic of his Novembergruppe period. A,Paragraph
"comparable sensibility, touched by a somewhat Russian",Paragraph
"sense of colour, is still evident in the 1927 Berlin Silk",Paragraph
"Industry Exhibition, designed in collaboration with Lilly",Paragraph
"Reich, who had initially trained as a fashion designer. The",Paragraph
"black, orange and red velvets and the gold, silver, black and",Title
"lemon-yellow silks no doubt reflected her taste, as did the",Paragraph
"acid-green, cowhide upholstery used for the sitting-room",Caption
furniture of the Tugendhat House. A latent feeling for,Paragraph
"Expressionism may still be detected, too, in the Deutsche",Paragraph
Werkbund Weissenhofsiedlung Exhibition which opened in,Paragraph
Stuttgart in the same year. Despite a tendency to regard,Paragraph
"every commission as a free-standing object, Mies initially",Paragraph
"planned this exhibition as a continuous urban form, like a",Paragraph
"medieval town. It even had a vestigial Stadtkrone, a pseudo-",Paragraph
Tautian gesture towards unity that had to be abandoned. In,Paragraph
the final version of the layout Mies divided the site into,Paragraph
"rectilinear plots, on which free-standing ‘display’ houses",Paragraph
"were erected to the designs of various Werkbund architects,",Paragraph
among them Walter Gropius and Hans Scharoun. A number,Paragraph
"of foreign architects also participated, including Le",Paragraph
"Corbusier, Victor Bourgeois, J.J.P. Oud and Mart Stam.",Caption
Initially conceived in the spirit of the original Darmstadt,Paragraph
"exhibition of 1901, ‘Ein Dokument Deutscher Kunst’, the",Paragraph
Weissenhofsiedlung became the first international,Paragraph
"manifestation of that white, prismatic, flat-roofed mode of",Paragraph
building which was to be identified in 1932 as the,Paragraph
International Style. Mies’s contribution to both the style and,Paragraph
the content of the exhibition was an apartment house that,Paragraph
he designed as the centra/ armature of the scheme. This,Paragraph
five-storey structure was generally similar to the standard,Paragraph
"Zeilenbau block being developed at the time, but it differed",Paragraph
from the typical row-house slab in the ease with which it,Paragraph
could be brought to accommodate a variety of different,Paragraph
apartment shapes and sizes. Of his solution Mies wrote in,Paragraph
1927:,Title
Today the factor of economy makes rationalization and,Paragraph
standardization imperative in rental housing. On the other,Paragraph
"hand, the increased complexity of our requirements",Paragraph
demands flexibility. The future will have to reckon with both.,Paragraph
For this purpose skeleton construction is the most suitable,Paragraph
system. It makes possible rationalized building methods and,Paragraph
allows the interior to be freely divided. If we regard kitchens,Paragraph
"and bathrooms, because of their plumbing, as a fixed core,",Paragraph
then all other space may be partitioned by means of,Paragraph
"movable walls. This should, | believe, satisfy all normal",Paragraph
requirements.3,Paragraph
The climax of Mies’s early career came with the three,Paragraph
masterworks that he designed in sequence after finishing,Paragraph
the Weissenhofsiedlung: the German State Pavilion at the,Title
"Barcelona World Exhibition of 1929, the Tugendhat House at",Caption
"Brno, Czechoslovakia, of 1930, and the model house erected",Caption
for the Berlin Building Exhibition of 1931. In all these works,Paragraph
a horizontal centrifugal spatial arrangement was subdivided,Paragraph
and articulated by free-standing planes and columns. While,Paragraph
this aesthetic (already anticipated in Mies’s country house,Paragraph
"projects of 1922 and 1923) was basically Wrightian, it was",Paragraph
Wright as reinterpreted through the sensibility of the G,Paragraph
group and the metaphysical space conceptions of De Stijl.,Paragraph
"As Alfred Barr observed, the load-bearing walls of Mies’s",Paragraph
brick country house were disposed in a pinwheel fashion like,Paragraph
"the clustering elements of Van Doesburg’s painting of 1917,",Paragraph
Rhythms of a Russian Dance.,Paragraph
Despite the Classical associations of its regular eight-,Paragraph
"column grid and its liberal use of traditional materials, the",Paragraph
Barcelona Pavilion was undeniably a Suprematist-,Paragraph
Elementarist composition (compare Malevich's Future,Title
Planets for Earth Dwellers of 1924 and the work of his,Paragraph
indirect pupil lvan Leonidov). Contemporary photographs,Paragraph
reveal the ambivalent and ineffable quality of its spatial and,Paragraph
material form [160]. From these records we may see that,Paragraph
certain displacements in its volume were brought about by,Paragraph
illusory surface readings such as that effected by the use of,Paragraph
"green tinted glass screens, to emerge as the mirror",Paragraph
"equivalents of the main bounding planes. These planes,",Paragraph
"faced in polished green Tinian marble, in their turn reflected",Paragraph
the highlights of the chromium vertical glazing bars holding,Paragraph
the glass in place. A comparable play in terms of texture,Paragraph
and colour was effected by the contrast between the,Paragraph
internal core plane of polished onyx (the equivalent of,Paragraph
Wright’s centrally placed chimney core) and the long,Paragraph
travertine wall that flanked the main terrace with its large,Paragraph
"reflecting pool. Here, bounded by travertine and agitated by",Paragraph
"the wind, the broken surface of the water distorted the",Paragraph
"mirror image of the building. In contrast to this, the internal",Paragraph
"space of the pavilion, modulated by columns and mullions,",Paragraph
"terminated in an enclosed court, containing a reflecting pool",Caption
"lined with black glass. Above and in this implacable, perfect",Paragraph
"mirror, there stood the frozen form and image of Georg",Paragraph
Kolbe’s Dancer. Yet despite all these delicate aesthetic,Paragraph
contrasts the building was simply structured about eight,Paragraph
free-standing cruciform columns that supported its flat roof.,Caption
The regularity of the structure and the solidity of its matt,Paragraph
travertine base evoked the Schinkelschdler tradition to,Paragraph
which Mies was to return.,Paragraph
"160 Mies van der Rohe, German Pavilion, World Exhibition, Barcelona, 1929.",Caption
"Like the De Stijl room of 1923, the Barcelona Pavilion was",Paragraph
"the occasion for a classic piece of furniture, namely the",Paragraph
"Barcelona chair, which was one of five Schinkelesque pieces",Paragraph
that the architect designed in the years 1929-30 - the other,Paragraph
"four being the Barcelona stool and table, the Tugendhat",Paragraph
"armchair, and a buttoned-down leather couch. The",Paragraph
"Barcelona chair, framed in welded and chromium-plated bar",Caption
"steel and upholstered in buttoned-down calfskin, was as",Paragraph
integrated into the design of the pavilion as Rietveld’s,Paragraph
Red/Blue chair in the room designed for the Berlin,Caption
Exhibition.,Paragraph
"The Tugendhat House, built in 1930 on a steeply sloping",Paragraph
"site overlooking the city of Brno in Czechoslovakia, adapted",Caption
the spatial conception of the Barcelona Pavilion to a,Paragraph
domestic programme [161]. One may also see it as an,Paragraph
"attempt to combine the layered, compartmentalized",Paragraph
planning of Wright’s Robie House - where the service block,Caption
slides behind the main living volume - with the typical,Paragraph
"loggia form of the Schinkel Italianate Villa. In any event, the",Paragraph
free plan was reserved here solely for the horizontal living,Paragraph
"volume, which, modulated once again by chromium",Paragraph
"cruciform columns, opened on its long side to a panorama of",Paragraph
the city and on its short side to a conservatory faced in,Paragraph
large sheets of plate glass. While the mechanical lowering of,Paragraph
the long glass wall converted the whole of the living area,Paragraph
"into a belvedere, the conservatory acted as a natural foil in",Paragraph
a symbolic scheme - as a mediation between natural,Paragraph
vegetation and the fossilized onyx of the interior. In a,Paragraph
"comparable manner, the plywood dining alcove, faced in",Paragraph
"ebony veneer, evoked the sustenance of life to which its",Paragraph
"space was dedicated. Similarly, the rectilinear onyx plane",Paragraph
dividing the living volume of the house signified through its,Paragraph
surface the ‘worldliness’ of the spaces to be found on either,Paragraph
side of it - the sitting-room and the study. Such rhetoric,Paragraph
"obtained only on the lower ground floor, the bedrooms on",Paragraph
the entrance level being treated simply as hermetic,Paragraph
volumes.,Paragraph
"161 Mies van der Rohe, Tugendhat House, Brno, 1930.",Caption
"With the Berlin Building Exhibition house of 1931, on the",Paragraph
"other hand, Mies demonstrated the possibility of extending",Paragraph
"the free plan to the bedrooms, and for the next four years",Paragraph
he elaborated this approach in a series of extremely elegant,Paragraph
courtyard-houses that regretably were never built.,Paragraph
Mies van der Rohe’s idealism and his natural affinity for,Paragraph
German Romantic Classicism clearly served to remove him,Paragraph
from the mass-production approach of the Neue,Paragraph
Sachlichkeit. The sense of objectivity in each case was,Paragraph
patently different. As far as the Neue Sachlichkeit was,Paragraph
"concerned, Mies declared the apolitical, not to say",Paragraph
"reactionary, nature of his position when, in 1930, he",Paragraph
"accepted the directorship of the Bauhaus, as Hannes",Paragraph
"Meyer’s successor. In his essay The New Era, written on the",Paragraph
"occasion of his appointment, he attempted to formulate his",Paragraph
own somewhat ambivalent position. In response to Hannes,Paragraph
"Meyer’s ‘materialist’ essay, Bauen, he wrote:",Paragraph
"The new era is a fact: it exists, irrespective of our ‘yes’ or",Paragraph
"‘no’, yet it is neither better nor worse than any other era. it",Paragraph
"is pure datum, in itself without value content. Therefore |",Paragraph
will not try to define it or clarify its basic structure.,Paragraph
Let us not give undue importance to mechanization and,Paragraph
standardization.,Paragraph
Let us accept changed economic and social conditions as,Paragraph
a fact.,Paragraph
All these take their blind and fateful course.,Paragraph
One thing will be decisive: the way we assert ourselves in,Paragraph
the face of circumstance.,Paragraph
Here the problems of the spirit begin. The important,Paragraph
question to ask is not ‘what’ but ‘how’. What goods we,Paragraph
produce or what tools we use are not questions of spiritual,Paragraph
value.,Paragraph
How the question of skyscrapers versus low buildings is,Paragraph

The Russian pan-Slavic cultural movement that came into,Paragraph
being after the liberation of the serfs in 1861 manifested,Paragraph
itself in a widespread Slavophile arts and crafts revival. This,Paragraph
movement first appeared in the early 1870s on the,Paragraph

"Princess Tenisheva, for the purpose of reviving traditional",Paragraph
Slavic crafts. Where the achievements of the Mamontov,Paragraph

In contrast to the exuberant vitality of the Pan-Slavic,Paragraph

"By the eve of the First World War, avant-garde Russian",Paragraph
culture had already developed into two distinct but related,Paragraph
impulses. The first of these was represented by a non-,Paragraph
utilitarian synthetic art form that promised to transform,Paragraph
everyday life into that millennial future evoked by the,Paragraph
"poetry of Kruchonykh and Malevich. The second, as",Paragraph
"proposed by Bogdanov, was a post-Narodnik hypothesis that",Paragraph
sought to forge a new cultural unity from the material and,Paragraph
cultural exigencies of communal life and production. After,Paragraph
"October 1917, the revolutionary reality of the newly formed",Title
Soviet state tended to bring these two positions - the,Paragraph
"‘apocalyptic’ and the ‘synthetic’ - into conflict, leading to",Paragraph
"hybrid forms of socialist culture, such as Lissitzky’s",Paragraph
adaptation of Malevich’s ‘apocalyptic’ and highly abstract,Paragraph
art to the utilitarian ends of his self-styled Suprematist-,Paragraph
Elementarism.,Paragraph
In 1920 Inkhuk (the Institute for Artistic Culture) and,Paragraph
Vkhutemas (Higher Artistic and Technical Studios) were,Paragraph
founded in Moscow as institutes for comprehensive,Paragraph
"education in art, architecture and design. Both these",Paragraph
"institutions were to serve as arenas for public debate,",Paragraph
wherein mystical idealists such as Malevich and Wassily,Paragraph
Kandinsky and objective artists such as the brothers Pevsner,Paragraph
found themselves equally opposed by the so-called,Paragraph
"Productivists, Vladimir Tatlin, Alexander Rodchenko and",Paragraph
Alexei Gan. In 1920 the challenge of the pure art position,Paragraph
"was most eloquently formulated by Naum Gabo (Pevsner),",Paragraph
who later wrote of his critical reaction to the Tatlin Tower:,Paragraph
| showed them a photograph of the Eiffel Tower and said:,Paragraph
‘That which you think is new has been done already. Either,Paragraph
build functional houses and bridges or create pure art or,Paragraph
both. Don’t confuse one with the other. Such art is not pure,Paragraph
"constructive art, but merely an imitation of the machine’.",Paragraph
"Despite the persuasive logic of such rhetoric, idealists",Paragraph
such as Gabo and Kandinsky felt themselves constrained to,Paragraph
leave the Soviet Union even though Malevich had,Paragraph
"succeeded in entrenching himself in Vitebsk, where shortly",Paragraph
"after 1919 he had founded his Suprematist school, Unovis",Paragraph
(the School of the New Art). This institution was to exercise,Paragraph
"a definitive influence on Lissitzky’s development, putting an",Paragraph
end to his expressionistic graphics and starting him on his,Paragraph
career as a Suprematist designer.,Paragraph
"In the meantime, a specifically proletarian culture had",Paragraph
spontaneously emerged from the communicational needs of,Paragraph
"the Revolution, imparting vitality to cultural forms which",Paragraph
might otherwise have remained remote from the actual,Paragraph
conditions of the period and from the real needs of a,Paragraph
"population which was still basically ill-housed, ill-fed and",Paragraph
above all illiterate. Graphic art came to play a salient role in,Paragraph
spreading the message of the Revolution. It took the form of,Paragraph
"large-scale street art, displayed in the Agit-Prop propaganda",Paragraph
trains [162] and boats designed by Proletkult artists and in,Paragraph
the ‘monumental propaganda plan’ launched by the,Paragraph
authorities shortly after the Revolution with the express,Paragraph
purpose of covering every available surface with,Paragraph
inflammatory slogans and evocative iconography. The,Paragraph
central task of Proletkult at this time was the propagation of,Paragraph
"official information through theatrical production, film and",Title
"exhortatory graphics, and its form was invariably nomadic",Paragraph
and demountable. Everything had to be easily transportable,Paragraph
and made at the simplest level of production. Apart from the,Paragraph
"dissemination of propaganda, Productivist artists such as",Paragraph
Tatlin and Rodchenko addressed themselves to the design of,Paragraph
light collapsable furniture and to the fabrication of durable,Paragraph
clothing for workers. Tatlin designed a stove that was,Paragraph
supposed to give off maximum heat while consuming the,Paragraph
minimum of fuel. The universality of this ‘nomadic’ impulse,Paragraph
is reflected in the light-weight furniture designed by,Paragraph
European architects in the late 1920s - the conceptually,Paragraph
"‘knock-down’, if not actually demountable, chairs produced",Paragraph
"by Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier, Mart Stam, Hannes",Caption
Meyer and Marcel Breuer. Breuer was particularly,Paragraph
susceptible to this influence: his famous Wassily chair of,Paragraph
1926 coincided with an almost identical canvas and tube,Paragraph
chair of about the same date designed in Vkhutemas. It is,Caption
"now clear, from recently discovered correspondence",Paragraph
"between Moholy-Nagy and Rodchenko, that after 1923 the",Paragraph
Bauhaus was subject to direct influence from Vkhutemas.,Paragraph
"162 Agit-Prop train, 1919.",Caption
"In the early 1920s, Proletkult attained its most synthetic",Paragraph
"expression through the theatre, most notably in Nikolai",Paragraph
"Evreinov’s ‘theatricalization of everyday life’, which used",Paragraph
the format of the tattoo to stage the annual re-enactment of,Paragraph
the storming of the Winter Palace. On less momentous,Paragraph
"occasions, street parades were organized in which",Paragraph
"Constructivist lay figures, invariably representing either the",Paragraph
"Revolution or its capitalist enemies, served as the focusing",Paragraph
icons for mass demonstrations. An equally polemical,Paragraph
intention prompted V. Meyerhold’s proclamation of ‘The,Paragraph
"October Theatre’, which attempted to translate such Agit-",Paragraph
Prop street activity into the principles of the agitatory stage.,Paragraph
Meyerhold’s ‘Octobrist’ proclamation of 1920 prescribed a,Paragraph
theatre comprised of the following elements and principles:,Paragraph
(1) the use of a permanently illuminated arena stage so as,Paragraph
to unite the audience with the actors; (2) an anti-naturalistic,Paragraph
"mode of mechanized production, featuring the actor-",Paragraph
acrobat as the ideal type for Meyerhold’s ‘biomechanical’,Paragraph
stage - a stage form that had obvious affinities with the,Paragraph
"circus; and finally, (3) the exclusion of illusion and the",Paragraph
elimination of any of the Symbolism that was then still,Paragraph
"endemic to the bourgeois theatre, exemplified by",Paragraph
Stanislavsky’s Moscow Arts Theatre. Similar prescriptions,Paragraph
were to inform Erwin Piscator’s foundation of the Berlin,Paragraph
Proletarian Theatre in 1924.,Paragraph
"Lenin came to distrust, if not to fear, Bogdanov’s radical",Paragraph
assertion that there were three independent roads to,Paragraph
"socialism - the economic, the political and the cultural. Yet",Paragraph
despite the official repudiation of Bogdanov in 1920 and the,Paragraph
subsequent subjugation of the Proletkult movement to the,Paragraph
authority of Narkompros (People’s Commissariat for,Title
"Education), the ethos of Agit-Prop culture persisted,",Paragraph
particularly in Meyerhold’s theatre. It also continued to find,Paragraph
"expression in the numerous projects for kiosks, tribunes and",Paragraph
other didactic information-structures designed by,Paragraph
Productivist artists such as G. Klutsis and Rodchenko. These,Paragraph
projects constituted the first attempts to formulate a non-,Paragraph
professional socialist style of architecture. Although,Paragraph
"intentionally ‘unrealizable’, Lissitzky’s 1920 design for a",Paragraph
"Lenin Tribune (see p. 142), projected as a Proun, was an",Paragraph
alternative for such an architecture. Lissitzky had coined the,Paragraph
"term Proun - from Pro-Unovis, ‘For the School of the New",Paragraph
"Art’ - to indicate an unprecedented creative realm, situated",Paragraph
somewhere between painting and architecture.,Paragraph
Paramount among such pioneer works was Tatlin’s 1919-,Paragraph
"20 design for a 400-metre (1,310-foot) high monument to",Caption
"the Third International [163], projected as two interwining",Paragraph
lattice spirals within which were to be suspended four large,Paragraph
transparent volumes each rotating at progressively faster,Paragraph
"speeds, once a year, once a month, once a day and,",Paragraph
"presumably, once an hour. They were respectively dedicated",Paragraph
"to the purposes of legislation, administration, information",Paragraph
and cinematic projection. On one level Tatlin’s Tower was a,Paragraph
monument to the constitution and function of the Soviet,Caption
state; on another it was intended to exemplify the,Paragraph
Productivist/Constructivist programme of considering,Title
"‘intellectual materials’, such as colour, line, point and plane,",Paragraph
"and ‘physical materials’, such as iron, glass and wood, as",Paragraph
"thematically equal elements. In this respect, one can hardly",Paragraph
regard the tower as a purely utilitarian object. In spite of the,Paragraph
anti-art and anti-religious slogans of the 1920 ‘Programme,Title
"of the Productivist Group’, the tower remained as a",Paragraph
monumental metaphor for the harmony of a new social,Paragraph
order. It was first exhibited under a banner which bore the,Paragraph
slogan ‘Engineers Create New Forms’. The millennialistic,Paragraph
symbolism of both its form and its material are clearly,Paragraph
manifest in a contemporary description which presumably,Paragraph
paraphrased Tatlin’s own words:,Paragraph
"163 Tatlin, model of monument to the Third International, 1919-20. Tatlin stands",Caption
"in the foreground, pipe in hand.",Caption
Just as the product of the number of oscillations and the,Paragraph
"wavelength is the spatial measure of sound, so the",Paragraph
proportion between glass and iron is the measure of the,Paragraph
material rhythm. By the union of these fundamentally,Paragraph
"important materials, a compact and imposing simplicity",Paragraph
"and, at the same time, relation, is expressed, since these",Paragraph
"materials, for both of which fire is the creator of life, form",Paragraph
the elements of modern art.3,Caption
"In its use of the spiral theme, in its enclosure of a series",Paragraph
of progressively diminishing Platonic solids and in its,Paragraph
rhetorical exhibition of iron and glass and mechanized,Title
"movement, as the very stuff of the millennium, Tatlin’s",Paragraph
Tower anticipated the work of two distinct tendencies in,Paragraph
Russian avant-garde architecture. One of these was the,Paragraph
"school which established itself within Vkhutemas, as part of",Paragraph
the first- and second-year course given by Nikolai A.,Paragraph
"Ladovsky. This structuralist, or rather formalist, school",Paragraph
"attempted to evolve a totally new syntax of plastic form,",Paragraph
based ostensibly on the laws of human perception. The,Paragraph
other was a much more materialist and programmatic,Paragraph
approach which clearly emerged in 1925 under the,Paragraph
leadership of the architect Moisei Ginzburg.,Paragraph
In 1921 Ladovsky urged that a research institute be,Paragraph
established at Vkhutemas for the systematic study of the,Paragraph
"perception of form. Vkhutemas basic designs, carried out",Paragraph
"under his supervision, always featured some rhythmic",Paragraph
"delineation of the surfaces of pure forms or, alternatively,",Paragraph
studies into the growth and diminution of dynamic form,Title
according to the laws of mathematical progression. These,Paragraph
Vkhutemas exercises often featured geometrically,Paragraph
"progressing volumes, rising or falling in both size and",Paragraph
location. On occasions these studies were proposed as,Paragraph
"designs for actual buildings, as in the suspended restaurant",Paragraph
"designed by Simbirchev about 1923 [164], a project whose",Paragraph
total transparency and extravagant access system echoed,Title
the expressive utilitarianism of the Productivists. Such a,Paragraph
fantastic structure was patently beyond the capacity of,Paragraph
"Soviet engineering at the time, while its numerous changes",Paragraph
in level would surely have limited its use as a restaurant.,Paragraph
"164 Simbirchev in the Vkhutemas atelier of Ladovsky, project for a suspended",Caption
"restaurant, c. 1922-23.",Caption
Ladovsky’s so-called ‘rationalism’ was anything but,Paragraph
"programmatic, for he ultimately sought, as Lubetkin has",Paragraph
"observed, a universalism of the Larousse type. Like the Neo-",Paragraph
"Classical artists of the late 18th century, he preferred to use",Paragraph
"geometrical entities such as spheres and cubes, forms that",Paragraph
could be hypothetically associated with specific,Paragraph
psychological states. In 1923 Ladovsky tried to propagate,Paragraph
his views through the foundation of Asnova (Association of,Paragraph
"New Architects), a professional group centred on",Paragraph
Vkhutemas. This organization attained its greatest influence,Paragraph
"about 1925, when both Lissitzky and the architect",Paragraph
Konstantin Melnikov were associated with it. Like the,Paragraph
wooden demountable market stalls that he designed in,Caption
"1924 [165], Melnikov’s USSR Pavilion for the Paris",Caption
Exposition des Arts Décoratifs of 1925 [166] was a,Paragraph
synthesis of the more progressive aspects of Soviet,Title
architecture to date. In its imaginative use of lap-jointed,Paragraph
"timber struts and planks, it recalled not only the traditional",Paragraph
"vernacular of the Steppes, but also those exhibition",Paragraph
pavilions which had been designed for the All-Russian,Paragraph
"Agricultural and Craft Exhibition of 1923, including the",Paragraph
"Izvestia kiosk by the artists A.A. Exter, Gladkov and",Caption
"Stenberg, and Melnikov’s own Makhorka Pavilion. In its basic",Paragraph
"conception, Melnikov’s Pavilion reflected the rhythmic",Paragraph
formalism of the Ladovsky school. Its rectangular plot was,Paragraph
animated by a staircase traversing the diagonal which,Paragraph
divided the ground floor into two identical triangles. This,Paragraph
"staircase, rising and falling through an open timber",Caption
"construction forming criss-crossing planes, gave access only",Paragraph
to the upper levels of the structure. Such an intersecting,Paragraph
roof form was soon to become as prevalent a ‘geometrically,Paragraph
progressive’ device among the Russian avant garde as the,Paragraph
logarithmic spiral of the Tatlin Tower. Melnikov’s dynamic,Caption
timber structure was complemented by Rodchenko’s interior,Paragraph
for an ideal workers’ club featuring typical light-weight,Paragraph
"Productivist furniture, including a dialectically red and black",Paragraph
chess-playing suite consisting of a table and two chairs.,Paragraph
"165 Melnikov, Sucharev Market, Moscow, 1924-25.",Caption
"166 Melnikov, USSR Pavilion, Exposition des Arts Décoratifs, Paris, 1925. Ground",Caption
"plan, first-floor plan and elevation.",Caption
The Asnova group sought not only to achieve a more,Paragraph
"scientific aesthetic, but also to devise new building forms",Paragraph
which would satisfy and express the conditions of the new,Paragraph
socialist state. Hence the preoccupation with workers’ clubs,Paragraph
and recreational facilities designed to function as new,Paragraph
‘social condensers’. This drive to invent new forms also,Paragraph
accounts for Lissitzky’s attempt to reconstitute the,Paragraph
"American skyscraper in a socialist form, in his Wolkenbugel",Paragraph
"(‘cloud-hanger’) project of 1924, conceived as an elevated",Paragraph
propylaeum opening onto the peripheral boulevard,Title
"surrounding the centre of Moscow. This work, however",Paragraph
"bizarre, was intended as a critical antithesis to both the",Paragraph
capitalist skyscraper and the Classical gate.,Paragraph
Melnikov’s early Productivist works were all built in the,Paragraph
period of relative economic stability that resulted from,Paragraph
"Lenin’s New Economic Policy (NEP), introduced after the",Paragraph
Civil War in March 1921 as a way of attracting foreign,Paragraph
capital into partnership with the Soviet Union. Lenin’s death,Caption
in January 1924 not only brought the period of NEP culture,Paragraph
"to an end, but also presented the Party with the ironic",Paragraph
problem of finding an appropriate style for his tomb. While,Paragraph
the Productivist manner could be considered adequate for,Paragraph
the representation of the Soviet Union at an international,Title
"exhibition of decorative art, it was much too insubstantial to",Paragraph
enshrine the founder of the first socialist state. Neo-,Paragraph
"Classicism, with its idealistic connotations, was equally",Paragraph
inappropriate. Something of this uncertainty is reflected in,Paragraph
the designs that the Academician Shchusev produced for,Paragraph
Lenin’s mausoleum. The first was a temporary wooden,Paragraph
"structure, which despite its symmetry displayed affinities",Paragraph
"with the Productivist aesthetic. The second, permanent",Paragraph
version in stone was an attempt at recreating the form of a,Paragraph
Central Asian Tartar tomb.,Paragraph
With Lenin’s death the heroic period of the Revolution,Title
came to a close. By now the Revolution had acquired a,Paragraph
"definitive history, from the hard-won victory over the Whites",Paragraph
in the Civil War to the tragic suppression of the Kronstadt,Paragraph
revolt against the Party and the NEP establishment of state,Title
capitalism within the proletarian state. Deprived of Lenin’s,Paragraph
"charisma, the immediate prospect was one of conflict rather",Paragraph
"than resolution - the fight for succession within the Party,",Paragraph
"the modernization of industry and agriculture, the campaign",Title
"against illiteracy, the daily struggle to provide shelter and",Paragraph
"food, the drive to electrify the country and the ever-present",Paragraph
"need to forge a real link between the industrial, urban",Paragraph
proletariat and a dispersed and vestigially feudal peasant,Title
"society. Above all, there arose the annual battle to extract",Paragraph
sufficient food for the urban populace from a recalcitrant,Paragraph
"and alienated countryside, which had stubbornly resisted",Paragraph
the inducements it had received under the provisions of the,Paragraph
NEP.,Paragraph
The most chronic problem from an architectural,Paragraph
standpoint was clearly housing. Nothing had been built,Paragraph
"since the beginning of the First World War, and the degree",Paragraph
to which the pre-war stock had deteriorated was reflected in,Paragraph
"the proceedings of the 13th Party Congress of 1924, where",Paragraph
housing was recognized as ‘the most important question in,Paragraph
the material life of the workers’. Faced with the task of,Paragraph
"meeting this deficiency, certain members of the younger",Paragraph
generation of architects felt that they could no longer,Paragraph
"indulge in the formalist preoccupations of the Vkhutemas,",Paragraph
still under the influence of Ladovsky.,Paragraph
"This reaction precipitated the formation of a new group,",Paragraph
"the Association of Contemporary Architects (OSA), whose",Paragraph
"initial membership, under the leadership of Ginzburg,",Paragraph
"comprised M. Barshch, A. Burov, L. Komarova, Y. Kornfeld, M.",Caption
"Okhitovich, A. Pasternak, G. Vegman, V. Vladimirov and the",Caption
brothers A. and V. Vesnin [167]. Soon after its foundation,Paragraph
"OSA began to admit members from related fields, such as",Paragraph
sociology and engineering. OSA’s essentially programmatic,Paragraph
orientation was as antipathetic to the Productivist culture of,Paragraph
the Proletkult as it was to the perceptual aestheticism of,Paragraph
Ladovsky. From the outset it attempted to change the,Paragraph
"modus operandi of the architect, from one who traditionally",Paragraph
had a craftsmanlike relation to his client to a new type of,Paragraph
"professional who was first a sociologist, second a politician",Paragraph
and third a technician.,Paragraph
"167 Typical Constructivist works of the 1920s: Korschev, Spartakiada Stadium,",Caption
"Moscow, 1926 (left: section of stand), and Vesnin, Pravda Building, Moscow,",Caption
"1923 (right: plans, section and view).",Paragraph
In 1926 OSA began to propagate these views in its,Paragraph
"magazine, Sovremennaya Arkhitektura (or SA:",Paragraph
"‘Contemporary Architecture’), dedicated to the",Paragraph
incorporation of scientific methods into architectural,Title
practice. In the fourth issue OSA conducted an international,Paragraph
"inquiry into flat-roofed construction, wherein Taut, Behrens,",Paragraph
Oud and Le Corbusier were asked to comment on the,Paragraph
technical viability and advantages of flat roofs. OSA also set,Paragraph
itself the task of formulating the necessary programmes and,Paragraph
"type forms for an emerging Socialist society, concerning",Paragraph
itself as well with the broader issues of energy distribution,Paragraph
and population dispersal. Thus its prime concerns were: first,Paragraph
the issue of communal housing and the creation of,Title
"appropriate social units, and second, the process of",Paragraph
"distribution, namely transit in all its forms.",Paragraph
"In pursuit of the former, it launched a second inquiry in",Paragraph
"SA in 1927, as to the appropriate form of the new communal",Paragraph
dwelling or domkommuna. The replies received were used,Paragraph
as the basis for a fraternal competition that attempted to,Paragraph
"develop and refine a new residential prototype, something",Paragraph
along the lines of Fourier’s phalanstery [168]. Most of the,Paragraph
entries gave symbolic and operational importance to an,Paragraph
"internal double-loaded corridor, a volume formed by the",Paragraph
interlocking of up- and down-going duplex apartments. A,Paragraph
version of this section came to be adopted by Le Corbusier,Paragraph
after 1932 as the ‘cross-over’ section of the typical block of,Paragraph
his Ville Radieuse.,Paragraph
"168 Ol, Ivanov and Lavinsky, interlocking duplex flats with central corridor, OSA",Caption
"competition, 1927.",Caption
All this activity prompted the government to set up a,Paragraph
"research group for the standardization of housing, under the",Paragraph
leadership of Ginzburg [169]. The work of this group led to,Paragraph
"the development of a series of Stroikem units, one of which",Paragraph
was adopted by Ginzburg for his Narkomfin apartment block,Paragraph
built in Moscow in 1929. While its internal street or deck,Paragraph
system gave direct access to an adjunct block containing a,Paragraph
"canteen, a gymnasium, a library, a day nursery and a roof",Paragraph
"garden, Ginzburg remained acutely aware that this implied",Paragraph
collectivity could not be imposed on the residents through,Paragraph
the built form alone. He wrote at the time:,Paragraph
"169 Design for a compact kitchen module with concealing screens, by the",Caption
"Building Committee of the Economic Council of the USSR, 1928.",Caption
We can no longer compe! the occupants of a particular,Paragraph
"building to live collectively, as we have attempted to do in",Paragraph
"the past, generally with negative results. We must provide",Paragraph
"for the possibility of a gradual, natural transition to",Paragraph
communal utilization in a number of different areas. That is,Paragraph
"why we have tried to keep each unit isolated from the next,",Paragraph
that is why we found it necessary to design the kitchen,Paragraph
alcove as a standard element of minimum size that could be,Paragraph

"In the previous year, OSA had turned its attention to the",Paragraph
"design of another type of ‘social condenser’, the workers’",Paragraph
club. Anatole Kopp has observed:,Paragraph
The year 1928 witnessed a mutation in club architecture. In,Paragraph
"spite of all their innovations, the existing clubs, even the",Paragraph
most modern such as those designed by Melnikov and,Paragraph
"Golosov, were sharply criticized for being centred on the",Paragraph
stage and tied to the professional theatre.°,Paragraph
"The reaction of Ginzburg’s protégé, Ivan Leonidov, was to",Paragraph
"project a totally different type of club, one which focused",Paragraph
more on educational institutions and athletic facilities. In,Paragraph
"1928 he began to produce a series of designs that were all,",Paragraph
"in effect, versions of his remarkable Lenin Institute projected",Paragraph
a year earlier for a site in the Lenin Hills outside Moscow. His,Paragraph
design for this institute of advanced studies consisted of two,Paragraph
primary glazed forms: a rectilinear library tower and a,Caption
spherical auditorium resting on a single point. The whole,Paragraph
"suspended, floating complex, stabilized by guying cables,",Paragraph
was to have been linked to the city by an elevated monorail.,Paragraph
Leonidov’s science-fiction concept of the club as a,Paragraph
Suprematist megastructure - a vision clearly influenced by,Paragraph
the work of Malevich - reached its climax in 1930 in his,Paragraph
"Palace of Culture project [170], whose glazed auditoriums,",Paragraph
"planetariums, laboratories and winter gardens were laid out",Paragraph
ona gridded rectilinear matrix that made few concessions,Paragraph
"to traditional landscaping. Its inscribed, almost",Paragraph
metaphysical surface was relieved by clumps of luxuriant,Paragraph
"vegetation and by prisms whose transparent forms, while",Paragraph
"revelatory of their interiors, were not functionally",Paragraph
determined. The dirigible and mooring mast included in the,Paragraph
composition were clearly intended to exemplify the same,Paragraph
light-weight technology as would be used for the,Paragraph
earthbound structures - buildings whose integrated space-,Paragraph
frame construction anticipated the mid-century work of,Paragraph
designers such as Konrad Wachsmann and Buckminster,Paragraph
Fuller.,Paragraph

"In such complexes, Leonidov envisaged the enactment of",Paragraph
"a continual process of education and recreation: athletics,",Paragraph
"scientific demonstrations, political meetings, films, botanical",Title
"displays, manifestations, flying, gliding, car racing and",Title
military exercises. The very utopianism of this vision,Paragraph
brought him under attack from the pro-Stalin group known,Paragraph
"as Vopra (‘All-Russian Association of Proletarian Architects’),",Paragraph
who condemned such schemes for their vain idealism.,Paragraph
"Before the consolidation of the Party line in architecture,",Paragraph
"instituted by the Ukase of April 1932, finally suppressed the",Paragraph

"condensation’ on a much larger scale, at the level of",Paragraph
"regional planning, which was then still in its infancy as an",Paragraph
"applied science. For the main OSA planning theorist,",Paragraph
"Okhitovich, the projected electrification of the Soviet Union",Title
offered itself as an infrastructural model for all forms of,Paragraph
regional planning. His strategy for the disurbanization of the,Paragraph
"country, to be carried out literally along the lines of the",Paragraph
"power grid and the road system, implied a critical attitude",Paragraph
towards the dom-kommuna and the supercommunes or,Paragraph
kombinats then being proposed by the main theorist of,Paragraph
"urbanization, L. Sabsovich. Okhitovich wrote in 1930:",Paragraph
We have now arrived at a moment of disenchantment with,Paragraph
the so-called ‘commune’ that deprives the worker of living,Paragraph
space in favor of corridors and heated passages. The,Paragraph
pseudo-commune that allows the worker to do no more than,Paragraph
"sleep at home, the pseudo-commune that deprives him of",Paragraph
both living space and personal convenience (the lines that,Paragraph
form outside bath-rooms and cloakrooms and in the,Paragraph
canteen) is beginning to provoke mass unrest.®,Paragraph
"In the event, the supercollective communes came to be",Paragraph
"discredited, not only for their social unacceptability but also",Paragraph
because their massive scale would have entailed the use of,Paragraph
sophisticated technology and scarce material resources. For,Paragraph
a while the disurbanization proposals of Okhitovich and N.A.,Paragraph
Milyutin found a favourable hearing in official circles. It,Paragraph
"proved easier, however, to gain acceptance for a theoretical",Paragraph
policy than to devise an economical land settlement pattern,Paragraph
"that could be generally applied throughout the country, and",Paragraph
for the remainder of its existence the OSA group was,Paragraph
somewhat divided as to how this could be best achieved.,Paragraph
"After the linear city schemes of Arturo Soria y Mata, they",Paragraph
"finally proposed ribbonlike settlements which, however",Paragraph
"imaginative, were often quite arbitrary in their specific",Paragraph
configuration. Typical of such proposals was Barshch and,Paragraph
"Ginzburg’s Green City scheme for the extension of Moscow,",Paragraph
published in 1930. This rather eccentric project comprised a,Paragraph
"cranked continuous spine of ‘bachelor’ units raised on stilts,",Paragraph
"which, aside from providing residential accommodation, was",Paragraph
apparently conceived as signifying the presence of the city.,Paragraph
On both sides of this spine communal facilities were,Paragraph
"provided at 500-metre (1,640-foot) intervals. These",Paragraph
buildings were flanked with the usual complement of sports,Paragraph
fields and swimming pools and sited within continuous park,Title
"strips lying on either side of the central spine, green ‘bands’",Paragraph
of varying width which were delimited on their outer edges,Paragraph
by the flow and return of one-way roads giving access to the,Paragraph
entire system. Ginzburg’s overall strategy was to use such,Paragraph
arteries for the progressive decantation of the existing,Title
"population of Moscow, thereby allowing the old capital to",Paragraph
deteriorate and to revert gradually to semirustic parkland,Paragraph
within which significant monuments would remain as,Paragraph
reminders of past culture.,Paragraph
By far the most abstract and theoretically consistent,Paragraph
proposition was the linear-city principle advanced by,Paragraph
"Milyutin, who argued in 1930 for a continuous city",Paragraph
comprising six parallel strips or zones. These zones were to,Paragraph
be arranged in the following sequence: (1) a railway zone;,Paragraph
"(2) an industrial zone containing within itself, in addition to",Paragraph
"production, centres for education and research; (3) a green",Title
zone accommodating the highway; (4) a residential zone,Paragraph
"subdivided into communal institutions, dwellings, and a",Paragraph
juvenile area containing schools and kindergartens; (5) a,Paragraph
park zone with sports facilities; and finally (6) an agricultural,Paragraph
zone.,Paragraph
A specific political and economic intent informed this,Paragraph
arrangement. Both industrial and agricultural workers were,Paragraph
"to be unified in the same residential zone, while any surplus",Paragraph
production from either industry or agriculture would flow,Title
directly into the warehouses situated in the railway or green,Paragraph
"zones, to be temporarily stored there and later redistributed",Paragraph
throughout the country. In accordance with the same,Paragraph
"‘biological’ model, solid waste from the residential zone",Title
would be channelled directly to the agricultural zone for,Paragraph
recycling into food. After the principles laid down in the,Paragraph
"Communist Manifesto of 1848, all secondary and technical",Title
"education was to be carried out in the place of work, thus",Paragraph
assuring the unity of theory and practice. Of this biological,Paragraph
schema Milyutin wrote:,Paragraph
There must be no departure from the sequence of these six,Paragraph
zones as this would not only upset the whole plan but would,Paragraph
make the development and extension of each individual unit,Paragraph
"impossible, create unhealthy living conditions, and",Paragraph
completely nullify the important advantages in respect of,Paragraph
production that the linear system embodies.’,Paragraph
In January 1929 the Soviet Government declared its,Paragraph
intention to found the city of Magnitogorsk in the eastern,Paragraph
"Urals for the exploitation of iron deposits, and Milyutin and",Paragraph
other OSA architects such as Ginzburg and Leonidov,Paragraph
submitted schematic proposals for the new city [171].,Paragraph
These variously abstract schemes were rejected by the,Paragraph
"authorities, who chose instead to commission the German",Paragraph
architect Ernst May and his Frankfurt team to design the,Paragraph
official plan for the town. The endless theoretical disputes of,Paragraph
the Russian architectural avant garde - the complex,Title
arguments and counterarguments of the ‘urbanists’ and the,Paragraph
‘disurbanists’ finally brought the Soviet authorities to,Paragraph
circumvent such factional issues and to invite the more,Paragraph
pragmatic and experienced left-wing architects of the,Paragraph
Weimar Republic to apply their normative methods of,Paragraph
planning and production (their Ze/fenbau layout and their,Paragraph
rationalized building methods) to the task of realizing the,Paragraph
building of the first Five-Year Plan.,Caption
"171 Leonidov, project for Magnitogorsk, 1930. A 20-mile (32-kilometre) road",Caption

The failure of OSA to develop sufficiently concrete,Title
proposals for planning on a large scale or to evolve,Paragraph
residential building types which were appropriate to the,Paragraph
"needs and resources of a beleaguered socialist state, in",Paragraph
conjunction with the paranoid tendency that emerged under,Paragraph
"Stalin for state censorship and control, had the effect of",Paragraph
bringing about the eclipse of ‘modern’ architecture in the,Paragraph
Soviet Union. For all his justifications of the need for,Paragraph
proletarian culture to be based on the ‘organic development,Paragraph
of those stores of knowledge which humanity has,Paragraph
"accumulated under the yoke of capitalism’, there is little",Paragraph
doubt that Lenin’s repression of the Proletkult in October,Paragraph
1920 was something of an initial step in the other direction.,Paragraph
It was certainly the first attempt to control the remarkable,Paragraph
creative forces that had been released by the Revolution.,Paragraph
"Lenin’s NEP programme was clearly a second step,",Paragraph
inasmuch as it set limits on the scope of participatory,Paragraph
"Communism. Above all, the economic compromise of NEP",Paragraph
seems to have entailed the recall and employment of,Paragraph
"‘politically unreliable’ experts from the bourgeois era, men",Paragraph
"such as Shchusev, ironically commissioned to design Lenin’s",Paragraph
"mausoleum. For all its effectiveness, this co-option of",Paragraph
bourgeois professionals under state supervision involved a,Paragraph
deep compromise that not only prejudiced the principles of,Paragraph
the Revolution but also inhibited the development of a,Paragraph
"collective culture. On the other hand, the historical",Paragraph
circumstances were such that the people were largely,Paragraph
incapable of adopting the way of life posited by the socialist,Paragraph
"intelligentsia. Furthermore, the failure of the architectural",Paragraph
avant garde to match their visionary proposals for such a,Paragraph
life with adequate levels of technical performance led to,Paragraph
"their loss of credibility with the authorities. Finally, their",Paragraph
appeal to an international socialist culture was clearly,Paragraph
"antithetical to Soviet policy after 1925, when Stalin",Paragraph
announced the decision to ‘build socialism in one country’.,Paragraph
That Stalin had no use whatsoever for élitist,Paragraph
internationalism was officially confirmed by Anatole,Paragraph
Lunacharsky’s nationalist and populist cultural slogan of,Paragraph

Le Corbusier,Title
"Vers une architecture, 19231",Caption
After the League of Nations competition of 1927 the,Paragraph
Engineer’s Aesthetic and Architecture seemed to refer,Paragraph
"increasingly to a schism within Le Corbusier’s own ideology,",Paragraph
rather than to an opposition that was capable of synthesis.,Paragraph
"By 1928, this split was most evident in the contrast between",Paragraph
the undeniable monumentality of the Cité Mondiale and,Paragraph
those delicate pieces of light-weight tubular steel furniture,Title
that he designed at the same time with Charlotte Perriand -,Paragraph
"le fauteuil a dossier basculant, le grand confort, la chaise",Caption
"longue, la table ‘tube d’avion’ and le siége tournant - all of",Paragraph
which were exhibited at the Salon d’Automne of 1929. A,Paragraph
certain rationalization of this difference in approach had,Paragraph
"been anticipated already in Purist aesthetic theory, which",Paragraph
had argued that the more intimate the relation between the,Paragraph
"man and the object, the more the latter must reflect the",Paragraph
"contours of his form, that is, the more it must approximate",Paragraph
to being the ergonomic equivalent of the Engineer’s,Paragraph
Aesthetic - and that conversely the more distant the,Paragraph
"relation, the more the object will tend towards abstraction -",Paragraph
"that is, towards Architecture.",Paragraph
As far as building was concerned this determination of,Paragraph
form through proximity and use was complicated by the,Paragraph
demands of large-scale production and by the consequent,Paragraph
necessity to distinguish between the creation of the one-off,Paragraph
monument and the potential advantage of using,Title
rationalized production methods for the general provision of,Paragraph
shelter. Such a distinction seems to have been the motive,Paragraph
"for Le Corbusier abandoning his perimeter block, otherwise",Paragraph
"known as the Immeuble-Villa, in favour of a building form",Paragraph
"more suited to mass production, namely his 2 redent Ville",Paragraph
Radieuse block projected as a continuous band of ‘on-line’,Paragraph
housing. Based on Eugéne Hénard’s Boulevard a Redans of,Paragraph
1903 (the term redan being borrowed like the term,Paragraph
"boulevard from the vocabulary of fortification), Le",Paragraph
Corbusier’s redent form consisted of a continuous terrace,Paragraph
whose frontage was alternately and regularly set back from,Paragraph
or aligned with the outer limits of the street.,Paragraph
The difference in the organization of the dwelling units in,Paragraph
these two types was as significant as the difference,Paragraph
between their exterior form. Where the Immeuble-Villa was,Paragraph
predicated (as its name suggests) on the qualitative,Paragraph
provision of the house with its ‘hanging garden’ as an,Paragraph
"autonomous unit, the Ville Radieuse type seems to have",Paragraph
"been orientated towards more economic criteria, that is,",Paragraph
towards the quantitative standards of serial production.,Paragraph
Where the Immeuble-Villa incorporated an ample garden,Paragraph
"terrace and a double-height living space, of fixed",Paragraph
"dimensions irrespective of family size, the Ville Radieuse",Paragraph
"(VR) unit was a flexible, single-storey apartment of varying",Paragraph
"extent, more economical in terms of space than the double-",Paragraph
height duplex section [172]. The VR unit optimized every,Paragraph
"available square centimetre of space, its partitions being",Paragraph
reduced in thickness to the point of becoming inadequate as,Paragraph
"acoustical barriers. To similar ends, the service cores,",Paragraph
"namely the kitchens and bathrooms, were reduced to a",Paragraph
"minimum. Moreover, each apartment was made capable of",Paragraph
"a certain transformation from night to day use, through the",Paragraph
withdrawal of sliding partitions. When closed these elements,Paragraph
subdivided the sleeping spaces and when open they yielded,Paragraph
a children’s play area that could be made continuous with,Paragraph
the living room. Through such devices the typical VR,Paragraph
apartment was designed to be as ergonomically efficient as,Paragraph
"the sleeping cabins of a wagon-/it, and indeed Le Corbusier",Paragraph
used many of the same space standards. With air,Paragraph
"conditioning and sealed facades, this was clearly an attempt",Paragraph
to provide the normative equipment of a machine-age,Paragraph
civilization. Close to product design and remote from,Paragraph
"architecture in the traditional sense, the VR block could",Paragraph
hardly have been further from the ethos of the Cité,Paragraph
Mondiale.,Paragraph
"172 Le Corbusier and Jeanneret, Ville Radieuse, 1931. Plan of a five-bedroom",Caption
unit.,Paragraph
This shift from the self-contained perimeter block to the,Paragraph
continuous housing terrace and from the bourgeois standard,Paragraph
"of the ‘villa’ to an industrialized norm, may well have been a",Paragraph
response to the technocratic challenge of the left-wing of,Paragraph
CIAM - those German and Czech Neue Sachlichkeit,Title
architects whom Le Corbusier would have first encountered,Paragraph
at the founding CIAM congress of 1928 (see p. 146). These,Paragraph

"Frankfurt in 1929, on the occasion of the first working",Paragraph

‘Existenzminimum’ to determining optimum criteria for the,Paragraph
minimum standard dwelling. In repudiating the reductivist,Paragraph
approach of architects such as Ernst May and Hannes,Paragraph
"Meyer, Le Corbusier rhetorically proclaimed the space",Paragraph
"standards of his maison maximum, which happened to be",Paragraph
"an ironic play with the name of the economy car, voiture",Paragraph
"maximum, that he had designed with Pierre Jeanneret in the",Paragraph
previous year [173]. In this last respect they were to be,Paragraph
"proven right, since their voiture maximum became the",Paragraph
prototype for the austerity vehicles that were to be,Paragraph
produced on a large scale in Europe after the Second World,Paragraph
War.,Paragraph
"173 Le Corbusier and Jeanneret, voiture maximum, 1928.",Caption
This Neue Sachlichkeit encounter and the three visits,Title
that Le Corbusier made to Russia between 1928 and 1930,Paragraph
"brought him into close contact with the international Left, so",Paragraph
"much so that a Western reactionary critic, Alexandre de",Paragraph
"Senger, could denounce him soon after as being the Trojan",Paragraph
Horse of Bolshevism. Of greater consequence for his later,Paragraph
"development, however, was his exposure to the Russian",Paragraph
"OSA housing prototypes of 1927, with their interlocking",Paragraph
"duplex units, and his further encounter with the linear-city",Paragraph
concepts of N.A. Milyutin. Both of these ideas soon emerged,Paragraph
"in his own work, the ‘crossover’ duplex section in 1932 and",Paragraph
"the ‘linear-industrial’ city in 1935. Once assimilated, they",Paragraph
were reformulated by him in the mid-1940s: the former as,Paragraph
the prototypical section of his Unité d’Habitation and the,Paragraph
latter as the Cité Industrielle that was central to his regional,Paragraph

"By way of return, so to speak, he attempted to introduce the",Paragraph

technically ‘progressive’ but ultimately troublesome,Paragraph

double-layered glass wall (a standard technique of the Swiss,Paragraph

age city: amongst which the most important was the move,Paragraph
away from a centralized city model to a theoretically,Title
"limitless concept, whose principle of order stemmed from it",Paragraph
"being zoned, like the Milyutin linear city, into parallel bands.",Paragraph
In the Ville Radieuse these bands were assigned to the,Paragraph
following uses [174]: (1) satellite cities dedicated to,Paragraph
"education, (2) business zone, (3) transportation zone,",Paragraph
"including passenger rail and air transport, (4) hotel and",Paragraph
"embassy zone, (5) residential zone, (6) green zone, (7) light",Paragraph
"industrial zone, (8) warehouses plus freight rail and (9)",Paragraph
"heavy industry. It was paradoxical, to say the least, that",Paragraph
"something of a Humanist, anthropomorphic metaphor was",Paragraph
still inserted into this model. This much is evident from his,Paragraph
explicatory sketches of the period which show the isolated,Paragraph
‘head’ of the sixteen cruciform skyscrapers above the,Paragraph
"‘heart’ of the cultural centre, located between the two",Paragraph
halves or ‘lungs’ of the residential zone. Aside from the,Paragraph
distortions induced by such biological metaphors the linear,Paragraph
"model was strictly adhered to, thereby allowing less",Paragraph
hierarchic zones to expand independently of one another.,Paragraph
"174 Le Corbusier and Jeanneret, Ville Radieuse, 1931. Plan showing zoning in",Caption

The Ville Radieuse took the open-city concept of the Ville,Paragraph
"Contemporaine to its logical conclusion, and a typical",Paragraph
section through the entire city showed all the structures,Paragraph
"raised clear of the ground, including the garages and the",Paragraph
access roads. By virtue of elevating everything on pi/lotis the,Paragraph
ground surface would have become a continuous park in,Paragraph
which the pedestrian would have been free to wander at,Paragraph
will. The typical transverse section of the VR block and the,Paragraph
glass curtain wall or pan-verre in which it was enveloped,Paragraph
were equally crucial to the provision of the ‘essential joys’ of,Paragraph
"‘sun’, ‘space’ and ‘green’, this last being guaranteed not",Paragraph
"only by the park, but also by the roof garden, running along",Paragraph
the top of the continuous redent block.,Paragraph
"In 1929, before finalizing his plans for the ‘radiant city’,",Paragraph
"Le Corbusier visited South America where, piloted by the",Paragraph
"pioneer aviators Jean Mermoz and Antoine de Saint-Exupéry,",Paragraph
he had the stimulating experience of surveying a tropical,Paragraph
"landscape from the air. From such a vantage point, Rio de",Paragraph
"Janeiro impressed him as a natural linear city, laid out like a",Paragraph
"narrow ribbon along its corniche, with the sea on one side",Paragraph
"and steep, volcanic rocks on the other. The form of this",Paragraph
urban terrain seems to have spontaneously suggested the,Paragraph
"idea of the viaduct city, and Le Corbusier immediately",Paragraph
sketched [176] an extension of Rio in the form of a coastal,Paragraph
"highway, some 6 kilometres (3% miles) in length, elevated",Paragraph
100 metres (305 feet) above the ground and comprising,Paragraph
fifteen floors of ‘artificial sites’ for residential use stacked,Caption
beneath its road surface. The resultant megastructure was,Paragraph
shown in section as elevated above the average roof height,Paragraph
of the city.,Paragraph
This inspired proposal led directly to the plans for Algiers,Paragraph
developed during the years 1930 to 1933. The first of these,Paragraph
projected a motorway megastructure for the entire length of,Paragraph
"an equally spectacular corniche, given the code name",Paragraph
‘Obus’ because its concave enclosure of the bay resembled,Paragraph
the trajectory of a shell [175]. (Note once again the,Paragraph
appropriation of a military term.) With six floors beneath its,Paragraph
road surface and twelve above the idea of the ‘viaduct city’,Paragraph
"came into its own. Set some 5 metres (6 feet) apart, each of",Paragraph
"these floors constituted an artificial site, on which individual",Paragraph
owners were envisaged as erecting two-storey units ‘in any,Paragraph
style they saw fit’. This provision of a public but pluralistic,Paragraph
"infrastructure, designed for individual appropriation, was",Paragraph
destined to find considerable currency among the,Paragraph
anarchistic architectural avant garde of the post-Second,Title

proposed by Yona Friedman and Nicolaas Habraken).,Paragraph

The ‘erotic’ plan configurations created for the cities of,Paragraph
Rio de Janeiro and Algiers seem to have been related to,Paragraph
certain transformations in the expressive structure of Le,Paragraph
"Corbusier’s painting, which after 1926 began to move from",Paragraph
Purist abstraction towards sensuously figurative,Title
"compositions, featuring his so-called objets a réaction",Paragraph

"this time and the sensuous, heavy manner in which these",Paragraph
"were rendered lent a certain substance to his claim that, like",Paragraph
"Delacroix, he had rediscovered the essence of female",Paragraph
beauty in the casbah of Algiers.,Paragraph
Le Corbusier’s 1930 Algiers plan was his last urban,Paragraph
proposal of overwhelming grandeur. Reminiscent of the,Paragraph
"sensuous spirit of Gaudi’s Park Guell, his ecstatic",Paragraph
enthusiasm seems to have spent itself here in a passionate,Paragraph
poem to the natural beauty of the Mediterranean. From now,Paragraph
"on his approach to city planning was to be more pragmatic,",Paragraph
while his urban building types gradually assumed less,Paragraph
idealized forms. The cruciform Cartesian skyscraper was,Paragraph
"abandoned in favour of the Y-shaped office block, with which",Paragraph
it was possible to achieve a more favourable distribution of,Paragraph
"sun over the entire surface of the building. Similarly, his",Paragraph
typical VR redent block was distorted into an Arabesque,Paragraph
form in the Obus plan and then phased out entirely. This last,Paragraph
"modification, which led to his adoption of the free-standing",Paragraph
slab as his basic residential type (compare the Unité slab of,Paragraph
"1952), came with his 1935 proposals for the towns of",Paragraph
Nemours in North Africa and Zlin in Czechoslovakia [177].,Paragraph
While both of these plans were projected for steeply sloping,Paragraph
sites - for which the free-standing slab was eminently,Paragraph
"suitable - their chequerboard layout, set appropriately",Paragraph
"against the fall of the land, became a formula which was",Paragraph
soon to be applied everywhere irrespective of the,Paragraph
topography. As the typical Corbusian solution to high-,Paragraph
density housing it was to be copied with disastrous,Paragraph
consequences in a great deal of subsequent urban,Paragraph
"development, and the alienating environment created in",Paragraph
many of the post-war grands ensembles clearly owes much,Paragraph
to the influence of this model.,Paragraph
"177 Le Corbusier and Jeanneret, plan for Zlin, Czechoslovakia, 1935, showing it",Caption
organized as a linear city in parallel bands.,Paragraph
Aside from the context it afforded for the evolution of the,Paragraph
"Unité slab form, the significance of Zlin, designed for the",Paragraph
"shoe manufacturer Bata, lies in its ingenious adaptation of",Paragraph
the Milyutin linear-city proposal to a specific site. In linking,Paragraph
the old town and manufacturing centre of Zlin at the bottom,Paragraph
of the valley to the executive airport situated on the,Paragraph
"plateau, the road and railway paralleled the length of the",Paragraph
"valley, with the new industry on one side and the company",Paragraph
housing on the other. Zlin thus became Le Corbusier’s first,Paragraph
"formulation of the linear city after the Soviet model, a type",Paragraph
to be designated by him later as one of the three productive,Paragraph
"units (i.e. Etablissements humains), the other two being the",Paragraph
traditional radially planned city and the ‘agricultural co-,Paragraph
operative’.,Paragraph
The argument put forward in Les Trojs Etablissements,Paragraph
humains of 1944 was largely a reinterpretation of the,Paragraph
regional planning theses that had already been advanced by,Paragraph
the German geographer Walter Kristaller and the Spanish,Title
linear-city theorist Arturo Soria y Mata. Le Corbusier derived,Paragraph
his own regional model from Kristaller’s law of urban,Paragraph
"development which held that, other factors being equal,",Paragraph
urban settlements in Germany had always occurred at the,Paragraph
intersections of triangular or hexagonal grids. Using Soria y,Paragraph
Mata’s idea of the linear suburb Le Corbusier merely,Paragraph
complemented the Kristaller analysis by proposing that all,Paragraph
links between existing radio-concentric cities should be,Paragraph
developed as linear-industrial settlements. He went on to,Paragraph
show that the interstices within the grid could then be,Paragraph
developed as agricultural cooperatives. For this,Paragraph
comprehensive-regional approach it was necessary to,Paragraph
develop a new typology on an increased scale. Zlin was to,Paragraph
"serve as the generic ‘linear-industrial city’, and the ‘radiant",Paragraph
farm’ and the ‘radiant village’ designed in 1933 for the,Paragraph
Syndicalist agricultural worker Norbert Bezard were to be,Paragraph
posited as the constituent elements of the new agricultural,Paragraph
cooperative.,Paragraph
"Les Trois Etablissements humains, with which, according",Paragraph
"to Le Corbusier, one could both urbanize the town and",Paragraph
"urbanize the country, was an attempt to resolve the conflict",Paragraph
that had bitterly divided the Russian urban planners of the,Paragraph
"late 1920s, between the de-urbanists who had wanted to",Paragraph
redistribute the existing population throughout the Soviet,Paragraph
Union and the urbanists who had advocated the,Paragraph
maintenance of existing towns and the creation of additional,Title
urban centres.,Paragraph
"While the radiant city was never realized, its influence as",Paragraph
an evolving model on post-war urban development in,Paragraph
Europe and elsewhere was extensive. In addition to,Paragraph
"innumerable housing schemes, the specific organization of",Paragraph
two new capital cities was clearly indebted to ideas,Paragraph
embodied in the Ville Radieuse: namely Le Corbusier’s,Paragraph
master plan for Chandigarh of 1950 and Lucio Costa's plan,Caption
for Brasilia of 1957. Le Corbusier’s basic acceptance of the,Paragraph
"existing garden-city layout for Chandigarh, as produced by",Paragraph
"the American planner Albert Mayer in the very same year,",Paragraph
made it sufficiently clear that he had effectively abandoned,Paragraph
any notion of creating a finite city of significant form and,Paragraph
that he had shifted his general approach to promoting,Paragraph
models of dynamic growth on a regional scale. For all his,Paragraph
"modification of the Mayer plan, his ‘ideal city’ came to be",Paragraph
"reduced at this juncture to the government centre alone, the",Paragraph
Chandigarh Capitol of 1950. This realist strategy had,Paragraph
already been anticipated in his plan for St-Dié of 1946. From,Paragraph
"now on, like the masters of the Renaissance, he seems to",Paragraph
have been prepared to make up for the unrealizable whole,Paragraph
through the projection of a representational element on a,Paragraph
monumental scale.,Paragraph
Throughout the first half of the 1930s this latent,Paragraph
monumentalizing tendency in no way diminished Le,Title
Corbusier’s interest in equipping the ‘machine-age’,Paragraph
civilization. He continued to address himself to industrialists,Paragraph
and called attention wherever possible to his capacity for,Paragraph
"designing the large-scale objets-types, regarded by him as",Paragraph
being essential to the equipment of a new age. Such indeed,Paragraph
were the four major buildings that he realized between 1932,Paragraph
"and 1933: the Maison Clarté apartments in Geneva, the",Caption
"Pavillon Suisse in the Cité Universitaire, the Salvation Army",Caption
"Building and his own Porte Molitor apartments [178], the",Paragraph
"last three all being built in Paris. The modular, glass and",Paragraph
"steel, pan-verre facade employed in each case was intended",Paragraph
to demonstrate the ‘machine-age’ aesthetic. As such it,Paragraph
represented a break with the concrete frame and rendered,Paragraph
blockwork used in the villas of the 1920s. This apotheosis of,Paragraph
the Engineer’s Aesthetic paradoxically occurred at just that,Paragraph
moment when Le Corbusier was beginning to lose his faith,Paragraph
in the inevitable triumph of the machine age. Soon after,Paragraph
1933 he began to react against the rationalized production,Paragraph
"of the machine a habiter, although whether from disillusion",Paragraph
with modern technique as such or from despair in the face,Paragraph
of a world torn apart by economic depression and political,Title
reaction it is hard to know. As Robert Fishman has pointed,Paragraph
"out, he had always maintained a certain ambivalence with",Paragraph
regard to the promise of Taylorized mass production:,Paragraph
"178 Le Corbusier, Porte Molitor apartments. Paris, 1933.",Caption
Le Corbusier’s quest for Authority in the Thirties reflects,Paragraph
finally his deeply ambivalent attitude towards,Paragraph
industrialization. His social thought and his architecture,Paragraph
rested on the faith that industrial society had the inherent,Paragraph
capacity for a genuine and joyous order. But behind that,Paragraph
"faith, there was the fear that a perverted, uncontrolled",Paragraph
industrialization could destroy civilization. As a young man,Paragraph
"at La Chaux-de-Fonds he had seen ugly, mass-produced",Paragraph
time-pieces from Germany virtually wipe out the watch-,Paragraph
maker's crafts. The lesson was not forgotten.2,Caption
"Whatever the ultimate cause, primitive technical",Paragraph
elements began to appear in his work with increasing,Paragraph
frequency and freedom of expression from 1930 onwards.,Paragraph
"First in the pitched-roofed, timber and stone Errazuriz House",Caption
"projected in 1930 for Chile [179], then in the rubble-walled",Paragraph
"villa built for Madame Mandrot near Toulon in 1931, and",Paragraph
finally in two remarkable works of 1935 and 1937,Paragraph
"respectively: a concrete, vaulted weekend house built in the",Paragraph
"suburbs of Paris and his light-weight, canvas Pavillon des",Caption
"Temps Nouveaux, erected for the Paris International",Caption
Exhibition of 1937. While the roof of the former recalled not,Paragraph
"only his Maison Monol of 1919, but more profoundly the",Paragraph
"traditional barrel-vaulted construction of the Mediterranean,",Paragraph
the latter evoked not only the nomadic tent but also that,Paragraph
reconstruction of the Hebraic temple in the wilderness which,Paragraph
he had chosen to illustrate in Vers une architecture as an,Paragraph
example of regulating lines. With this series of works the,Paragraph
burden of expression now shifted from abstract form to the,Paragraph
means of construction itself. As Le Corbusier was to remark,Paragraph
of his weekend house: ‘The planning of such a house,Title
"demanded extreme care, the elements of construction were",Paragraph
the sole architectural means.’ Despite the archaic and,Paragraph
"vernacular references, both works still exploited aspects of",Paragraph
"advanced technology, the weekend house making telling",Title
"use of reinforced concrete, plywood and glass lenses and",Paragraph
the pavilion making a spectacular demonstration of steel,Paragraph
cable suspension in such a way as to recall the jointing,Paragraph
techniques which were then the province of aeronautical,Paragraph
construction. Finally both works seemed to be sophisticated,Paragraph
metaphors for a less doctrinaire future when men would,Paragraph
freely mix primitive and advanced techniques according to,Paragraph
their needs and resources (see Chapter 27).,Paragraph
"179 Le Corbusier and Jeanneret, Errazuriz House, Chile, 1930.",Caption
How resources in general might best be allocated in,Paragraph
socio-political terms was first explicitly formulated by Le,Paragraph
Corbusier in the contributions that he made from January,Paragraph
"1931 to the monthly Syndicalist journal, Plan, edited by",Caption
"Philippe Lamour, Hubert Lagardelle, Francois Pierrefeu and",Title
"Pierre Winter. In December 1931, in an essay entitled",Paragraph
"‘Décisions’, he established the political preconditions under",Paragraph
which his urban ideas might be fulfilled. His,Paragraph
recommendation that urban land should be requisitioned by,Paragraph
the state gave adequate ammunition to the forces of,Paragraph
"reaction, who had already chosen to see him as a Bolshevik",Paragraph
in disguise; while his demand that the state should forbid by,Paragraph
edict the production of useless consumer goods must have,Paragraph
"disturbed those on the technocratic right, who might",Paragraph
otherwise have taken him as an unequivocal representative,Paragraph
of their interests.,Paragraph
In 1932 Le Corbusier broke with Lamour and became a,Paragraph
member of the Committee for Regionalist and Syndicalist,Title
"Action and a contributory editor of its journal Pré/ude, edited",Paragraph
"by Hubert Lagardelle. As a protégé of Georges Sorel,",Paragraph

The second significant phase of Wright’s career was initiated,Paragraph

"in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1929, and by the first of his projects",Paragraph

"had the effect of rousing Wright from his Eldorado dreams,",Paragraph

Influenced by the role then being played by the Neue,Paragraph
"Sachlichkeit in Europe, Wright was induced to formulate a",Paragraph
new role for architecture in restructuring the social order of,Paragraph
the United States.,Paragraph
Ever since his address ‘The Art and Craft of the Machine’,Paragraph
"(1901), Wright had recognized that it was the destiny of the",Paragraph
machine to bring about a profound change in the nature of,Paragraph
"civilization. His initial reaction, lasting until 1916, had been",Paragraph
to adapt the machine to the creation of a high-level craft,Paragraph
"culture, that is, to apply it to the direct formation of his",Paragraph
"Prairie Style. Despite the fact that, for Wright, ‘machine’",Paragraph
expression always seemed to involve a certain rhetorical,Paragraph
use of the cantilever (the Robie House of 1909 is a typical,Paragraph
"example), he still insisted on the ultimate authority of",Paragraph
traditional materials and methods. Although anticipated in,Paragraph
the Coonley House (1908) and in Midway Gardens (1914) it,Paragraph
was the mid-1920s before Wright considered the assembly,Paragraph
"of entire structures from mass-produced synthetic elements,",Paragraph
such as the concrete-block mosaic of his Californian houses,Paragraph
or the modular curtain wall system that he devised for the,Paragraph
enclosure of monolithic concrete structures.,Paragraph
In being forced by the economy to recognize the limits of,Paragraph
"traditional materials and construction, Wright was caused to",Paragraph
"abandon the earthbound syntax of his Prairie Style, and",Paragraph
through a singular combination of reinforced concrete and,Paragraph
"glass he created a prismatic, faceted architecture whose",Paragraph
"glass exterior, borne on an armature of floating planes,",Paragraph
conveyed an illusion of total weightlessness. It was as,Paragraph
"though, like Paul Scheerbart before him, he had suddenly",Paragraph
"been possessed by the expressive qualities of glass, whose",Paragraph
crystalline translucence could be best complemented by the,Paragraph
liberating attributes of the column-free plan. The first,Paragraph
"occasion on which Wright, the master of masonry,",Paragraph
acclaimed glass as the modern material par excellence was,Paragraph
"in his famous Kahn Lectures, given at Princeton University in",Paragraph
1930. In ‘Style in Industry’ he stated:,Paragraph
"Glass has now a perfect visibility, thin sheets of air",Paragraph
crystallized to keep air currents outside or inside. Glass,Paragraph
"surfaces, too, may be modified to let the vision sweep",Paragraph
through to any extent up to perfection. Tradition left no,Paragraph
orders concerning this material as a means of perfect,Paragraph
"visibility; hence the sense of glass as crystal has not, as",Paragraph
"poetry, entered yet into Architecture. All the dignity of",Paragraph
colour and material available in any other material may be,Paragraph
discounted by glass as light and discounted with,Paragraph
permanence.,Paragraph
Shadows were the ‘brush work’ of the ancient Architect.,Paragraph
"Let the Modern now work with light, light diffused, light",Paragraph
"reflected, light for its own sake, shadows gratuitous. It is the",Paragraph
Machine that makes modern these rare new opportunities in,Paragraph
Glass.*,Paragraph
In 1928 Wright coined the term ‘Usonia’ to denote an,Paragraph
egalitarian culture that would spontaneously emerge in the,Paragraph
United States. By this he seems to have intended not only a,Paragraph
"grassroots individualism but also the realization of a new,",Paragraph
dispersed form of civilization such as had recently been,Paragraph
made possible by mass ownership of the automobile. The,Paragraph
car as the ‘democratic’ mode of locomotion was to be the,Paragraph
"deus ex machina of Wright’s anti-urban model, his",Paragraph
"Broadacre City concept, in which the concentration of the",Paragraph
19th-century city was to be redistributed over the network,Paragraph
of a regional agrarian grid (already anticipated in his entry,Paragraph
"for the City Club, Chicago, competition of 1913 for a",Caption
subdivision on the outskirts of Chicago [182]). He had first,Paragraph
spoken out against the traditional city in the last of his Kahn,Paragraph
"Lectures, which began: ‘Is the city a persistent form of social",Paragraph
"disease, eventuating in the fate all cities have met?’ It is",Paragraph
one of the ironies of our century that Broadacre City,Paragraph
corresponded more closely than any other form of radical,Paragraph
urbanism to the central precepts of the Communist,Title
"Manifesto of 1848, advocating ‘the gradual abolition of the",Paragraph
distinction between town and country by a more equable,Paragraph
distribution of the population over the land’.,Paragraph
"182 Wright, plan for the subdivision of a typical section of land, Chicago, 1913.",Caption
"Nevertheless, Wright’s first building projects for this new",Paragraph
"Usonian culture, the St Mark’s apartment tower and the",Paragraph
"Capital Journal newspaper building [183], both of 1931,",Caption
were urban rather than agrarian in tone. Eventually realized,Paragraph
"as the Price Tower in Bartlesville, Oklahoma (1952-55), and",Paragraph
"as the Johnson Wax Administration Building in Racine,",Paragraph
"Wisconsin (1936-39), both of these projects consisted of",Paragraph
reinforced-concrete cantilevered systems covered in a,Paragraph
crystalline membrane. At a symbolic level they embodied,Paragraph
the essential polarity that had been evident in Wright’s work,Paragraph
ever since his Martin House and Larkin Building of 1904 -,Paragraph
the fundamentalist assimilation of the building of the home,Title
to the processes of nature and of the workplace to the idea,Title
of sacrament. This polarization was to be brilliantly,Paragraph
reformulated in Wright’s Usonian period in two masterworks,Paragraph
"of unsurpassed richness and generosity, the Kaufmann",Paragraph
"weekend house at Bear Run, Pennsylvania, of 1936, better",Caption
"known as Falling Water, and the Johnson Wax Administration",Paragraph
Building begun in the same year.,Paragraph
"183 Wright, project for the Capital Journal Building, Salem, Oregon, 1931.",Caption
Section.,Paragraph
"For Wright, the word ‘organic’ (which he first applied to",Paragraph
architecture in 1908) came to mean the use of the concrete,Paragraph
"cantilever as though it were a natural, treelike form. He",Paragraph
seems to have conceived of such a form as a direct,Paragraph
extension of Louis Sullivan’s vitalist metaphor of the ‘seed,Paragraph
"germ’, extended now to include the whole structure rather",Paragraph
"than the ornament alone. Just before his death, Wright wrote",Paragraph
of the vulva-shaped pool in the foyer of the Guggenheim,Caption
"Museum: ‘Typical of the details of this edifice, the symbolic",Paragraph
figure is the oval seed pod containing globular units.’,Paragraph
In the Johnson Wax Administration Building this organic,Paragraph
"metaphor revealed itself in tall, slender mushroom columns",Paragraph
"tapering towards their bases, which form the prime support",Paragraph
within a 9-metre (30-foot) high open-planned air-conditioned,Paragraph
office space [184]. These columns resolve themselves at,Paragraph
"roof level into broad circular lily pads of concrete, between",Paragraph
which is ‘interwoven’ a membrane of Pyrex glass tubing.,Paragraph
These horizontal roof lights delicately supported by,Paragraph
"columns, and the columns themselves (whose hollow cores",Paragraph
serve as storm water drains and whose hinged bases are,Paragraph
"pin-jointed into bronze shoes), jointly represent the",Paragraph
apotheosis of Wright’s technical imagination. This was the,Paragraph
"expressive destiny of Usonia, a poetry of miraculous",Paragraph
technique arising out of a daring inversion of the traditional,Paragraph
elements. Thus where one would have expected solid (the,Paragraph
roof) one found light; and where one would have expected,Paragraph
light (the walls) one found solid. Of this inversion Wright,Paragraph
wrote:,Title
"184 Wright, S.C. Johnson & Son Administration Building, Racine, Wisconsin,",Caption
1936-39. Interior.,Caption
Glass tubing laid up like bricks in a wall composes all the,Paragraph
lighting surfaces. Light enters the building where the cornice,Paragraph
used to be. In the interior the box-like structure vanishes,Paragraph
completely. The walls carrying the glass ribbing are of hard,Paragraph
red brick and red Kasota sandstone. The entire fabric is,Paragraph
"reinforced concrete, cold-drawn mesh being used for the",Paragraph
reinforcement.3,Title
This concrete mushroom construction brought Wright to,Paragraph
"develop, for the first time, a curved corner profile and a",Paragraph
"predominantly circular vocabulary, which, executed in hard,",Paragraph
precise materials and lit throughout by translucent glass,Paragraph
"tubing, imparted to the structure a Moderne streamlined",Paragraph
aura which time has done little to dispel. At the same time,Paragraph
this science-fiction atmosphere rendered the Johnson Wax,Paragraph
"Building as a self-contained, monastic place of work. As",Paragraph
Henry-Russell Hitchcock wrote: ‘There is a certain illusion of,Paragraph
"sky seen from the bottom of an aquarium.’ Here again, as in",Paragraph
"his Larkin Building, Wright had created an hermetic",Paragraph
environment whose physical exclusion of the outside world,Paragraph
was reinforced by the form and colour of the special office,Paragraph
equipment designed for its furnishing.,Paragraph
While Johnson Wax reinterpreted the sacramental place,Paragraph
"of work, Falling Water embodied Wright’s ideal of the place",Paragraph
"of living fused into nature. Once again, reinforced concrete",Paragraph
afforded the point of departure; only this time the,Paragraph
"cantilevering gesture was extravagant to the point of folly,",Paragraph
in contrast to the implacable calm of the mushroom,Paragraph
structure of Johnson Wax. Falling Water projected itself out,Paragraph
"from the natural rock in which it was anchored, as a free-",Paragraph
floating platform poised over a small waterfall [185].,Caption
"Designed in a single day, this dramatic structural gesture",Paragraph
was Wright’s ultimate romantic statement. No longer,Paragraph
"restricted by the extended earth line of his Prairie Style, the",Paragraph
terraces of this house appeared as an agglomeration of,Paragraph
"planes miraculously suspended in space, poised at varying",Paragraph
heights above the trees of a densely wooded valley. Tied,Paragraph
back into the escarpment by the reinforced-concrete,Paragraph
"upstand beams of its terraces, Falling Water defies",Paragraph
"photographic record. Its fusion with the landscape is total,",Paragraph
"for, despite the extensive use of horizontal glazing, nature",Paragraph
permeates the structure at every turn. Its interior evokes,Paragraph
the atmosphere of a furnished cave rather than that of a,Paragraph
house in the traditional sense. That the rough stone walls,Paragraph
and flagged floors intend some primitive homage to the site,Paragraph
"is borne out by the living-room stairs which, descending",Paragraph
"through the floor to the waterfall below, have no function",Paragraph
other than to bring man into more intimate communion with,Paragraph
the surface of the stream. Wright’s perennial ambivalence,Paragraph
towards technique was never more singularly expressed,Paragraph
"than in this house, for although concrete had made the",Paragraph
design feasible he still regarded it as an illegitimate material,Paragraph
- as a ‘conglomera’ that had ‘little quality in itself’. His initial,Paragraph
intent had been to cover the concrete of Falling Water in,Paragraph
"gold leaf, a kitsch gesture from which he was dissuaded by",Paragraph
the discretion of the client. He finally settled for finishing its,Paragraph
surface in apricot paint!,Title
"185 Wright, Falling Water, Bear Run, Pa., 1936.",Caption
"From now on, aside from his remarkably practical",Paragraph
"Usonian houses, Wright continued to develop a curious kind",Paragraph
"of science-fiction architecture which, judging from the exotic",Paragraph
"style of his late renderings, seemed intended for occupation",Paragraph
by some extraterrestial species. This self-conscious,Paragraph
exoticism fell to the level of ultra-kitsch in his Marin County,Paragraph
"Courthouse, California, commissioned in 1957 and finished",Caption
"in 1963, four years after his death. Wright had already",Paragraph
acknowledged this compulsion towards the fantastic when,Paragraph
he wrote in 1928: ‘The fact remains Usonia wanted romance,Paragraph
and sentiment. The failure to get it is less significant than,Paragraph
the fact that it was sought.’,Paragraph
"Wright’s Usonian vision, first crystallized in his",Paragraph
"masterworks of the mid-1930s, attained its fulfilment in his",Paragraph
"Guggenheim Museum, New York, of 1943 [186]. The",Caption
structural idea and parti for the museum date back to his,Paragraph
sketch for the Gordon Strong Planetarium of 1925 -a,Caption
"science-fiction proposal par excellence, a ‘ziggurat’ destined",Title

"pilgrims. At the Guggenheim, he simply turned the",Paragraph
"diminishing helix of the planetarium inside out, inverting",Paragraph
and thereby converting what had previously been a car,Paragraph
"ramp into an internal, spiralling gallery, an extended spatial",Paragraph
helix which Wright later referred to as an ‘unbroken wave’.,Paragraph
The Guggenheim Museum must be regarded as the climax,Paragraph
"of Wright’s later career, since it combines the structural and",Paragraph
spatial principles of Falling Water with the top-lit,Paragraph
containment of Johnson Wax. His declaration that the,Paragraph
museum was more like a temple in a park than a mundane,Paragraph
business building or residential structure may be seen as an,Paragraph
ironic reference to the building’s origin in these projects.,Paragraph

"everywhere and nowhere, and that ‘it will be a city so",Paragraph
greatly different from the ancient city or from any city of,Paragraph
today that we will probably fail to recognize its coming as,Paragraph
the city at all’. Elsewhere he stated: ‘America needs no help,Paragraph
"to build Broadacre City. It will build itself, haphazard.’ Wright",Paragraph
neither sought nor found any satisfactory resolution to the,Paragraph
"inherent contradiction of this polemic. On the one hand, he",Paragraph
argued that men should consciously establish a new system,Paragraph
"of dispersed land settlement, anti-urban by definition; on",Paragraph

"In his historical determinism, Wright looked to the",Paragraph
machine as the one agent with which the architect has no,Paragraph
choice but to come to terms. But the old dilemma remained:,Paragraph
"how to do this without being brutalized? For Wright, this was",Paragraph
"the constant cultural quest of his long career. Thus, in The",Paragraph
"Living City (1958), we find him writing: ‘Miracles of technical",Paragraph
invention with which our “hit and run” culture has nothing to,Paragraph
do are - despite misuse - new forces with which any,Paragraph
indigenous culture must reckon.’ While he consigned steam,Paragraph
"power and the railway to instant oblivion, he welcomed (like",Paragraph
the Soviet de-urbanists of his day) electricity as a source of,Paragraph
silent power and the automobile as the provider of limitless,Title
movement. He identified the new forces which would,Paragraph
transform the entire basis of Western civilization as follows:,Paragraph
"(1) Electrification, the communicational annihilation of",Paragraph
distance and the constant illumination of human occupation;,Paragraph
"(2) Mechanical Mobilization, the immeasurable widening of",Paragraph
human contact due to the invention of the airplane and the,Paragraph
"automobile, and finally (3) Organic Architecture, which,",Paragraph
"although it always escaped any precise definition, seems to",Paragraph
have eventually meant for Wright the economic creation of,Paragraph
built form and space in accordance with the latent principles,Paragraph
of nature as these may be revealed through the application,Paragraph
of the reinforced-concrete construction. On another,Paragraph
"occasion, Wright characterized the resources that would",Paragraph
"implacably shape Broadacre City as the car, the radio, the",Paragraph
"telephone, the telegraph and, above all, standardized",Paragraph
machine shop production.,Paragraph
"For Wright, Usonian culture and Broadacre City were",Paragraph
"inseparable concepts, the former providing the prime",Paragraph
intention behind a whole range of buildings which were the,Paragraph
architectural substance of the latter. Falling Water and the,Paragraph
Johnson Wax Building would no doubt have found their,Paragraph
"appointed places in Broadacre City. Yet, by Usonia, Wright",Paragraph
generally intended something altogether more modest:,Paragraph
"warm, open-planned, small houses designed for",Paragraph
"convenience, economy and comfort. The heart of the",Paragraph
"Usonian house was the ‘time-and-motion’ kitchen, an alcove",Paragraph
"work space freely planned off the living volume, which, as",Paragraph
"Henry-Russell Hitchcock observed, was an important",Paragraph
contribution to American domestic planning. Of almost,Paragraph
equal import to the modern interior was Wright's,Paragraph
introduction at this time of continuous wall-seating to,Paragraph
maximize space in small houses. While single-family,Paragraph
Usonian homes were projected as the housing stock of,Paragraph
"Broadacre City, they were also actually realized in the",Paragraph
numerous suburban houses that Wright designed and built,Paragraph
"between 1932 and 1960, including the famous four-family",Paragraph
"Suntop Homes, arranged in a pinwheel formation, that were",Paragraph
erected on the outskirts of Philadelphia in 1939.,Paragraph
By far the most important building type designed for,Paragraph
Wright’s ideal city was not a house at all but the Walter,Paragraph
"Davidson Model Farm projected in 1932. This unit, designed",Paragraph
to facilitate the economic management of both home and,Paragraph
"land, was critical to the overall economy of Broadacre City,",Paragraph
where every man was to grow his own food on an acre of,Paragraph
"land which, reserved at his birth, would be placed at his",Paragraph
disposal as soon as he was of age.,Paragraph
Apart from a number of contingent social ideas such as,Paragraph
the single tax system or social credit - both popular,Paragraph
remedial notions in the Depression - Broadacre City was,Paragraph
above all an updating of that smallholding cottage-industry,Paragraph
"economy first advocated by Peter Kropotkin in his Factories,",Paragraph
Fields and Workshops of 1898. In reviving such a proposition,Paragraph
"there was at least one awkward contradiction which Wright,",Paragraph
"like Henry Ford, stubbornly refused to recognize: namely,",Paragraph
that an individualistic quasi-agrarian economy would not,Paragraph
necessarily be able to guarantee to an industrialized society,Paragraph
"either its subsistence or the benefits of mass production,",Paragraph
"since the latter, despite automation, still demanded some",Paragraph
concentration in both labour and resources. Even Kropotkin,Paragraph
acknowledged the need to concentrate labour and resources,Paragraph
for the processes of heavy industry. Wright’s vision of a city,Paragraph
"in which part-time smallholders would drive to work, to rural",Paragraph
"factories, in secondhand Model T Fords, suggests that a",Paragraph
"migrant, ‘sweat equity’ labour force would have been",Paragraph
essential for the success of the Broadacre economy.,Paragraph
"As Meyer Schapiro pointed out at the time, Wright,",Paragraph
despite his unremitting attack on rent and profit and his,Paragraph
"prescience in foreseeing the dissolution of the city, failed to",Paragraph
confront the urgent issue of power that was fundamental to,Paragraph
"the Broadacre concept. Like Buckminster Fuller, who was",Paragraph
"already active by this date, he could not bring himself to",Paragraph
"acknowledge that architecture and planning must, of",Paragraph
"necessity, address themselves to the class struggle.",Paragraph
"Schapiro summed up Wright’s utopianism correctly in 1938,",Paragraph
when he wrote:,Paragraph
The economic conditions that determine freedom and a,Paragraph
"decent living are largely ignored by Wright. He foresees, in",Paragraph
"fact, the poverty of these new feudal settlements when he",Paragraph
provides that the worker set up his own factory-made,Paragraph
"house, part by part, according to his means, beginning with",Paragraph
"a toilet and kitchen, and adding other rooms as he earns the",Paragraph
means by his labor in the factory. His indifference to,Paragraph
"property relations and the state, his admission of private",Paragraph
industry and second-hand Fords in this idyllic world of,Paragraph
"amphibian labor, betray its reactionary character. Already",Paragraph
"under the dictatorship of Napoleon III, the state farms,",Paragraph
"partly inspired by the old Utopias, were the official solution",Paragraph
of unemployment. The democratic Wright may attack rent,Paragraph

The first essential feature of interest is Karelian,Paragraph
architecture's uniformity. There are few comparable,Paragraph
examples in Europe. It is a pure forest-settlement,Paragraph
architecture in which wood dominates almost one hundred,Paragraph
percent both as material and as jointing method. From the,Paragraph
"roof, with its massive system of joists, to the movable",Paragraph
"building parts, wood dominated, in most cases naked,",Paragraph
without the dematerializing effect that a layer of paint gives.,Paragraph
"In addition, wood is often used in as natural proportions as",Paragraph
"possible, on the scale typical of the material. A dilapidated",Paragraph
Karelian village is somehow similar in appearance to a,Paragraph
"Greek ruin, where, also, the material’s uniformity is a",Paragraph
"dominant feature, though marble replaces wood. ... Another",Paragraph
significant special feature is the manner in which the,Paragraph
"Karelian house has come about, both its historical",Paragraph
development and its building methods. Without going,Paragraph
"further into ethnographic details, we can conclude that the",Paragraph
inner system of construction results from a methodical,Paragraph
accommodation to circumstance. The Karelian house is ina,Paragraph
way a building that begins with a single modest cell or with,Paragraph
"an imperfect embryo building, shelter for a man and",Paragraph
"animals, and which then figuratively speaking grows year by",Paragraph

this interior with its etched precision shows something of,Paragraph
"the same surface articulation as is found, say, in Otto",Paragraph

"Gustav Nystrém. Nystrém, aside from pioneering granite",Caption
"construction, had established himself as a Wagnerian",Paragraph

"and the Telephone Building in Helsinki (1905), were patently",Paragraph

Finnish medieval tradition. This Richardsonian manner was,Paragraph
"soon to be adapted by Eliel Saarinen and Armas Lindgren, in",Paragraph
their orientalizing Neo-Romanesque Finnish Pavilion for the,Paragraph
"Paris Exposition of 1900, and a domestic version of this",Paragraph
"manner was used in their highly romantic Villa Hvittrask,",Paragraph
designed in 1902 in collaboration with Gesellius [190].,Paragraph
"Inside, however, Hvittrask was less Richardsonian, and in",Paragraph
many respects a reworking of Gallén-Kallela’s log cabin,Paragraph

only five years earlier.) The swansong of the Finnish,Paragraph

"Naturally enough, given Finland’s long history as an",Paragraph

revival of Romantic Classicism in Scandinavia - the so-called,Paragraph
Doricist sensibility - began in Denmark. It came into being,Paragraph
there under the influence of writers such as Vilhelm,Paragraph
"Wansher, whose first articles on Neo-Classicism appeared in",Paragraph
"1907, and the German Paul Mebes, whose book Um 1800",Paragraph
was published in 1908. The interest of these men (and,Paragraph
others including H. Kampmann and E. Thompsen) in a non-,Paragraph
"historicist, primordial Doric simplicity, based on primal",Paragraph
architectonic elements which were neither Classic nor,Paragraph
"vernacular, drew attention to the Danish school of Romantic",Paragraph
"Classicism, to the work of Gottlieb Bindesbgll and Christian",Paragraph
"Frederick Hansen. This whole sensibility crystallized in 1910,",Paragraph
after the Carlsberg Brewery had publicly demanded that a,Paragraph
spire be added to Hansen’s Fruekirche. The architect Carl,Caption
Petersen responded to their arrogant gesture by organizing,Paragraph
an exhibition of Hansen’s drawings. In the following year a,Paragraph
group of painters responded by commissioning Petersen to,Paragraph
"design the Faaborg Museum, generally regarded as the first",Paragraph
building of the Romantic Classical Revival.,Caption
It was to take some time for this movement to enter,Paragraph
Sweden. The impulse is just discernible in Carl Westman’s,Paragraph
"Stockholm Law Courts of 1915, a part- National Romantic,",Paragraph
"part-Classical work, which was followed by Ivar Tengbom’s",Paragraph
Neo-Classical Stockholm Concert Hall (1920-26) and Gunnar,Title
"Asplund’s Stockholm Public Library (1920-28), the",Paragraph
movement culminating in Finland at the point of its,Paragraph
"exhaustion, with J.S. Sirén’s Finnish Parliament Building",Caption
"(1926-31). In Sweden the Romantic Classical Revival, far",Paragraph
"from being sachlich and normative, was distorted by a",Paragraph
tendency towards the inflection of the plan and by an,Paragraph
"obsession with local allusion, such as had been established",Paragraph
in the skewed planning and iconography of Ostberg’s,Paragraph
National Romantic manner. This was a restrained and,Paragraph
synthetic form of expression that invariably alluded to the,Paragraph
topography and the genius loci. This drive towards distortion,Paragraph
"was deeply engrained in Asplund who, having been",Paragraph
influenced by both Ostberg and Tengbom at the Klara,Paragraph
"School, sought sporadically throughout his career to",Paragraph
transcend the ‘battle of styles’ by fusing the vernacular and,Paragraph
the Classical into a primitive and more authentic form of,Paragraph
expression. The first opportunity to do this came with his,Paragraph
Woodland Chapel (1918-20) in the Stockholm South,Paragraph
"Cemetery, which he had planned as a competition design",Paragraph
"with Sigurd Lewerentz in 1915. Basically Classical in design,",Paragraph
"this small single-cell structure, with its crisply profiled",Paragraph
"shingle roof set on a Tuscan peristyle, was in fact derived",Paragraph
from a ‘primitive hut’ that Asplund had happened to see ina,Paragraph
garden at Liselund. Up to the time of his brief ‘Functionalist’,Paragraph
"period, lasting from 1928 to 1933, his work seems to have",Paragraph
been subject to influences as diverse and as separate in,Paragraph
"time as the French Neo-Classicists, Josef Hoffmann and",Paragraph
"above all Bindesbgll, whose Thorvaldsen Museum,",Paragraph
"Copenhagen, of 1848 furnished Asplund with the Egyptoid",Paragraph
and Neo-Classical motifs that recur in his work throughout,Paragraph
"the 1920s, first in the Carl Johan School at Goteborg of",Paragraph
"1915, then in the Skandia Cinema at Stockholm of 1921,",Paragraph
"and finally in the Stockholm Public Library, completed in",Caption
1928 [191].,Paragraph
"191 Asplund, Stockholm Public Library, 1920-28.",Caption
In Alvar Aalto’s early career it was Asplund who was the,Paragraph
"catalyst, despite the Wagnerschule influence of Aalto’s",Paragraph
"teacher, Usko Nystrém. By 1922, when he started on his",Paragraph
"own, Aalto, like Asplund before him, appeared to be moving",Paragraph
in several directions. The four buildings that he designed for,Paragraph
the Industrial Exhibition held at Tampere in that year,Paragraph
obviously allude to quite different levels of cultural,Paragraph
development. In all the rhetorical diversity of his later,Paragraph
"career, no contrast is so expressive as that to be found in",Paragraph
"his work there, between, say, his ‘Classical’ industrial",Paragraph
"pavilion, built of modular panels, along the lines of Otto",Paragraph
"Wagner’s Karlsplatz Station of 1899, and his ‘vernacular’",Paragraph
thatched-roofed kiosk designed for the display of Finnish,Caption
handicrafts.,Paragraph
Aalto’s early practice in Jyvaskyla between 1923 and,Paragraph
"1927 was remarkably varied, including workers’ apartments",Paragraph
"and a workers’ club (both built in 1924), a surprising number",Paragraph
"of churches and church renovations, and two civilian",Paragraph
"guardhouses, built at Seindjoki and Jyvaskyla in 1927. All",Caption
these works were carried out under Asplund’s influence in a,Paragraph
"vaguely Doricist style, which, while compounded in part of",Paragraph
"the local timber vernacular, was at the same time indebted",Paragraph
to Hoffmann’s austerity of line and to Schinkel’s Italianate,Paragraph
mode. In 1927 Aalto moved decisively towards Romantic,Paragraph
Classicism in his Viinika Church and his Viipuri Library,Title
competition entry [192]. The latter (realized in a modified,Paragraph
"form in 1935) was unequivocally influenced by Asplund, its",Paragraph
form including features taken directly from the Stockholm,Paragraph
"Public Library. Of these, the Neo-Classical plan with its axial",Paragraph
"scala regia, the atectonic facade and its frieze, and the giant",Paragraph
Egyptoid door were patently items which Asplund in his turn,Paragraph
had drawn from Bindesball. It was Aalto’s prize-winning,Paragraph
entry for the Paimio Sanatorium of 1928 that firmly,Paragraph
established the fundamental Functionalist style of his first,Paragraph
mature period (1927-34).,Paragraph
"192 Aalto, project for Viipuri Library, 1927.",Caption
"Aside from Asplund, the other catalytic figure in Aalto’s",Paragraph
early development was clearly the slightly older Finnish,Paragraph
"architect Erik Bryggman, with whom Alvar and his wife,",Paragraph
"Aino, briefly collaborated after their move to the booming",Paragraph
city of Turku in southern Finland at the end of 1927. Alvar,Caption
Aalto was soon to outdo the stripped Classicism of,Paragraph
Bryggman’s Atrium Apartments of 1925 in his own,Paragraph
Asplundian South-Western Agricultural Co-operative,Title
"Building, realized in Turku in 1928. The colour scheme of the",Paragraph
theatre in this building - a dark blue auditorium offset by,Paragraph
grey and pink plush upholstery - is obviously taken from,Paragraph
"Asplund’s Skandia Cinema, as is the frieze running below",Paragraph
the exterior cornice. The fruit of Aalto’s collaboration with,Caption
Bryggman was first an office building project for the town of,Paragraph
"Vaasa and then, in 1929, an exhibition celebrating the 700th",Paragraph
anniversary of Turku. As in Asplund’s 1928 sketch proposals,Paragraph
"for the Stockholm Exhibition, with their exposed, light-",Paragraph
"weight, cantilevered trusses, suspended sky signs and",Caption
"‘agitatory’ graphics, this commission led Bryggman and",Paragraph
Aalto to follow the Soviet Agit-Prop lead in architectural,Paragraph
rhetoric.,Paragraph
After the realization of his Constructivist-influenced,Paragraph
Turun-Sanomat newspaper building at Turku in 1928,Caption
"(reminiscent of the Vesnins’ Pravda project of 1923), Aalto",Paragraph
was able to take advantage of his growing reputation by,Paragraph
participating in international conferences on modem,Paragraph
architecture and construction. At a conference on reinforced,Paragraph
concrete in Paris in 1928 he became acquainted with the,Paragraph
"work of Duiker (see p. 145), whose reinforced-concrete",Paragraph
Zonnestraal Sanatorium was the point of departure for,Paragraph
"Aalto’s own competition design for the Paimio Sanatorium,",Paragraph
submitted in January 1929. From this date on Aalto was,Paragraph
decidedly under the influence of both Dutch and Russian,Paragraph
"Constructivism, particularly as it was manifest in the work of",Paragraph
Duiker and in the urban projects of N.A. Ladovsky’s Asnova,Paragraph
"and ARU groups. The serial, geometrical schemes proposed",Paragraph
at different times by the ARU (Association of Urban,Paragraph
"Architects), such as Ladovsky’s Kostino Quarter for Moscow",Paragraph
"of 1926, are obviously the source for the entry trajectory",Paragraph
and the serial landscape formations that appear in Paimio.,Paragraph
"As well as reflecting the urban approach of ARU, Paimio also",Paragraph
"marked a turning point in the matter of detail, for it",Paragraph
abounded in Constructivist quotation.,Paragraph
Although he kept his distance from international,Paragraph
"polemics, in this period Aalto drew surprisingly close to the",Paragraph
exclusively economic position adopted by the German Neue,Paragraph
Sachlichkeit architects at the 1929 Frankfurt CIAM Congress,Caption
"on ‘Existenzminimum’, such concerns being reflected in his",Paragraph
1930 apartment designs for the Finnish Arts and Crafts,Caption
"Society, and in his prototypical minimum house for the",Paragraph
Nordic Building Conference of 1932.,Paragraph
"At around the same time, Aalto met Harry and Mairea",Paragraph
"Gullichsen, an event which opened up his practice to",Paragraph
"industrial production. Mrs Gullichsen, heiress of the large",Paragraph
"Ahlstr6é6m timber, paper and cellulose concern, had seen",Paragraph
"Aalto’s earliest furniture in a Helsinki store, and invited him",Paragraph
to design a range of furniture for serial production. The,Paragraph
eventual consequences were the foundation in 1935 of the,Paragraph
Artek Furniture Company (to distribute Aalto’s furniture) and,Paragraph
the Sunila Pulp Mill and workers’ housing designed and,Paragraph
realized at Kotka between 1935 and 1939. Fortunately,Paragraph
Aalto’s pieces readily lent themselves to mass production.,Paragraph
He had already started to design plywood furniture as early,Paragraph
as 1926 when he produced a stacking chair for the Jyvaskyla,Paragraph
"guardhouse, and he followed this success with a laminated",Paragraph
"armchair for Paimio, a prototype which was finally put into",Paragraph
production in 1933. It is interesting to note that Aalto took,Paragraph
the technique of this design from the standard bent-plywood,Paragraph
seating that Otto Korhonen produced in the late 1920s.,Paragraph
Aalto’s patronage by the Finnish timber industry - the,Paragraph
large industrial concerns of Ahlstr6m and Enso-Gutzeit were,Paragraph
to be his patrons for the rest of his life - led him to re-,Paragraph
appraise the value of timber over concrete as a primary,Paragraph
expressive material. With this he seems to have gradually,Paragraph
returned to the highly textured architectural manner of the,Paragraph
"Finnish National Romantic movement, to the work of",Paragraph
"Saarinen, Gallén-Kallela and Sonck. The first indication of",Paragraph
this move away from international Constructivism came with,Paragraph
"his own house built in Munkkiniemi, Helsinki, in 1936. This",Paragraph
"somewhat irregular L-shaped building, executed as a collage",Paragraph
"in rendered masonry, grooved planking and exposed",Paragraph
"brickwork, was followed by his prizewinning entry design for",Paragraph
the Finnish Pavilion for the Paris World Exhibition of 1937,Title
"[193], a timber structure significantly entitled ‘Le Bois est",Caption
en marche’. It was a rhetorical display of wooden,Paragraph
"construction, its various bearing elements expressing the",Paragraph
specific characteristics of wood. The battened timber siding,Caption
of the main hall and the skeleton timber structure of the,Caption
perimeter exhibition space made up a virtuoso display of,Paragraph
different techniques for jointing in wood. Yet for all its,Paragraph
"constructional ingenuity, the Finnish Pavilion was chiefly",Paragraph
important for its formulation of the site-planning principle of,Paragraph
"Aalto’s later career, wherein a given building is invariably",Paragraph
separated into two distinct elements and the space between,Paragraph
is articulated as a space of human appearance (see the Villa,Paragraph
"Mairea, Saynatsalo Town Hall, etc.: pp. 228-29). He wrote of",Paragraph
the pavilion in his collected works:,Paragraph
"193 Aalto, Finnish Pavilion, World Exhibition, Paris, 1937. Details show boarded",Caption
"siding, a reinforced wooden column of the loggia and part of a column with",Paragraph
projecting reinforcement fins.,Paragraph
One of the most difficult architectural problems is the,Paragraph
shaping of the building’s surroundings to the human scale.,Paragraph
In modern architecture where the rationality of the,Paragraph
structural frame and the building masses threaten to,Paragraph
"dominate, there is often an architectural vacuum in the left-",Paragraph
"over portions of the site. It would be good if, instead of",Paragraph
"filling up this vacuum with decorative gardens, the organic",Paragraph
movement of people could be incorporated in the shaping of,Paragraph
the site in order to create an intimate relationship between,Paragraph
Man and Architecture. In the case of the Paris Pavilion this,Paragraph
problem fortunately could be solved.”,Paragraph
"In his later career, Aalto was to regard the shift from",Paragraph
reinforced-concrete expression to wood and natural,Paragraph
materials as being of the utmost importance for the,Paragraph
development of his architecture. He saw his laminated,Paragraph
"furniture as exemplifying an intuitive, indirect and more",Paragraph
"critical approach to design, which was capable of achieving",Paragraph
a more responsive and inflected environment than that,Paragraph
"usually achieved by linear logic. Thus in 1946, on the",Paragraph
"occasion of an exhibition of his furniture in ZUrich, he wrote:",Paragraph
In order to achieve practical goals and valid aesthetic forms,Paragraph
"in connection with architecture, one cannot always start",Paragraph
from a rational and technical standpoint - perhaps even,Paragraph
never. Human imagination must have free room in which to,Paragraph
unfold. This was usually the case with my experiments in,Paragraph
"wood. Pure playful forms, with no practical function",Paragraph
"whatsoever, have, in some cases, led to a practical form",Paragraph
after ten years have elapsed.| ...,Paragraph
The first attempt to construct organic form from volumes,Paragraph
"of wood without the use of cutting techniques led later, after",Paragraph
"nearly ten years, to triangular solutions, considering the",Paragraph
orientation of wood fibres. The vertical bearing portion of,Paragraph
furniture forms is truly the smaller sister of the architectural,Paragraph
column.3,Title
This organic approach to design already lies behind the,Paragraph
"detailing of the Viipuri Library and the Paimio Sanatorium,",Caption
"those masterworks of the late 1920s, which, although they",Paragraph
"were built of reinforced concrete, still afforded Aalto an",Paragraph
occasion for extending the precepts of Functionalism to,Paragraph
include the satisfaction of a full range of physical and,Paragraph
psychological needs (compare with Richard Neutra’s,Paragraph
‘biological’ approach). Aalto’s lifelong concern for the overall,Paragraph
ambience of a space and for the way it may be modified,Paragraph
"through the responsive filtration of heat, light and sound",Paragraph
was first fully formulated in these works. In Paimio the two-,Paragraph
person wards were carefully arranged to meet the patient’s,Paragraph
needs not only at the level of environmental control but also,Paragraph
"in terms of identity and privacy, direct light and heat being",Paragraph
"kept away from the patient’s head, while ceilings were",Paragraph
"coloured to reduce glare, and handwash basins were",Paragraph
"designed to function noiselessly. Similarly, the main reading",Paragraph
"rooms of the Viipuri Library [194, 195] were indirectly lit at",Paragraph
"all times - by day through the funnel-shaped roof lights, and",Paragraph
at night through retractable spotlights which bounced their,Paragraph
light off the walls opposite. Aalto gave equally careful,Paragraph
"consideration to the library’s acoustical properties, isolating",Paragraph
reading rooms from traffic noise and equipping the,Paragraph
rectangular lecture hall with an undulating ceiling reflector,Caption
for the whole of its length. In general the ‘free planning’,Paragraph
principles adopted in the library and sanatorium established,Paragraph
"Aalto’s organic approach to architecture, an approach which",Paragraph
"for all its inherent freedom rarely suffered, in formal terms,",Paragraph
from a loss of control. His concern for the natural,Paragraph
modification of the environment and for the intrinsic nature,Title
of the site gave his work a unique continuity from his,Paragraph
Functionalist period in the late 1920s to the more expressive,Paragraph
phase of his work that started in the early 1950s. Of his,Paragraph
anti-mechanistic attitude he wrote in 1960:,Paragraph
"194 Aalto, Viipuri Library, 1927-35. Lending department, and reading room at",Caption
higher level.,Paragraph
"195 Aalto, Viipuri Library, 1927-35. First-floor plan.",Caption
To make architecture more human means better,Title
"architecture, and it means a functionalism much larger than",Paragraph
the merely technical one. This goal can be accomplished,Paragraph
only by architectural methods - by the creation and,Paragraph
combination of different technical things in such a way that,Paragraph
they will provide for the human being the most harmonious,Paragraph
life.4,Title
"In 1938, Aalto achieved the masterwork of his pre-war",Paragraph
"career, the Villa Mairea [196, 197, 198], a summer home",Paragraph
built for Mairea Gullichsen at Noormarkku. The initial sketch,Caption
for this L-shaped building makes explicit reference to,Paragraph
National Romanticism: the plan of the main living hall refers,Title
directly to the plan of Gallén-Kallela’s Ruovesi studio of,Paragraph
"1893. Both works also feature a prominent, rendered,",Paragraph
sculptural fireplace and a stepped living level which,Caption
eventually leads to a mezzanine stair. Like his Munkkiniemi,Paragraph
"House, the Villa Mairea is compounded out of a mixture of",Paragraph
"brickwork, rendered masonry and timber siding.",Caption
"196 Aalto, Villa Mairea, Noormarkku, 1938-39.",Caption
"197, 198 Aalto, Villa Mairea, Noormarkku, 1938-39. View towards the living hall,",Caption
and exterior.,Paragraph
More than any other pre-war work of Aino and Alvar,Paragraph
"Aalto, the villa represents a conceptual link between the",Paragraph
rational-constructivist tradition of the 20th century and the,Paragraph
evocative heritage of the National Romantic movement. Its,Paragraph
"primary spaces, the dining and living rooms, border a",Paragraph
"sheltered garden court, set within a roughly circular forest",Paragraph
clearing. The ‘geologically striated’ mass of the house and,Paragraph
the irregularly contoured perimeter of the sauna plunge pool,Caption
suggest a metaphorical opposition between artificial and,Paragraph
"natural form, and this principle of duality obtains throughout",Paragraph
the work. Thus the ‘head’ of Mrs Gullichsen’s prowlike studio,Paragraph
"opposes the ‘tail’ of the sauna, and the wooden siding of the",Paragraph
public rooms stands in strong contrast to the white,Paragraph
rendering of the private areas. Similarly complex formal,Paragraph
operations abound throughout the house: an example is the,Paragraph
"‘metonymy’ of the entrance canopy, the irregular rhythm of",Paragraph
its timber screen echoing the irregular spacing of the pine,Paragraph
trees in the forest - a device that is repeated in the railing of,Paragraph
"the interior stair. This is followed, in terms of sequence, by",Paragraph
"the repetition of the same plan form in the studio, the",Paragraph
"entrance canopy and the plunge pool, all recalling the",Paragraph
sinuous perimeter of a typical Finnish lake. The finishes of,Paragraph
the ground floor are also coded as an internal landscape in,Paragraph
which changes from tiles to boarding or to rough paving,Paragraph
"stones denote subtle transformations in mood and status, as",Paragraph
"one moves from, say, the family hearth to the sitting room",Paragraph
"and conservatory. Finally, structure itself is used",Paragraph
"symbolically to refer to origins: as in the Villa Hvittrask, the",Paragraph
sauna represents the native culture - linked by an outriding,Paragraph
"rubble wall to the main house, it is a traditional timber-sided",Paragraph
"structure roofed with sod, and built according to the canons",Paragraph
"of Finnish timber vernacular, in opposition to the",Paragraph
sophisticated tectonic of the house itself.,Paragraph
After the rhetorical exuberance of his pavilion for the,Paragraph
New York World’s Fair in 1939 and the somewhat unresolved,Paragraph
"design of the Baker Dormitory, built for MIT at Cambridge,",Caption
"Massachusetts, in 1947, there was an expressive",Paragraph
"uncertainty in Aalto’s work, until 1949, when the second",Paragraph
phase of his career took decisive shape with his Saynatsalo,Paragraph
Town Hall [199]. Where the Villa Mairea had depended for,Paragraph
"its articulation on wooden revetment, at Saynatsalo the",Paragraph
syncopation of the form depended on the rhythmic spacing,Paragraph
of the fenestration and on the subtle modelling of brickwork.,Paragraph
"For all their differences, however, the works had the same",Paragraph
"conceptual basis in their division into two parts, grouped",Paragraph
"around an atrium. These elements, which took the form of",Paragraph
"an L-shaped house and a plunge pool in the Villa Mairea, are",Paragraph
at Saynatsalo a U-shaped administration building and a free-,Paragraph
"standing library block, the two forms enclosing a court",Paragraph
"raised above the street level. This parti, which Aalto used",Paragraph
"again in his National Pensions Institute at Helsinki, seems to",Paragraph
have been derived from the traditional Karelian farm and,Paragraph
village complexes that he had first written about in 1941.,Paragraph
Another source for the duality of these compositions may be,Paragraph
Aalto’s idiosyncratic view of the process of architectural,Paragraph
"creation, of which he wrote in ‘The Trout and the Mountain",Paragraph
Stream’ (1947):,Title

| would like to add that architecture and its details are,Paragraph
connected in a way with biology. They are perhaps like large,Paragraph
"salmon or trout. They are not born mature, they are not",Paragraph
even born in the sea or body of water where they will,Paragraph
normally live. They are born many hundreds of miles from,Paragraph
their proper living environment. Where the rivers are but,Paragraph
"streams, small shining bodies of water between mountains",Paragraph
... aS far from their normal environment as man’s spiritual,Paragraph
life and instincts are from his daily work. And as the fish,Paragraph
"egg’s development to a mature organism requires time, so it",Paragraph
also requires time for all that develops and crystallizes in,Paragraph
our world of thoughts. Architecture needs this time to an,Paragraph
even greater degree than any other creative work.°,Paragraph
All these buildings seem to symbolize this duality of,Paragraph
"architectural creation, wherein the enclosing L or U form of",Paragraph
"the main mass, the ‘fish’ element, is contrasted with the",Paragraph
independent form of the adjacent ‘egg’. In the Villa Mairea,Paragraph
and Saynatsalo Town Hall the head of the fish form appears,Paragraph
to accommodate the most honorific public element - the,Paragraph
"studio in the house, and the council chamber in the town",Paragraph
hall.,Paragraph
Such hierarchical differentiation is complemented by,Paragraph
changes in material and structure. At Saynatsalo the brick,Caption
paving of the ‘secular’ access corridor and stair gives way to,Paragraph
the suspended wooden floor of the ‘sacred’ council chamber,Caption
above. This change in status is confirmed by the elaborate,Paragraph
"detailing of the roof trusses over the council room, an",Caption
obvious reference to medieval practice. Similar shifts in,Paragraph
symbolic content occur in the ‘egg’ element: in the Villa,Paragraph
Mairea the ‘egg’ is the swimming pool - the agent of,Paragraph
physical regeneration - while in Saynatsalo Town Hall it is,Paragraph
"the library, the repository of intellectual nourishment.",Paragraph
"Furthermore the detailing of the atrium itself, particularly at",Paragraph
"Saynatsalo and in the Pensions Institute, reflects a",Paragraph
comparable mythic intent. In both instances the path,Paragraph
"through the ‘acropolis’ is treated like a ‘rite of passage’,",Paragraph
between overcivilized urbanity on one side of the complex,Paragraph
"and native rusticity on the other. In each instance, the space",Paragraph
"is enriched by the presence of water, hinting again at the",Paragraph
process of birth and regeneration.,Paragraph
"The Pensions Institute in Helsinki [200], designed for a",Paragraph
"competition of 1948 and built in 1952-56, established Aalto",Paragraph
as one of the master architects of the post-war period. As,Paragraph
much as any work from the last twenty-five years of his,Paragraph
"career, this large bureaucratic complex demonstrated an",Paragraph
"architecture that would, in his own words, add ‘a more",Paragraph
"sensitive structure to living’. This intent, evident in the",Paragraph
"warmth and convenience of the smallest details, from the",Paragraph
foyer seats to the visitors’ coatracks and from the light,Caption
"fittings to the built-in heating, was manifest above all in the",Paragraph
delicately scaled interviewing booths ranged in rows under,Paragraph
"the skylit hall. This hall, paved in black and white marble,",Paragraph
established the honorific ‘key’ for the rest of the building.,Paragraph
Thereafter each space is colour-coded in order to suggest a,Paragraph
change in status - the main entry in white and dark blue,Title
"wall tiles, the staff refectory in brown, white and beige, and",Paragraph
so on.,Paragraph
"200 Aalto, National Pensions Institute, Helsinki, 1952-56. Centre of south front.",Caption
Aalto’s resolve to serve the common man reappeared in,Paragraph
his adaptation of the ‘atrium’ concept to the design of a,Paragraph
"multistorey apartment block, built for the Berlin",Caption
‘Hansaviertel Interbau’ exhibition in 1955. This ingenious,Paragraph
design [201] comprised one of the most significant,Paragraph
apartment types to have been invented since the end of the,Paragraph
Second World War. Le Corbusier’s famous Unité maisonette,Paragraph
(so extensively copied in low-cost housing throughout the,Paragraph
world) compares with it rather unfavourably as a family,Paragraph
dwelling. The primary virtue of Aalto’s apartment type is,Paragraph
that it provides the attributes of the single-family home,Paragraph
within the confines of a small flat. Within its U-organization,Paragraph
a generous atrium terrace is flanked by the living and dining,Paragraph
"rooms, while the whole is surrounded on two sides by",Paragraph
"private spaces, such as bedrooms and bathrooms. The",Paragraph
disposition of these apartment units within the block is,Paragraph
"equally good, their ‘clustering’ about naturally lit stair halls",Paragraph
enabling Aalto to avoid that sense of an infinite number of,Paragraph
‘monotype’ apartments stacked in a single high-rise,Paragraph
structure.,Paragraph
"201 Aalto, Hansaviertel apartment block, Berlin, 1955.",Caption
Aalto’s lifelong attempt to satisfy social and,Paragraph
psychological criteria effectively set him apart from the,Paragraph
"more dogmatic Functionalists of the 1920s, whose careers",Paragraph
were already established when he designed his first,Paragraph
significant works. Despite his initial response to the dynamic,Paragraph
"forms of Soviet Constructivism, Aalto always focused his",Paragraph
attention on the creation of environments which would be,Paragraph
conducive to human well-being. Even his most Functionalist,Paragraph
"works, such as his 7urun-Sanomat Building of 1928, reflect",Paragraph
"his perennial sensitivity to light, constantly enriching a",Paragraph
structure that would otherwise be extremely dogmatic and,Paragraph
austere.,Paragraph
Such a consistently organic approach brought Aalto,Paragraph
"conceptually close to the ethos of Bruno Taut’s Glass Chain,",Paragraph
above all to the work of Hans Scharoun and to Hugo Haring.,Paragraph
So he may be seen as belonging to that ‘group’ of Northern,Paragraph
European Expressionist architects who were concerned that,Paragraph
building should be life-giving rather than repressive. This,Paragraph
meant that the latent tyranny of the normative orthogonal,Paragraph
grid should always be fractured and inflected where the,Paragraph
idiosyncrasies of the site or the programme demanded it. In,Paragraph
1960 Leonardo Benevolo effectively summed up Aalto’s,Paragraph
achievement from this standpoint in the following terms:,Paragraph
In the first modern buildings the constancy of the right,Paragraph
angle served mainly to generalize the compositional process,Paragraph
of instituting a priori geometrical relationships between all,Paragraph
"the elements, which meant that all conflicts could be",Paragraph
"resolved geometrically with the balancing of lines, surfaces,",Paragraph
and volumes. The use of the oblique (as at Paimio) pointed,Paragraph
"the way towards the contrary process, that of making the",Paragraph
"forms more individual and precise, allowing imbalance and",Paragraph
tension to exist and to be balanced by the physical,Paragraph
consistency of the elements and surroundings. Such,Paragraph
"architecture lost in didactic rigours but gained in warmth,",Paragraph
"richness, and feeling, and ultimately extended its field of",Paragraph
action because the process of individuation was based on,Paragraph
the already recognized generalizing method and indeed,Paragraph
presupposed it.®,Paragraph
At its best this was a discreet yet highly responsive mode,Paragraph
"of building, one which continued the essential Nordic",Paragraph
tradition of fusing the vernacular with the Classical - the,Paragraph
idiosyncratic with the normative - through fifty years of,Paragraph
"unbroken development, from Ostberg’s Bonnier Villa of 1909",Paragraph

"after graduating from the Milan Polytechnic, in the Rassegna",Paragraph
"Italiana, comprised the architects Sebastiano Larco, Guido",Paragraph
"Frette, Carlo Enrico Rava, Adalberto Libera, Luigi Figini, Gino",Caption
Pollini and Giuseppe Terragni. All sought to achieve a new,Paragraph
and more rational synthesis between the nationalistic values,Title
of Italian Classicism and the structural logic of the machine,Title
age. In their ‘Note’ of 1926 they committed themselves to,Paragraph
exploring a middle ground between the arcane language of,Paragraph
the Novecento - of which Muzio’s Ca’ Brutta apartment,Paragraph
block built in Milan in 1923 was an influential example - and,Paragraph
the dynamic vocabulary of industrial form bequeathed to,Paragraph
them by the Futurists. The group also showed a certain,Paragraph
sympathy for the Deutsche Werkbund and for the works of,Paragraph
the Russian Constructivists. Yet for all their enthusiasm for,Paragraph
"the machine age, the gruppo 7 gave more weight to a",Paragraph
"reinterpretation of tradition than to modernity per se. Thus,",Paragraph
"in 1926, they wrote critically of the Futurists:",Paragraph
The hallmark of the earlier avant garde was a contrived,Paragraph
"impetus and a vain, destructive fury, mingling good and bad",Paragraph
elements: the hallmark of today’s youth is a desire for,Paragraph
lucidity and wisdom. ... This must be clear... we do not,Paragraph
"intend to break with tradition. ... The new architecture, the",Paragraph
true architecture should be the result of a close association,Paragraph
between logic and rationality.,Paragraph
"Despite this declaration of faith in tradition, the early",Paragraph
"works of the Rationalists, particularly those projected by",Paragraph
"Giuseppe Terragni, displayed a preference for compositions",Paragraph
based on industrial themes. Terragni’s projects for a,Paragraph
gasworks and a steel tube factory exhibited at the IIlrd,Caption
Monza Biennale of 1927 seem to have more to do with the,Paragraph
"Engineer’s Aesthetic than with Architecture, to use the",Paragraph
"polarities of Le Corbusier’s Vers une architecture, a book",Paragraph
which exercised considerable influence on the Rationailisti,Paragraph
after its publication in 1923. An early and naive response to,Paragraph
"this influence was indubitably Pietro Lingeri’s boathouse,",Paragraph
"built at Como in 1926, which, with its allusion to marine",Paragraph
"engineering, paid somewhat simplistic homage to the work",Paragraph
of Le Corbusier.,Paragraph
"More susceptible to the influence of Muzio, Terragni",Paragraph
established himself in 1928 with the completion of his,Paragraph
Novocomun apartments in Como. This symmetrical five-,Paragraph
"storey composition, popularly known as the Transatlantico,",Paragraph
manifested that characteristic Rationalist concern for the,Paragraph
rhetorical displacement of mass. Where the corners of the,Paragraph
building should have been reinforced in accordance with,Paragraph
"Classical canon, they were dramatically cut away so as to",Paragraph
"expose glass cylinders, which were capped by the massive",Paragraph
weight of the oversailing top floor and bound into the,Paragraph
composition by the overruns of the third-floor balcony and,Caption
the mass of the second floor. This solution obviously owed,Paragraph
"more to Russian Constructivism than to Purism, Golossov’s",Paragraph
"initial project for his Zuyev Workers’ Club, completed in",Paragraph
"Moscow in 1928, being the most obvious precedent.",Paragraph
The Italian Rationalist movement briefly constituted itself,Paragraph
as an official body in the Movimento Italiano per,Paragraph
"l’Architettura Razionale (MIAR), founded in 1930 just one",Paragraph
year before the third exhibition of the gruppo 7 staged in,Paragraph
Bardi’s Galleria d’Arte in Rome. Its influence was short-lived,Paragraph
since it was soon to be undermined by the forces of cultural,Paragraph
reaction. Where earlier manifestations of Rationalist work,Paragraph
had left the more conservative professionals relatively,Paragraph
"undisturbed, this show was accompanied by a provocative",Paragraph
"pamphlet entitled ‘Report to Mussolini on Architecture’,",Paragraph
written by the art critic Pietro Maria Bardi. He claimed that,Paragraph
Rationalist architecture was the only true expression of,Paragraph
Fascist revolutionary principles. A MIAR declaration of the,Paragraph
period put forward an equally opportunistic assertion: ‘Our,Paragraph
movement has no other moral aim than that of serving the,Paragraph
[Fascist] Revolution in the prevailing harsh climate. We call,Paragraph
upon Mussolini’s good faith to enable us to achieve this.’,Paragraph
"Mussolini opened the exhibition, but his faith was little",Paragraph
proof against the hostile reaction of the National Union of,Paragraph
"Architects, subject to the influence of the classicist Marcello",Paragraph
"Piacentini. Three weeks after the opening of the exhibition,",Paragraph
the National Union of Architects repudiated the very work,Paragraph
"that it had previously sponsored, publicly declaring that",Paragraph
Rationalist architecture was incompatible with the rhetorical,Paragraph
demands of Fascism. It was left for Piacentini to mediate,Paragraph
between the metaphysical traditionalism of the Novecento,Title
and the avant gardism of the Rationalists and to propose his,Paragraph
highly eclectic Stile Littorio (Lictorial Style) as the ‘official’,Paragraph
"party manner. First formulated in the Revolutionary Tower,",Paragraph
"completed in Brescia to his designs in 1932, this manner",Paragraph
was finally consolidated in Piacentini’s Palace of Justice,Paragraph
started in Milan in 1932.,Paragraph
Piacentini’s position was reinforced by the founding of,Paragraph
"the Fascist Raggruppamento Architetti Moderni, which",Paragraph
avoided any categorical condemnation of either the,Paragraph
Novecentisti or the Rationalists and gave its support to the,Paragraph
vestigial Classicism of the Stile Littorio. The guidelines that,Paragraph
Piacentini imposed on the nine architects who collaborated,Paragraph
with him in 1932 on the new University in Rome [202],Caption
"established, through the repetition of simple elements, the",Paragraph
rudiments of the official Fascist manner. This remarkably,Paragraph
consistent style was expressed almost always in four-storey,Paragraph
"brick or stone masses, capped by rudimentary cornices and",Paragraph
articulated solely through a modulation of rectangular,Paragraph
openings. Since a certain irregularity and asymmetry was,Paragraph
"permitted in the detailed planning, representative",Paragraph
"expression was largely restricted to the entrances where,",Paragraph
"with colonnades, bas reliefs and lettered friezes, it took a",Paragraph
Classical form. Although none of gruppo 7 worked on the,Paragraph
"University, three buildings by the Piacentini team betrayed a",Paragraph
certain Rationalist affinity: Gio Ponti’s School of,Paragraph
"Mathematics, Giovanni Michelucci’s Mineralogy Building",Title
"and, above all, Giuseppe Pagano’s elegantly brick-faced",Paragraph
Institute of Physics.,Paragraph
"202 Piacentini and team, University of Rome, 1932. Senate building on",Caption
inauguration day.,Paragraph
By 1932 Pagano had already made his contribution to the,Paragraph
polemic surrounding the evolution of an appropriate,Title
"national style, for in 1930 he had started to edit the",Paragraph
magazine Casabella in collaboration with the Turinese art,Paragraph
critic and designer Edoardo Persico. These men,Paragraph
endeavoured through their editorials to persuade the,Paragraph
undecided members of the Novecento to abandon the Stile,Paragraph
Littorio of Piacentini in favour of the Rationalism of Terragni.,Paragraph
"In 1934 Persico wrote of the Rationalist predicament: ‘Today,",Paragraph
artists must tackle the thorniest problem of Italian life: the,Paragraph
capacity to believe in specific ideologies and the will to,Paragraph
pursue the struggle against the claims of an “anti-,Paragraph
modernist” majority.’,Paragraph
In 1932 Terragni produced the canonical work of the,Paragraph
"Italian Rationalist movement, the Casa del Fascio (now the",Paragraph
Casa del Popolo) in Como. Planned within a perfect square,Paragraph
"and half as high as its width of 33 metres (110 feet), the half",Paragraph
cube of the Casa del Fascio established the basis of strictly,Paragraph
"rational geometry [203]. Within this volume, it not only",Paragraph
revealed the logic of its trabeated frame but also the,Paragraph
‘rational’ code underlying the modelling of its layered,Paragraph
facade. On every side (except the south-east elevation,Caption
which stresses the main stair) the fenestration and the,Paragraph
external layers of the building are manipulated in such a,Paragraph
way as to express the presence of the internal atrium.,Paragraph
Earlier studies for the building reveal that like other works,Paragraph
by Terragni (such as his Sant’Elia School of 1936) it was,Paragraph
"originally planned around an open courtyard, on the model",Paragraph
of the traditional palazzo. In subsequent stages of the,Paragraph
design this cortile became a central double-height meeting,Paragraph
"hall, top-lit through a glazed concrete roof and surrounded",Caption
"on four sides by galleries, offices and meeting rooms. As in",Paragraph
"Mies van der Rohe’s Barcelona Pavilion of 1929, the",Paragraph
monumental status of the entire structure is established by,Paragraph
"its slight elevation on a masonry base, described by Terragni",Paragraph
as a piano rialzato. The original political purpose of the,Paragraph
structure is expressed in almost literal terms through the,Paragraph
battery of glass doors which separates the entrance foyer,Caption
"from the piazza. These, when simultaneously opened by an",Paragraph
"electrical device, would have united the inner agora of the",Paragraph
"cortile to the piazza, thereby permitting the uninterrupted",Paragraph
"flow of mass demonstrations from street to interior (fig. 24,",Caption
p. 47). Comparable political connotations are evident in the,Paragraph
treatment of the main meeting room with its photomontage,Caption
relief by Mario Radice [204] and in the shrine,Caption
commemorating the fallen of the Fascist movement. There,Paragraph
"is, needless to say, an aspect of this work which transcends",Paragraph
these ideological considerations to concern itself with the,Paragraph
creation of metaphysical spatial effects - the building is,Paragraph
"treated as though it were a continuous spatial matrix,",Paragraph
"without any particular orientation such as up or down, left or",Paragraph
"right, etc. Thus the mirror effects of glass are used in the",Paragraph
lining of the foyer ceiling to create the illusion of an infinite,Paragraph
trabeated construction existing in volumes which are in fact,Paragraph
quite differently occupied. At the same time the subtle,Paragraph
"implantation of the work in an historic urban core, its facing",Paragraph
throughout in Bolticino marble and its use of glass block to,Paragraph
"designate its honorific space, combine to create a work",Paragraph
"which is at once tectonic, meticulous and monumental.",Paragraph
"203 Terragni, Casa del Fascio, Como, 1932-36. Proportional system of facade,",Caption
and ground plan.,Paragraph
"204 Terragni, Casa del Fascio, Como, 1932-36. Main meeting room. The panel",Caption
"on the end wall, by Radice, includes a portrait of Mussolini.",Caption
This ideal symbolization of Fascism was by no means,Paragraph
unique. Other rhetorical overtures to the movement were,Paragraph
made by the Rationalists before their final disillusionment in,Paragraph
"the mid-1940s. Amongst these, mention must be made of",Paragraph
"the building for the ‘Mostra della Rivoluzione Fascista’,",Paragraph
"staged in Rome in 1932, on the occasion of the tenth",Paragraph
anniversary of the March on Rome. This temporary,Paragraph
"structure, strongly reminiscent of the work of Leonidov and",Paragraph
"built to the designs of Libera and De Renzi, contained along",Paragraph
with other set pieces the commemorative 1922 Room,Caption
"designed by Terragni as a dynamic wall relief, combining",Paragraph
"plastic, graphic and photographic elements in a manner",Paragraph
which recalled Lissitzky’s Soviet International Hygiene,Paragraph
"Exhibit, staged in Dresden in 1930.",Paragraph
By the mid-1930s actual Rationalist architecture varied,Paragraph
widely from the highly intellectual work of Terragni to the,Paragraph
"bland International Style of the short-lived Comasco group,",Paragraph
whose artist’s house was exhibited at the Vth Milan,Paragraph
Triennale of 1933. The participation of Terragni as a member,Paragraph
of this eight-man design team seems to have had little,Paragraph
"effect on the quality of the outcome, and a comparable loss",Paragraph
of intensity can be detected when one compares the very,Paragraph
"first work of Figini and Pollini, namely their Casa Elettrica",Paragraph
"built for the Milan Triennale of 1930, to their artist’s house",Paragraph
built for the next Triennale in 1933. And indeed the facts,Paragraph
"indicate that by the time of the Vth Triennale, Italian",Paragraph
"Rationalism was already becoming compromised, either by",Paragraph
a banal modernism on the one hand or by a reactionary,Paragraph
historicism on the other.,Paragraph
In 1934 Persico and Marcello Nizzoli designed their,Paragraph
famous Medaglia d’Oro room for the Italian Aeronautical,Caption
Show in Milan [205]. An elegant labyrinth of white wooden,Caption
"lattices, raised well above the floor, supported a field of",Paragraph
graphic and photographic images that appeared to float in,Paragraph
space and to advance and recede throughout the depth of,Paragraph
the hall. This suspended construction established a new,Paragraph
standard for exhibition design that was to exercise a strong,Paragraph
"influence until well after the Second World War. By this date,",Paragraph
with the exception of such occasional masterpieces as this,Paragraph
"extraordinary work by Persico and Nizzoli, Italian",Caption
Rationalism had entered its decline. This much is evident,Paragraph
"from the subsequent work of Persico himself, who moved in",Paragraph
the space of two years from designs of great vivacity and,Paragraph
"sophistication to the cold, atectonic monumentality of his",Paragraph
"Salone d’Onore for the 1936 Triennale, designed in",Caption
"collaboration with Nizzoli, Palanti and Fontana. Only",Caption
"Terragni, working with Pietro Lingeri and Cesare Cattaneo,",Paragraph
was able to maintain the intellectual intensity of the,Paragraph

"integration of conceptual, structural and symbolic form.",Paragraph
"205 Persico and Nizzoli, Medaglia d’Oro room, the first Italian Aeronautical",Caption
"Show, Milan, 1934.",Caption
"After Persico’s untimely death in 1936, the political and",Paragraph
"cultural difficulties of the Rationalists increased. Pagano,",Paragraph
"always close to official circles, compromised himself further",Paragraph
through collaborating with Piacentini on the plan for the,Paragraph
"‘Esposizione Universale Roma ’42’, to be held outside Rome",Paragraph
"in 1942. Like the new Fascist towns of Littoria, Sabaudia,",Paragraph
Carbonia and Pontinia (this last being built in the Pontine,Paragraph
"marshes), the permanent structures of the EUR ’42, the",Paragraph
"museums, memorials and palaces, were designated by",Paragraph
Mussolini to form the core of the Third Rome. Not even,Paragraph
Pagano’s intelligence could prevent this extravagant,Paragraph
ideological gesture from degenerating into the most banal,Paragraph
"assembly of Neo-Classical forms. Its major set-piece, the",Paragraph
"Palazzo della Civilta Italiana by Guerrini, La Padula and",Caption
"Romano, was nothing if not the ultimate vulgarization of the",Paragraph
"Valori Plastici movement. One imagines that its empty,",Paragraph
"cubic, arcuated forms could have hardly delighted any",Paragraph
sensibility more than that of De Chirico himself. Of the same,Paragraph
spirit as Mussolini’s 1931 plan for the Haussmannization of,Paragraph
Rome (a proposal for the wholesale removal of the medieval,Paragraph
urban tissue from the antique ruins) Piacentini’s EUR ‘42,Caption
"plan was caught, like the various architectural factions",Paragraph
"including the Rationalists, between a post-Futurist drive to",Paragraph
create a modern civilization and the need to legitimize this,Paragraph
same civilization through an appeal to the glories of the,Paragraph
Roman imperium. Thus the EUR complex turned its principal,Paragraph
axis towards the Tyrrhenian coast and inscribed one of its,Paragraph
monuments with the prophecy: ‘The Third Rome will spread,Title
over the other hills along the sacred river [Tiber] to the,Paragraph
beaches of the sea.’ As for the involvement of the,Paragraph
"Rationalists in this Faustian enterprise, Leonardo Benevolo",Paragraph
has written:,Paragraph
The compromise attempted by Pagano was thus untenable:,Paragraph
"by following ‘ideal links back to Roman times, architects",Paragraph
"would arrive at one result only, neo-classical conformism;",Paragraph
the differences of tone between Brasini’s applied,Paragraph
"archaeology and Foschini’s measured simplification,",Paragraph
between the sophisticated elegance of the young Romans,Paragraph
"and the calculated rhythms of the young Milanese, which",Paragraph
"seemed important in the plans, disappeared entirely in the",Paragraph
"execution. What had happened in Germany, Russia, and",Paragraph
France was repeated here too: this was the internationale,Paragraph
des pompiers.4,Caption
The reactionary architectural and political climate,Title
prevailing in Italy in the mid-1930s was partly offset by the,Paragraph
"Saint-Simonian aspirations of one man, Adriano Olivetti, who",Paragraph
had succeeded his father as director of the famous business,Paragraph
machines concern in 1932. In 1934 Adriano began to reveal,Paragraph
his concern for the contribution to be made by modern,Paragraph
design to industrial welfare by successively commissioning,Title
Figini and Pollini to design a whole sequence of buildings for,Paragraph
the Olivetti enterprise in Ivrea: first a new administrative,Title
centre in 1935 and then workers’ housing and community,Title
facilities between 1939 and 1942. In 1937 he extended his,Paragraph
"partronage to regional planning, calling upon Figini and",Paragraph
"Pollini and BBPR (Banfi, Belgiojoso, Peressutti and Rogers) to",Paragraph
prepare a plan for the Aosta valley.,Paragraph
"In the meantime, a set of closely related designs",Paragraph
"continued to pour forth from Terragni’s studio, including his",Paragraph
competition entries for the Casa Littoria of 1937 and the,Paragraph
"EUR Congress Building of 1938, both projects designed in",Paragraph
collaboration with Cattaneo and Lingeri. Around the same,Paragraph
time Terragni produced the most metaphysical work of his,Paragraph
"entire career, his Danteum [206], projected in 1938 as a",Paragraph
monumental embellishment to the Via Del Impero cut by,Caption
"Mussolini through the ancient city. This project, comprising",Paragraph
progressively less dense blocks of rectangular space,Paragraph
arranged as a labyrinth and symbolizing the stages of,Paragraph
"Inferno, Purgatory and Paradise, was in many respects an",Paragraph
abstraction of the part/ used for the EUR building.,Paragraph
"206 Terragni, Danteum project, Rome, 1938.",Caption
Terragni’s obsession with a ‘transparent’ architecture - a,Paragraph
sublimation of the Futurist programme of projecting the,Paragraph
street into the house - was first advanced in his Casa del,Paragraph
Fascio. Thereafter it reappeared as a constant drive,Paragraph
"throughout all his public work, from the Sarfatti Monument,",Paragraph
"built at Col d’Echele in 1934, to the final design for the EUR",Paragraph
Congress Building. Aside from the ultimate state of ‘lucidity’,Paragraph
"attained in the Paradise volume of the Danteum, with its",Paragraph
"thirty-three glass columns and its glass ceiling, Terragni",Caption
achieved a sense of conceptual transparency through two,Paragraph
basic devices which were ingeniously fused together in his,Paragraph
"seven-storey apartment block, the Casa Rustici, Milan",Caption
(1936-37). These devices were (1) the use of a duality,Paragraph
"which, following the form of his 1931 War Memorial in",Paragraph
"Como, generally comprised two parallel rectilinear masses",Paragraph
"with a slot of space in between, and (2) frontalized parallel",Paragraph
"rectilinear voids or masses, receding like successive picture",Paragraph
"planes from a given vantage point, as in the flying balconies",Paragraph
"and bridges, etc., of the Casa Rustici or the glazed office",Caption
"slabs of the Casa Littoria, whose receding spatial layers",Paragraph
established the domain of the ancillary ground-level,Paragraph
"accommodation, the auditoria, etc.",Paragraph
This frontalized formula of alternately built and non-built,Paragraph
parallel volumes came to be asymmetrically rotated in the,Paragraph
EUR proposal and in a condensed form in Terragni’s last,Paragraph
"building, his four-storey Giuliani Frigerio Apartments",Caption
completed in Como in 1940. As in the Casa del Fascio the,Paragraph
intention seems to have been to inflect the orientation of,Paragraph
the prism by arranging for a primary and secondary facade,Caption
to be placed at right angles to one another. A similar,Paragraph
rotatory ‘cubist’ composition had already appeared in,Paragraph
Terragni’s early villas and the same ‘format’ was adopted by,Paragraph
Cattaneo in his apartment house built in Cernobbio in 1938.,Paragraph
"The final work of the series, in which Terragni did not",Paragraph
"participate, is the Fascist Trades Union Building at Como",Paragraph
"[207], under construction on a site next to the Casa del",Caption
Fascio from 1938 to 1943 and built to the designs of,Paragraph
"Terragni’s prime pupil Cattaneo, in collaboration with",Paragraph
"Lingeri, Augusto Magnagni, L. Origoni and Mario Terragni.",Caption
"This orthogonal, trabeated structure, organized about a",Paragraph
Palladian ABABABABA grid in one direction and a regular but,Paragraph
"partially syncopated modular grid in the other, is in many",Paragraph
respects the most sublime resolution of compositional and,Paragraph
"typological themes initiated by the Como Rationalists, so",Paragraph
much so that one may even claim that this building is one of,Paragraph
the major inspirations behind the so-called ‘autonomous,Paragraph
architecture’ of the Italian Tendenza produced over the past,Paragraph
decade (compare Giorgio Grassi’s design for a Students’,Paragraph
"Hostel at Chieti of 1974 with Monestiroli, Conti and",Paragraph
Guazzoni). The Trades Union Building consists of two five-,Paragraph
storey slabs separated by a courtyard in which a two-storey,Paragraph
"ancillary block is suspended, comprising an entry podium, a",Paragraph
secretariat and a 500-seat auditorium.,Paragraph
"207 Cattaneo, Lingeri, Magnagni, Origoni and M. Terragni, Trades Union Building,",Caption
"Como, 1938-43. Cut-away axonometric view.",Caption
The completion of this building in 1943 coincided with,Paragraph
the premature and still somewhat mysterious deaths of both,Paragraph
Terragni and Cattaneo. Although their deaths brought the,Paragraph
"movement to an abrupt close, their works still testify to their",Paragraph
efforts to realize an ideal setting for a society which would,Paragraph
be at one and the same time both rationally organized and,Paragraph
culturally classless. The fact that this ideal attained its,Paragraph
fulfilment in the transparent logic of their architecture rather,Paragraph
than in the society at large was touched on by Sylvia Danesi,Paragraph
when she wrote of the two men in 1977:,Paragraph
In both there is a complete trust in the guiding role of the,Paragraph
middle class and of its organizing capacity in its,Paragraph
administrative function as a pivot of the social contract.,Paragraph
They did not sense the crisis that was about to involve their,Paragraph
generation. They felt that the class to which they too,Paragraph
belonged would be perfectly capable of carrying out the,Paragraph
task delegated to them by the rest of the country. They did,Paragraph
not realize that the local industrial middle class was,Paragraph
gradually losing ground to the new State bourgeoisie that,Paragraph
was being formed on the strength of the 1929 crisis,Paragraph
"(nationalization of banks, foundation of the IRI, etc.) and",Paragraph
which still governs us to this day; a class who got on fine,Paragraph
with big capital interests and felt at their ease with the,Paragraph

It is to Henry-Russell Hitchcock’s credit as a historian that,Paragraph
long ago he felt it necessary to acknowledge the persistence,Paragraph
"of this vestigial tradition. However, his term ‘The New",Paragraph
"Tradition’, coined in 1929 in an effort to distinguish a certain",Paragraph
"conservative trend from the works of the pioneers, has",Paragraph
hardly stood the test of time. The attributes and the,Paragraph
chronology that he attached to this tradition were too vague,Paragraph
"to gain general acceptance. Nevertheless, the need to treat",Paragraph
the problems posed by representation or the lack of it has,Paragraph
"increased rather than diminished over the years, and the",Paragraph
cultural predicament of Social Realism in its broadest sense,Paragraph
can now no longer be excluded from our critical scrutiny. In,Paragraph
"a general sense, the term may be taken as evidence of the",Paragraph
"failure of abstract form to communicate. In the face of this,",Paragraph
as Hitchcock wrote in 1958: ‘The historian must attempt to,Paragraph
give some sort of account of things like the Stockholm City,Paragraph
Hall or the Woolworth Building.’,Paragraph
"The origin of the New Tradition, outside the main line of",Paragraph
"the Modern Movement, can be seen to lie in the emergence",Paragraph
between 1900 and 1914 of a consciously ‘modernized’,Paragraph
"historicist style. In the first place, the generic style of the",Paragraph
"establishment, the late 19th-century public mode which",Paragraph
"oscillated constantly between Neo-Gothic and Neo-Baroque,",Paragraph
"began to lose its definition. In England and Germany, in",Paragraph
"particular, it degenerated into an eclectic elaboration which",Paragraph
in the event demonstrated little capacity for achieving a,Paragraph
convincing architectural expression. At the same time the,Paragraph
"main line of European Classicism, the Beaux-Arts, reached",Paragraph
its pompier dead end in the Paris Exhibition of 1900. The,Paragraph
"scintillating yet over-blown rhetoric of the Grand Palais, for",Paragraph
"example, was patently ill-equipped to represent the",Paragraph
progressive ideology of an advanced industrialized society.,Paragraph
What could after all be more symbolic of repression than the,Paragraph
ferrovitreous interior of the Grand Palais incarcerated in an,Paragraph
elaborate scenography of stone? The subsequent attempt to,Paragraph
revivify this perennial preference for lithic form with sinuous,Paragraph
floral motives drawn from Art Nouveau led to equally,Paragraph
lugubrious examples of petrified Classicism with heavy,Paragraph
"Symbolist overtones, such as Boileau’s Hétel Lutetia, Paris",Paragraph
"(1911), much despised by Le Corbusier.",Paragraph
"On the other hand, the essentially anti-establishment",Paragraph
Anglo-Saxon Free Style or its even more liberated successor,Paragraph
"on the Continent, generally known as Art Nouveau, had by",Paragraph
"this time degenerated into a very rigid, crystallized form of",Paragraph
"expression. In addition, as Henry van de Velde realized in",Paragraph
"1908, the very idea of a Gesamtskunstwerk had the",Paragraph
unfortunate consequence of privatizing the sociocultural,Paragraph
significance of the work in question. Neither the protracted,Paragraph
Pre-Raphaelite myth of a return to an agrarian craft,Paragraph
economy nor the urbane exoticism of Art Nouveau could be,Paragraph
exploited to represent either parliamentary democracy or,Paragraph
the ideological aspirations of a liberal and progressive,Title
"society. Even Peter Behrens, who, about 1910, stood on the",Paragraph
threshold of a new normative style expressly conceived for,Paragraph
"the representation of the cartel, if not of the modern",Paragraph
"industrial state (Max Weber's Machtstaat), was to lose his",Paragraph
creative nerve by the time of the Werkbund Exhibition of,Paragraph

Ragnar Ostberg’s unique adaptation of the principles of,Paragraph

singular success to the fact that it represented a traditional,Paragraph
Burgher port rather than an industrial state. In this respect it,Paragraph
"hinted at the architectural policies of the Third Reich, which",Paragraph
reserved certain styles for particular ideological ends.,Paragraph
The eve of the First World War saw the creation of a,Paragraph
"number of works representative of the New Tradition,",Paragraph
‘historicist’ buildings which were far from being historically,Paragraph
determined in their overall conception. Thus the Gothic,Paragraph
detailing of Cass Gilbert’s Woolworth Building in New York,Caption
(1913) was incidental compared to the way in which its,Paragraph
uncompromising organization and exotic profile were to,Paragraph
anticipate the post-war skyscraper developments of Frank,Paragraph
Lloyd Wright and Raymond Hood.,Paragraph
In Europe the inauguration of the New Tradition was more,Paragraph
"self-conscious, marked by works which independently broke",Paragraph
"with the received public style of the Neo-Baroque to return,",Paragraph
"in spirit if not in form, to the gravity and clarity of ancient",Paragraph
Rome - typical examples include Paul Bonatz’s Stuttgart,Paragraph
"Railway Station, built in 1913-27, and Edwin Lutyens’s New",Paragraph

form until 1931.,Paragraph
"George V's proclamation, founding the capital of New",Paragraph
"Delhi at a durbar or mass pageant held there in his honour,",Paragraph
"was nothing if not an elaborate ideological gesture,",Paragraph
designed to mask the sheer expediency that lay behind the,Paragraph
British removal of their Indian capital from Calcutta to Delhi,Title
in 1911. Evidently the British hoped that by reviving the,Paragraph
pageantry of the Moghul Court - in the name of the Raj and,Paragraph
in the heart of the Empire - they might still pursue their,Paragraph
contradictory policy of welcoming home rule while,Paragraph
maintaining their colonial economy. The fact that much of,Paragraph
the imperial kudos was lost because the King entered the,Paragraph
city on a horse rather than an elephant is not without a,Paragraph
certain significance. The diplomatic effort at a liberal,Paragraph
compromise had altered the traditional code beyond,Paragraph
recognition and the King passed through the gates of Delhi,Paragraph
largely unobserved. That the building of New Delhi was a,Paragraph
reification of this fragile ideological gesture is evident from,Paragraph
the protracted efforts made between 1913 and 1918 to,Paragraph
arrive at a convincing Anglo-Indian style which would satisfy,Paragraph
"all concerned. Above all, it had to convince Lutyens himself,",Paragraph
who finally decided that the Moghul city of Fatehpur Sikri,Paragraph
presented the only native architecture that could be,Paragraph
effectively incorporated into the humanist tradition.,Paragraph
"Humanism, that is to say Classicism, had been hastily",Paragraph
revalidated in English architectural culture after the turn of,Paragraph

The struggle between the Modern Movement and the New,Title

impact of this competition on Soviet architecture was,Paragraph
"decisive, for it not only drew entries from all over the world,",Paragraph
"including projects by Le Corbusier, Perret, Gropius, Poelzig",Paragraph
"and Lubetkin, but it also stimulated an equal amount of",Paragraph
"activity inside the Soviet Union, involving a large number of",Paragraph
individual designers as well as entries from the major,Paragraph
"architectural factions, including Asnova, OSA and Vopra.",Paragraph
That Le Corbusier’s project (see p. 175) was the most,Paragraph
Constructivist of his entire career is evident from the,Paragraph
exposed roof structure of its auditoria and from the total,Paragraph
"transparency of its external skin. Yet, despite the reductive",Paragraph
"nature of these elements, the symbolism of the project was",Paragraph
quite explicit in the speaker’s tribune situated at the end of,Paragraph
"the library block, overlooking the res publica podium, to the",Paragraph
rear of the larger auditorium. Few entries were so literal in,Paragraph
according symbolic value to the functionality of their various,Paragraph
"components, and one recognizes here a work as didactic in",Paragraph
"its organization and form as Gropius’s theatre for Piscator,",Paragraph
"designed some four years earlier. However, the jury found",Paragraph
that Le Corbusier’s entry ‘indulged in a too pronounced cult,Paragraph
of machinism and aestheticization’.,Paragraph
This could also have been said of many of the Russian,Paragraph
"projects, which were often little more than elaborate",Paragraph
exercises in technological rhetoric projected as metaphors,Title
for the newly industrialized socialist state. It is one of the,Paragraph
ironies of this competition that the monumental Socialist,Paragraph
"Realist line, which was to be officially adopted by the",Paragraph
"Central Committee of the Party in April 1932, was not",Paragraph
"represented by the entry of the most left-wing faction, the",Paragraph
Proletkult group or All Russian Association of Proletarian,Title
Architects. Instead the Socialist Realist style was first,Paragraph
"tentatively advanced in the winning entry of B.M. lofan,",Paragraph
whose Constructivist auditoria were shown as semicircular,Paragraph
"terminal buildings delimiting the confines of a rectangular,",Paragraph
Classical court. From the centre of this enclosure rose an,Paragraph
equally Classical pylon surmounted by the statue of a,Paragraph
worker. This figure seems to have been a conscious,Paragraph
"reference to the Statue of Liberty, its raised arm projecting",Paragraph
"the light of revolt, if not of freedom. In the subsequent",Paragraph
"development of the design after 1933, by lofan in",Paragraph
collaboration with the Academicians Gelfreikh and V.,Paragraph
"Shchuko, it became increasingly rhetorical. By 1934, the two",Paragraph
auditoria of the original version had been absorbed into a,Paragraph
"‘wedding cake’ of colonnaded tiers and pinnacled statuary,",Paragraph
culminating in a gargantuan figure of Lenin offering his hand,Paragraph
"to the universe, at a height of 450 metres (1,500 feet)",Paragraph
"[210]. Three years later, although the general form",Paragraph
"remained the same, the total mass was smaller and the",Paragraph
colonnades had been regrouped as Art Deco pilasters.,Paragraph
"210 lofan, project for the Palace of the Soviets, Moscow, 1934.",Caption
After 1932 those Academicians such as A.V. Shchusev,Paragraph
(whose eclectic National Romantic Kazan Station in Moscow,Paragraph
"was under construction by 1913), who had established",Paragraph
"themselves before the Revolution and had laid low since,",Paragraph
began to build one pseudo-Neo-Classical monument after,Paragraph
another. Shchuko’s Lenin State Library of 1938 typifies this,Paragraph
"bastard style of asymmetrical volumes, stripped pilasters",Paragraph
and inconsequential Classical episodes enriched by,Paragraph
sculpure. The emergence of the New Tradition in the Soviet,Paragraph
Union was due to several contributory factors. First there,Paragraph
was the doctrinal and unanswerable challenge made by,Paragraph
Vopra against the Constructivist intellectuals to the effect,Title
that only the proletariat could create a proletarian culture;,Paragraph
then there were the rehabilitated pre-war Academicians,Paragraph
"who, while technically indispensable to the building",Paragraph
"programme, were to remain unsympathetic to",Paragraph
Constructivism; finally there was the Party itself which,Paragraph
sensed that the people were incapable of responding to the,Paragraph
abstract aesthetics of modern architecture. The absolute,Paragraph
ideological expediency of the Party Social Realist line,Title
instigated in 1932 accounts for Anatole Lunacharsky’s,Paragraph
"sophistries of the following year, his over-elaborate apologia",Paragraph
"for Social Realism in which, while acknowledging the",Paragraph
"remoteness of Hellenic culture, he insisted that ‘this cradle",Paragraph
of civilization and art’ could still serve as a model for,Paragraph
architecture in the Soviet Union. The success of this state,Paragraph
"culture, which was maintained as a consistent policy for",Paragraph
"more than forty years, has perhaps never been more justly",Paragraph
"assessed than by Berthold Lubetkin, who wrote in 1956:",Paragraph
"Festooned as they are with haberdashery, draped in",Paragraph
"theatrical marginalia, and wrapped in irrelevant pages from",Paragraph
"a monumental mason’s catalogue, some of the Soviet",Paragraph
"buildings (if by no means all) are yet able to form, by virtue",Paragraph
"of vigorously conceived layouts, of prodigious use of open",Paragraph

A similar conflict between modernity and tradition coloured,Paragraph

the leadership of Marcello Piacentini to support the cause of,Paragraph
reconciling the rival factions into a single ideological,Title
"formation, the Raggruppamento Architetti Moderni Italiani.",Paragraph
The development of Fascist ideology after the war had,Paragraph
stemmed from two distinct aspects of the pre-war Futurist,Paragraph
movement: from its revolutionary concern for the,Title
"restructuring of society, and from its cult of war and its",Paragraph
worship of the machine. Both aspects provided elements,Paragraph
"that could be effectively incorporated into Fascist rhetoric,",Paragraph
but the war and its aftermath had been a disaster -,Paragraph
destructive even of Futurism itself - and the idea of a,Paragraph

under his direction in 1932. Muzio’s defence of the Classical,Paragraph

universality of the New Tradition that transcended the,Paragraph
Piranesian conceits of his own style. He wrote of the,Paragraph
Novecento movement as being of an anti-Futurist,Paragraph
conviction. He argued that the Classical schemas of the past,Paragraph
"would always be applicable, and asked: ‘Are we not perhaps",Paragraph
anticipating a movement whose imminent birth is,Paragraph

The conflict between modernity and tradition took a,Paragraph

Ludwig Troost and Albert Speer (successively Hitler’s,Title

The conscious elimination of Schinkel’s proportional,Title
delicacy in the name of the millennium evolved only slightly,Paragraph
as it passed from Troost’s frigid version of the Tuscan order,Paragraph

"became the setting for the inculcation of Nazi ideology, not",Paragraph
only on the spot but throughout the Reich: for the first time,Paragraph
the ‘state as a work of art’ could be channelled into the,Paragraph
mass media of radio and film. Leni Riefenstahl’s,Paragraph

"des Willens (The Triumph of the Wil), was the first occasion",Paragraph
"on which architecture, in the form of Speer’s temporary",Paragraph

propaganda. Henceforth Speer’s designs for stadia at,Paragraph
Nuremberg were determined as much by camera angles as,Paragraph
by architectural criteria. This cinematic exploitation of,Paragraph
architecture was totally at variance with Speer’s insistence,Paragraph
on the use of load-bearing masonry to insure the future of,Paragraph
the Zeppelinfeld as a sublime ruin. This idiosyncratic ‘law of,Paragraph

"could be seen in Paris, where it was displayed in such works",Paragraph
as J.C. Dondel’s Musée d’Art Moderne and Auguste Perret’s,Paragraph

The synthesis of the Art Deco or the Modernistic Style in,Paragraph
the States had just as many roots in the mainstream of the,Paragraph

democracy and capitalism in the New World. From the,Paragraph
American point of view the First World War had been,Paragraph

Something of the intent behind the Modernistic Style may,Paragraph

architects like J.J.P. Oud had been touched by its influence,Paragraph

1938). After the war the general ideological climate of the,Paragraph
West was hostile to any kind of monumentality. The League,Paragraph
"of Nations had been discredited, the British had granted",Paragraph
India her independence and the regimes that had made the,Paragraph
New Tradition into an instrument of national policy were,Paragraph
"regarded as anathema. Moreover, the manipulatory",Paragraph
"advantages of less permanent but cheaper, more flexible",Paragraph
and more penetrating modes of ideological representation,Title
were soon seen as far surpassing the effectiveness of,Paragraph
architecture. As anticipated by the intense and brilliant use,Paragraph
of radio and film in the propaganda of the Third Reich and in,Paragraph
the popular mass productions of RCA and Hollywood during,Paragraph
"the Depression, governments after the Second World War",Paragraph
came to give increasing attention to the content and impact,Paragraph
of media rather than to built form. And where the former,Paragraph
"became increasingly rhetorical and intense, the latter",Paragraph
became more and more abstract and devoid of,Paragraph
iconographical content. The highly abstract quality of the,Paragraph

their actions. They are intended to outlive the period which,Paragraph
"originated them, and constitute a heritage for future",Paragraph

the future.,Paragraph
(2) Monuments are the expression of man’s highest cultural,Paragraph
needs. They have to satisfy the eternal demand of the,Paragraph
people for translation of their collective force into symbols.,Paragraph
The most vital monuments are those which express the,Paragraph
feeling and thinking of this collective force - the people.,Paragraph
(4) The last hundred years have witnessed the devaluation,Paragraph
of monumentality. This does not mean that there is any lack,Paragraph
of formal monuments or architectural examples pretending,Paragraph
to serve this purpose; but the so-called monuments of,Paragraph
"recent date have, with rare exceptions, become empty",Paragraph
shells. They in no way represent the spirit and the collective,Paragraph
feeling of modern times.,Paragraph
(6) A new step lies ahead. Postwar changes in the whole,Paragraph
economic structure of nations may bring with them the,Paragraph
organization of community life in the city which has been,Paragraph
practically neglected up to date.,Paragraph

This position paper - destined to become the brief for,Paragraph
CIAM VIII of 1952 - formulated a sharply discriminative,Paragraph
"approach to the problem of representation, which seems to",Paragraph
be as valid today as when it was first written. In the first,Paragraph
"instance, there is its recognition of the fact that neither the",Paragraph
monumentality of the New Tradition nor the functionalism of,Paragraph
the Modern Movement was capable of representing the,Paragraph
"collective aspirations of the people. In the second, there is",Paragraph
"the implication, never explicitly stated, that a genuine",Paragraph
collectivity can only realize an appropriate expression of its,Paragraph
values and historical continuity at a ‘cantonal’ or municipal,Title
"level, and that large centralized or authoritarian states are",Paragraph
"incapable, by definition, of authentically representing the",Paragraph
hopes and desires of the people. In the years since 1943 the,Paragraph
issue of representation - the fundamental problem of,Title
"meaning in architecture - has recurred again and again,",Paragraph
"only to be met by repression and denial, or by escapist",Paragraph
withdrawal into the supposedly spontaneous and hence,Paragraph

into ‘silence’ - see Manfredo Tafuri’s Progetto e Utopia,Caption

because one of the primary subjects of which it should,Paragraph

Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret had already thought of,Paragraph

"such a monumental scale. Now, with this holiday house",Paragraph
designed for Héléne de Mandrot and built outside Toulon in,Caption
"1931, and their Errazuriz House projected for a remote site",Paragraph
"in Chile (1930), they began to envisage their works as",Paragraph
reaching out across landscapes of titanic proportions. This,Paragraph
subtle shift towards a topographic sensibility contrasted,Paragraph
with their apparently spontaneous acceptance of,Paragraph
‘vernacular’ construction as a mode of expression. Although,Paragraph
they had used load-bearing crosswalls before they had,Paragraph
never exploited the expressive qualities of rough-hewn,Paragraph
stonework.,Paragraph
This break with the dogmatic aesthetic of Purism (already,Paragraph
anticipated in Le Corbusier’s painting of 1926) coincides,Paragraph
with the conceptual point in his career when he began to,Paragraph
abandon his faith in the inevitably beneficient workings of a,Paragraph
"machine-age civilization. From now on, disillusioned by",Paragraph
industrial reality and increasingly under the ‘Brutalist’,Title
"influence of the painter Fernand Léger, his style began to",Paragraph
move in two opposite directions at once. On the one hand,Paragraph
"he returned, at least in his domestic work, to the language",Paragraph
"of the vernacular; on the other, as in his project for Paul",Paragraph
"Otlet’s Cité Mondiale of 1929, he embraced a",Paragraph
"monumentality of Classical, not to say Beaux-Arts, grandeur.",Paragraph
"However, to think of this schism as a simple",Paragraph
differentiation in the expressive mode between ‘building’,Paragraph
and ‘architecture’ is to give an oversimplified account of the,Paragraph
"practice at this time. For, despite the ‘inner doubt’, not only",Paragraph
had the machine aesthetic not been totally abandoned (as,Paragraph
we may judge from ‘curtain-walled’ structures built by the,Paragraph
"practice between 1930 and 1933), but also works such as",Paragraph
the de Beistegui Penthouse unexpectedly revealed a,Paragraph
Surrealist side to Le Corbusier’s imagination. This dreamlike,Paragraph
exercise - reminiscent of Adolf Loos’s interiors for the Tristan,Paragraph
Tzara house of 1926 - manifested its ‘aesthetic’ disjunctions,Paragraph
on more than one level. While it emphasized the,Paragraph
strangeness of objects at a domestic scale (the lawn of the,Paragraph
solarium appeared like a living carpet!) it also evoked,Paragraph
unlikely urban (topographic) associations such as the,Paragraph
isomorphic similarity between the solarium’s false fireplace,Paragraph
"and the Arc de Triomphe, poised on the artificial horizon of",Paragraph
the bounding wall. This Surrealist sensibility (compare,Paragraph
Magritte and Piranesi) is latent throughout the whole of Le,Paragraph
"Corbusier’s return to the vernacular, from the de Mandrot",Paragraph
House of 1931 to the Ronchamp pilgrimage chapel built in,Caption
the mid-1950s.,Paragraph
In many of the ‘vernacular’ essays prior to Ronchamp the,Paragraph
remoteness of the site itself became the rationale for the,Paragraph
mode of building. The extreme example of this is the very,Paragraph
"cheap house at Mathes, near Bordeaux (1935), which was",Paragraph
built from drawings without the architect visiting the site. Le,Paragraph
Corbusier wrote:,Paragraph
The impossibility of supervising the construction and the,Paragraph
necessity of employing a small contractor from the village,Paragraph
led even to the conception of the plan itself. The house had,Paragraph
three successive and absolutely separate stages of work:,Paragraph
"(a) the masonry built at one time,",Paragraph
"(b) the carpentry built at one time,",Paragraph
"(c) the joinery, comprising windows, doors, shutters and",Paragraph
"cupboards, all to a standard and to a unitary principle of",Paragraph
construction; assembled independently and variously,Paragraph
"panelled in glass, plywood and asbestos cement.”",Paragraph
The same justification of limited resources could be put,Paragraph
"forward in the case of the Errazuriz and de Mandrot houses,",Paragraph
but it could hardly apply to the weekend house built in the,Paragraph
Parisian suburbs in 1935 [221]. Here the vernacular was,Paragraph
"being consciously embraced for its material articulation, for",Paragraph
its capacity to enrich the abstract and reductive nature of,Paragraph
the Purist style. Le Corbusier wrote:,Paragraph
"221 Le Corbusier and Jeanneret, weekend house, Paris, 1935.",Caption
The designing of such a house demanded extreme care,Paragraph
since the elements of construction were the only,Paragraph
architectonic means. The architectural theme was,Paragraph
established about a typical bay whose influence extended,Paragraph
as far as the little pavilion in the garden. Here one was,Paragraph
"confronted by exposed stonework, natural on the outside,",Paragraph
white on the interior; wood on the walls and ceilings; and a,Caption
"chimney out of rough brickwork, with white ceramic tiles on",Caption
"the floor, Nevada glass block walls and a table of Cippolino",Caption
marble.?,Paragraph
"In short, one experienced, as at Toulon and Mathes, an",Paragraph
expressive bricolage. From now on the juxtaposition of,Paragraph
contrasting materials became an essential aspect of Le,Paragraph
"Corbusier’s style, not only as an expressive ‘palette’ but",Paragraph
also as a means of building.,Paragraph
This shift to natural materials and primitive methods had,Paragraph
consequences that went beyond a mere change in,Paragraph
technique or surface style. Above all it meant abandoning,Paragraph
the Classical envelope that had been used in the villas of,Paragraph
the late 1920s in favour of an architecture predicated on the,Paragraph
"expressive force of a single architectonic element, be this a",Paragraph
monopitched roof supported by cross-walls or a barrel-,Paragraph
vaulted megaron. While the former mode (anticipated at,Paragraph
Mathes) appeared in the rammed-earth walls and lean-to,Paragraph

"As James Stirling was to make clear, the Maisons Jaoul",Paragraph
design was an affront to those sensibilities which had been,Paragraph

"manifest itself as smooth, machine-wrought, planar surfaces",Paragraph
set within an articulated structural frame. It was disturbing,Paragraph
to find that this complex was ‘being built by Algerian,Paragraph
"labourers equipped with ladders, hammers and nails’, and",Paragraph
that with the exception of glass no synthetic materials were,Paragraph

"the narrow openings in the cross-walls, and the transverse",Paragraph

The Maisons Jaoul design was a monumental,Paragraph

stemmed as much from its introspective solemnity as from,Paragraph
its scale. This Surrealistic syntax could hardly be used for,Paragraph
"the eighteen-storey Unité d’Habitation, built at Marseilles in",Paragraph
1947-52 [224]. And yet in abandoning the lightweight,Paragraph
machine technology of the pre-war era the Unité showed,Paragraph
itself equally committed to ‘brutalist’ methods of,Paragraph
construction. This is especially evident in the casting of its,Paragraph
"basic concrete superstructure from rough timber formwork,",Paragraph
a deliberate revelation of built process which Le Corbusier,Paragraph
was to justify on grounds which were almost existential.,Paragraph
"224 Le Corbusier, Unité d’Habitation, Marseilles, 1947-52.",Caption
"Aside from this béton brut appearance, the Unité was far",Paragraph
more complex in its organization than the typical pre-war,Paragraph
Ville Radieuse block. Where the Ville Radieuse slab was a,Paragraph
"continuous horizontal volume, hermetically contained",Paragraph
"behind glass, the Unité revealed its cellular structure",Paragraph
through the use of concrete sun-baffle balconies and,Paragraph
canopies projecting from the main body of the building.,Caption
These brises-solei/ with their side walls stressed the volume,Paragraph
of the two-storey units extending through the width of the,Paragraph
block - megaron forms constructed as independent,Paragraph
elements and suspended within the concrete frame in much,Paragraph
the same manner as bottles are set into a rack. Interior,Paragraph
‘streets’ on every other floor provided the horizontal access,Paragraph
to these interlocking crossover units.,Paragraph
This cellular morphology automatically expressed an,Paragraph
"agglomeration of private dwellings (compare Roq et Rob),",Paragraph
while the shopping arcade and the rooftop communal,Paragraph
facilities served to establish and represent the public realm.,Paragraph
The honorific status of this larger whole was expressed at,Paragraph
ground level in the carefully profiled columns supporting the,Paragraph
"underbelly of the building. These pi/otis, precisely",Paragraph
"proportioned in accordance with Le Corbusier’s Modulor,",Paragraph
suggested the invention of a new ‘Classical’ order. Uniting,Paragraph
"its 337 dwellings with a shopping arcade, a hotel and a",Paragraph
"roofdeck, a running track, a paddling pool [225], a",Paragraph
"kindergarten and a gymnasium, the Unité was just as much",Paragraph
of a ‘social condenser’ as the Soviet commune blocks of the,Paragraph
1920s. This total integration of community services recalled,Paragraph
"the 19th-century model of Fourier’s phalanstery, not only",Paragraph
through its size but also in its isolation from the immediate,Paragraph
environment. And just as the phalanstery was intended to,Paragraph
house the ordinary man in a princely domain (Fourier,Paragraph
"detesting the meanness of the individual house), so the",Paragraph
Unité was seen by its author as restoring the dignity of,Paragraph
architecture to the simplest private dwelling.,Paragraph

- that preoccupied Le Corbusier throughout the 1950s. The,Paragraph
"monastery, effectively combining both types, served to",Paragraph
remind him of that paradigm of ‘solitude and communion’,Paragraph
which had so deeply moved him when he first visited the,Paragraph
Charterhouse of Ema in 1907. La Tourette simply,Caption
reinterpreted this ideal model as a bipartite scheme,Paragraph
comprising ‘public’ church and ‘private’ cloister. Elevated off,Paragraph
"the ground rather than terraced into its site, this opposition",Paragraph
between the vertical volume of the chapel and the,Paragraph
horizontal layer of the ambulatory was dramatically exposed,Paragraph
by the fall of the land. Colin Rowe has written:,Paragraph
"226 Le Corbusier, monastery of La Tourette, near Lyons, 1957-60. Section and",Caption

At La Tourette the site is everything and nothing. It is,Paragraph
equipped with an abrupt slope and a lavishly accidental,Paragraph
cross-fall. It is by no means a local condition which would,Paragraph
really justify the quintessential Dominican establishment,Paragraph
which seems to have been preconceived. Rather it is the,Paragraph
"reverse; architecture and landscape, lucid and separate",Title
"experiences, are like rival protagonists of a debate who",Paragraph
progressively contradict and clarify each other’s meaning.‘,Paragraph
Nothing could have been further from this than the,Paragraph
"rapport established between building and site at Ronchamp,",Paragraph
where the crustacean forms which make up the whole - the,Paragraph
"shell roof with its giant gargoyle, the side chapels and the",Paragraph
altar - were all precisely tuned to respond to the ‘visual,Paragraph
acoustics’ of an undulating landscape. Ronchamp brought,Paragraph
"Le Corbusier back to the 1930s, not only to the de Mandrot",Paragraph
House for its integration into the site but also to the basic,Paragraph
form of the Pavilion des Temps Nouveaux built for the Paris,Paragraph
"Exhibition of 1937 [227, 228]. Unlikely as it may seem, this",Paragraph
wire-cable suspension structure was the fundamental,Paragraph
"prototype for Ronchamp, inasmuch as it was inspired by the",Paragraph

previously reproduced in Vers une architecture. As a further,Paragraph
"transposition of the same metaphor, the dominant concrete",Paragraph
shell roof of Ronchamp echoed the profile of the canvas-,Paragraph
and-cable catenary roof to the 1937 pavilion. The recurrence,Caption
of this profile in the Chandigarh Capitol and elsewhere in his,Paragraph
later work makes it seem that Le Corbusier was trying to,Paragraph
establish this form as the 20th-century equivalent of the,Paragraph

this Christian site was once the location of a sun temple.,Paragraph

"Garches, the rough masonry infill is rendered over with",Paragraph
"‘gunite’, but the desired finish is no longer the machine",Paragraph
"precision of Purism but the stippled, whitewashed texture of",Paragraph
Mediterranean folk building.,Paragraph
Le Corbusier’s concern for the sculptural resonance of a,Paragraph
"building in relation to its site was first formulated in 1923,",Paragraph
when he characterized the Acropolis and its Propylea as that,Paragraph
"point ‘when nothing more might be taken away, when",Paragraph
nothing would be left but these closely knit and violent,Paragraph
"elements, sounding clear and tragic like brazen trumpets’.",Paragraph
"This passionate image of the Acropolis, conveying a feeling",Paragraph
"for unity just prior to breaking up, reappears as a constant",Paragraph
theme throughout his life and with heightened pathos,Paragraph
towards the end of his career. This was as much the,Paragraph
principle underlying Ronchamp’s ‘visual acoustics’ as it was,Paragraph
"the reason for the diminutive volcanic, mountainous forms",Paragraph
that erupt on the roofdeck of the Unité.,Paragraph
A more Cartesian approach informed the design of,Paragraph
"Chandigarh [229], the new administrative capital of the",Paragraph
"Punjab, founded in 1951. Since the terrain here was flat, the",Paragraph
siting of the monuments was determined by the imposition,Paragraph
of a proportional grid. Le Corbusier had already used such,Paragraph
‘regulating lines’ on an urban scale in his Cité Mondiale of,Paragraph
1929 and in his centre for St-Dié of 1945. His description of,Paragraph
the Capitol makes it clear he was convinced that such,Paragraph
"delicate refinements were perceptible, irrespective of the",Paragraph
distances involved. ‘The composition of the Park of the,Paragraph
"Capitol, vast as it is, is today regulated to the centimetre in",Paragraph
nearly all of its dimensions both overall and in detail. Such,Paragraph
"are the means, the powers, and the objectives of",Paragraph
“proportioning”.’ That similar modular devices had been,Paragraph
used by Sir Edwin Lutyens when designing New Delhi was,Paragraph
"not lost on Le Corbusier, who wrote appreciatively of that",Paragraph
new capital that it was ‘built by Lutyens over thirty years,Paragraph
"ago with extreme care, great talent, and with true success.",Paragraph
"The critics may rant as they will, but the accomplishment of",Paragraph
such an undertaking earns respect.’,Paragraph

"showing the Secretariat, Assembly, Governor’s Palace and High Court.",Caption
"230 Le Corbusier, Ronchamp Chapel, near Belfort, 1950-55.",Caption
"Unlike New Delhi or the Cité Mondiale, Chandigarh",Paragraph
achieved monumentality without referring directly to the,Paragraph
traditional vocabulary of Western Classicism. The striking,Paragraph
"profiles of its three monuments were derived, in the first",Paragraph
"instance, from a direct response to the severity of the",Paragraph
"climate. Unlike Lutyens, who had exploited only the",Paragraph
"secondary elements of Moghul architecture, Le Corbusier",Caption
appropriated the traditional ‘parasol’ concept of Fatehpur,Paragraph
Sikri as a Monumental coding device to be varied from one,Paragraph
structure to the next. By using this shell form either as a,Paragraph
"prelude (the Assembly entrance canopy), or as a constant",Paragraph
"(the vaulted roof of the High Court), or as a dominant (the",Paragraph
"crowning parasol of the Governor’s Palace), he was able to",Paragraph
suggest the character and status of each institution. The,Paragraph
subtle profiles of these shell forms were derived in part from,Paragraph
the livestock and landscape of the region [231]. The evident,Paragraph
intent was to represent a modern Indian identity that would,Paragraph
be free from any association with its colonial past.,Paragraph

Mies van der Rohe and the,Title
Monumentalization of,Title
Technique 1933-67,Title
In architecture there is only one man whom even the young,Paragraph
men can defend and that is Mies van der Rohe. Mies has,Paragraph
always kept out of politics and has always taken his stand,Paragraph
against functionalism. No one can accuse Mies’s houses of,Paragraph
looking like factories. Two factors especially make Mies’s,Paragraph
"acceptance as the new architect possible. First, Mies is",Paragraph
respected by the conservatives. Even the Kampfbund fir,Paragraph
Deutsche Kultur has nothing against him. Secondly. Mies has,Paragraph
just won... a competition for the new building of the,Paragraph
Reichsbank. The jury were older architects and,Paragraph
representatives of the bank.,Paragraph
If (and it may be a long if) Mies should build this building,Paragraph
it would clinch his position. A good modern Reichsbank,Paragraph
"would satisfy the new craving for monumentality, but above",Paragraph
it all it would prove to the German intellectuals and to,Paragraph
foreign countries that the new Germany is not bent on,Paragraph
destroying all the splendid modern arts which have been,Paragraph
built up in recent years.,Paragraph
Philip Johnson,Title
"‘Architecture in the Third Reich’, Horn and Hound, 19331",Caption
Mies van der Rohe’s entry for the Reichsbank competition of,Paragraph
1933 [233] was the beginning of a transformation in his,Paragraph
"work, from informal asymmetry to symmetrical",Paragraph
monumentality. This move towards the monumental,Paragraph
eventually culminated in the development of a highly,Paragraph
rationalized building method that was widely adopted in the,Paragraph
1950s by the American building industry and its corporate,Title
clientele. The Reichsbank design hinted at this future,Paragraph
"development in more ways than one, for it established a",Paragraph
preference not only for symmetry but also for a certain,Paragraph
tectonic which tended to move away from the dynamic,Paragraph
Spatial effects of his earlier career. At the same time the,Paragraph
"client was the institutional establishment, a patron that Mies",Paragraph
was to serve throughout his practice in the United States.,Paragraph
"233 Mies van der Rohe, project for the Reichsbank, Berlin, 1933.",Caption
The Reichsbank design was not simply a return to,Paragraph
"Schinkel, who, except in Mies’s work of the early 1920s, had",Paragraph
always been a latent influence. It was more a return to the,Paragraph
"tectonics of Mies’s concrete office building, first published in",Paragraph
"the magazine Gin 1923, the emphasis in both projects",Paragraph
being on the expressive qualities of an objective building,Paragraph
"technique, logically conceived and rigorously executed. In",Paragraph
1926 Mies had spoken of architecture as being ‘the will of,Paragraph
"the epoch translated into space’. In Hegelian terms, he saw",Paragraph
"this will as historically determined technique, as a self-",Paragraph
"evident fact, only to be refined by the spirit. The intrinsic",Paragraph
monumentality of his later work was predicated on such a,Paragraph
"refinement. For Mies, technology was the cultural",Paragraph
"manifestation of modern man, and in this respect the",Paragraph
Reichsbank must be regarded as his first essay in the,Paragraph
monumentalization of technique. This accounts for its,Paragraph
"warehouse-like appearance, for the neutral, scarcely",Paragraph
modulated treatment of its curtain wall.,Paragraph
"Between 1933 and the early 1950s, Mies’s work was to",Paragraph
"oscillate between asymmetry and symmetry, between",Paragraph
technique as found and the monumentalization of technique,Title
as form. This variation in expression occurred not only from,Paragraph
one building to the next but also within a single structure.,Paragraph
He summed up the over-riding cultural import that he,Paragraph
attached to technique in his address to the Illinois Institute,Paragraph
of Technology in 1950:,Title
Technology is rooted in the past. It dominates the present,Paragraph
and tends into the future. It is a real historical movement -,Paragraph
one of the great movements which shape and represent,Paragraph
their epoch.,Paragraph
It can be compared only with the classic discovery of,Paragraph
"man as a person, the Roman will to power, and the religious",Paragraph
movement of the Middle Ages.,Paragraph
"Technology is far more than a method, it is a world in",Paragraph
itself As a method it is superior in almost every respect. But,Paragraph
"only where it is left to itself, as in gigantic structures of",Paragraph
"engineering, there technology reveals its true nature. ...",Paragraph
"Whenever technology reaches its real fulfilment, it",Paragraph
transcends into architecture. It is true that architecture,Paragraph
"depends on facts, but its real field of activity is in the realm",Paragraph
of significance.2,Paragraph
Mies van der Rohe’s development after the mid-1930s,Paragraph
concerned itself with the conciliation of two opposed,Paragraph
systems. One was the heritage of Romantic Classicism,Paragraph
"which, when translated into the skeleton steel frame,",Paragraph
"pointed towards the dematerialization of architecture, to the",Paragraph
mutation of built form into shifting planes suspended in,Paragraph
diaphanous space - the image of Suprematism. The other,Paragraph
was the authority of trabeated architecture as it had been,Paragraph
"inherited from the ancient world, the implacable elements of",Paragraph
"roof, beam, column and wall. Caught, as it were, between",Paragraph
"‘space’ and ‘structure’, Mies constantly sought to express",Paragraph
simultaneously both transparency and corporeality. The,Paragraph
dichotomy revealed itself most sublimely in his attitude to,Paragraph
"glass, which he used in such a way as to allow it to change",Paragraph
under light from the appearance of a reflective surface to,Paragraph
the disappearance of the surface into pure transparency: on,Paragraph
"the one hand, the apparition of nothing, on the other, an",Paragraph
evident need for support.,Paragraph
"In this respect, the preliminary scheme for the Illinois",Paragraph
"Institute of Technology (IIT) campus in Chicago [234],",Paragraph
"prepared in 1939, two years after his arrival in the United",Paragraph
"States, is clearly as Suprematist in feeling as parts of the",Paragraph
"Barcelona Pavilion. As in the Reichsbank project, the plan is",Paragraph
disposed about a single axis of symmetry. All the structures,Paragraph
"are four storeys high and rendered as pure prisms, faced in",Paragraph
"graph paper curtain walls, their surfaces animated by",Paragraph
skyscape reflections. These walls are shown sliding behind,Paragraph
"occasional clumps of trees, eliding into projecting ivy-clad",Paragraph
"brick planes, poised on the edge of their stereometric",Paragraph
masses. Apart from a Neo-Classical insistence on the visual,Paragraph
"reinforcement of corners with panels of brickwork, the effect",Paragraph
"is close to the Suprematist aesthetic of lvan Leonidov, in",Paragraph
particular to his Culture Park project of 1930.,Paragraph
"234 Mies van der Rohe, preliminary scheme for the Illinois Institute of",Caption
"Technology, Chicago, 1939.",Caption
"At this point, Mies appears to be struggling with the",Paragraph
"generic relation of column to wall, particularly where the",Paragraph
wall in question is largely of glass. The implicit solution in,Paragraph
the first IIT proposal (as in the Reichsbank project) is to set,Paragraph
"the columns back from the glass face, but in the final 1940",Paragraph
version the columns are integrated into the wall. This,Paragraph
development becomes explicit in the first building for the,Paragraph
campus. The articulation of the column system in,Paragraph
conjunction with the glazed plane becomes increasingly,Paragraph
idealized and monumental with each successive structure.,Paragraph
This progressive idealization depended on the,Paragraph
replacement of Mies’s generic cruciform column section of,Paragraph
the early 1930s by the standard American I-beam. The,Paragraph
asymmetrical pinwheeling plans of the Barcelona Pavilion,Caption
and the Tugendhat House at Brno demanded a non-,Paragraph
"directional column form, similar to the point supports that",Paragraph
Mies used in his Berlin Building Exhibition house of 1931. By,Paragraph
"contrast, his preference from the Reichsbank onwards for a",Paragraph
single axis of symmetry favoured the articulation of facades,Paragraph
in terms of the directional axis of the I-beam. The,Paragraph
"development of his work at IIT, from the Minerals and Metals",Paragraph
Research Building [235] and the Library of 1942 to the,Paragraph
"Alumni Memorial Hall of 1945, is towards the idealization of",Paragraph

steel columns of the Alumni Memorial Hall.,Caption
"235 Mies van der Rohe, Minerals and Metals Research Building, IIT, Chicago,",Caption
1942.,Paragraph
"With the Library and the Alumni Memorial Hall, Mies was",Paragraph
on the threshold of the building typology and structural,Caption
"syntax of his late career. At the same time, in the IIT Library",Paragraph
he first projected a work whose monumentality depended,Paragraph
on its great size - a gargantuanism that has obsessed,Paragraph
Chicago architectural practice ever since (see the recent,Paragraph
"work by the leading designers of Skidmore, Owings and",Paragraph
"Merrill, and C.F. Murphy). Here Mies audaciously proposed a",Paragraph

(first clearly formulated in his drive-in restaurant project of,Paragraph

structure of the external wall combine to form an articulated,Paragraph
"facade. Where the IIT Library led, by way of the drive-in",Caption

1953 - a technological monument par excellence consisting,Paragraph
"of a large flat roof, measuring 162 x 81 metres (530 x 266",Paragraph
"feet), suspended from seven steel trusses - the detailing of",Paragraph
the Alumni Memorial Hall was the formulation of the,Paragraph
language that Mies would soon use for the realization of 860,Paragraph
Lake Shore Drive.,Paragraph
"The Lake Shore Drive apartments [236, 237], under",Caption
"construction between 1948 and 1951, took the kitchen,",Paragraph
bathrooms and access cores of Mies’s 1927,Title
Weissenhofsiedlung apartments and compacted them about,Paragraph
two elevators in the middle of a thick slab. In this,Paragraph
"arrangement one gained access, through a service zone",Paragraph
"comprising kitchens and bathrooms, to a continuous living",Paragraph
space running around the perimeter that could be,Paragraph
subdivided according to variations in unit size and type. The,Paragraph
initial wall/column articulations of the Alumni Hall were here,Paragraph
elaborated into a modulated facade which was subtly,Paragraph
"related to the Suprematist, pinwheeling juxtaposition of the",Paragraph
two blocks. Of this relationship Peter Carter has written:,Paragraph
"236 Mies van der Rohe, 860 Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, 1948-51. Ground plan of",Caption
towers and typical floor plan.,Paragraph
"237 Mies van der Rohe, 860 Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, 1948-51.",Caption
The structural frame and its glass infill become,Paragraph
"architecturally fused, each losing a part of its particular",Paragraph
identity in establishing the new architectural reality. The,Paragraph
mullion has acted as a kind of catalyst for this change. The,Paragraph
columns and mullion dimensions determine window widths.,Paragraph
"The two central windows (in each structural bay) are,",Paragraph
"therefore, wider than those adjacent to the column. These",Paragraph
variants produce visual cadences of expanding and,Paragraph
contracting intervals; column - narrow window - wide,Paragraph
"window, then reversing - wide window, narrow window -",Paragraph
"column, and so on, of an extraordinarily subtle richness. And",Paragraph
to this is added the alternating opacity of the steel and,Paragraph
reflectivity of the glass caused by the blinker quality of the,Paragraph
mullions en masse.?,Paragraph
"In short, more than in any other work by Mies, the wall is",Paragraph
rendered here - after Semper’s prescription - as a woven,Paragraph
fabric; a subtle integration of structure with fenestration,Paragraph
that displays the same capacity as load-bearing masonry for,Paragraph
limiting any extension of the space.,Paragraph
"This restriction may well have contributed, as Colin Rowe",Paragraph
"has suggested, to Mies’s preoccupation with the creation of",Paragraph
"an unobstructed, clear-span, single-storey, unitary volume.",Caption
"This, Mies’s other generic type, was to absorb him from the",Paragraph
IIT Library onwards. As an archetypal form it was inherently,Paragraph
"public, yet it did not always accommodate a public",Paragraph
programme. In domestic terms the type was first,Paragraph
crystallized in the house designed in 1946 for Dr Edith,Caption
"Farnsworth, realized four years later at Plano, Illinois [238].",Paragraph
Here a 23 X 9-metre (77 x 29-foot) single-volume house,Paragraph
"was sandwiched, as it were, between floor and roof slabs",Paragraph
and raised some 1.5 metres (5 feet) above the ground on,Paragraph
exterior I-columns set 6.7 metres (22 feet) apart. The,Paragraph
"resultant box was enclosed by a plate-glass skin, the",Paragraph
"apotheosis of Mies’s phrase beinahe nichts, ‘almost",Paragraph
nothing’.,Paragraph
"238 Mies van der Rohe, Farnsworth House, Fox River, Plano, Illinois, 1946-50.",Caption
An evident asymmetry deriving in part from Suprematism,Paragraph
was here beautifully balanced by the symmetry of the,Paragraph
Schinkelschdler tradition. Thus the entrance platform slid,Paragraph
past the base of the house as a flat plane carried on six,Paragraph
columns in opposition to a prismatic volume carried on eight,Caption
- the asymmetry being evident in the overlapping of two,Paragraph
"symmetrical elements. For all its limited size, this was the",Paragraph
elevation of a house to the status of a monument. The,Paragraph
"podium, the steps, the terrace and the floor itself were all",Paragraph
faced in travertine. The exposed steelwork was sprayed,Paragraph
white after having been ground down to remove all the,Paragraph
welds. The windows were curtained in natural off-white,Paragraph
shantung silk. One is hardly surprised to learn that the,Paragraph
inordinate cost of the house led to a rupture between Mies,Paragraph
and Dr Farnsworth. Now a museum and National Historic,Caption

Colin Rowe has argued that the whole evolution of the,Paragraph
International Style in architecture was profoundly affected,Paragraph
by a conceptual schism between centripetal and centrifugal,Paragraph

ultimately deriving from the anti-monumentality of Wright’s,Paragraph

"claims, is demonstrated in Crown Hall (significantly enough,",Paragraph
"the IIT school of architecture), where the 67 x 37-metre",Paragraph
(220 x 120-foot) span glazed box does not afford an,Paragraph
unequivocal reading of its centralized composition. As Rowe,Paragraph
has written:,Paragraph
"Like the characteristic Palladian composition, Crown Hall is a",Paragraph
"symmetrical and, probably, a mathematically regulated",Paragraph
"volume. But, unlike the characteristic Palladian composition,",Paragraph
it is not a hierarchically ordered organization which projects,Paragraph
its centralized theme vertically in the form of a pyramidal,Paragraph
"roof or dome. Unlike the Villa Rotonda, but like so many of",Paragraph
"the compositions of the twenties, Crown Hall is provided",Paragraph
with no effective central area within which the observer can,Paragraph
"stand and comprehend the whole ... once inside, rather than",Paragraph
"any Spatial climax, the building offers a central solid, not",Paragraph
"energetically stated, it is true, but still an isolated core",Paragraph

Mies’s approach offered the publicity-conscious client an,Paragraph

completion of 860 Lake Shore Drive (built for the developer,Caption
"Herbert Greenwald) in 1951, he began to work increasingly",Paragraph
"for the real-estate and institutional establishment, the final",Paragraph
‘breakthrough’ coming in 1958 when he was commissioned,Paragraph
through the agency of Phyllis Lambert to design the thirty-,Paragraph
nine-storey Seagram Building [241] in New York. In this,Caption
"bronze and brown glass office tower, Mies once again",Caption
achieved that Semperian interweaving of fenestration with,Paragraph
"structure. This time, however, unlike Lake Shore Drive, he",Paragraph
created a frontalized axial composition facing a granite,Paragraph

"feet) from the building line, as a compliment to the 1917",Paragraph
"Racquet Club by McKim, Mead and White on the other side",Caption

infrastructural basis for the numerous welfare works that,Paragraph
were to be executed between Roosevelt’s Housing Act of,Paragraph

famous planning and settlement projects of the New Deal,Title
were the Tennessee Valley Authority and Clarence Stein’s,Paragraph
"Greenbelt New Towns, the latter realized after 1936 under",Paragraph
the auspices of the Federal Resettlement Administration.,Paragraph
"Unlike the remarkable dams [242], gantries and slipways",Paragraph

that Kahn had already proven his ability while working for,Paragraph

"Irrespective of their architectural merit, all of these works",Paragraph
evinced the presence of a ‘New Objectivity’ in the United,Paragraph
States. That this movement was hardly as self-conscious or,Paragraph
as polemical as its European counterpart was due to the fact,Paragraph
that a comparable ideological basis did not exist. The,Paragraph
"‘movement’ had, in any event, to be more sensitive to the",Paragraph
issue of popular acceptance and to this end its anti-,Paragraph
monumentality stemmed directly from its use of native,Paragraph
materials and from its response to the vagaries of,Paragraph
topography and climate.,Paragraph
A unique and contentious figure within the American,Paragraph
"architectural avant garde during the New Deal, Richard",Paragraph
Buckminster Fuller had adopted a recognizably ‘objective’ -,Paragraph
"not to say Constructivist - attitude as early as 1927, when",Paragraph
he designed the first version of his free-standing Dymaxion,Paragraph
"House, the name being a neologism, signifying dynamism",Paragraph
"plus efficiency. Fuller, like the more extreme members of the",Paragraph
"Swiss ABC group, had no concern whatsoever for the",Paragraph
idiosyncrasies of any given context and projected his house,Paragraph
as though it were a prototype for serial production [243].,Paragraph
Hexagonal in plan and sandwiched between two hollow,Paragraph
"decks, it was suspended and triangulated (on the wire wheel",Paragraph
"principle) from a central mast. In this form, it was advanced,",Paragraph
like Fuller’s even more eccentric Dymaxion automobile of,Paragraph
"1933, as the one and only inevitable solution. Fuller, never",Paragraph
"at a loss for rhetoric, described this light-weight metal",Paragraph
house in his Shelter magazine of May 1932 as a synthesis,Paragraph
between the American skyscraper and the oriental pagoda.,Paragraph
Ingeniously equipped with a hollow hexagonal mast,Paragraph
"containing all the necessary services, it was the first in a",Paragraph
series of centralized structures which culminated in Fuller’s,Paragraph
"much simpler geodesic dome, first adapted for domestic use",Paragraph
"on his own account at Carbondale, Illinois, in 1959. The",Paragraph
rugged reductive ethic of the pioneering individualist is,Paragraph
evident from the doggerel chorus to be sung to the tune of,Paragraph
‘Home on the Range’ that Fuller composed while teaching as,Paragraph
a visitor at Yale University in the mid-1950s:,Paragraph

Such a utilitarian and yet complacent attitude seems a,Paragraph
far cry from the proposals that Fuller seriously made in 1932,Paragraph
for the conversion of empty skyscraper office structures,Paragraph
(vacant as a result of the Depression) into emergency,Paragraph
residential accommodation. Fuller claimed that by the end,Paragraph
of the year ninety per cent of the people then still living in,Paragraph
"the city would be unable to pay taxes or to buy food. This,",Paragraph
"more than anything else, tends to confirm the affinity that",Paragraph
then coincidentally existed between the concerns of the,Paragraph

The year 1945 appears as the watershed between the,Paragraph
socially committed ethos of the New Deal and an incipient,Paragraph
impulse towards monumentality. This last seems to have,Paragraph
emerged partly out of the demands of America’s status as a,Paragraph
world power and partly out of the cultural anxiety that,Paragraph
attended the end of the Second World War. Two texts,Paragraph
published in 1945 establish the climate of the period with,Paragraph
"some precision: they are Built in U.S.A. 1932-1944, edited",Paragraph
"by Elizabeth Mock, which accompanied an exhibition at the",Caption
"Museum of Modern Art, New York - in which over half the",Paragraph
illustrations were devoted to the works of the New Deal -,Paragraph
"and New Architecture and City Planning, edited by Paul",Title
"Zucker, which recorded the proceedings of a symposium",Paragraph
conducted in the same year. This symposium was devoted,Paragraph
"to the growing need for monumental expression, a theme",Paragraph
most elaborately formulated by Sigfried Giedion in his paper,Paragraph
"of 1944, The Need for a New Monumentality. Kahn himself",Paragraph
had argued on the same occasion that,Paragraph
Monumentality is enigmatic. It cannot be intentionally,Paragraph
created. Neither the finest material nor the most advanced,Paragraph
technology need enter a work of monumental character for,Paragraph
the same reason that the finest ink was not required to draw,Paragraph
up the Magna Carta.”,Paragraph
The issue emerged again in 1950 in the first number of,Paragraph
"Perspecta - The Yale Architectural Journal, founded by",Paragraph
"George Howe, wherein Henry Hope Reed argued that the",Paragraph
New Deal had dealt a severe blow to the culture of,Paragraph
"affluence, and that the provisions arising out of the",Paragraph
Depression had effectively inhibited any capacity for the,Paragraph
monumental:,Title
To be sure the New Deal proved to be the greatest patron of,Paragraph
"the arts in that decade, but never on the basis of pomp and",Paragraph
"ceremony, or for reasons of national prestige or democratic",Paragraph
grandeur. The government instead reached a charitable and,Paragraph
"philanthropic hand to the starving artist, not that of a",Paragraph
magnificent and ‘wasteful’ patron.,Paragraph
It is hardly surprising that architects and city planners,Paragraph
were ripe for a message from across the waters about a new,Paragraph
"style which banished ‘waste’, tolerated only the functional",Paragraph
"and declared the house to be a machine for living, a fitting",Paragraph
phrase for a technocratic era.>,Paragraph
Although Reed concluded that the tools to create the,Paragraph
"monument had been lost, he was soon to be proven wrong,",Paragraph
for America was about to enter on a spate of all but,Paragraph
unprecedented monument-building. Intimations of this in,Paragraph
the 1944 Zucker symposium were vindicated a few years,Paragraph
"later, in 1949, when Philip Johnson built his small but",Paragraph
"monumental Glass House at New Canaan, Connecticut",Caption
"[244, 245]. Although inspired by Mies van der Rohe’s 1945",Paragraph
"sketches for the Farnsworth House, this work wilfully",Paragraph
departed from Mies’s preoccupation with the expression of,Paragraph
structural logic. That the Glass House already anticipated,Paragraph
Johnson’s later adaptation of the Miesian syntax to,Paragraph
decorative ends is hinted at in his description of it written in,Paragraph
1950:,Title
"244, 245 Johnson, Glass House, New Canaan, Connecticut, 1949.",Caption
"Many details of the house are adapted from Mies’s work,",Paragraph
especially the corner treatment and the relation of the,Paragraph
column to the window frames. The use of standard steel,Paragraph
sections to make a strong and at the same time decorative,Paragraph
finish to the facade is typical of Mies’s Chicago work.,Caption
Perhaps if there is ever to be ‘decoration’ in our architecture,Paragraph
it may come from the manipulation of stock structural,Paragraph
elements such as this (may not Mannerism be next?).4,Caption
Johnson’s determination to obscure structure through,Paragraph
surface manipulation was to characterize his work,Paragraph
"throughout the next decade. This approach, first fully",Paragraph
broached in monumental terms in his Port Chester,Paragraph
"Synagogue, New York, of 1954, attained its fullest",Paragraph
development in his New York State Theater in Lincoln,Caption
"Center, New York, and in his Klein Laboratory Tower built for",Caption
"Yale University at New Haven, both of which were complete",Paragraph
for occupation by 1963.,Paragraph
While the Graduate School of Design at Harvard (under,Paragraph
the direction of Gropius after 1963) helped to consolidate,Paragraph
"the anti-historicist and ‘objective’, Functionalist approach of",Paragraph
"the New Deal, the School of Architecture at Yale, under",Paragraph
"George Howe’s leadership after 1950, played a formative",Paragraph
role in the development of American post-war,Paragraph
monumentality. Howe’s own professional career had,Paragraph
"certainly been as varied as Gropius’s, ranging from the arch",Paragraph
conservatism of his country house practice in Philadelphia,Paragraph
to the avant-garde Functionalism of his brief partnership in,Paragraph
1929 with William Lescaze. Howe championed the cause of,Paragraph
"monumentality not only through his founding of Perspecta,",Paragraph
but also through his influence on the selection of architects,Paragraph
for Yale’s expansion programme which began in the early,Paragraph
"1950s. Indeed, when Reed’s article appeared in Perspecta in",Paragraph
"1950, Louis Kahn had already been selected to design the",Paragraph
Yale Art Gallery.,Paragraph
"With the completion of the art gallery in 1954, Kahn",Paragraph
established American post-war monumentality as a cultural,Paragraph
force in its own right. He did so with a building that was,Paragraph
hardly to be compared to the vulgar rhetoric generally,Paragraph
attained by American official architecture throughout the,Paragraph
1950s. A typical ‘imperialistic’ monument of the period was,Paragraph
surely Edward Durell Stone’s U.S. Embassy built at New,Paragraph
"Delhi in 1957, a work whose level of decorative, not to say",Paragraph
"laboured, monumentality was to be surpassed in respect of",Paragraph
its authoritarian overtones only by Eero Saarinen’s far,Paragraph
"superior U.S. Embassy in London, completed in 1960.",Caption
"The Yale Art Gallery [246, 247], like Johnson's Glass",Paragraph
"House, was based on a subtle transposition of the late",Paragraph
Miesian aesthetic. Yet where Mies had always given priority,Paragraph
"to the direct expression of structural frame, both Kahn and",Paragraph
"Johnson concealed the frame, at least externally, placing",Paragraph
their particular emphasis on the monumentalization of what,Paragraph
"might be considered ‘secondary’ components, such as walls,",Paragraph
"floors and ceilings. By a similar token, where Mies always",Paragraph
"chose to emphasize the axiality of his composition, Kahn",Paragraph
and Johnson masked the inherent symmetrical order of,Paragraph
theirwork by suppressing the frame. Where Kahn used the,Paragraph
"palpable opacity of brick for this purpose, Johnson relied on",Paragraph
"the reflectivity of glass. He exploited its innate capacity,",Paragraph
"when set flush with the surface, to appear as a continuous",Paragraph
membrane: to seem to be of the same metalled substance,Paragraph
"and formal order as the supporting metal frame. However,",Paragraph
these two seminal works had more in common than their,Paragraph
‘hermetic’ attitude to surface. In both instances the main,Paragraph
orthogonal volume was animated by a cylindrical form,Paragraph
housing primary service elements: the major access stair in,Paragraph
"the case of the gallery, and the fireplace and bathroom in",Paragraph
the case of the house. And while the schema of the Glass,Paragraph
House - namely a circle in a rectangle - also served as the,Paragraph
"essential parti of Kahn’s gallery, it was Kahn and not",Paragraph
Johnson who was to go on to elaborate the notion of the,Paragraph
cylinder as the servant and the rectangle as the served into,Paragraph
the dialectic of a general architectural theory.,Paragraph
"246 Kahn, Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut, 1950-54. Floor",Caption
plan with diagrid ceiling reflected.,Caption
"247 Kahn, Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut, 1950-54.",Caption
These early works of Johnson and Kahn created a kind of,Paragraph
post-Miesian space: an asymmetrical architecture of ‘almost,Paragraph
"nothing’, which depended no longer on the manifestation of",Paragraph
"structure as frame, but rather on the manipulation of",Paragraph
"surface as the ultimate agent for the revelation of light,",Paragraph
space and support. Thus the space of Kahn's art gallery was,Paragraph
as much determined by the concrete tetrahedral space-,Paragraph
frame that constituted its floors as it was by the regular grid,Paragraph
of rectangular columns that divided its internal volume into,Paragraph
four basic sections.,Paragraph
"From the early 1950s on, first Johnson and then Kahn",Paragraph
came to be increasingly concerned with reactivating the,Paragraph
formal systems of the past. Johnson’s own ‘historicism’ -,Paragraph
evident in the Neo-Classical qualities of the Glass House -,Paragraph
"came directly from his understanding of late Mies and, again",Paragraph
"after Mies, something of Schinkel’s Romantic Classicism.",Paragraph
The beginning of Kahn’s concern with the past is more,Paragraph
difficult to establish. Beaux-Arts-trained in Philadelphia,Paragraph
under Paul Cret but close in the late 1930s and 1940s to the,Paragraph
radicalism of men like Buckminster Fuller and Frederick,Title
"Kiesler, Kahn was to return after the New Deal to a remote",Paragraph
"historical tradition, through his preoccupation with the",Paragraph
creation of hierarchic order out of heavy structural form.,Paragraph
Certainly Kahn’s whole approach changed with his project,Paragraph
"for the Trenton Jewish Community Centre of 1954, made",Paragraph
some two years after he had returned from his sabbatical at,Paragraph
the American Academy in Rome.,Caption
By the mid-1950s the points of reference were becoming,Paragraph
"more complex, for while Johnson had shifted his attention",Paragraph
"from Schinkel to Soane, simultaneously keeping his eye",Paragraph
fixed on the totally independent Baroque forays then being,Paragraph
"made in Brasilia by Oscar Niemeyer, Kahn had begun to be",Paragraph
"preoccupied with the concept of an architectural totality,",Paragraph
whose ultimate historical reference would prove Islamic,Paragraph
rather than Western.,Paragraph
At this juncture in Kahn’s career one encounters one of,Paragraph
the central paradoxes in the work and influence of,Paragraph
Buckminster Fuller. For whereas Fuller’s contribution was,Paragraph
posited by both himself and his followers as the only truly,Paragraph
"functionalist approach of the age, it has since become",Paragraph
evident that his geodesic structural systems should be,Paragraph
regarded as evoking through their universal geometry an,Paragraph
attitude to both form and life that is fundamentally mystical.,Paragraph
It is clear from Kahn’s subsequent career that this side of,Paragraph
Fuller’s thought exercised a strong hold over his,Paragraph
"development, and never more so than during the period of",Paragraph
"his association with Ann Tyng, who was an ardent follower of",Paragraph
the Fuller line. The various versions of Kahn’s multistorey,Paragraph
"triangulated city hall for Philadelphia [248], designed in",Caption
"association with Tyng between 1952 and 1957, bracket the",Paragraph
period during which he was most directly under Fuller’s,Paragraph
"influence. The basic concept of a geodesic skyscraper,",Paragraph
stabilized by tetrahedronal concrete floors - ‘a vertical truss,Paragraph
against the wind’ - enabled Kahn to return to an,Paragraph
architectural intention that would have been appreciated by,Paragraph
Viollet-le-Duc. This much is evident from one of the clearest,Paragraph
statements of intent that he ever produced:,Paragraph
"248 Kahn and Tyng, project for Philadelphia City Hall, 1952-57. Model.",Caption
"In Gothic times, architects built in solid stones. Now we can",Paragraph
build with hollow stones. The spaces defined by the,Paragraph
members of a structure are as important as the members.,Paragraph
These spaces range in scale from the voids of an insulation,Paragraph
"panel, voids for air, lighting and heat to circulate, to spaces",Paragraph
big enough to walk through and live in. The desire to,Paragraph
express voids positively in the design of structure is,Paragraph
evidenced by the growing interest and work in the,Paragraph
development of space-frames. The forms being,Paragraph
experimented with come from a closer knowledge of nature,Paragraph
and the outgrowth of the constant search for order. Design,Paragraph
habits leading to the concealment of structure have no,Paragraph
place in this implied order. Such habits retard the,Paragraph
"development of an art. | believe that in architecture, as in all",Paragraph
"art, the artist instinctively keeps the marks which reveal",Paragraph
how a thing was done. The feeling that our present day,Paragraph
architecture needs embellishment stems in part from our,Paragraph
"tendency to fair joints out of sight, to conceal how parts are",Paragraph
put together. Structures should be devised which can,Paragraph
harbour the mechanical needs of rooms and spaces. ... If we,Paragraph
"were to train ourselves to draw as we build, from the bottom",Paragraph
"up, when we do, stopping our pencil to make a mark at the",Paragraph
"joints of pouring or erecting, ornament would grow out of",Paragraph
our love for the expression of method. It would follow that,Paragraph
the pasting over the construction of lighting and acoustical,Paragraph
"material, the burying of tortured unwanted ducts, conduits",Paragraph
"and pipe lines, would become intolerable. The desire to",Paragraph
express how it is done would filter through the entire society,Paragraph
"of building, to architect, engineer, builder and craftsman.°",Paragraph
The fundamental themes of Kahn’s subsequent career,Paragraph
"are all basically outlined in this remarkable passage, from",Paragraph
the notion of conceptually transposing solid and void - see,Paragraph
the reference to hollow stones - to the idea of explicitly,Paragraph
integrating mechanical systems with the structure and the,Paragraph
important corollary that the universal ordering principle,Paragraph
(namely ‘what the building wants to be’) could only make,Paragraph
itself manifest through the revelation of the constructional,Paragraph
process.,Paragraph
"The integrated development of these principles, from the",Paragraph
Yale Art Gallery to the Richards Laboratories [249] built for,Caption
"the University of Pennsylvania between 1957 and 1964, led",Paragraph
to the first phase of Kahn’s postponed maturity. In both,Paragraph
works Kahn used a method and mode of expression where,Paragraph
the empirical details of the programme have little or no,Paragraph
impact on the overall form. It was in fact a case of discrete,Paragraph
function having to accommodate itself - as in the past - to,Paragraph
"the form, but only insofar as the form itself had been",Paragraph
invented from a profound understanding of the overall task,Paragraph
"in the first place. In the case of the Richards Laboratories,",Paragraph
the problematic aspect of Kahn’s method lay exactly in this,Paragraph
"issue, as to whether or not the overall form was",Paragraph
typologically justified. The subsequent difficulties,Paragraph
encountered in using the building would suggest that it was,Paragraph
not. We seem to be confronted here with the traditional,Paragraph
American impulse to idealize the work place - to,Paragraph
monumentalize the space of process - an intention which is,Paragraph
as evident in the Richards Laboratories as it is in Johnson's,Paragraph
"Klein Tower. The precedent for all this would seem, not",Paragraph
"surprisingly, to be Wright, first in his Larkin Building at",Paragraph
"Buffalo of 1904 and then in his complex for Johnson Wax,",Paragraph
"built at Racine in Wisconsin, in 1936-39. It is an appropriate",Paragraph
"irony, to say the least, that both Kahn and Johnson should",Paragraph
come to debate in Perspecta 2 (1953) the validity of,Paragraph
"Wright’s later addition to his Racine complex, namely the",Paragraph
laboratory tower built there in 1946. With marked,Caption
indifference to the status of the tower as it might be,Paragraph
"determined by the programme in relation to the society,",Paragraph
Kahn remarked:,Paragraph
"249 Kahn, A.N. Richards Laboratories, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia,",Caption
1957-61. Third-floor plan.,Caption
It has to do with the full complexity of making architecture,Paragraph
work in the fullest psychological sense. It works because it is,Paragraph
motivated. It fills the desires and the needs. And so should,Paragraph
"the Tower work, as psychological satisfaction.®",Paragraph
Along more aesthetic lines and with greater,Paragraph
"flamboyance, Johnson declared his own indifference to the",Paragraph
issue of function:,Title
It was the terrific problem of a man who wants a beautiful,Paragraph
building but the only thing he has to build is a laboratory.,Paragraph
Wright puts it into a tower. If doesn’t work: it doesn’t have,Paragraph
to work. Wright had that shape conceived long before he,Paragraph
knew what was going into it. | claim that is where,Paragraph
"architecture starts, with the concept.’",Paragraph
It is a measure of Kahn’s achievement and of his,Paragraph
continuing influence today that the ‘concept’ was exactly,Paragraph
"where architecture always started for him, even if he was",Paragraph
sufficiently flexible to allow the initial ‘Form’ (Kahn’s term,Paragraph
for ‘type’) to be modified by the exigencies of the,Paragraph
"programme. For him, building remained a spiritual act, and",Paragraph
it is hardly an accident that his best work was reserved for,Paragraph
religious or extremely honorific structures. In many,Paragraph
subsequent commissions he ascribed a highly spiritual,Paragraph
connotation to the programme and never more so than in,Paragraph
the case of the research centre that he designed for Dr,Paragraph
"Jonas Salk, at La Jolla, California, between 1959 and 1965",Caption
"[250]. In this instance, the separation of the whole complex",Paragraph
"into working, meeting and living sectors seems to have",Paragraph
released Kahn from the compulsive need to reduce the,Paragraph
laboratory space to an ideal form. The final version of the,Paragraph
Salk Laboratories brought him to accept a solution in which,Paragraph
the services were as ‘repressed’ or concealed as in any,Paragraph
office building by Mies van der Rohe. Kahn's provision of a,Caption
whole full-height service floor under each laboratory - a,Paragraph
provision which today is fully utilized - yielded a much more,Paragraph
flexible space than that generally achieved at Philadelphia.,Paragraph
The unbuilt Salk meeting complex was also the first,Paragraph
occasion on which Kahn had a chance to develop his anti-,Paragraph
"glare concept of setting a ‘building within a building’, a",Paragraph
notion which he had first broached at a conceptual level in,Paragraph
"his 1959 sketches for the American Consulate at Luanda,",Paragraph
"Angola. This idea, destined to remain unbuilt even at La",Paragraph
"Jolla, was to become the main theme of his magnificent",Paragraph
"National Assembly Building, under construction at Dacca in",Caption
East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) from 1965 to 1974.,Paragraph
"250 Kahn, Salk Institute of Biological Studies, La Jolla, California, 1959-65.",Caption
Section through laboratory wing.,Caption
Kahn’s rejection of a simple-minded if socially committed,Paragraph
functionalism in favour of an architecture capable of,Paragraph
transcending utility led him to postulate a parallel approach,Paragraph
to urban form. Once again this shift reflected his own,Paragraph
"development, in which he progressed from projecting the",Paragraph
Ville Radieuse onto the centre of Philadelphia - in his so-,Paragraph
"called Rational City studies of 1939-48 - to postulating, in",Paragraph
"his maturity, the need to make an explicit distinction",Paragraph
between the architecture of the ‘viaduct’ and building at a,Paragraph
human scale. This was perhaps never more dramatically,Paragraph
"expressed than in his plan for midtown Philadelphia of 1956,",Paragraph
where he attempted to press the forms of Piranesi’s Rome of,Paragraph
1762 into the service of the modern city. Yet for all the,Paragraph
"rational poetry of this proposition, and the ingenuity of his",Paragraph
subtly rearranged traffic patterns (his distinction for,Paragraph
instance between the expressways as ‘rivers’ and the ‘stop-,Paragraph
"go’ traffic-light-controlled streets as ‘canals’), Kahn’s",Paragraph
midtown planning proposals remained paradoxically,Paragraph
unspecific when it came to imagining the precise relations,Paragraph
that should obtain between the pedestrian and the,Paragraph
"automobile. Kahn, conscious of the profound antipathy",Paragraph
between the automobile and the city and of the fatal link,Title
"between consumerism, the suburban shopping centre and",Paragraph
the decline of the urban core (a link that stemmed,Paragraph
incidentally from the combined effects of the post-war,Paragraph
federal highway subsidy and the mortgage provisions of the,Title
"G.I. Bill), was no more capable than any other architect of",Paragraph
conceiving a satisfactory interchange between the human,Paragraph
scale and the scale of the car. His Piranesian ‘dock’ proposal,Paragraph
"[251] of 1956, comprising a six-storey cylindrical silo",Paragraph
"housing 1,500 cars and surrounded on its perimeter by",Paragraph
"eighteen-storey blocks, was as deprived as any other mega-",Paragraph
structure of the period of the necessary elements with,Paragraph
which to establish a human scale at its base. The limits of,Paragraph
Kahn's profound historicism were never more poignant than,Paragraph
in his likening of his Philadelphia midtown plan to,Paragraph
"Carcassonne. It was surely a vain utopian hope to argue, as",Paragraph
"he did, that the ordering of movement within a city would of",Paragraph

"In many respects, the International Style was little more",Paragraph
than a convenient phrase denoting a cubistic mode of,Paragraph
architecture which had spread throughout the developed,Paragraph
world by the time of the Second World War. Its apparent,Paragraph
"homogeneity was deceptive, since its stripped planar form",Paragraph
was subtly inflected so as to respond to different climatic,Paragraph
and cultural conditions. Unlike the Neo-Classical manner of,Paragraph
"the Western world in the late 18th century, the International",Paragraph
"Style never became truly universal. Nonetheless, it implied",Paragraph
a universality of approach which generally favoured light-,Paragraph
"weight technique, synthetic modern materials and standard",Title
modular parts so as to facilitate fabrication and erection. It,Paragraph
tended as a general rule towards the hypothetical flexibility,Paragraph
"of the free plan, and to this end it preferred skeleton frame",Paragraph
construction to masonry. This predisposition became,Paragraph
"formalistic where specified conditions, be they climatic,",Paragraph
"cultural or economic, could not support the application of",Paragraph
advanced light-weight technology. Le Corbusier’s ideal villas,Paragraph
of the late 1920s anticipated such formalism inasmuch as,Paragraph
"they masqueraded as white, homogeneous, machine-made",Paragraph
"forms, whereas they were in fact built of rendered concrete",Paragraph
blockwork held in place by a reinforced-concrete frame.,Caption

"beyond the physical care of the body. He was, and he",Paragraph
"wished to be considered, progressive, whether in physical",Paragraph
"culture, permissive education, or architecture.2",Caption
The ideology of Lovell and its direct expression in the,Paragraph
Health House exercised a decisive influence over the rest of,Paragraph
Neutra’s career. From now on his work was at its best where,Paragraph
the building programme could be interpreted as making a,Paragraph
direct contribution to the psycho-physiological wellbeing of,Paragraph
its occupants. The central theme of both Neutra’s work and,Paragraph
his writings was the beneficial impact of a well-designed,Paragraph
environment upon the general health of the human nervous,Title
system. And while his so-called ‘bio-realism’ rested largely,Paragraph
on unproven arguments linking architectural form to overall,Title
"health, it is difficult to discredit the extraordinary sensitivity",Paragraph
and supra-functional attitude that coloured his whole,Paragraph
approach. Nothing could be further removed from the,Paragraph
exclusively formal motivations attributed to the,Paragraph
International Style by Hitchcock and Johnson than the,Title
overall biological concerns addressed by Neutra in his book,Paragraph
"Survival Through Design (1954), where he wrote:",Paragraph
lt has become imperative that in designing our physical,Paragraph
environment we should consciously raise the fundamental,Paragraph
question of survival in the broadest sense of the term. Any,Paragraph
design that impairs or imposes excessive strain on the,Paragraph
natural human equipment should be eliminated or modified,Title
in accordance with the requirements of our nervous and,Paragraph
"more gradually, our total physiological functioning.",Paragraph
"Thus, the primary concern for Schindler and Neutra alike",Paragraph
- both of whom had served their American apprenticeships,Paragraph
"with Wright - was not abstract form as such, but rather the",Paragraph
modulation of sun and light and the sensitive articulation of,Paragraph
the screens of plants between the building and its general,Paragraph
context. This ambient hedonism was never more subtly,Paragraph

It is a very moving experience to turn over the pages of,Paragraph

In Brazil modern architecture had its origins in the mid-,Paragraph
"1920s partnership of Lucio Costa and Gregori Warchavchik,",Paragraph
an émigré Russian architect who had been influenced by,Paragraph
Futurism during his studies in Rome and who was,Paragraph
responsible for the first cubistic houses in Brazil. With the,Paragraph
revolution headed by Getulio Vargas in 1930 and the,Paragraph
appointment of Costa as head of the School of Fine Arts in,Paragraph
"Rio de Janeiro in 1931, modern architecture came to be",Paragraph
welcomed in Brazil as a matter of national policy. In 1936 Le,Paragraph
Corbusier had a direct impact on South America when he,Paragraph
was invited to Brazil to act as adviser for the design of a,Paragraph
new building for the Ministry of Education in Rio de Janeiro.,Caption
"After working with Costa and his design team, Le Corbusier",Paragraph
seems to have endorsed the sixteen-storey slab solution,Paragraph
which departed dramatically from his initial sketches. Yet,Paragraph
"the final version, raised on a peristyle of pi/otis, was an",Paragraph
occasion for the first monumental application of many of the,Paragraph
"characteristic Corbusian elements, including the to/t-jardin,",Paragraph
the brise-solei/ and the pan-verre. The young Brazilian,Paragraph
followers of Le Corbusier immediately transformed these,Paragraph
Purist components into a highly sensuous native expression,Paragraph
which echoed in its plastic exuberance the 18th-century,Paragraph
Brazilian Baroque. The most brilliant exponent of this,Paragraph
"rhetorical manner was Oscar Niemeyer, who had worked",Paragraph
"with Costa, Affonso Reidy, Jorge Moreira and others on the",Paragraph
design for the Ministry of Education. Niemeyer’s freely,Caption
planned Brazilian Pavilion for the 1939 New York World’s Fair,Caption
"[263], designed with Costa and Paul Lester Wiener, gained",Paragraph
world recognition for the Brazilian movement and confirmed,Title
his own exceptional ability. Niemeyer brought Le Corbusier’s,Paragraph
concept of the free plan to a new level of fluidity and,Paragraph
interpenetration. Initially planned around an exotic garden,Paragraph
court of Brazilian flora and fauna - a micro-Amazonian,Title
landscape complete with orchids and snakes - this plastic,Paragraph
concept evoked the tropical corniche of Rio itself. The,Paragraph
garden layout was the work of the painter Roberto Burle,Paragraph
"Marx, whose landscapes after 1936 became a seminal force",Paragraph
in the Brazilian movement. Burle Marx exploited the Purist,Paragraph
concept of the mariage de contour in order to organize,Paragraph
"‘paradise gardens’, articulated and textured in many",Paragraph
instances with newly domesticated plants which he himself,Paragraph
had taken from the jungle. With Burle Marx’s landscape a,Paragraph
"new national style came into being, based to a large extent",Paragraph
on indigenous Brazilian vegetation.,Paragraph
"Niemeyer’s genius reached its height in 1942 when, at",Paragraph
"the age of thirty-five, he achieved his first masterwork, the",Paragraph
Casino at Pampulha [262]. Here Niemeyer reinterpreted the,Paragraph
Corbusian notion of a promenade architecturale in a spatial,Paragraph
composition of remarkable balance and vivacity. This was a,Paragraph
"narrative building in every respect, from the welcoming",Paragraph
double-height foyer to the gleaming ramps rising to the,Paragraph
gaming floor; from the elliptical corridors leading towards,Paragraph
the restaurant to the ingenious backstage access to the,Paragraph
"dance area; in short, an explicit promenade which",Paragraph
articulated the space of the building as the structure of an,Paragraph
"elaborate game, a game as intricate as the habits of the",Paragraph
society it was intended to serve. The restaurant with its,Paragraph
"complex accessways, interlocking like the turns of a",Paragraph
"labyrinth, established not only the routes but also the class",Paragraph
"roles of the various ‘actors’ divided between clients,",Paragraph
entertainers and serving staff. Strong and hedonistic in its,Paragraph
"general treatment, the building had a severe yet theatrical",Paragraph
"atmosphere, a contrast in mood established by the propriety",Paragraph
of the facades faced in travertine and juparana stone and,Paragraph
"the exoticism of an interior lined with pink glass, satin and",Paragraph
brilliantly coloured panels of traditional Portuguese tiles.,Caption
Rendered obsolete as a casino through a subsequent,Paragraph
"interdiction on gambling, the building now serves as an art",Paragraph
museum. Niemeyer was well aware of the limitations of,Paragraph
working for such an underdeveloped society when he wrote,Paragraph
in 1950:,Title

Second-floor plan.,Caption
"263 Niemeyer, Costa and Wiener, Brazilian Pavilion, World’s Fair, New York,",Caption
1939.,Paragraph
Architecture must express the spirit of the technical and,Paragraph
social forces that are predominant in a given epoch; but,Paragraph
"when such forces are not balanced, the resulting conflict is",Paragraph
prejudicial to the content of the work and to the work as a,Paragraph
whole. Only with this in mind may we understand the nature,Paragraph
of the plans and drawings which appear in this volume. |,Paragraph
should have very much liked to be in a position to present a,Paragraph
more realistic achievement: a kind of work which reflects,Paragraph
not only refinements and comfort but also a positive,Paragraph
collaboration between the architect and the whole society.®,Paragraph
For all that this collaboration was earnestly sought by the,Paragraph
"reformist president Juscelino Kubitschek, for whom",Paragraph
"Niemeyer had worked since 1942, such a balance remained",Paragraph
elusive. A singular achievement was Reidy’s Pedregulho,Paragraph
"complex, built outside Rio between 1948 and 1954,",Paragraph
"comprising apartments, a primary school, a gymnasium and",Paragraph
"a swimming pool, the whole constituting a prototypical",Paragraph
"neighbourhood unit. Throughout Kubitschek’s presidency,",Paragraph
"from 1955 on, surprisingly little architecture was realized in",Paragraph
the name of the whole society.,Paragraph
"Brasilia [264], planned by Costa in the mid-1950s,",Paragraph
brought the progressive development of Brazilian,Paragraph
"architecture to a point of crisis. This crisis, destined",Paragraph
eventually to provoke a global reaction against the precepts,Paragraph
"of the Modern Movement, permeated the entire project, not",Paragraph
only at the level of the individual building but also at the,Paragraph
scale of the plan itself. The conceptual schism that had,Paragraph
"already occurred at Chandigarh in 1951, between the",Paragraph
isolated monumentality of the government centre as,Paragraph
"designed by Le Corbusier and the rest of the city, was to be",Paragraph
repeated at Brasilia where the overall plan was somewhat,Paragraph
"less systematic in its basic conception. Where Chandigarh,",Paragraph
"in the last analysis, at least paid lip service to the time-",Paragraph
"honoured logic of the colonial grid, Brasilia, despite its",Paragraph
"orthogonal pattern of supercuadras, was fundamentally",Paragraph
based on a cross form. It would seem as if the mythic,Paragraph
"principles of European humanism, as reinterpreted through",Paragraph
"the late work of Le Corbusier, determined the structure of",Paragraph
"Brasilia with unfortunate consequences, at least from the",Paragraph
"point of view of accessibility. Moreover, soon after its",Paragraph
"foundation, Brasilia emerged as two cities: the monumental",Paragraph
city of government and big business to which the,Paragraph
"bureaucrats commuted by air from Rio, and the ‘shanty",Paragraph
"town’ or fave/a, whose inhabitants served the ‘radiance’ of",Paragraph
"the high city. Even within its own confines, Brasilia, like Le",Paragraph
"Corbusier’s Ville Radieuse of 1933, was a divided city, zoned",Paragraph
"into separate sections to accord with its class structure. Yet,",Paragraph
aside from the manifest social inequality enforced by such,Paragraph
"an arrangement, Brasilia also produced formalistic and",Paragraph
repressive results at the level of its own representation. In,Paragraph
this connection it may be argued that Le Corbusier’s,Paragraph
development at Chandigarh foreshadowed a critical point in,Paragraph
"Niemeyer’s own career, for clearly Niemeyer’s work became",Paragraph
increasingly simplistic and monumental after the publication,Paragraph
of the first sketches for Chandigarh.,Paragraph

"delicacy of his Pampulha Casino, his command of free form,",Paragraph
deriving in part from his continual association with Burle,Paragraph
"Marx, grew in its lyrical authority from the time of his",Paragraph
Pampulha restaurant of 1942 to the extraordinary ‘organic’,Paragraph
"house that he built for himself in 1953-54 at Gavea,",Paragraph

with the informal functionality on which his fluid plan forms,Paragraph
"had been based, to concentrate on the creation of pure",Paragraph

One may date this break with his 1955 project for a Museum,Paragraph
"of Modern Art in Caracas, where he proposed the dramatic",Paragraph
"use of an inverted pyramid, to be poised on the edge of a",Paragraph
"precipitous terrain. Inverted or not, this use of the pyramid",Paragraph
"seems to have signalled a return to Classical absolutes, and",Paragraph
"the same may be said of his work at Brasilia which, together",Paragraph
"with Costa’s grid, evoked the aura of the genre terrible, the",Paragraph
assertion of implacable form against remorseless nature; for,Paragraph
"beyond the order of Brasilia’s Capitol, edged by an artificial",Paragraph

"paraphrase of Chandigarh, Brasilia’s Three Powers Square,",Paragraph

In contrast to the adjustable brise-so/ei/ judiciously,Paragraph
"applied, some twenty years before, to the north facade of",Caption
"the Ministry of Education, the curtain walls at Brasilia were",Paragraph
"left unshielded from the sun, although faced with heat-",Paragraph
absorbent glass. This indifference to climate seems to have,Paragraph
arisen out of a desire to represent the institutions of,Paragraph
government by Platonic forms whose purity would stand in,Paragraph
strong contrast to the glazed and repetitive slabs housing,Paragraph
the ministries. That the initial exuberance of modern,Paragraph
Brazilian architecture contained within itself the seeds of,Paragraph
such decadent formalism seems to have been most clearly,Paragraph
"appreciated by Max Bill, who condemned Niemeyer’s 1954",Paragraph

"Once again, it was a question of the style being introduced,",Paragraph
"in its most accomplished form, by an émigré. Raymond was",Paragraph
a much-travelled Czech-American who had come to Tokyo at,Paragraph
the end of 1919 to work as the supervising architect on,Paragraph
Frank Lloyd Wright’s Imperial Hotel. As in the case of the,Paragraph
"careers of Neutra and Schindler in the States, the style",Paragraph
emerged from the hands of a Central European who had,Paragraph
been formally educated in Europe and afterwards trained by,Paragraph
"Wright. It is interesting to note that Neutra, Schindler and",Paragraph
Raymond freed themselves from the constraints of Wright’s,Paragraph
stylistic influence within a few years of leaving his employ.,Paragraph
"265 Raymond, the architect’s house, Reinanzaka, Tokyo, 1923.",Caption
Raymond’s own house was remarkable in a number of,Paragraph
ways. It was one of the first occasions on which a concrete,Paragraph
frame was detailed so as to recall traditional Japanese,Paragraph
"wooden construction, a mannerism which was to become",Paragraph
the architectonic touchstone of Japanese architecture after,Paragraph
the Second World War. Its interior was equally in advance of,Paragraph
"its time by the standards of the International Style, since",Paragraph
Raymond made one of the earliest uses of cantilevered,Paragraph
"tubular steel furniture, antedating the pioneering chairs of",Paragraph
Mart Stam and Marcel Breuer. The house itself was detailed,Paragraph
with metal fenestration and tubular steel trellises. At the,Caption
"same time, Raymond attempted to integrate into its form",Paragraph
"elements taken straight from the local vernacular, such as",Paragraph
the use of rope rain leaders instead of traditional Western,Paragraph
"downpipes. Otherwise, in the profiling of its window",Paragraph
"canopies, the house still recalled something of Wright’s",Paragraph
Unity Temple style of 1905.,Paragraph
Despite the previous brilliance of Wright’s ‘reworking’ of,Paragraph
Japanese culture in America and Paul Mueller’s ingenious,Title
"use of reinforced-concrete technique, the Imperial Hotel in",Paragraph
Tokyo gave no indication as to how its ponderous,Paragraph
architectural style could ever contribute to an intelligent,Paragraph
reinterpretation of Japanese light-weight construction. Its,Paragraph
stylistic affinities were closer to the isolated castles of the,Paragraph
16th and 17th centuries than to aristocratic Shinto building,Paragraph
of the Heian era; contrary to Louis Sullivan’s opinion of 1924,Paragraph
it remained firmly removed from the architectural,Paragraph
"mainstream of the indigenous culture. Nonetheless, its",Paragraph
spectacular survival of the 1923 Tokyo earthquake disaster,Title
provided a post facto justification for the expense of anti-,Paragraph
"seismic structure, particularly in the case of public buildings.",Paragraph
This ‘proof’ of reinforced monolithic construction enabled,Paragraph
Raymond to take full advantage of the latest concrete,Paragraph
"technology in his major works of the late 1920s, including",Paragraph
his Rising Sun Petroleum Company offices of 1926 and his,Paragraph
"elaborate and highly mannered Tokyo Golf Club, built",Caption
outside the capital in 1930. At this juncture Raymond seems,Paragraph
"to have shifted his stylistic allegiance to Auguste Perret,",Paragraph
apparently sensing that an appropriate syntax for exposed,Paragraph
reinforced concrete was hardly to be found in Wright.,Paragraph
"With the Akaboshi and Fukui houses of 1933-35,",Paragraph
Raymond and his wife Noemi Pernessin reached the high,Paragraph
point of their early career in the service of an arriviste,Paragraph
industrialist class. Together they determined the design of,Paragraph
everything from the building itself to its furnishings and,Paragraph
"fabrics. In these years, they produced a whole series of",Paragraph
"houses for different members of the Akaboshi family, loosely",Paragraph
attempting to integrate their own rather tasteful furniture,Paragraph
with the severity of the traditional tatam/ floor and the,Paragraph
implacable surface of the shoji screen. Their unique,Paragraph
Eurasian style seems to have reached its apotheosis in a,Paragraph
house and bathing facility that the Raymonds designed for,Paragraph
"the Fukui family at Atami Bay in 1935, where they",Paragraph
reinterpreted traditional forms in such a way as to liberate,Paragraph
themselves finally from the influence of both Wright and,Paragraph
Perret.,Paragraph
"In 1926, a relatively independent Japanese movement",Paragraph
"began to develop around the Japanese Secession Group,",Paragraph
"which included among its early members Mamoru Yamada,",Paragraph
"who designed the Central Telephone Office in Tokyo in 1926,",Paragraph
"and Tetsuro Yoshida, who designed the Tokyo General Post",Paragraph
"Office in 1931. At the same time, those of an even younger",Paragraph
"generation, such as Kunio Mayekawa and Junzo Yoshimura,",Paragraph
began either to work for Raymond or to study abroad. A,Paragraph
number of Japanese even ended up by studying at the,Paragraph
"Bauhaus in the late 1920s, while others such as Mayekawa",Paragraph
and Junzo Sakakura worked for Le Corbusier. Sakakura even,Paragraph
managed to complete his European experience with a work,Paragraph
"of international importance, the Japanese Pavilion at the",Paragraph
"Paris Exhibition of 1937, in which the architectonic order of",Paragraph
"the traditional teahouse was reinterpreted in modern, not to",Paragraph
"say Corbusian, terms. Sakakura’s open-space planning,",Paragraph
together with the clear articulation of his structure and its,Paragraph
"ramped interconnection of exterior and interior space, bore",Paragraph
but a distant resemblance to the spatial order of traditional,Paragraph
Japanese architecture.,Paragraph
A more restrained interpretation of tradition informed the,Paragraph
"domestic practice of Isoya Yoshida, while against such",Paragraph
conservatism stood the conceptual boldness of men such as,Paragraph
Rentchitchiro Kavakita whose entry for the Soviet Kharkov,Title
Theatre competition of 1931 [266] was far removed from,Paragraph
"the received modernism of the period; that is to say, it was",Paragraph
as distant from conventional Constructivist motifs as it was,Paragraph
from the Japanese tradition. It was primarily concerned with,Paragraph
the excitement of mechanical movement and the rhetoric of,Paragraph
structural invention on an enormous scale. This work surely,Paragraph
anticipated the quite extraordinary audacity of Kenzo,Paragraph
"Tange’s post-war development, culminating in the twin",Paragraph
Olympic stadia that he designed for the Tokyo games in,Paragraph
1964 [267]. While Tange was not concerned with,Paragraph
"movement, the elliptical and circular volumes of these",Paragraph
stadia were covered by catenary steel roofs hung from the,Paragraph
prowlike ‘horns’ of elliptical concrete ring beams which also,Paragraph
supported the upper tiers of the raked seating.,Caption

fused concepts drawn from the Heian era with elements,Paragraph
discreetly abstracted from the received vocabulary of the,Paragraph

established Tange as one of the major figures to emerge in,Paragraph
Japan after the Second World War. Despite common roots in,Paragraph

could be farther apart than Niemeyer’s Three Powers Square,Paragraph

the instrumentality of the West. Both the Kamakura Museum,Caption

conclusion that:,Paragraph
"269 Mayekawa, Harumi Apartments, Tokyo, 1957.",Caption
Modern architecture is and must be squarely based on the,Paragraph
"solid achievements of modern science, technology, and",Title
engineering. Why then does it so often tend to become,Paragraph
something inhuman? | believe that one of the main reasons,Paragraph
is that it is not always created merely to satisfy human,Paragraph
"requirements, but rather for some other reason, such as the",Paragraph
profit motive. Or an attempt is made to cramp the,Paragraph
architecture into the framework of some budget formulated,Paragraph
by the mechanical operations of a powerful bureaucratic,Paragraph
"system of the modern state, this budget having nothing to",Paragraph
do with human considerations. Another possibility is that,Paragraph
"inhuman elements may be contained within science,",Paragraph
"technology, and engineering themselves. When man",Paragraph
"attempts to understand a certain phenomenon, science",Paragraph
"analyses it, breaking it down into the simplest possible",Paragraph
"elements. Thus, in structural engineering when one",Paragraph
"attempts to understand a certain phenomenon, the methods",Paragraph
adopted are those of simplification and abstraction. The,Paragraph
question arises of whether the use of such methods may not,Paragraph
cause a departure from human realities ... Modern,Paragraph
"architecture must recall its rudiments, its initial principles as",Paragraph
a human architecture. Whereas science and engineering are,Paragraph
"the products of human brains, the modern architecture and",Paragraph
the modern cities which are built by them tend to become,Paragraph
inhuman. That which has beclouded the rudimentary,Paragraph
"principles of modern architecture, that which is distorting its",Paragraph
sense of mission is today’s ethical system regulating human,Paragraph
"action, and the system of value judgments concealed",Title
behind this ethical system. These ethical and value criteria,Paragraph
are the forces which are moving modern civilization but are,Paragraph
also obliterating human dignity and making a mockery of,Paragraph
the Declaration of Human Rights. The conclusion of the,Paragraph
tragedy is by no means simple. We must go back to the,Paragraph
beginnings of Western civilization and discover whether the,Paragraph
power to bring about such an ethical revolution can really,Paragraph
"be found in the inventory of Western civilization itself. If not,",Paragraph
"then we must seek it, together with Toynbee, in the Orient,",Paragraph

"comprised an architecture of shallow-pitched roofs, brick",Paragraph

While the work of Edman and Holm may have sparked,Paragraph

"dignified by the grandiose title of ‘The New Humanism’,",Paragraph
which was in itself a reworking of a title invented (by The,Paragraph
Architectural Review) for the Swedish retreat from Modern,Paragraph
Architecture: The New Empiricism.?,Paragraph
Inasmuch as Brutalism embraced an identifiable,Paragraph
"Palladian tendency, the Brutalist response to the New",Paragraph
Humanism of The Architectural Review was to assert the old,Paragraph
"Humanism, that had in any event always been latent in the",Paragraph
pre-war Modern Movement. The 1949 publication of Rudolf,Paragraph
Wittkower’s Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism,Title
had the unexpected effect of engaging the interest of the,Paragraph
rising generation in the methodology and aims of Palladio.,Paragraph
On another level the Brutalists responded to the challenge,Paragraph
of ‘people’s detailing’ by making a direct reference to the,Paragraph
"socio-anthropological roots of popular culture, while",Paragraph
rejecting outright the petit-bourgeois respectability of,Paragraph
Swedish empiricism. This anthropological aestheticism,Paragraph
(closely related as an impulse to the painter Jean Dubuffet’s,Paragraph
anti-art cult of art brut) brought the Smithsons into contact,Paragraph
in the early 1950s with the remarkable personalities of the,Paragraph
photographer Nigel Henderson and the sculptor Eduardo,Title
"Paolozzi, from both of whom Brutalism derived much of its",Paragraph
existential character.,Paragraph
The years 1951-54 were crucial to the architectural,Paragraph
formation of this sensibility. Already heavily involved with,Paragraph
the realization of their Palladian-cum-Miesian school [270],Caption
designed for Hunstanton in Norfolk in 1949 and completed,Caption
"some five years later, the Smithsons followed their early",Paragraph
success with a sequence of highly original competition,Paragraph
"entries - projects which, as Banham has remarked, can only",Paragraph
be seen as attempts to invent a totally ‘other’ kind of,Paragraph

"Coventry Cathedral of 1951 to their Golden Lane housing,",Paragraph
"London, of 1952, or their equally remarkable Sheffield",Paragraph
"University extension [271] of the following year. If anything,",Paragraph
"these projects are ‘Constructivist’ in their affinities, although",Paragraph
their restrained structural rhetoric seems in retrospect to,Paragraph
have been of Japanese rather than Russian persuasion. That,Paragraph
the failure to premiate any of these designs was a loss to,Paragraph
English architectural culture may be judged from the,Paragraph

erected in their place.,Paragraph

the cryptic element that transcended its Palladianism - first,Paragraph
came to public notice with the ‘Parallel of Life and Art’,Paragraph

"London, in 1953. This show comprised a didactic collection",Paragraph
"of photographs assembled and annotated by Henderson,",Paragraph

"arcane archaeological, anthropological and zoological",Title
"sources, many of these images ‘offered scenes of violence",Paragraph
"and distorted or anti-aesthetic views of the human figure,",Paragraph
and all had a coarse grainy texture which was clearly,Paragraph
regarded by the collaborators as one of their main virtues’.,Paragraph
There was something decidedly existential about an,Paragraph
exhibition that insisted on viewing the world as a landscape,Paragraph
"laid waste by war, decay and disease - beneath whose",Paragraph
"ashen layers one could still find traces of life, albeit",Paragraph
"microscopic, pulsating within the ruins. Henderson, writing",Caption
"of his work in this period, stated: ‘I feel happiest among",Paragraph
"discarded things, vituperative fragments, cast casually from",Paragraph
"life, with the fizz of vitality still about them. There is an irony",Paragraph
in this and it forms at least a partial symbol for an artist’s,Paragraph
activity.’,Paragraph
That this was the underlying motivation of Brutalism in,Paragraph

remarked:,Title
"One could not help feeling that this particular garden shed,",Paragraph

crystallized the domestic image of the Brutalist sensibility.,Paragraph
"The Smithsons’ ‘House of the Future’, exhibited at the Daily",Caption
"Mail |deal Home Exhibition in 1956, was evidently intended",Paragraph
as the ideal home for Hamilton’s muscle-bound ‘punch-bag’,Paragraph
natural man and his curvaceous companion.,Paragraph
Split between a sympathy for old-fashioned working-class,Paragraph
"solidarity and the promise of consumerism, the Smithsons",Title
were ensnared in the intrinsic ambivalence of an assumed,Paragraph
populism. Throughout the second half of the 1950s they,Paragraph
moved away from their initial sympathy for the lifestyle of,Paragraph
the proletariat towards more middle-class ideals that,Paragraph
depended for their appeal on both conspicuous consumption,Paragraph
"and mass ownership of the automobile. At the same time,",Paragraph
they remained far from sanguine about the evident potential,Paragraph
for such new-found ‘mobility’ to destroy both the structure,Paragraph
and the density of the traditional city. In their London Roads,Paragraph
Study of 1956 they attempted to resolve this dilemma by,Paragraph
projecting the elevated freeway as the new urban fix.,Paragraph
Meanwhile at a domestic scale they continued to regard the,Paragraph
chromium consumer product in the crumbling tenement or,Paragraph
the plastic interior as the ultimate liberating icon of their,Paragraph
conciliatory style.,Paragraph
Up to the mid-1950s truth to materials remained an,Paragraph
"essential precept of Brutalist architecture, manifesting itself",Paragraph
initially in an obsessive concern for the expressive,Paragraph
"articulation of mechanical and structural elements, as in the",Paragraph
"Smithsons’ Hunstanton school, and reasserting itself in a",Paragraph

as ‘the elementary activity of man intimately linked with,Paragraph

asserted that architecture was unavoidably contingent on,Paragraph
"the broader issues of politics and economics and that, far",Paragraph
from being removed from the realities of the industrialized,Paragraph
"world, it would have to depend for its general level of",Paragraph
quality not on craftsmen but on the universal adoption of,Paragraph

Hitchcock and Johnson were to argue for the pre-eminence,Paragraph
"of style as determined by technique, CIAM emphasized the",Paragraph

as it did so efficiency as a means for maximizing profit.,Paragraph
Instead it advocated the introduction of normative,Paragraph
dimensions and efficient production methods as a,Paragraph
preliminary step towards a rationalization of the building,Title

known as CIRPAC (Comité International pour la Résolution,Paragraph

primary task was to prepare themes for future congresses.,Paragraph
"The second stage of CIAM, lasting from 1933 to 1947,",Paragraph
"was dominated by the personality of Le Corbusier, who",Paragraph
consciously shifted the emphasis to town planning. CIAM IV,Paragraph
in 1933 was without doubt the most comprehensive,Paragraph
"congress from an urbanistic standpoint, by virtue of its",Paragraph
comparative analysis of thirty-four European towns. Out of it,Paragraph
"came the articles of the Athens Charter, which for",Paragraph
inexplicable reasons were not published until a decade later.,Paragraph
Reyner Banham characterized the achievements of this,Paragraph
"congress in 1963 in the following, rather critical terms:",Paragraph
CIAM IV - theme ‘The Functional City’ - took place in July,Paragraph
"and August 1933 aboard the S.S. Patris, in Athens, and in",Paragraph
Marseilles at the end of the voyage. It was the first of the,Paragraph
"‘romantic’ congresses, set against a background of scenic",Paragraph

first Congrés to be dominated by Le Corbusier and the,Paragraph
"French, rather than the tough German realists. The",Paragraph
Mediterranean cruise was Clearly a welcome relief from the,Paragraph
worsening situation of Europe and in this brief respite from,Paragraph
"reality the delegates produced the most Olympian,",Paragraph
"rhetorical, and ultimately destructive document to come out",Paragraph
of CIAM: the Athens Charter. The hundred and eleven,Caption
propositions that comprise the Charter consist in part of,Paragraph
"statements about the conditions of towns, and in part of",Paragraph
"proposals for the rectification of those conditions, grouped",Paragraph
"under five main headings: Dwellings, Recreation, Work,",Paragraph
"Transportation, and Historic Buildings.",Paragraph
"The tone remains dogmatic, but is also generalized and",Paragraph
less specifically related to immediate practical problems,Paragraph
than were the Frankfurt and Brussels reports. The,Paragraph
"generalization had its virtues, where it brought with ita",Paragraph
greater breadth of vision and insisted that cities could be,Paragraph
"considered only in relation to their surrounding regions, but",Paragraph
this persuasive generality which gives the Athens Charter its,Paragraph
air of universal applicability conceals a very narrow,Paragraph
conception of both architecture and town planning and,Paragraph
committed CIAM unequivocally to: (a) rigid functional zoning,Paragraph
"of city plans, with green belts between the areas reserved to",Paragraph
"the different functions, and (b) a single type of urban",Paragraph
"housing, expressed in the words of the Charter as ‘high,",Paragraph
widely-spaced apartment blocks wherever the necessity of,Paragraph
housing high density of population exists’. At a distance of,Paragraph
thirty years we recognize this as merely the expression of,Paragraph
"an aesthetic preference, but at the time it had the power of",Paragraph
a Mosaic commandment and effectively paralyzed research,Paragraph
into other forms of housing.,Paragraph
While the summary consensus of the Athens Charter may,Paragraph
well have served to inhibit any further examination of,Paragraph
"alternative housing models, the fact remains that there was",Paragraph
a noticeable shift in tone. The radical political demands of,Paragraph
the early movement had been dropped and while,Paragraph
"Functionalism remained the general credo, the articles of",Paragraph
"the Charter read like a neo-capitalist catechism, whose",Paragraph
edicts were as idealistically ‘rationalistic’ as they were,Paragraph
largely unrealizable. This idealistic approach acquired its,Paragraph
"pre-war formulation in the fifth congress, dedicated to the",Paragraph
theme of dwelling and leisure and held in Paris in 1937. On,Paragraph
this occasion CIAM was prepared to acknowledge not only,Paragraph
the impact of historical structures but also the influence of,Paragraph
the region in which the city happened to be situated.,Paragraph
"With the third and final stage of CIAM, liberal idealism",Paragraph
triumphed completely over the materialism of the early,Paragraph
"period. In 1947, at CIAM VI, held at Bridgwater in England,",Paragraph
CIAM attempted to transcend the abstract sterility of the,Paragraph
‘functional city’ by affirming that ‘the aim of CIAM is to work,Paragraph
for the creation of a physical environment that will satisfy,Paragraph
man’s emotional and material needs.’ This theme was,Paragraph
developed further under the auspices of the English MARS,Paragraph
"group which prepared the topic ‘The Core’, for CIAM VIII,",Paragraph
"held at Hoddesdon, England, in 1951. In choosing the theme",Paragraph
"‘The Heart of the City’, MARS caused the congress to",Paragraph
address itself to a topic that had already been broached by,Paragraph
"Sigfried Giedion, José Luis Sert and Fernand Léger in their",Paragraph
"manifesto of 1943, where they wrote: ‘The people want",Paragraph
buildings that represent their social and community life to,Paragraph
give more functional fulfilment. They want their aspiration,Paragraph
"for monumentality, joy, pride and excitement to be",Paragraph
satisfied.’,Paragraph
"For Giedion, as for Camillo Sitte, the ‘space of public",Paragraph
appearance’ was necessarily contingent on the monumental,Paragraph
counterform of the public institutions enclosing it and vice,Paragraph
"versa. Yet, despite their now manifest concern for the",Paragraph
"concrete qualities of place, the old guard of CIAM gave no",Paragraph
indication that they were capable of realistically appraising,Paragraph
the complexities of the post-war urban predicament; with,Paragraph
"the result that new affiliates, drawn from the younger",Paragraph
"generation, became increasingly disillusioned and restless.",Paragraph
The decisive split came with CIAM IX held at Aix-en-,Paragraph
"Provence in 1953, when this generation, led by Alison and",Paragraph
"Peter Smithson and Aldo van Eyck, challenged the four",Paragraph
"Functionalist categories of the Athens Charter: Dwelling,",Paragraph
"Work, Recreation and Transportation. Instead of proffering",Paragraph
"an alternative set of abstractions, the Smithsons, Van Eyck,",Paragraph
"Jacob Bakema, Georges Candilis, Shadrach Woods, John",Caption
"Voelcker, and William and Jill Howell searched for the",Paragraph
structural principles of urban growth and for the next,Title
significant unit above the family cell. Their dissatisfaction,Paragraph
with the modified Functionalism of the old guard - with the,Paragraph
"‘idealism’ of Le Corbusier, Van Eesteren, Sert, Ernesto",Caption
"Rogers, Alfred Roth, Kunio Mayekawa and Gropius - is",Paragraph
reflected in their critical reaction to the CIAM VIII report.,Paragraph
They responded to the simplistic model of the urban core by,Paragraph
"positing a more complex pattern that would be, in their",Paragraph
"view, more responsive to the need for identity. They wrote:",Paragraph
"Man may readily identify himself with his own hearth, but",Paragraph
not easily with the town within which it is placed.,Paragraph
‘Belonging’ is a basic emotional need - its associations are,Paragraph
of the simplest order. From ‘belonging’ - identity - comes,Paragraph
the enriching sense of neighbourliness. The short narrow,Paragraph
street of the slum succeeds where spacious redevelopment,Title
frequently fails.,Paragraph
In this singularly sharp paragraph they not only,Paragraph
"dismissed the Sittesque sentimentality of the old guard, but",Paragraph
also the rationalism of the ‘functional city’. Their critical,Paragraph
drive to find a more precise relation between physical form,Paragraph
and socio-psychological need became the subject matter for,Paragraph
"CIAM X, held at Dubrovnik in 1956 - the last CIAM meeting -",Paragraph
"for which this group, thereafter known as Team X, was",Paragraph
basically responsible. The official demise of CIAM and the,Paragraph
succession of Team X were confirmed in a further meeting,Paragraph
that took place in 1959 in the elegiac setting of Van de,Paragraph
Velde’s Museum at Otterloo with the old master in,Paragraph
attendance. But the essential epitaph of CIAM had already,Paragraph
"been written, in Le Corbusier’s letter to the Dubrovnik",Paragraph
"congress, when he stated:",Paragraph
"It is those who are now forty years old, born around 1916",Paragraph
"during wars and revolutions, and those then unborn, now",Paragraph

"actual problems, personally, profoundly, the goals to follow,",Paragraph
"the means to reach them, the pathetic urgency of the",Paragraph
present situation. They are in the know. Their predecessors,Paragraph
"no longer are, they are out, they are no longer subject to the",Paragraph
direct impact of the situation.*,Paragraph
"The peculiar London cultural climate of the mid-1950s,",Paragraph
"subject as it was to the influence of Parisian Existentialism,",Paragraph
not only decisively shaped the ethos of the British Brutalist,Paragraph
movement but also contributed to the Team X polemic with,Paragraph
which it was closely associated. In this respect credit must,Paragraph
"be given to the photographer Nigel Henderson, whose",Paragraph
photographs of London street life were exhibited by the,Paragraph
Smithsons at Aix-en-Provence and whose perception and,Paragraph
way of life played such a crucial role in shaping the,Paragraph
Smithsons’ sensibility. That this sensibility was ultimately at,Paragraph
odds with the tabula rasa implications of Le Corbusier’s,Paragraph
"CIAM Grid, which was still being propagated as late as 1952,",Paragraph
must in no small part be attributed to Henderson’s record of,Paragraph
the social and physical reality of London’s East End - his,Paragraph
photographs of community life in Bethnal Green. The,Caption
Smithsons regularly visited Henderson’s home in Bethnal,Paragraph
Green from 1950 onwards and it was from their first-hand,Paragraph
experience of the street life in the area (now obliterated by,Paragraph
the high-rise housing blocks of the Welfare State) that they,Paragraph
drew their first notions of identity and association. Thus the,Paragraph
"Bye-Law Street, albeit distorted by their own rationalization,",Paragraph
became the conceptual ‘armature’ for their Golden Lane,Paragraph
housing proposal of 1952.,Paragraph
For all its resemblance to Le Corbusier’s ‘llot Insalubre’,Paragraph
"project of 1937, Golden Lane was clearly intended as a",Paragraph
critique of the Ville Radieuse and of the zoning of the four,Paragraph
"functions of the city into Dwelling, Work, Recreation and",Paragraph
Transportation. The Smithsons opposed these functions with,Paragraph
"the more phenomenological categories of House, Street,",Paragraph
"District and City, although what they meant by these terms",Paragraph
grew vaguer as the scale increased. The house in their,Paragraph
Golden Lane project was clearly the family unit; the street,Paragraph
was evidently a system of one-sided gallery access of,Paragraph
"generous width, elevated into the air. The district and the",Paragraph
city were understandably and realistically regarded as,Paragraph
variable domains that lay outside the bounds of physical,Paragraph
definition.,Paragraph
"Yet, while remaining opposed to the pre-war determinism",Paragraph
"of the ‘functional city’, the Smithsons in their Golden Lane",Paragraph
proposal became caught in a rationalization process,Paragraph
comparable to that of CIAM. For all that the ‘yards’ in their,Paragraph
Golden Lane scheme were indicated as adjunct areas to the,Paragraph
"streets, it was clear that the ‘house in the air’ did not have a",Paragraph
yard that was in any way akin to the backyard of the Bye-,Paragraph
"Law Street and that the street itself, now divorced from the",Paragraph
"ground, could no longer accommodate community life.",Paragraph
"Above all, its one-sided nature had only the capacity to",Paragraph
stress the linearity of the route rather than engender a,Paragraph
sense of place. The presence of life on both sides of the,Paragraph
Bye-Law Street had clearly been responsible for its social,Paragraph
vitality (as an early sketch by the Smithsons would,Paragraph
"indicate), but the nature of Golden Lane - high density on a",Paragraph
small site - and the Smithsons’ own acceptance of,Paragraph
Functionalist norms precluded a solution that could have,Paragraph
sustained such a life.,Paragraph
From their postulation of this housing pattern as a,Paragraph
"prototypical solution, one must conclude that the Smithsons",Paragraph
were largely unaware of these contradictions: they,Paragraph
"proceeded to show their Golden Lane scheme, repeated ad",Paragraph
"infinitum over the metropolitan area, as though it were the",Paragraph
manifest critical alternative to Le Corbusier’s Ville Radieuse.,Paragraph
"And while its random, ‘twig-like’ distribution could no doubt",Paragraph
be taken as a polemic against wholesale demolition and as,Paragraph
"an argument in favour of piecemeal development, their",Paragraph
collage of the Golden Lane prototype as a phantom,Paragraph
"axonometric, apparently erecting itself amid the ruins of",Paragraph
"Coventry, returned its authors to the central dilemma of",Paragraph
"CIAM. As imposed on blitzed Coventry [277], Golden Lane",Paragraph
appeared to be as much against the continuity of the,Paragraph
existing city as the Haussmann-like projections of Le,Paragraph
Corbusier’s Plan Voisin of 1925. The axonometric depicted,Paragraph
the ‘edge conditions’ between the old street pattern and the,Paragraph
new work as a series of inevitable collisions. After the,Paragraph
building-out of the Golden Lane concept in 1961 at Park Hill,Paragraph
"in Sheffield [278], to the design of Jack Lynn and Ivor Smith,",Paragraph
"it became obvious that aside from the perimeter block form,",Paragraph
"such as had been realized by Brinkman at Spangen,",Paragraph
"Rotterdam, in 1919 (a scheme well known to the",Paragraph
"Smithsons), there was little possibility of achieving any",Paragraph
continuity between decks in the air and streets on the,Paragraph
ground.,Paragraph
"277 Alison and Peter Smithson, Golden Lane Housing system applied to central",Caption
Coventry. (The parish church and ruined cathedral are on the left.),Caption
"278 Lynn and Smith, Park Hill, Sheffield, 1961.",Caption
For all that Team X were committed to the multilevel city,Paragraph
- an idea stemming via Le Corbusier from Hénard’s visions,Paragraph
of 1910 - it was to the Smithsons’ credit that they remained,Paragraph
conscious of its limitations and in consequence produced,Paragraph
"one of the most critical sketches of their early career,",Paragraph
namely a drawing which demonstrated that above the sixth,Paragraph
floor one lost all contact with the ground. While the,Paragraph
Smithsons were to use this sketch as a way of justifying a,Paragraph
"megastructural approach, their recognition of tree height as",Paragraph
an experiential limit may well have exerted an influence in,Paragraph
"the 1960s on the general adoption of ‘low rise, high density’",Paragraph
as the preferred policy for family residential development.,Paragraph
This critical awareness was amplified at the time by the,Paragraph
Smithsons’ own village-infill projects of the mid-1950s -,Paragraph
"their ‘close’ and ‘fold’ houses - and by their insistence,",Paragraph
following the ‘ecological’ argument of their Doom Manifesto,Paragraph
"of 1954, that ‘habitat should be integrated into the",Paragraph
landscape rather than isolated as an object within it’.,Paragraph
The sociocultural challenge of Bethnal Green was largely,Paragraph
"lost on Bakema, despite the anti-Functionalism of his",Paragraph
pronouncements in the early 1940s. He was the one,Paragraph
member of Team X whose practice was hardly to deviate,Paragraph
from the site planning principles of the Neue Sachlichkeit -,Paragraph
the row-house principle of open-ended blocks of identical,Paragraph
height an optimum distance apart. Bakema’s constant point,Paragraph
of reference was clearly the Amsterdam South Plan of 1934,Paragraph
and the pre-war work of Dutch Functionalists such as,Paragraph
"Merkelbach, Karsten and Stam. All the same, in the Opbouw",Caption
studies for Pendrecht (1949-51) and for Alexander Polder,Paragraph
"(1953-56), in all of which Bakema participated, there was a",Paragraph
move away from the rigid principle of blocks of uniform,Paragraph
"height and orientation to a more modulated layout,",Paragraph
"comprising ‘swastika’ formations, grouped into",Paragraph
"‘neighbourhoods’ about clusters of public facilities,",Paragraph
"swimming pools, schools, etc.",Paragraph
"The Kennermerland project, designed by Bakema in",Paragraph
collaboration with J.M. Stokla and submitted to the Otterlo,Paragraph
"Congress of 1959, was a culmination of this research work,",Paragraph
as Bakema admitted when challenged by Kenzo Tange as to,Paragraph
the origin of the proposal. Yet it says something for the,Paragraph
confusion of the time that both Tange and Bakema should,Paragraph
"insist on Corbusian rationalism as its point of departure, for",Paragraph
clearly Kennermerland stemmed from the abstract,Paragraph
‘neighbourhood’ concept first developed by German,Paragraph
planners such as Ernst May and Arthur Korn. Even as late as,Paragraph
"the early 1960s, Bakema was still proposing an extremely",Paragraph
hierarchized form of neighbourhood planning as had first,Paragraph
appeared in Korn’s MARS plan for London of 1942.,Paragraph
Bakema did not truly come under Le Corbusier’s,Paragraph
"influence until his Tel Aviv proposal of 1963 [279], when he",Paragraph
used the megastructural Obus block projected for Algiers in,Paragraph
1931 (fig. 175) as a means for giving order to the dispersed,Paragraph
"form of the city. Paradoxically, this continuous superblock in",Paragraph
no way served to liberate Bakema from his deterministic,Paragraph
"tendencies, for while the fiction of the neighbourhood unit",Paragraph
"was given less importance, its structuring function was",Paragraph
"replaced by megaforms that either cut across topography,",Paragraph
"as in the case of his 1962 entry for Bochum University, or",Paragraph
"alternatively, as in Tel Aviv, paralleled the trajectory of a",Paragraph
freeway spine running through the city.,Paragraph
"279 Bakema and Van den Broek, project for megastructural blocks in Tel Aviv,",Caption
1963.,Paragraph
It is one of the paradoxes of Team X that Bakema,Paragraph
proposed the megabuilding as the psychological ‘fix’ for the,Paragraph
megalopolitan landscape just when the Smithsons had,Paragraph
begun to entertain doubts as to the viability of such,Paragraph
"structures. The Smithsons’ ‘open city’ thesis, influenced by",Paragraph
"the urbanistic concepts of Louis Kahn, was first broached",Paragraph
after their initial visit to the States in 1958. In that year they,Paragraph

for the Hauptstadt district of Berlin. In this scheme,Paragraph
(strangely similar to that of Scharoun) they posited the,Paragraph
notion of the permanently ‘ruined’ city - ruined in the sense,Paragraph
that accelerated movement and change in the 20th century,Paragraph
were incapable of relating to the pattern of any pre-existing,Paragraph
fabric.,Paragraph
While both Bakema and the Smithsons were preoccupied,Paragraph
with the notion of ‘urban fix’ - with the sense of place to be,Paragraph
established by architecture within the ‘space endlessness’,Paragraph
"of Motopia - the Smithsons, rather than continuing to",Paragraph
"advocate the megastructure, opted for localized traffic-free",Paragraph
"enclaves, be they the elevated podiums of their Hauptstadt",Paragraph
"scheme [280, 281] or the Schinkelesque Paradep/atzen of",Paragraph
"their Mehringplatz proposal of 1962. Either way round, both",Paragraph
"Bakema and the Smithsons were, by this date, obsessed",Paragraph
"with the liberating promise of mass mobility, whose",Paragraph
achievement they wanted to celebrate with an appropriate,Paragraph
architectural counterform.,Paragraph

"1958. Above, southern portion of pedestrian net, showing the growth of",Caption
"causeways above the old street grid; be/ow, escalator access to shopping level",Paragraph
and roof.,Paragraph
Of the various strategies proffered for dealing with this,Paragraph
"phenomenon, those of the Smithsons seem to have been",Paragraph
"the more feasible, and this is reflected in the partial",Paragraph
realization of both their Hauptstadt and Mehringplatz,Paragraph
"prototypes - the one in their Economist office complex,",Paragraph
"London, of 1965, and the other in their Robin Hood Gardens",Paragraph
"housing, London, of 1969. Yet the sterile conditions imposed",Paragraph
"by these developments, particularly in the case of Robin",Paragraph
"Hood Gardens, which was as isolated from its urban context",Paragraph
"as the towers of any ‘functional city’, would suggest that the",Paragraph
Smithsons had yet to come to terms with the urban,Paragraph
consequences of their ‘landcastle’ approach.,Paragraph
The essential pluralism of Team X found a direct,Paragraph
reflection in the very different approach of Aldo van Eyck,Title
whose entire career was devoted to evolving a ‘place form’,Paragraph
which would be appropriate to the second half of the 20th,Paragraph
century. From the very outset Van Eyck addressed himself to,Paragraph
issues which the majority of Team X would have preferred to,Paragraph
"have left unformulated, and where Team X kept its initial",Paragraph
buoyancy through a naive optimism Van Eyck was,Paragraph
motivated by a critical impulse which verged on the,Paragraph
pessimistic. No other Team X member seems to have been,Paragraph
prepared to attack the alienating abstraction of modern,Paragraph
"architecture at its roots, possibly because no one else had",Paragraph
had the benefit of Van Eyck’s ‘anthropological’ experience.,Paragraph
"His personal preoccupation with ‘primitive’ cultures, and",Paragraph
with the timeless aspects of built form that such cultures,Paragraph
"invariably reveal, dated from the early 1940s, so that by the",Paragraph
time he joined Team X he had already developed a unique,Paragraph
"position. His statement at the Otterlo Congress of 1959, in",Paragraph
"which he declared his concern for the timelessness of man,",Paragraph
was almost as foreign to the mainstream of Team X thought,Paragraph
as it was to the ideology of CIAM:,Paragraph
Man is always and everywhere essentially the same. He has,Paragraph
the same mental equipment though he uses it differently,Paragraph
"according to his cultural or social background, according to",Paragraph
the particular life pattern of which he happens to be a part.,Paragraph
Modern architects have been harping continually on what is,Paragraph
different in our time to such an extent that even they have,Paragraph
"lost touch with what is not different, with what is always",Paragraph
essentially the same.*,Paragraph
"Van Eyck’s concern for transition, for the amplification of",Paragraph
the ‘threshold’ so as to mediate symbolically between such,Paragraph
universal twin phenomena as ‘inside versus outside’ and,Paragraph
"‘house versus city’, was to make itself manifest in his own",Paragraph
"work of the late 1950s, most particularly in his children’s",Paragraph
home in Amsterdam which was then nearing completion. In,Paragraph
this school Van Eyck demonstrated his notion of,Paragraph
‘labyrinthine clarity’ (see pp. 334-35) through an,Paragraph
"interconnected sequence of domed ‘family’ units, all united",Paragraph
under a continuous roof.,Paragraph
"By 1966, however, that which had been the cause for",Paragraph
enthusiasm became the occasion for despair. Five years of,Paragraph
intense urban development had been enough to convince,Paragraph
"Van Eyck that the architectural profession, if not Western",Paragraph
"man as a whole, had so far proved incapable of developing",Paragraph
either an aesthetic or a strategy for dealing with the urban,Paragraph
realities of mass society. Van Eyck stated: ‘We know nothing,Paragraph
of vast multiplicity - we cannot come to grips with it - not as,Paragraph
"architects, planners or anybody else.’ Elsewhere Van Eyck",Paragraph
characterized this predicament in terms of the cultural void,Paragraph
left by the loss of the vernacular. In his various writings of,Paragraph
"the period, he pointed to the role played by modern",Paragraph
architecture in the eradication of both style and place. He,Paragraph
argued that post-war Dutch planning had produced nothing,Paragraph
save the organized uninhabitable nowhere of the ‘functional,Title
city’. His doubts as to the ability of the profession to meet,Paragraph
"the pluralistic demands of society, without the mediation of",Paragraph
"a vernacular, led him to question the authenticity of the",Paragraph
society itself. In 1966 he asked: ‘If society has no form - how,Paragraph
can architects build its counterform?’,Paragraph
"By 1963, Team X had already passed beyond the stage of",Paragraph
"fertile exchange and collaboration, a transformation that",Paragraph
was intuitively acknowledged by the Smithsons in their 1962,Paragraph
"publication of the 7eam X Primer. From now on, Team X",Paragraph
"would continue as a movement in name only, since what",Paragraph
there had been to achieve through a creative critique of,Paragraph
"CIAM had already been attained. Little more, in fact, was",Paragraph
now to be accomplished in the way of critical,Paragraph
"reinterpretation, save possibly for the work of two men who",Paragraph
"had hitherto remained somewhat to one side - an American,",Paragraph
"Shadrach Woods, and an Italian, Giancarlo de Carlo.",Paragraph
The new departure made by Woods in his Frankfurt-,Paragraph
ROmerberg competition entry of 1963 [282] was a direct,Paragraph
response to Van Eyck’s appeal for ‘labyrinthine clarity’: for,Paragraph
what was being proffered in the Frankfurt proposal was a,Paragraph
‘city in miniature’. In the place of the medieval centre,Caption
"destroyed in the Second World War, Woods, in collaboration",Paragraph
"with Manfred Schiedhelm, proposed an equally labyrinthine",Paragraph
"configuration of shops, public spaces, offices and dwellings,",Paragraph
the whole being served by a double-decked basement,Paragraph
containing service and parking. If Frankfurt was an urban,Paragraph
"‘event’, it was certainly conceived in different terms from",Paragraph
"those of the Smithsons or Bakema, for while presenting an",Paragraph
orthogonal counterform in opposition to the medieval form,Paragraph
"of the city, it also embodied a three-dimensional ‘loft’",Paragraph
"system, served by escalators, whose interstices could be",Paragraph
occupied according to demand. That this concept had been,Paragraph
anticipated by the infrastructures of Yona Friedman’s,Paragraph
L’Architecture mobile of 1958 in no way detracted from the,Paragraph
magnitude of Wood’s achievement.,Paragraph
"282 Candilis, Josic and Woods, project for Frankfurt-R6merberg, 1963. Model.",Caption
(Designers: Woods and Schiedhelm.),Caption
"Frankfurt-Ré6merberg, although it remained a project, was",Paragraph
without doubt the greatest accomplishment of Woods’s,Paragraph
career and is probably one of the most important prototypes,Paragraph
developed by Team X. In relating to the context of an,Paragraph
existing city and refusing the escapism of both ‘functional’,Paragraph
"and ‘open’ city models, it endeavoured to put the",Paragraph
automobile in its place and to continue the tradition of,Paragraph
urban culture.,Paragraph
That this Frankfurt scheme as built out in the Free,Paragraph
"University of Berlin in 1973 [283, 284] lost much of its",Paragraph
conviction stems largely from the absence of an urban,Paragraph
context. In Berlin-Dahlem it was deprived of that urban,Paragraph
culture for which it had been conceived and to which it,Paragraph
would have responded had it been built in Frankfurt.,Paragraph
However much a university may function like a city in,Paragraph
"microcosm, it cannot generate the animated diversity of the",Paragraph
"city proper. Aside from this, Frankfurt’s flexibility in terms of",Paragraph
Space was replaced in Berlin by an idealization of flexibility,Paragraph
in terms of technique - by the ‘poetic’ but somewhat,Paragraph
unserviceable detailing of Jean Prouvé’s modular clip-on,Paragraph
facade of Corten steel.,Caption

and ground plan of first phase.,Paragraph

"steel cladding system, detailed by Prouvé.",Caption
"In 1964, the implicit ideology of Woods’s Frankfurt",Paragraph
scheme found its complement in De Carlo’s plan for Urbino.,Paragraph
"This plan, preceded by an exhaustive topographical study,",Paragraph
devotes more space to the tactics of preservation and,Paragraph
rehabilitation than to the accommodation of new,Paragraph
"development. With De Carlo’s Urbino, Team X finally arrived",Paragraph
at the complete antithesis to the Cartesian projections of,Paragraph
the Ville Radieuse. De Carlo’s concern for the reuse of,Paragraph
existing stock wherever possible has been confirmed as a,Paragraph
"policy by recent housing studies, which have shown",Paragraph
"conclusively that, despite the higher densities usually",Paragraph
"attained, it may take as long as fifty years for new housing",Paragraph
to compensate for the statistical ‘housing loss’ incurred,Paragraph
through the time spent in demolition and construction.,Paragraph
Considerations such as these finally had the effect of,Paragraph
precipitating Team X into a realm that it had always,Paragraph
"strenously avoided, namely politics. Never was this shift in",Paragraph
consciousness more manifest than at the Milan Triennale of,Paragraph
"1968 when Woods, in sympathy with student radicals,",Paragraph
assisted in the removal of his own work. Only one year,Paragraph
"before, he had written:",Paragraph
What are we waiting for? To read the news about a new,Paragraph
"armed attack with even more esoteric weapons, news which",Paragraph
comes to us through the air captured by our marvellous,Paragraph
"transistorized instruments, somewhere deep in our more",Paragraph
and more savaged dwellings? Our weapons become more,Paragraph
sophisticated; our houses more and more brutish. Is that the,Paragraph
balance sheet for the richest civilization since time began?,Paragraph
This same theme was taken up by De Carlo in 1968 when,Paragraph
he wrote his synoptic analysis of the ideological,Paragraph
"development of modern architecture, under the title",Paragraph
"Legitimizing Architecture, wherein he reviewed the",Paragraph
consequences of the CIAM Declaration of 1928:,Title
"Today, forty years after the Congress, we find that those",Paragraph
proposals have become houses and neighbourhoods and,Paragraph
"suburbs and then entire cities, palpable manifestations of an",Paragraph
abuse perpetrated first on the poor and then even on the,Paragraph
not-so-poor: cultural alibis for the most ferocious economic,Title
speculation and the most obtuse political inefficiency. And,Paragraph
yet those ‘whys’ so nonchalantly forgotten in Frankfurt still,Paragraph
have trouble coming openly to the surface. At the same,Paragraph
"time, we have a right to ask ‘why’ housing should be as",Paragraph
"cheap as possible and not, for example, rather expensive;",Paragraph
‘why’ instead of making every effort to reduce it to,Paragraph
"minimum levels of surface, of thickness, of materials, we",Paragraph
"should not try to make it spacious, protected, isolated,",Paragraph
"comfortable, well equipped, rich in opportunities for privacy,",Paragraph
"communication, exchange, personal creativity. No one, in",Paragraph
"fact, can be satisfied by an answer which appeals to the",Paragraph
"scarcity of available resources, when we all know how much",Paragraph
"is spent on wars, on the construction of missiles and anti-",Paragraph
"ballistic systems, on moon projects, on research for the",Paragraph
defoliation of forests inhabited by partisans and for the,Paragraph
paralyzation of the demonstrators emerging from the,Paragraph
"ghettos, on hidden persuasion, on the invention of artificial",Paragraph
"needs, etc.®",Paragraph
"For De Carlo, the students’ revolt of 1968 was not only a",Paragraph
necessary culmination of the crisis in architectural,Paragraph
"education, but also a reflection of the deeper and more",Paragraph
significant dysfunctions of architectural practice and theory,Title
- the latter often serving to mystify the true network of,Paragraph
power and exploitation permeating the entire society. As an,Paragraph
"example of this, De Carlo cited the proceedings of CIAM VIII,",Paragraph
whose sentimental deliberations on ‘The Heart of the City’,Paragraph
were largely responsible for the ideology with which the,Paragraph
"traditional city core was subsequently raped (an ironic, if not",Paragraph
"cynical, procedure that did not gain its full momentum until",Paragraph
"a decade later). As De Carlo argued, the Newspeak",Paragraph
overtones of this venture were not entirely lost on the critics,Paragraph
"of Western society, who came to regard the process of",Paragraph
urban renewal as a euphemism for the dislocation of the,Paragraph
poor.,Paragraph
In the mid-1960s this point still largely escaped most,Paragraph
"Team X members who, with the exception of Van Eyck,",Paragraph
"Woods and De Carlo, seemed to prefer to ignore the",Paragraph
destruction of our urban heritage in the name of,Paragraph
speculation. The postulative capacities of Team X became,Paragraph
"paralyzed at this juncture, their inventive energies",Paragraph
becoming depleted in the face of an impossible situation.,Paragraph

No account of recent developments in architecture can fail,Paragraph
to mention the ambivalent role that the profession has,Paragraph
played since the mid-1960s - ambivalent not only in the,Paragraph
sense that while professing to act in the public interest it,Paragraph
has sometimes assisted uncritically in furthering the domain,Paragraph
"of an optimized technology, but also in the sense that many",Paragraph
of its more intelligent members have abandoned traditional,Paragraph
"practice, either to resort to direct social action or to indulge",Paragraph
in the projection of architecture as a form of art. As far as,Paragraph
"this last aspect is concerned, one cannot help regarding it",Paragraph
"as the return of a repressed creativity, as the implosion of",Paragraph
utopia upon itself. Architects have of course indulged in,Paragraph
"such unrealizable projections before but, with the classic",Paragraph
"exception of Piranesi or, more recently, the phantasmagoria",Paragraph
"of Bruno Taut’s Glass Chain, rarely have they projected their",Paragraph
images in such inaccessible terms. Both before and after the,Paragraph
trauma of the First World War the positive aspirations of the,Paragraph
Enlightenment still had the power to carry a certain,Paragraph
"conviction. Before that, at the threshold of the 19th century,",Paragraph
"even the most grandiose of Boullée’s visions could, one",Paragraph
"imagines, have been built had sufficient resources been",Paragraph
"made available, and clearly Ledoux was as much a builder",Paragraph
as he was a visionary. What was true of Ledoux was,Paragraph
"certainly no less true of Le Corbusier, whose vast urban",Paragraph
projections could no doubt all have been realized had,Paragraph
sufficient power been placed at his disposal. The 412-metre,Paragraph
"(1,350-foot) World Trade Center, New York, a framed tube",Caption

"Merrill, both served to demonstrate that possibly not even",Paragraph
"Wright’s 1,600-metre-high (1-mile) skyscraper of 1956 was",Paragraph
necessarily unfeasible. But such megabuildings are too,Paragraph
exceptional to serve as a model for general practice.,Paragraph
"Meanwhile, as Manfredo Tafuri has suggested, the aim of the",Paragraph
latter-day avant garde is either to validate itself through the,Paragraph
"media or, alternatively, to redeem its guilt by executing the",Paragraph
rite of creative exorcism in isolation. The extent to which,Paragraph
this last may serve as a Subversive tactic (Archigram’s,Paragraph
‘injecting noise into the system’) or as an elaborate,Paragraph
metaphor with critical implications depends of course on the,Paragraph
complexity of ideas involved and on the intent underlying,Paragraph
the whole enterprise.,Paragraph
"In the case of the English Archigram group, who began to",Paragraph
project Neo-Futurist images just before the first issue of,Paragraph
"their magazine Archigram in 1961, it is obvious that their",Paragraph
attitude was closely tied to the technocratic ideology of the,Paragraph
American designer Buckminster Fuller and to that of his,Paragraph
British apologists John McHale and Reyner Banham. By,Paragraph
"1960, at McHale’s suggestion, Banham had already",Paragraph
earmarked Fuller as the redeeming white knight of the,Paragraph
"future, in the last chapter of his book Theory and Design in",Paragraph
the First Machine Age. Archigram’s subsequent commitment,Paragraph
"to a ‘high-tech’, lightweight, infrastructural approach (the",Paragraph
kind of indeterminacy implicit in the work of Fuller and even,Paragraph
more evident in Yona Friedman's L’Architecture mobile of,Paragraph
"1958) brought them, rather paradoxically, to indulge in",Paragraph
"ironic forms of science fiction, rather than to project",Paragraph
solutions that were either truly indeterminate or capable of,Paragraph
being realized and appropriated by society. It is this more,Paragraph
than anything else that distinguishes them from that other,Paragraph
"prominent Fuller disciple on the British scene, Cedric Price,",Paragraph
whose Fun Palace of 1961 and Potteries Thinkbelt of 1964,Title
"were nothing if not realizable and, in theory at least, both",Paragraph
"indeterminate and capable, respectively, of meeting an",Paragraph
evident demand for popular entertainment and a readily,Paragraph
accessible system of higher education.,Paragraph
Aside from a certain subversive eroticism (the,Paragraph
biologically functionalist parody evident say in Michael,Title
Webb's ‘Sin Centre’ of 1962 [285]) Archigram was more,Paragraph
interested in the seductive appeal of space-age imagery,Paragraph
"and, after Fuller, in the Armageddon overtones of survival",Paragraph
technology than in the processes of production or the,Paragraph
relevance of such sophisticated technique to the tasks of,Paragraph
"the moment. For all their surface irony, Ron Herron’s",Paragraph
‘Walking Cities’ of 1964 [286] were clearly projected as,Paragraph
stalking across a ruined world in the aftermath of a nuclear,Paragraph
war. Like Howard Hughes’s ‘Glomar Explorer’ they suggest,Paragraph
"some sort of nightmarish salvation, rescuing both men and",Paragraph
artefacts after a cataclysmic disaster. These leviathans may,Paragraph
be regarded as parallelling Fuller’s 1962 proposal to erect a,Paragraph
giant dome over the whole of midtown Manhattan [287].,Caption
This urban iron lung was projected as a geodesic smog,Paragraph
"shield, a device which could no doubt be made to double as",Paragraph
a fallout shelter in the unlikely event of a nuclear near-miss.,Paragraph
"With comparable nonchalance, Archigram saw no reason to",Paragraph
concern themselves with the social and ecological,Paragraph
"consequences of their various megastructural proposals, of",Paragraph
which Peter Cook’s ‘Plug-In City’ of 1964 was a typical,Paragraph
"example. Similarly, in their obsession with suspended",Paragraph
"space-age capsules, Dennis Crompton, Michael Webb,",Caption
Warren Chalk and David Greene felt under no obligation to,Paragraph
explain why one might choose to live in such expensive and,Paragraph
sophisticated hardware and yet at the same time in brutally,Paragraph
cramped conditions. Like Banham acting out the narcissistic,Paragraph
"gestures of Vishnu in his solipsistic, inflatable bubble,",Paragraph
equipped with high fidelity and presumably other,Paragraph
conveniences (in homage probably to the philistine ethos of,Paragraph
"Fuller’s ironic lyric ‘Roam Home to a Dome’: see p. 273),",Paragraph
they all proposed space standards that were well below the,Paragraph
Existenzminimum established by those pre-war,Paragraph
functionalists they supposedly despised.,Paragraph

If anything was destined to reduce architecture ‘to the,Paragraph
level of the activities of certain species of insects and,Paragraph
mammals’ - to quote Berthold Lubetkin’s 1956 attack on the,Paragraph
reductivism of Soviet Constructivist architects (his target,Title
was Ginzburg’s OSA group) - it was surely these residential,Paragraph
cells projected by Archigram. Modelled on Fuller’s Dymaxion,Caption
House of 1927 or on his Dymaxion Bathroom of a decade,Paragraph
"later (see p. 273), these units aspired to being ‘autonomous",Paragraph
"packages’, in the sense that they were designed chiefly for",Paragraph
individuals or couples. Although this preoccupation with the,Paragraph
childless unit may have been an implicit critique of the,Paragraph
"bourgeois family, the ultimate stance of Archigram was",Paragraph
"hardly critical, as the following passage from Peter Cook’s",Paragraph
Architecture: Action and Plan of 1967 makes evident:,Paragraph
it will often be part of the architect’s brief to investigate the,Paragraph
‘possibilities’ of a site ... in other words to use the ingenuity,Paragraph
of the architectural concept to exploit the maximum profit,Paragraph
from a piece of land. In the past this would have been,Paragraph
considered an immoral use of the talents of an artist. It is,Paragraph
now simply part of the sophistication of the whole,Paragraph
environmental and building process in which finance can be,Paragraph
made into a creative element of the design.?,Paragraph
The work of Archigram was surprisingly close to that of,Paragraph
"the Japanese Metabolists, who, reacting to the pressures of",Paragraph
"Japanese overcrowding, started in the late 1950s to propose",Paragraph
constantly growing and adapting ‘plug-in’ megastructures,Paragraph
"where the living cells, as in the work of Noriaki Kurokawa,",Paragraph
would be reduced to prefabricated pods clipped on to vast,Paragraph
"helicoidal skyscrapers. Alternatively, as in the projects of",Paragraph
"Kiyonori Kikutake [288], they would be attached like limpets",Paragraph
to the inner and outer surfaces of large cylinders floating in,Paragraph
or on the sea. Kikutake’s floating cities are surely among the,Paragraph
"most poetic visions of the Metabolist movement. Yet,",Paragraph
despite the proliferation of offshore drilling rigs with their,Paragraph
"working complement dedicated to the extraction of energy,",Paragraph
Kikutake’s marine cities seem even more remote and,Paragraph
inapplicable to everyday life than the megastructures of,Paragraph
Archigram. It testifies to the rhetorical avant gardism of the,Paragraph
movement that most of the Metabolists went on to establish,Paragraph
rather conventional practices. With the exception of,Paragraph
Kikutake’s Sky House of 1958 and Kurokawa’s Nagakin,Title
"bachelor capsule tower [289], built in the Ginza, Tokyo, in",Caption
"1971 (see Kurokawa’s capsule apartments of 1962), very",Paragraph
few Metabolic concepts were realized. Although such frantic,Paragraph
futurism is to be distinguished from the intelligent additive,Paragraph
urban form proposals advanced by such moderates as,Paragraph
"Fumihiko Maki and Masato Otaka, Gunther Nitschke had this",Paragraph
to say when making an assessment of the Metabolist,Paragraph
movement in 1966:,Title

"289 Kurokawa, Nakagin capsule tower, Tokyo, 1971.",Caption
"As long as the actual buildings get heavier, harder, more",Paragraph
"and more monstrous in scale, as long as architecture is",Paragraph
"taken as a means of expression of power, be it of oneself or",Paragraph
"of any kind of vulgar institution, which should be serving not",Paragraph
"ruling in society, the talk of greater flexibility and change-",Paragraph
loving structures is just fuss. Comparing this structure [Akira,Paragraph
Shibuya’s Metabolic City project of 1966] with any one of,Paragraph
the traditional Japanese structures or modern methods,Title
"suggested by Wachsmann, Fuller, or Ekuan in Japan, it must",Paragraph
"be considered a mere anachronism, a thousand years out of",Paragraph
"date, or to say the least, not an advance of modern",Paragraph
architecture in terms of theory and practice.,Paragraph
The decline of the Metabolist vision in Japan came with,Paragraph
the evident ideological emptiness of the Osaka Exhibition of,Paragraph
1970. Thereafter the critical lead in Japanese architecture,Paragraph
passed from the older Metabolists to the members of the so-,Paragraph
"called Japanese New Wave, whose work became known",Paragraph
largely through the support of two architects of the middle,Paragraph
"generation, Arata Ilsozaki and Kazuo Shinohara. While",Paragraph
Shinohara’s work has remained almost exclusively,Paragraph
"domestic, Isozaki’s stature stems from his double",Paragraph
"reputation, first as a critical intellectual and second as a",Paragraph
public architect whose independent career began with the,Paragraph
"Oita branch of the Fukuoka Sogo Bank, built in Kyushu in",Paragraph
1966. This successful work led to a whole series of major,Paragraph
"public structures, including the Gunma Prefectural Museum,",Paragraph
"Takasaki [290], dating from 1974.",Caption
"290 Isozaki, Gunma Prefectural Museum of Fine Arts, Takasaki, 1974.",Caption
Isozaki came to the fore internationally in 1968 when he,Paragraph
contributed a critical exhibit entitled ‘Electric Labyrinth’ to,Paragraph
the 14th Triennale in Milan. Conceived as a multimedia,Paragraph
presentation of the apocalyptic significance of the Hiroshima,Title
"disaster, this tour de force comprising randomly operated",Paragraph
pivoting screens and back-projected images established,Paragraph
Isozaki’s standing with the European avant garde. The Milan,Paragraph
Triennale brought him into contact with Archigram and Hans,Paragraph
"Hollein, and thereafter his work displayed certain aspects of",Paragraph
these influences. From Archigram he took the ‘high-tech’,Paragraph
exuberance of his robot designed for Kenzo Tange’s Festival,Caption
"Plaza in the Osaka Exhibition of 1970; from Hollein, his taste",Paragraph
for mixing materials with high crafted objects and ironic,Paragraph
"artistic images, the latter first appearing in the Fukuoka",Paragraph
Sogo Bank headquarters in Kitakyushu (1968-71). Apart,Paragraph
"from his penchant for elaborate interior finishes, Isozaki was",Paragraph
"inspired, like Kahn, by the architecture parlante of Ledoux.",Paragraph
Taking Ledoux’s emblematic Neoplatonic geometry as his,Paragraph
"point of departure, Isozaki pursued a gridded high-tech",Paragraph
architecture in a series of branch banks designed in the,Paragraph
"early 1970s, culminating in the magnum opus of the Gunma",Paragraph
"Museum. With this miragelike, scintillating architecture",Paragraph
Isozaki attempted to compensate for the loss of the,Paragraph
"traditional Japanese ‘space of darkness’ - the dimly lit,",Paragraph
recessive domestic interior which Junichiro Tanizaki had,Paragraph
"been among the first to lament, in his essay ‘In Praise of",Paragraph
Shadows’ (1933). Sympathetic with Tanizaki’s evaluation of,Paragraph
the underlit interiors of traditional Japanese buildings but,Paragraph
unable to accept the reactionary implications of his cultural,Paragraph
"nostalgia, Isozaki attempted to evolve a modern equivalent",Paragraph
for this traditional illusionistic space. This development,Paragraph
"reached its peak in the Nagamsami Home Bank (1971), of",Paragraph
which he wrote:,Paragraph
This building has almost no form; it is merely a gray,Paragraph
expanse. The multi-level grid guides one’s lines of sight but,Paragraph
does not focus them on anything in particular. At first,Paragraph
"encounter, the vague gray expanse seems impossible to",Paragraph
decipher and utterly odd. The multi-level lattice disperses,Paragraph
"vision throughout the space, much as various images might",Paragraph
be thrown around an area from a central projector. It,Paragraph
absorbs all individual spaces that establish strict order. It,Paragraph
"conceals them, and when the concealment process is over,",Paragraph
only the gray expanse remains.*,Paragraph
Since the early 1970s Isozaki’s work has oscillated,Paragraph
constantly between gridded atectonic assemblies (grey,Paragraph
"expanses) controlled by the superimposition of cubic forms,",Paragraph
as in the Gunma Museum and the Shukosha Building in,Paragraph
"Fukuoka City (1974-75), and a series of barrel-vaulted",Paragraph
"tectonic structures, such as the Fujimi Country Clubhouse",Paragraph
near Oita (1972-74) and the Central Library of Kitakyushu,Paragraph
City (1972-75). A version of this last paradigm is the,Paragraph
"Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, completed in",Caption
"1986, which is probably one of his finest later works.",Paragraph
"Unlike the Metabolists, lsozaki and Shinohara and other",Paragraph
members of the Japanese New Wave accept the fact that,Paragraph
today one can hardly hope to achieve any meaningful,Paragraph
relationship between the one-off building and the urban,Title
fabric as a whole. This critical attitude has been expressed,Paragraph
in a series of extremely formal and introspective houses,Paragraph
"designed by such architects as Tadao Ando, Hiromi Fujii,",Paragraph
"Hiroshi Hara, Itsuko Hasegawa and Toyo Ito, in addition to",Paragraph
similarly introverted works by Isozaki and Shinohara (see,Paragraph

‘Collage and Superficiality in Architecture’:,Title
Surface richness in a Japanese city does not consist of a,Paragraph

present. Behind an endless desire for nostalgic satisfaction,Paragraph
there resides a void without any substance. What | wish to,Paragraph

the nature of the void hidden beneath.°,Paragraph

"greatest impact has been in Japan and, above all, in Britain,",Paragraph
where a continuous ‘Dymaxion’ development can be traced,Paragraph
from the first space-frame and dome projects of Cedric Price,Caption
and Peter Cook to the work of Foster Associates.,Paragraph
The paradigm of this movement is the Centre Pompidou,Paragraph
"in Paris [291, 292], built in 1977 to the designs of the short-",Paragraph
lived Anglo-Italian partnership of Richard Rogers and Renzo,Paragraph
Piano. The building is obviously a realization of the,Paragraph
technological and infrastructural rhetoric of Archigram; and,Paragraph
while the full consequences of this approach have become,Paragraph
"evident through everyday use, it is apparent that certain",Paragraph
paradoxical achievements may be claimed on its behalf. In,Paragraph
"the first place, it is an outstanding popular success - as",Paragraph
much for its sensational nature as for anything else. In the,Paragraph
"second, it is a brilliant tour de force in advanced technique,",Paragraph
looking for all the world like the oil refinery whose,Paragraph
"technology it attempts to emulate. It seems, however, to",Paragraph
have come into being with the minimum regard for the,Paragraph
specificity of its brief - for the art and library holdings it was,Paragraph
destined to house. It represents the design approach of,Paragraph
indeterminacy and optimum flexibility taken to extremes.,Paragraph
Not only was it necessary to build another ‘building’ within,Paragraph
its skeletonal volume in order to provide sufficient wall,Paragraph
surface and enclosure for the exhibition of art; but also the,Paragraph
provision of 50-metre (165-foot) lattice truss spans,Paragraph
"throughout, in order to ensure optimum flexibility, seems to",Paragraph
have proved excessive. In the first instance we have an,Paragraph
"underprovision of wall surface, in the second an",Paragraph
overprovision of flexibility. The additional fact that the scale,Paragraph
of the building is quite indifferent to its urban context and,Paragraph
that it is incapable of representing its status as an institution,Paragraph
is consistent with the ideological position from which it,Paragraph
"stems, since such concerns were always foreign to the",Paragraph
English Dymaxion school of design. One of the unintended,Paragraph
ironies of this work seems to derive from the spectacular,Paragraph
view of the city which may be gained from the glazed,Paragraph
"escalator access tubes, hung off the west side of the",Caption
building. These access ways are now barely adequate to,Paragraph
accommodate the average daily attendance of thousands of,Paragraph
"visitors, a number of whom come not for the cultural",Paragraph
facilities offered but for the building and the view.,Paragraph
"291, 292 Piano and Rogers, Centre Pompidou, Paris, 1972-77.",Caption
An equally indeterminate approach was adopted in the,Paragraph
"1972 design of the English New Town, Milton Keynes [293].",Caption
"This city, based on a somewhat irregular street grid, was",Paragraph
apparently conceived as an instant Los Angeles to be laid,Paragraph
over the agrarian landscape of Buckinghamshire. Its empty,Paragraph
"irregular network, configurated after the topography, was",Paragraph
yet another exercise in indeterminacy pushed to absurdity.,Paragraph
"Despite the Neo-Classicism of its Miesian shopping centre,",Paragraph
its capacity to represent a municipal identity is virtually non-,Paragraph
existent. One has no notion of arrival here save for the,Paragraph
"graphic indication of the legal boundary, and for the casual",Paragraph

random collection of more or less well-designed housing,Paragraph
estates. One thinks by contrast of the orthogonal precision,Paragraph
"of Wright’s Broadacre City, where, despite the relentless",Paragraph
"dispersal of the urban fabric, places would have acquired a",Paragraph
certain definition by virtue of their orthogonal boundaries.,Paragraph
"Here, needless to say, what boundaries there are fail to",Paragraph
"correspond to any perceivable order, and this is hardly",Paragraph
surprising given that the structure of the town was,Paragraph
"influenced by the planning theories of Melvin Webber,",Paragraph
whose slogan ‘Non-Place Urban Realm’ seems to have been,Paragraph
"adopted as a credo by the official architects of the plan,",Paragraph
Llewelyn-Davies Weeks Forestier-Walker and Bor. The fact,Paragraph
that this slogan stemmed from Webber’s commitment to the,Paragraph
"Kristaller-Losch central place location theory - then as now,",Paragraph
the most dynamic model available for the creation of,Paragraph
optimum marketing conditions - could hardly have escaped,Paragraph
either the architects or the City Corporation. This selection,Paragraph
of an open-ended planning model in accordance with the,Paragraph
hypothetical interests of a consumer society was surely a,Paragraph
conscious choice.,Paragraph

Within the Hochschule flr Gestaltung (HfG) [294] at Ulm,Paragraph
"in Germany, initially conceived in 1951 by the Swiss",Paragraph
architect Max Bill as the institutional successor to the,Paragraph
"Bauhaus, a rigorous approach to design and technology",Paragraph
brought itself in the space of a decade to confront the,Paragraph
fundamental contradictions of designing for a consumer,Title
"society. After Bill’s resignation as director in 1956, the HfG",Paragraph
embraced a form of ‘operational research’ by which it,Paragraph
"intended to evolve a heuristic of design, whereby the forms",Paragraph
of objects would be determined in accordance with precise,Paragraph
methods for analyzing the nature of their production and,Paragraph
"use. Unfortunately, this method rapidly degenerated into a",Paragraph
form of method-idolatry in which the methodological ‘purist’,Paragraph
was invariably prepared to forego a solution rather than,Paragraph
arrive at a design that had not been ergonomically,Paragraph
determined. As far as Herbert Ohl’s Department of,Paragraph
"Industrialized Building was concerned, this led to an",Paragraph
emphasis on the design of industrial components to the,Paragraph
exclusion of any comprehensive analysis of specific building,Title
tasks. Real needs were often overlooked in an effort to,Paragraph
"produce extremely sophisticated, if relatively simple,",Paragraph
prototypical components for the rationalized production of,Paragraph
built form. By the mid-1960s the more critical faculty,Paragraph
"members, Tomas Maldonado, Claude Schnaidt and Gui",Paragraph
"Bonsiepe, had jointly recognized that this idealization of",Paragraph
"product design was a dead end, conveniently overlooking in",Paragraph
the name of scientific method and functional aesthetics the,Paragraph
fundamental contradictions inherent in neo-capitalist,Title
society. As far as architecture was concerned this was never,Paragraph
"more forcibly expressed than by Schnaidt, who in his essay",Paragraph
‘Architecture and Political Commitment’ (1967) wrote:,Paragraph
"294 Bill, Hochschule fur Gestaltung, Ulm, 1953-55, showing workshop block,",Caption
"library, administration building and student housing. In the distance is Ulm",Paragraph
Cathedral.,Paragraph
In the days when the pioneers of modern architecture were,Paragraph
still young they thought like William Morris that architecture,Paragraph
should be an ‘art of the people for the people’. Instead of,Paragraph
"pandering to the tastes of the privileged few, they wanted",Paragraph
to satisfy the requirements of the community. They wanted,Paragraph
"to build dwellings, matched to human needs, to erect a Cité",Paragraph
Radieuse. But they had reckoned without the commercial,Paragraph
instincts of the bourgeoisie who lost no time in arrogating,Paragraph
their theories to themselves and pressing them into service,Paragraph
for the purpose of money-making. Utility quickly became,Paragraph
synonymous with profitability. Anti-academic forms became,Paragraph
the new decor of the ruling classes. The rational dwelling,Paragraph
"was transformed into the minimum dwelling, the Cité",Paragraph
Radieuse into the urban conglomeration and austerity of,Paragraph
"line into poverty of form. The architects of the trade unions,",Paragraph
"co-operatives, and socialist municipalities were enlisted in",Paragraph
"the service of the whisky distillers, detergent",Paragraph
"manufacturers, the bankers, and the Vatican. Modern",Paragraph
"architecture, which wanted to play its part in the liberation",Paragraph
"of mankind by creating a new environment to live in, was",Paragraph
transformed into a giant enterprise for the degradation of,Paragraph
the human habitat.®,Paragraph
Later in the same article Schnaidt criticized the,Paragraph
achievements of the ‘alternative’ avant garde of the 1960s:,Paragraph
It is their philosophy that even the most audacious concepts,Paragraph
in architecture and city planning are feasible with modern,Paragraph
technological aids. This is what lies behind their quest for,Paragraph
"something resembling space ships, packing crates, filing",Paragraph
"systems, refineries, or artificial islands. ...",Paragraph
These futurist architects may well have the merit of,Paragraph
taking technology to its logical conclusion but more often,Paragraph
than not their attitude ends up in technolatry. The refinery,Paragraph
and the space capsule may serve as models of technical,Paragraph
and formal perfection but if they become the objects of a,Paragraph
"cult, the lessons they can teach will completely miss their",Paragraph
mark. This unlimited confidence in the potentialities of,Paragraph
technology goes hand in hand with a surprising degree of,Paragraph
disingenuousness concerning the future of man. ... Such,Paragraph
visions as these are soothing to many architects: braced by,Paragraph
"so much technology, by such confidence in the future, they",Paragraph
feel reassured and justified in their social and political,Paragraph
abdication.’,Paragraph
"Yet while one might challenge its effectiveness, the",Paragraph
architectural avant garde of the 1960s had not entirely,Paragraph
abdicated its social responsibility. Many factions existed,Paragraph
whose orientation was decidedly political and whose,Paragraph
attitude towards advanced technology was by no means,Paragraph
uncritical. Of these mention must be made of the Italian,Paragraph
"Superstudio group, who were, in this respect, among the",Paragraph
most poetic. Influenced by the ‘unitary town planning’,Paragraph
concepts of the International Situationist Constant,Title
"Nieuwenhuys, who, in his New Babylon of 1960, had",Paragraph
postulated a constantly changing urban fabric that would,Paragraph
"respond to the ‘ludic’ tendency in man, Superstudio, led by",Paragraph
"Adolfo Natalini, started in 1966 to produce a body of work",Paragraph
which was more or less divided between representing the,Paragraph
form of a ‘Continuous Monument’ as a mute urban sign and,Paragraph
producing a series of vignettes illustrating a world from,Paragraph
which consumer goods had been eliminated. Their work,Paragraph
"varied from the projection of vast impenetrable megaliths,",Paragraph
"faced in mirror-glass, to the depiction of a science-fiction",Paragraph
landscape in which nature had been rendered benevolent -,Paragraph
in short the quintessential anti-architectural utopia. In 1969,Paragraph
they wrote:,Paragraph
Beyond the convulsions of over-production a state can be,Paragraph
born of calm in which a world takes shape without products,Paragraph
"and refuse, a zone in which the mind is energy and raw",Paragraph
"material and is also the final product, the only intangible",Paragraph
object for consumption.®,Paragraph
And again in 1972:,Paragraph
"The objects we will need will be only flags or talismans,",Paragraph
"signals for an existence that continues, or simple utensils",Paragraph
"for simple operations. Thus, on the one hand, there will",Paragraph
"remain utensils ... on the other, such symbolic objects as",Paragraph
monuments or badges ... objects that can easily be carried,Paragraph
"about if we should become nomads, or heavy and",Paragraph
immovable if we decide to stay in one place forever?,Paragraph
"Beyond the rule of the performance principle, which the",Paragraph
philosopher Herbert Marcuse had already characterized as,Paragraph
"defining life in terms of instruments and consumer goods,",Paragraph
"Superstudio projected a silent, anti-futurist and",Paragraph
"technologically optimistic utopia where, in the words of",Paragraph
"Marcuse’s Eros and Civilization (1962),",Paragraph
The level of living would be measured by other criteria: the,Paragraph
"universal gratification of the basic human needs, and",Paragraph
freedom from guilt and fear - internalized as well as,Paragraph
"externalized, instinctual as well as ‘rational’. ... In this case",Paragraph
the quantum of instinctual energy still to be diverted to,Paragraph
necessary labor ... would be so small that a large area of,Paragraph
repressive constraints and modifications no longer sustained,Title
by external forces would collapse.‘°,Paragraph
It is significant that Superstudio chose to represent such,Paragraph
a non-repressive world in terms of an architecture that was,Paragraph
"virtually invisible [295], or, where visible, totally useless",Paragraph
and by design auto-destructive (see their self-disintegrating,Paragraph
mirror-glass dam for Niagara Falls). For all that they,Paragraph
rendered the contradiction of the ‘Continuous Monument’ as,Paragraph
"an impenetrable mass reminiscent of Boullée, it was",Paragraph
"nonetheless a metaphysical image, as fleeting and as",Paragraph
cryptic as the Suprematist monuments of Malevich or the,Paragraph
"‘wrapped’ buildings of Christo, an artist who, after wrapping",Paragraph
"the Kunsthalle at Berne in 1968, went on to package and",Paragraph
hence to ‘silence’ most of the institutional monuments of,Paragraph
the Western world.,Paragraph
"295 Superstudio, ‘A Journey from A to B’, 1969. ‘There will be no further reason",Caption
for roads or squares.’,Paragraph
The growing awareness in the early 1960s that in,Paragraph
common practice there was a fundamental lack of,Paragraph
correspondence between the values of the architect and the,Paragraph
needs and mores of the user led to a whole series of,Paragraph
reformist moves which sought in a variety of counterutopian,Paragraph
ways to overcome this divorce of the designer from,Paragraph
everyday society. These factions not only challenged the,Paragraph
inaccessibility of the abstract syntax of contemporary,Title
architecture but also tried to devise ways in which architects,Paragraph
could serve those poor sectors of the society not normally,Paragraph
addressed by the profession. In his book Supports: An,Paragraph
Alternative to Mass Housing (1972) N.J. Habraken first,Caption
tackled the problem of building residential stock that could,Paragraph
"meet the variable needs of its users, and John Turner and",Paragraph
William Mangin began in 1963 to write up their experience,Paragraph
as consultants to the spontaneous ‘squatter’ cities then,Paragraph
coming into existence around the perimeters of large South,Paragraph
"American towns. The following situation, as described by",Paragraph
"Mangin at the time, may be taken as typical of many other",Paragraph
cities throughout the Continent:,Title
"The tremendous population growth in Peru, together with",Paragraph
"the centralization of social, political, economic and cultural",Title
"rewards in Lima, the capital city, has led to recent",Paragraph
intensified migration from the provinces to Lima. It is safe to,Paragraph
say that at least a million of Lima’s two million people were,Paragraph
born outside the city. The increase in the numbers of,Paragraph
migrants to the city and the subsequent dramatic,Title
resettlement of many of them in ‘unaided self-help’ squatter,Paragraph
"settlements, ‘barriadas’ ... have drawn considerable",Paragraph
attention locally and abroad and for the first time have,Paragraph
made many Peruvians aware of the situation. The city has,Paragraph
"probably grown in the past in much the same way, but the",Paragraph
magnitude and the visibility of the recent influx make it,Paragraph
seem to be a new phenomenon. The migrants come from,Paragraph
practically all regions and all social classes and ethnic,Paragraph
"groupings in the country.""",Paragraph
"Problems of this magnitude, of course, lie beyond the",Paragraph
province of architecture as an autonomous discipline and,Paragraph
even outside the process of land settlement and building as,Paragraph
"it is commonly understood. All the same, the scale of the",Paragraph
"problem, its visibility and the need to confront it in a way",Paragraph
that would assist the squatters to build in a more effective,Paragraph
manner (the provision in most instances of water and sewer,Paragraph
"infrastructures), created a general climate in which the",Paragraph
forty-year-old Neue Sachlichkeit formula of slum clearance,Title
followed by massive rehousing was for the first time,Paragraph
subjected to radical reconsideration. Habraken argued that,Paragraph
"the whole approach needed to be rethought, not only in",Paragraph
respect of the Third World but also in the face of growing,Paragraph
user discontent in industrialized economies.,Paragraph
The establishment of alternative modes of practice to,Paragraph
"meet this situation, for both the developed and the",Paragraph
"underdeveloped world, has proved elusive, and the panacea",Paragraph
of ‘user participation’ (hard to define appropriately and even,Paragraph
more difficult to achieve) has only served to make us,Paragraph
acutely aware of the intractability of the problem and of the,Paragraph
fact that probably it can be effectively tackled only ona,Paragraph
"piecemeal basis, by responding appropriately to specific",Paragraph
"situations. Nevertheless, advocacy planning remains with us",Paragraph
"as a radical legacy of the 1960s, although the results of its",Paragraph
"application have varied widely, from the political",Paragraph
manipulation of the underprivileged to the achievement of a,Paragraph
"section of low-rise housing [296] in Terni north of Rome,",Paragraph
"designed by Giancarlo de Carlo, in accordance with a brief",Caption
developed as a result of extensive discussions with the local,Paragraph
trade union. There is no doubt that this whole undertaking,Paragraph
"has resulted in housing of remarkable quality and variety,",Paragraph
although the manner in which the users’ desires were finally,Paragraph
interpreted remains a controversial issue.,Paragraph
"296 De Carlo, Matteotti village, Terni, 1974-77.",Caption
As far as transforming the practice of the Neue,Paragraph
"Sachlichkeit was concerned, Habraken and his Foundation",Paragraph
for Architectural Research (SAR) in Eindhoven did their,Paragraph
technocratic best to take the promise of Yona Friedman’s,Title
"open infrastructural approach, his ‘mobile architecture’, to",Paragraph
"its logical conclusion. To this end they proposed a low-rise,",Paragraph
"multistorey, support structure, whose plan arrangement was",Paragraph
"undetermined, save for fixed access, kitchen and bathroom",Caption
zones. Outside these zones the occupant would be free to,Paragraph
arrange the plan of his allocated volume in any way he,Paragraph
"wished. Regrettably, Habraken intended to furnish this",Paragraph
"spatial matrix with industrialized, modular components",Paragraph
fabricated along the lines of the car industry and brought to,Paragraph
a level of technical sophistication and structural tolerance,Title
"which has yet to be attained, even in the wholesale",Paragraph
prefabricated building programmes of the Soviet Union.,Paragraph
"Moreover, like Friedman, he tended to overlook the fact that",Paragraph
much of the inherent ‘freedom’ of the system would,Paragraph
automatically disappear once it came under the auspices of,Paragraph
monopoly capital. Housing after all has yet to become a,Paragraph
"truly consumable item. Fortunately, the SAR concept does",Paragraph
"not stand or fall by its technology alone, and Habraken has",Paragraph
opened up a line of research which has yet to be fully,Paragraph
explored. A quite remarkable work apparently influenced by,Paragraph
Habraken’s thought is the distinguished ‘expandable’,Paragraph

Populism,Title
The Loosian recognition of the loss of cultural identity that,Paragraph
urbanization had brought in its wake returned with a,Paragraph
vengeance in the mid-1960s as architects began to realize,Paragraph
that the reductive codes of contemporary architecture had,Paragraph
led to an impoverishment of the urban environment. The,Paragraph
exact manner in which this impoverishment has come,Paragraph
"about, however - the extent to which it is due to abstract",Paragraph
tendencies present in Cartesian rationality itself or,Paragraph
alternatively to ruthless economic exploitation - is a,Paragraph
complex and critical issue which has yet to be judiciously,Paragraph
decided. It cannot be denied that the tabula rasa,Paragraph
reductivism of the Modern Movement has played a salient,Paragraph
role in the wholesale destruction of urban culture; thus the,Paragraph
emphasis that the ‘Post-Modernist’ critique has placed on,Paragraph
respecting the existing urban context can hardly be,Paragraph
discredited. This anti-utopian ‘contextualist’ critique was,Paragraph
"already available in the 1960s, first in Colin Rowe’s neo-",Paragraph
Sittesque approach to urban form (as taught in Cornell,Paragraph
"University and presented in his book of 1979, Collage City),",Paragraph
and then in Robert Venturi’s Complexity and Contradiction in,Paragraph

their thesis. And while their critical distance permits them,Paragraph
the luxury of describing the typical casino as a ruthless,Paragraph
landscape of seduction and control - they emphasize the,Paragraph

This return to the ‘limits’ of architecture was initiated by,Paragraph
"the publication of two singularly seminal texts, Aldo Rossi’s",Paragraph
L’architettura della citta (1966) and Giorgio Grassi’s La,Paragraph
costruzione logica dell’architettura (1967). The first stressed,Paragraph
the part to be played by established building types in,Paragraph
determining the morphological structure of urban form as it,Paragraph

necessary compositional or combinatorial rules for,Title
architecture - the intrinsic logic by which Grassi himself had,Paragraph
arrived at his own highly restrained expression. While,Paragraph
"insisting that everyday needs must be met, both men",Paragraph
rejected the principle by which form is supposed to follow,Paragraph
function - ergonomics - and asserted instead the relative,Paragraph
autonomy of architectural order. Aware of the tendency of,Paragraph
interested rationality to absorb and distort every significant,Paragraph

architectonic elements that could recall and yet transcend,Paragraph
the rational if arbitrary paradigms of the Enlightenment -,Paragraph
the pure form postulated in the second half of the 18th,Paragraph
"century by Piranesi, Ledoux, Boullée and Lequeu. The most",Paragraph
"enigmatic, not to say hermetic, aspect of his thought resides",Paragraph
in his unstated preoccupation with the Panopticon (see,Paragraph
Michel Foucault’s Surveiller et punir of 1975) under the,Paragraph
rubric of which he would surely include - after Pugin’s,Paragraph
"Contrasts of 1843 - the school, the hospital and the prison.",Paragraph
Rossi seems to have obsessively returned to these,Paragraph
"regulatory, quasi-punitive institutions which for him, in",Paragraph
"conjunction with the monument and cemetery, constitute",Paragraph
the only programmes capable of embodying the values of,Paragraph
architecture per se. After the thesis that Loos first set out in,Paragraph
"his essay Architektur of 1910, Rossi has recognized that",Paragraph
most modern programmes are inappropriate vehicles for,Paragraph
architecture and for him this has meant having recourse to,Paragraph
a so-called analogical architecture whose referents and,Paragraph
"elements are to be abstracted from the vernacular, in the",Paragraph
broadest possible sense. To this end his Gallaratese,Paragraph
"apartment block [299], designed as part of Carlo",Caption
Aymonino’s housing complex built on the outskirts of Milan,Paragraph
"in 1973, was an occasion to evoke the architecture of the",Paragraph
traditional Milanese tenement. Similarly his town hall for,Paragraph
"Trieste, projected in the form of a penitentiary in 1973, was",Paragraph
both a homage to the local 19th-century building tradition,Paragraph
and a sardonic comment on the ultimate nature of modern,Paragraph
"bureaucracy. Like Léon Krier, who has since taken a similar",Paragraph
"path, Rossi attempts to evade the twin chimeras of",Paragraph
modernity - positivistic logic and a blind faith in progress -,Title
by returning to both the building typology and the,Paragraph
constructional forms of the second half of the 19th century.,Paragraph

already flourishing in the early 1960s. While Bruno Reichlin,Paragraph
and Fabio Reinhart followed Rossi closely (see their Tonini,Paragraph

architects whose work came into being under a much,Paragraph
broader Rationalist influence. Typical in this regard is Aurelio,Paragraph
"Galfetti’s Corbusian Rotalinti House, Bellinzona (1961),",Caption
which predates the emergence of the Tendenza as an,Paragraph

the Ticinese architects were privileged with links to the pre-,Paragraph
"war Italian Rationalist movement, in particular Alberto",Paragraph
Sartoris and Rino Tami (see p. 360).,Paragraph
"301 Reichlin and Reinhart, Tonini House, Torricella, 1974.",Caption
Since the late 1960s Neo-Rationalism has attained a wide,Paragraph
"following throughout Continental Europe. In France, its",Paragraph
influence is apparent in H.E. Ciriani’s Noisy 2 apartment,Paragraph
complex [302] in Marne-la-Vallée near Paris (1980). In,Paragraph
"Germany, Neo-Rationalism has found its principal",Paragraph
"manifestation in the typological work of Mathias Ungers,",Paragraph
Jurgen Sawade and J.P. Kleihues. Recent works of,Caption
consequence in this regard are Ungers’ extension to the,Paragraph
"Messehalle (1983) and his Architecture Museum (1984),",Paragraph
both in Frankfurt. In Berlin a sampling of Rationalist work,Paragraph
would surely include Kleihues’ Vinetaplatz perimeter,Paragraph
housing block in Wedding (1978) [303] and his,Paragraph
megastructural hospital in Neukdélln (1984).,Paragraph
"302 Ciriani, detail of Noisy 2, Marne-la-Vallée, 1980.",Caption
"303 Kleihues, perimeter block housing, Berlin-Wedding, 1978. This residential",Caption
type has the capacity to engender both courtyards and streets.,Paragraph
Particularly significant in the German development was,Paragraph
Ungers’ adoption of a modified Neo-Rationalist approach to,Paragraph
"urban form, after his return from the United States in 1975.",Paragraph
"His thesis of that time, that in the future we shall often find",Paragraph
ourselves confronted with the problem of planned,Paragraph
"metropolitan shrinkage, rather than expansion or renewal,",Paragraph
has imparted a certain urgency to his approach. Ungers,Paragraph
recommends a fragmentary urban strategy comprising,Paragraph
forms of development limited in accordance with the,Paragraph
topographical and institutional constraints of a specific task,Title
in a particular context. This appears in such projects as his,Paragraph
1976 Hotel Berlin or his 1978 proposal for a multi-use,Title
building in the centre of Hildesheim. Where in the Hotel,Caption
"Berlin he opted for a self-contained ‘city in miniature’, close",Paragraph
to the devastated urban landscape of the historic,Title
"Lutzowplatz, at Hildesheim he attempted to rationalize and",Paragraph
reinterpret the received type of the medieval market hall,Paragraph

"completed in 1982, was his only truly contextual realization",Paragraph
of that period.,Paragraph
"304 Ungers, project for a ‘Stadtloggia’ in the marketplace at Hildesheim, 1980.",Caption
Ungers has been a major Neo-Rationalist theoretician,Paragraph
"and teacher, first in the Technische Universitat in Berlin and",Paragraph
"then at Cornell University, where from 1967 to 1974 he",Paragraph
directed the Department of Architecture. His consistent,Paragraph
application of the principle of typological transformation to,Paragraph
both teaching and practice gave his pedagogical method,Paragraph
great conviction. He made the full range of this,Paragraph
transformational precept explicit in 1982:,Paragraph
"When architecture is seen as a continuous process, in which",Paragraph
"theses and antitheses are dialectically integrated, or as a",Paragraph
"process, in which history is as closely involved as",Paragraph
"anticipation of history, in which the past has the same",Paragraph
"weight as looking forward to the future, then the process of",Paragraph
"transformation is not only the instrument of design, but it is",Paragraph
the very object of design. At the same time it becomes,Paragraph
possible to make reference to the specific reality of each,Paragraph
individual site where the architecture will be built - and,Paragraph
therefore to the genius loci and to discover the poetry of the,Paragraph
place and give it expression. In this way the site is used to,Paragraph
its best advantage.,Paragraph
The principle of transformation is active in all fields of,Paragraph
"nature, life and art. It is the principle of formation",Paragraph
(Gestaltungsprinzip) capable of organizing divergent,Paragraph
elements into a planned totality. Thus the principle of,Paragraph
transformation as it can be grasped for example in the,Paragraph
historical transformations of the town plan of Trier -,Title
converts a given stabilized organization into chaos and,Paragraph
"eventually, following the laws of chance, into a new order. ...",Paragraph
A differentiated and planned organisation is submerged over,Paragraph
"the course of time by chance and spontaneity, which in the",Paragraph
end produce an organisation that is genuinely different and,Paragraph
"contrasts with the previous one; an organisation, that is of",Paragraph
immediacy and pragmatic necessity.'®,Paragraph
This grounding of architecture in the dialectic of,Paragraph
typological transformation exerted a major influence on the,Paragraph
"Luxembourg architect Robert Krier, who spent a number of",Paragraph
years in Ungers’ Cologne studio as his assistant. However,Paragraph
where Ungers was to remain open to the free interchange,Paragraph
"and generation of both type and technique, including",Paragraph
"industrial technique, Robert Krier and, to an even greater",Paragraph
"extent, his brother Léon adopted an exclusively craft",Paragraph
approach to the generation of tectonic and urban form. Thus,Paragraph
we find Léon Krier writing in 1976:,Paragraph
The debate which both Robert Krier and | want to raise with,Paragraph
our projects is that of urban morphology as against the,Paragraph
zoning of planners. The restoration of precise forms of urban,Paragraph
space as against the wasteland which is created by zoning.,Paragraph
"The design of urban spaces, both traffic and pedestrian,",Paragraph
"linear and focal is, on the one hand, a method which is",Paragraph
"general enough to allow flexibility and change and, on the",Paragraph
"other, precise enough to create both spatial and built",Paragraph
continuity within the city ... we try in our projects to re-,Paragraph
"establish the dialectic of building and public realm, of solid",Paragraph
"and void, of the built organism and the spaces it necessarily",Paragraph
creates around itself... the architectural language we use,Paragraph
for fairly large urban parts is both simple and ambiguous. In,Paragraph
Echternach (1970) [305] we used the same craft which after,Paragraph
"the war reconstructed the city, the Abbey, and the annex",Paragraph
buildings.,Paragraph
"305 L. Krier, project for Echternach, Luxembourg, 1970. The continuous pitched",Caption
"roof (centre to bottom right) contains shops, apartments and a school.",Caption
Structuralism,Title
"The Krier brothers’ credo that ‘function follows form’, their",Paragraph
anti-technocratic attitude and their insistence on the,Paragraph
"cultural importance of place, all find a parallel in the work",Paragraph
"and thought of the Dutch architect Herman Hertzberger,",Paragraph
who in every other respect could not be further removed,Paragraph
from the ethos of the Tendenza. The most crucial influence,Paragraph
on the thought and practice of Hertzberger has been Aldo,Paragraph
"van Eyck, who is responsible for the most consistently",Paragraph
sustained and significant critique of modern architecture as,Paragraph
an inseparable part of the Enlightenment. In 1962 Van Eyck,Paragraph
delivered one of his sharpest attacks on Europocentrism and,Paragraph
on the bankruptcy of imperialist culture:,Title
Western civilization habitually identifies itself with,Paragraph
civilization as such on the pontifical assumption that what is,Paragraph
"not like it, is a deviation, less advanced, ‘primitive’, or, at",Paragraph
"best, exotically interesting at a safe distance.'’",Paragraph
"Five years later, in his magazine Forum, Van Eyck",Paragraph
anticipated many of the arguments since advanced by the,Paragraph
"Kriers, including a certain scepticism with regard to the",Paragraph
notion of progress:,Title
"It seems to me that past, present and future must be active",Paragraph
in the mind’s interior as a continuum. If they are not the,Paragraph
artifacts we make will be without temporal depth or,Paragraph
associative perspective. ... Man after all has been,Paragraph
accommodating himself physically in this world for,Paragraph
thousands of years. His natural genius has neither increased,Paragraph
nor decreased during that time. It is obvious that the full,Paragraph
scope of this enormous environmental experience cannot be,Paragraph
combined unless we telescope the past. ... Architects,Paragraph
"nowadays are pathologically addicted to change, regarding",Paragraph
"it as something one either hinders, runs after, or at best",Paragraph
"keeps up with. This, | suggest, is why they tend to sever the",Paragraph
"past from the future, with the result that the present is",Paragraph
"rendered emotionally inaccessible, without temporal",Paragraph
dimension. | dislike a sentimental antiquarian attitude,Paragraph
toward the past as much as | dislike a sentimental,Paragraph
technocratic one toward the future. Both are founded on a,Paragraph
"Static, clockwork, notion of time (what antiquarians and",Paragraph
"technocrats have in common), so let’s start with the past for",Paragraph
a change and discover the unchanging condition of man.*®,Paragraph
The unifying concept with which Dutch Structuralism,Paragraph
hoped to overcome the reductive aspect of Functionalism,Paragraph
"was Characterized by Van Eyck as labyrinthine clarity, a",Paragraph
concept that has since been fully elaborated by his pupils.,Paragraph
Thus Hertzberger wrote of their common notion of,Paragraph
‘polyvalent space’ in 1963:,Paragraph
"What we must look for, in place of prototypes which are",Paragraph
"collective interpretations of individual living patterns, are",Paragraph
prototypes which make individual interpretations of the,Paragraph
"collective patterns possible; in other words, we must make",Paragraph
"houses alike in a particular way, such that everyone can",Paragraph
bring into being his own interpretation of the collective,Paragraph
pattern. ... Because it is impossible (and it always was) to,Paragraph
"make the individual setting that exactly suits everyone, we",Paragraph
"have to create the possibility for personal interpretation, by",Paragraph
making things in such a way that they are indeed,Paragraph
interpretable.'9,Paragraph
This precept has been the point of departure from which,Paragraph
"Hertzberger has evolved the rest of his work, culminating in",Paragraph
the erection in 1974 of the Centraal Beheer insurance,Paragraph
"offices in Apeldoorn [306], built to his designs in the form of",Paragraph
a ‘city within a city’. This reinforced-concrete frame and,Paragraph
concrete-block structure is ordered about an irregular,Paragraph
cluster of working platforms set within a regular orthogonal,Paragraph
"tartan grid comprising floors, columns, light slots and",Paragraph
service ducts. Top-lit gallery spaces of varying height,Caption
separate these 7.5-metre (24-foot) square platforms from,Paragraph
one another and allow natural light to filter down to the,Paragraph
lowest public levels. The suspended platforms provide a,Paragraph
network of activity spaces that may be appropriated as,Paragraph
"either individual or group working stations, through the",Paragraph
"rearrangement of modular elements comprising desks,",Paragraph
"seats, light fittings, cabinets, couches and expresso",Caption
"machines, etc. According to Hertzberger this bunker-like",Paragraph
labyrinth - reminiscent in its introspection of Wright’s Larkin,Paragraph
Building of 1904 - has been deliberately left unfinished so,Paragraph
as to encourage the ‘spontaneous’ appropriation and,Paragraph
decoration of the space by its immediate users.,Paragraph
Hertzberger’s antipathy to the mechanistic provision of,Paragraph
"flexibility, as found in the sophisticated infrastructural",Paragraph
"propositions of both Habraken and Friedman, seems to have",Paragraph
been vindicated here by the apparent spontaneity and ease,Paragraph
with which the working spaces have been taken over and,Paragraph
modified. And while one can only be circumspect about the,Paragraph
rhetorical comparison that Hertzberger draws between the,Paragraph
appropriation of space in the Centraal Beheer and the,Paragraph
"Saussurian linguistic distinction between /angue and parole,",Paragraph
there is little doubt that his approach has done something to,Paragraph
overcome the chronic inaccessibility of the architectural,Paragraph
discourse in a Taylorized age.,Paragraph
"306 Hertzberger, Centraal Beheer Building, Apeldoorn. Holland, 1974.",Caption
The architects of the Tendenza would surely agree with,Paragraph
Hertzberger’s argument that the functionalist organization,Paragraph
"of residential units into strictly subdivided areas for living,",Paragraph
"dining, cooking, washing and sleeping is in itself a tyranny,",Paragraph
and that we should attempt to return to the pre-industrial,Paragraph
"norm of interconnected rooms, offering an altogether looser",Paragraph
fit between volume and activity (see Hertzberger’s,Paragraph
‘Diagoon’ experimental houses built in Delft in 1971). On,Paragraph
the other hand they would no doubt reject outright his,Paragraph
"‘casbah’ concept, particularly as this appears in the",Paragraph
"Centraal Beheer, on the grounds that such an introverted",Paragraph
type-form is incapable of providing representative public,Paragraph
"space at an urban scale. The Centraal Beheer is, indeed,",Paragraph
indifferently related to its urban context. The fact that these,Paragraph
Islamic ‘bazaar’ or ‘patio’ building types inherently afford no,Paragraph
architectural element with which to express the hierarchical,Paragraph
status of the entrance is also confirmed at the Centraal,Paragraph
"Beheer, where the company found it necessary to put up",Paragraph
signs directing visitors to the point of entry.,Caption
Since the mid-1970s Hertzberger has modified his,Paragraph
"structuralist paradigm, not only in terms of the labyrinthine",Paragraph
introspective model that has since appeared in an equally,Paragraph
complex but spatially more generous version in the Ministry,Paragraph
"of Social Welfare realized in The Hague in 1990 [307], but",Paragraph
also in terms of the mass forms assumed by recent works,Paragraph
projected for and realized in Berlin - the unbuilt film centre,Caption
for the Esplanade (1984) and the realized Lindenstrasse,Paragraph
"housing (1986), which are unified by circular or semicircular",Paragraph
"perimeter forms. Similarly, the four-square introspective",Paragraph
school type developed in 1980 for his prototypical Apollo,Paragraph
School in Amsterdam evolved through superimposed,Paragraph
"circular perimeters into the Ambonplein School, also in",Paragraph
"Amsterdam (1986), and then through freer adaptation into",Paragraph
the curved and splayed classroom wings of a school,Paragraph
"extension at Aerdenhout [308, 309] completed in 1989. Of",Paragraph

Visibility from the classrooms to the central mixing space,Caption

"Like the exterior stairs in the Amsterdam schools, this has",Paragraph
"been carefully composed, with the help of detail models,",Paragraph
into a welded sculpture with roofs as in Berlage’s,Paragraph
Smeedwerk. Hertzberger’s metal stairways make a direct,Paragraph
link with nautical detailing; after all the modernists’,Paragraph
fascination with ocean liners was not only about,Paragraph
"functionalism, but also the rich and complex spatial",Paragraph
requirements of ship-layout. And this is indeed a rich and,Paragraph
complex spatial experience - especially in such a small,Paragraph
building. Hertzberger’s recent work has complemented the,Paragraph
sound basis of structuralism with a constantly increasing,Paragraph
sense of narrative.?°,Paragraph

If Centraal Beheer is a hybrid building - derived in part,Paragraph
from the 19th-century arcade (see Pomerantsev’s New,Paragraph
"Trading Lines, Moscow, of 1893) and in part from the Middle",Paragraph
Eastern casbah - Willis-Faber with its central escalator,Paragraph
access hall lies somewhere between the 20th-century office,Paragraph
tower and the 19th-century department store. The case can,Paragraph
"be made, as G.C. Argan has proposed, that building types",Paragraph
embody certain values which were inherent at their,Paragraph
inception and which survive any subsequent transposition. It,Paragraph
is surely pertinent to the cultural significance of these,Paragraph
buildings that in both cases the tertiary industry of,Paragraph
informational exchange has come to be housed in spatial,Paragraph
"types which, in part at least, were once spaces of",Paragraph
consumption - the casbah and the department store. It is,Paragraph
against this background that Centraal Beheer can be seen,Paragraph
as an attempt to overcome the bureaucratic division of,Paragraph
labour through the ‘anthropological’ occupation of its,Paragraph
"labyrinthine office landscape. As in the traditional casbah,",Paragraph
Hertzberger’s fragmented Burolandschaft encourages a,Paragraph
pattern of behaviour that oscillates constantly between,Paragraph
"moments of work and moments of relaxation. In Willis-Faber,",Paragraph
"on the other hand, we are confronted with a Burolandschaft",Paragraph
that is a natural successor to Bentham’s Panopticon of,Paragraph
"1791, an open-plan form whose unremitting panorama of",Paragraph
order and control is supposedly compensated for by the,Paragraph
provision of centralized amenities such as the staff,Paragraph
restaurant and the swimming pool. Since these facilities are,Paragraph
equally subject to company control the scope of the,Paragraph
Panoptic domain appears to be total.,Paragraph
The contrast between these buildings also extends to the,Paragraph
ambience established by their detailing. The exposed,Paragraph
concrete-block partitions used throughout the Centraal,Paragraph
Beheer are supposed to provoke the ‘anarchistic’,Paragraph
appropriation of the space while Willis-Faber posits the,Paragraph
corporate image of a hypothetically egalitarian and affluent,Paragraph
society through the absolute impeccability of its pristine,Paragraph
skin and interior. Willis-Faber’s undulating curtain wall,Caption

The Willis-Faber building is Mies van der Rohe’s ‘almost,Paragraph
nothing’ stripped of its Classicism and brought through the,Paragraph
use of mirror-glass not only to answer the contextual,Paragraph
imperative of relating to the scale and texture of the,Paragraph
"existing urban environment - in this instance, by simply",Paragraph
reflecting it - but also to respond to the modernist,Paragraph

proffers a range of constantly changing kinaesthetic,Paragraph

paradoxical way it shares with its Dutch counterpart the lack,Paragraph
"of any naturally inflective syntax, with the result that its",Paragraph
entry is almost as invisible as the entrance to the Centraal,Paragraph
Beheer.,Paragraph
Productivism in its purest sense is virtually,Paragraph
"indistinguishable, as a ‘modernist’ position, from the view",Paragraph
which holds that an authentic modern architecture can and,Paragraph
"should be nothing more than elegant engineering, or",Paragraph
certainly a product of industrial design on a giant scale. As |,Paragraph
"have already indicated, this is a view that has many",Paragraph
"antecedents in the history of the Modern Movement, not",Paragraph
least among them the pioneering work of the French,Paragraph

the engineer Vladimir Bodiansky and the architects Marcel,Title
Lods and Eugéne Beaudouin.,Paragraph
In taking Mies literally at his word (i.e. in the cult of,Paragraph
"‘almost nothing’), one wing of Productivism has",Paragraph
"concentrated on air-Supported, inflatable structures, as",Paragraph
exemplified by Yutaka Murata’s Fuji Pavilion for Expo ’70 at,Paragraph
"Osaka, or on cable-suspended tent construction, of which",Paragraph
the leading exponent is the German architect/engineer Frei,Paragraph
Otto. Although Otto’s earliest tented structures date from,Paragraph
"the mid-1950s, he came to prominence with the large tents",Paragraph

The basic precepts of Productivism may be summarized,Paragraph
"as follows. In the first place, the building ‘task’ should be",Paragraph
"accommodated, as far as is feasible, in an undecorated shed",Paragraph
"or hangar, this loft structure to be kept as open and as",Paragraph
flexible as possible (on the model of the post-Second World,Paragraph
"War bdrolandschaft ideal). In the second place, the",Paragraph
adaptability of this volume should be maintained by the,Paragraph
provision of a homogeneous and integrated network of,Paragraph
"services - power, light, heat and ventilation (see Cedric",Title
Price’s concept of well-serviced anonymity). The third,Paragraph
precept concerns the necessity of articulating and,Paragraph
"expressing both the structure and the services, usually",Paragraph
achieved by following Kahn's famous separation of served,Paragraph
and servant spaces. This last precept is patently,Paragraph
"demonstrated in the larger works of Richard Rogers, in his",Paragraph
Centre Pompidou and later in his headquarters building for,Caption
"Lloyd’s of London, designed in 1976 and completed some",Paragraph
eight years later. The same basic idea is given a more,Paragraph
discreet (and ultimately more serviceable) expression in,Paragraph

the University of East Anglia outside Norwich in 1978. Here,Paragraph
the servant space is accommodated precisely within the,Paragraph
depth of the trussed tubular steel supporting frames and 33-,Caption
metre spans (see Kahn's Salk Institute at La Jolla of 1965:,Paragraph
fig. 250). The fourth and all-important precept of,Paragraph
Productivism is of course the ‘unimpeded’ manifestation of,Paragraph
"production itself, that is the expression of all component",Paragraph
parts as Produktformen - a hardline rule which is rarely,Paragraph
obeyed within the buildings of American minimalists (who,Paragraph
"show little interest in revealed construction), though both",Paragraph
American and British Productivists strive for a smooth all-,Paragraph
enveloping ‘consumerist’ skin. As Andrew Peckham,Paragraph
"observed of the Sainsbury Centre, ‘[Foster’s] ability to",Paragraph
persuade us doesn’t hinge on the traditional language of,Paragraph
architecture but rather on the language of the modern,Paragraph
material world - of industrial production and consumable,Title
finishes’.,Paragraph
One of the few basic variables in the Productivist,Paragraph
approach is the extent to which the skin or the skeleton is,Paragraph
the dominant mode of expression. This differentiation,Paragraph
formerly permitted one to distinguish between the,Paragraph
respective rhetorical attitudes adopted by the Foster and,Paragraph
"Rogers practices, with the former ultimately favouring the",Paragraph
skin and the latter placing the prime expressive burden on,Paragraph
"the structure. Foster Associates modified their approach,",Paragraph
"however, turning increasingly towards the extrinsic",Paragraph
"expression of structure, most notably in their Renault",Paragraph
"factory at Swindon, Wiltshire, completed in 1983, and in",Paragraph
their headquarters building for the Hongkong and Shanghai,Paragraph
"Banking Corporation in Hong Kong, designed in 1979 [313].",Paragraph
More than any of the more fantastic structures envisaged by,Paragraph
"Archigram or Buckminster Fuller, this layered skyscraper",Paragraph
(comprising three 16.2-metre [53-foot] deep slabs rising to,Paragraph
"28, 35 and 41 storeys respectively) invites comparison with",Paragraph
the rocket-launching structures of Cape Canaveral - not for,Paragraph
"its overall size, but for the colossal scale of its articulated",Paragraph
"components, above all for its double-height deep, giant",Paragraph
"exposed tubular steel trusses, spanning 38.4 metres (126",Caption
"feet), from which the floors are suspended, grouped in sets,",Paragraph
"seven at the bottom, then six, then five, and finally four",Paragraph
floors which top out the structure. Foster’s own words are,Paragraph
only too eloquent of the strange mixture of reality and,Paragraph
techno-romanticism which determined this building’s form:,Paragraph
"313 Foster Associates, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation",Caption
"headquarters, Hong Kong, 1979-84.",Caption
The difficulties of building rapidly and quietly on a tight site,Paragraph
have been resolved by a combination of technologies,Paragraph
ranging trom indigenous craft-based family units to the spin-,Paragraph
off from aerospace and other advanced industries. For,Paragraph
example the fastest way to place caissons is to hand-dig,Paragraph
them - a locally based technique that also happens to be,Paragraph
noise-free. Likewise the most elegantly efficient structures,Paragraph
to be seen in the Colony are the spider-webs of bamboo,Paragraph
scaffolding which mark virtually all construction sites.,Paragraph
However given the amount of imported hardware that,Paragraph
"buildings comprise, as well as an awareness of the very real",Paragraph
"relationship between weight and performance, the design",Paragraph
has been strongly influenced by sources outside the,Paragraph
traditional building industry. These range from the Concorde,Paragraph
"design team, to military establishments coping with mobile",Paragraph
bridges to take tank loadings to the world of aircraft sub-,Paragraph
"contractors, particularly in the States.?1",Paragraph
Foster’s approach has been at its best when the repeated,Paragraph
structural unit and the overall image of the building are,Paragraph
"mutually complementary, thereby yielding a structurally",Paragraph
"explicit yet self-sufficient form, as in the Renault Centre and",Paragraph
in the athletic stadium projected for Frankfurt in 1986. The,Paragraph
latter is shown roofed by a shallow 70-metre (230-foot) arch,Paragraph
in tubular steel latticework. The hollow hexagonal cells,Paragraph
formed by this double-layered roof structure afford ample,Paragraph
surface and interstitial volume both for the filtration of,Paragraph
daylight and for the accommodation of ventilation and,Paragraph
lighting. The structural thrust of this metal roof is passed,Paragraph
through hinged joints mounted on a series of in situ,Paragraph
concrete ribs cast integrally with the recessed earthwork,Caption
that is stepped so as to provide for stadium seating.,Paragraph
"The Third London Airport at Stansted [314], completed in",Paragraph
"1991, is similarly articulated about the theme of roofwork",Paragraph
"versus earthwork, the terminal building comprising a single",Paragraph

"sided terminal, roofed by an ingenious assembly of twenty-",Paragraph
"two shallow domes, is divided by low partitions into",Paragraph

Post-Modernism,Title
"The architectural section of the Venice Biennale of 1980,",Paragraph

its legitimacy in exclusively formal - not to say superficial -,Paragraph
"terms, rather than in terms of constructional, organizational",Paragraph
or socio-cultural considerations (such as were still central to,Paragraph

in the major monuments of the period.,Paragraph

"Needless to say, the most distinguished American",Paragraph
"architects of the preceding decades, Mies van der Rohe and",Paragraph

historical legacy and to a reassembly of its precepts and,Paragraph
components in accordance with the technological capacity,Paragraph
"of the epoch: the work remained expressive of its time, even",Paragraph
if certain tectonic elements and compositional models were,Paragraph
patently (and even polemically) determined by historical,Paragraph
precedents. Mies van der Rohe’s Neue Nationalgalerie in,Paragraph
"Berlin (commissioned 1961, built 1965-68) and Kahn’s",Paragraph
"Kimbell Art Museum at Fort Worth, Texas (1967-72) illustrate",Caption
"this, the one tied to Schinkel and 19th-century ferrovitreous",Paragraph
"engineering, the other to Mediterranean vaulted",Title
construction and the tectonics of reinforced concrete.,Paragraph
Millennialistic utopianism is of course largely absent from,Paragraph
"the later work of both men, the focus being instead upon",Paragraph
the irreducible nature of tectonic construction and upon its,Paragraph
"sublime interaction with light, as the two transhistorical",Paragraph
"conditions of architecture, and, in Kahn’s case, upon a form",Paragraph
"of cosmological, cabbalistic mysticism. Both Mies and Kahn",Paragraph
would have seen the advent of Post-Modernism as cultural,Paragraph
decadence; and indeed we have Kahn's aphoristic reproach,Paragraph
"to Venturi, on seeing his proposal for the Philadelphia",Paragraph
"Bicentennial ‘strip’, to the effect that ‘colour ain’t",Paragraph
architecture’.,Paragraph
"We may claim, in this regard, that no ‘master’ architects",Paragraph
in history were more misunderstood by their immediate,Paragraph
pupils and heirs than Mies and Kahn. Mies was patently,Paragraph
gratified by his success in formulating the normative,Paragraph
"American mode of corporate building from 1950 to 1975,",Paragraph
the Miesian format becoming standard for a certain sector,Paragraph
of development in the post-war world (see Arthur Drexler’s,Paragraph
"‘Buildings for Business and Government’, MoMA, 1959), but",Paragraph
both he and Kahn tended to find that the latent qualities of,Paragraph
their work were better appreciated in Europe. Thus while the,Paragraph
"Skidmore, Owings and Merrill-dominated Chicago School",Paragraph
"succeeded in following Mies with verve and audacity,",Paragraph
"architects like Myron Goldsmith (United Airlines, Des Plaines,",Paragraph
"Illinois, 1962), Gene Summers (McCormick Place, Chicago,",Caption
1971) and Arthur Takeuchi (Wendell Smith Elementary,Title
"School, Chicago, 1973) all failed to arrive at a fresh point of",Paragraph
"departure, possibly because they were unable to appreciate",Paragraph
sufficiently the Romantic Classical and Suprematist,Title
dimensions which lay hidden in Mies’s work. In the same,Paragraph
"way Kahn, despite his disciples of the Philadelphia School",Paragraph
"(Moore, Venturi, Vreeland and Giurgola), ultimately found a",Paragraph
more sensitive following in Italian Neo-Rationalism and,Paragraph
Dutch Structuralism.,Paragraph
"This eclipse of Late Modernism in America, together with the",Paragraph
‘consensus’ rejection of what Jurgen Habermas called the,Paragraph
"‘unfinished modern project’, as this had been so fervently",Paragraph
integrated into the myth and reality of American,Paragraph
"development over the past century, is nowhere more",Paragraph
evident than in the current repudiation of Frank Lloyd,Paragraph
"Wright, particularly when one considers Wright’s",Paragraph
indisputable status as one of the most fertile architects of,Paragraph
"this century. It is significant how, apart from the antiquarian",Paragraph
"art market, Wright continues to be ignored by the American",Paragraph
"protagonists of Post-Modernism, despite the efforts of",Paragraph
Charles Jencks to validate Michael Graves by way of Wright,Caption
in his book Kings of Infinite Space (1983). The reason for,Paragraph
"this amnesia is not hard to find, since Wright has to be",Paragraph
counted among those modernists (Aalto would be another),Paragraph
whose work can in no way be dismissed as reductive or,Paragraph
inaccessible. One may advance as evidence to the contrary,Paragraph
the 200 Usonian houses which Wright built in his own,Paragraph
lifetime and think of them as an attempt to render the,Paragraph
generic suburb as a cultivated domain.,Paragraph
It is difficult to arrive at the fundamental character of the,Paragraph
Post-Modern phenomenon as this has emerged in,Paragraph
architecture and almost every other cultural field. From one,Paragraph
point of view it has to be acknowledged as an,Paragraph
understandable reaction to the pressures of societal,Paragraph
modernization and thus as an escape from the tendency of,Paragraph
contemporary life to be totally dominated by the values of,Paragraph
the scientific-industrial complex. Yet while the utopian,Paragraph
emancipatory aims of the Enlightenment may now have to,Paragraph
be relinquished in the name of more effective and,Paragraph
"reassuring forms of realism, there is little evidence that",Paragraph
"modern society either can or, finally, wishes to renounce the",Paragraph
"fundamental ‘benefits’ of modernization. Moreover, as",Paragraph
Habermas suggested in his Theodor Adorno Prize address of,Paragraph
"1980, it is the speed and rapacity of modern development,",Paragraph
"rather than avant-gardist culture, that is responsible for",Paragraph
"disruptions and disappointments, together with this",Paragraph
"apparently popular rejection of the new. In the end, even the",Paragraph
staunchest Neo-Conservative will admit there is little chance,Paragraph
"of resisting, in real terms, the relentless progress of",Paragraph
modernization.,Paragraph
If there is a general principle that can be said to,Paragraph
"characterize Post-Modern architecture, it is the conscious",Paragraph
ruination of style and the cannibalization of architectural,Title
"form, as though no value either traditional or otherwise can",Paragraph
withstand for long the tendency of the,Paragraph
production/consumption cycle to reduce every civic,Title
institution to some kind of consumerism and to undermine,Paragraph
every traditional quality. Today the division of labour and the,Paragraph
imperatives of ‘monopolized’ economy are such as to,Paragraph
reduce the practice of architecture to large-scale packaging;,Paragraph
"and at least one Post-Modern architect, Helmut Jahn, has",Paragraph
frankly acknowledged that this is how he sees his role. At its,Paragraph
"most predetermined, Post-Modernism reduces architecture",Paragraph
to a condition in which the ‘package deal’ arranged by the,Paragraph
builder/developer determines the carcass and the essential,Paragraph
"substance of the work, while the architect is reduced to",Paragraph
contributing a suitably seductive mask. This is the,Paragraph
predominant situation in city-centre development in,Paragraph
"America today, where high-rise towers are either reduced to",Paragraph
"the ‘silence’ of their totally glazed, reflective envelopes or",Paragraph
alternatively dressed in devalued historical trappings of one,Paragraph
kind or another. Indeed Jahn’s Popular Machinism must be,Paragraph
regarded as an attempt to combine both strategies.,Paragraph
Irrespective of whether this dematerialized historicism is,Paragraph
made of actual stone and hence of necessity suspended,Paragraph
"from heavily reinforced steel skeletons, as in the case of",Paragraph
"Philip Johnson’s AT&T headquarters building, New York",Caption
"(1978-84), or whether more moderately it is a decorative",Paragraph
"curtain wall of glass hung off steel, or even whether, as in",Paragraph
"the case of Michael Graves’s Portland Building in Portland,",Paragraph
"Oregon (1979-82) [316], it is a painted concrete ‘billboard’",Paragraph
which enlarges to a gargantuan scale the graphic image of a,Paragraph
"‘ruined’ and hence idealized garden folly, the result is",Paragraph
"fundamentally the same; that is to say, it is the Populist",Paragraph
"format of Venturi’s ‘decorated shed’. In any event, in all",Paragraph
three options the impulse is scenographic rather than,Paragraph
"tectonic, so that not only is there a total schism between",Paragraph
"the inner substance and the outer form, but the form itself",Paragraph
either repudiates its constructional origin or dissipates its,Paragraph
palpability. In Post-Modern architecture classical and,Paragraph
vernacular ‘quotations’ tend to interpenetrate each other,Paragraph
"disconcertingly. Invariably rendered as unfocused images,",Paragraph
"they easily disintegrate and mix with other more abstract,",Paragraph
"usually cubistic forms, for which the architect has no more",Paragraph
respect than for his extremely arbitrary historical allusions.,Paragraph
"316 Graves, Portland Building, Portland, Oregon, 1979-82.",Caption
Michael Graves has been a symptomatic figure in this,Paragraph
whole development. The method and the substance of his,Paragraph
Post-Cubist collages (be they painted or built) changed,Paragraph
radically around 1975 as he fell under the influence of Léon,Paragraph
Krier’s Neo-Classical ‘speculations’ and as Krier himself,Paragraph
proceeded to eliminate all traces of modernist syntax from,Paragraph
his own work. (Compare Krier’s Royal Mint Square project of,Paragraph
"1974 to his Lilliputian St Quentin-en-Yvelines school of 1978,",Paragraph
where this expurgation has been brought to its logical,Paragraph
"conclusion.) Similarly, Graves passed from his still",Paragraph
‘modernist’ Crooks House project (1976) to the Neo-,Paragraph
"Classical ‘folly’ of his Fargo-Moorhead Cultural Center,",Paragraph
proposed in 1977 for the twin towns on either side of the,Paragraph
state line dividing Minnesota from North Dakota. From this,Paragraph
point onwards ‘inverted’ Ledoux-like motifs prevail in his,Paragraph
"work, mixed with episodic fragments drawn from Krier,",Paragraph
"Hoffmann, Gilly, Schinkel, Cubism and even Art Deco.",Paragraph
"Graves’s largest work at the time, the Portland Building,",Paragraph
projected him into the centre of the Post-Modern furore with,Paragraph
a public building where the most contentious aspect derived,Paragraph
from the arbitrary painted configurations of the facade. To,Paragraph
"start with, the clients vigorously objected to the smallness",Paragraph
"of the predominantly square, pierced windows, on the",Paragraph
"grounds that in Oregon the sky is generally overcast, and as",Paragraph
"a result the windows were slightly enlarged. Then, as built,",Paragraph
the building was criticized on architectonic grounds for the,Paragraph
"total falseness of its seemingly large windows, much of",Paragraph
which consists of heavily tinted plate glass ‘drawn’,Paragraph
"deceptively over solid concrete walls. Finally, and perhaps",Paragraph
"most seriously, it was challenged for its surprisingly",Paragraph
insensitive attitude towards the site. Unlike the Beaux Arts,Paragraph
buildings on either side - the City Hall and the County,Caption
Courthouse - the Portland Building fails to acknowledge,Title
(except for a service entrance) the public amenity of the,Paragraph
"park to the south, and it also presents, despite its arcaded",Paragraph
"ground floor, a strangely inhospitable frontage to the",Paragraph
surrounding streets.,Paragraph
Graves later gained commissions which seemed to be,Paragraph
"more suited to his imagistic approach, as one may judge",Paragraph
from the diminutive civic scale of the Public Library in San,Caption
"Juan Capistrano, California (1983), with its regionally",Paragraph
"inflected Spanish Colonial roofs. Even here, however, a",Paragraph
"feeling begins to obtrude that like Olbrich, to whom his",Paragraph
astonishing talent may be compared more revealingly than,Paragraph
"to Wright, he is more of a designer of objets d’art than an",Paragraph
"architect. With the later Graves, as Peter Eisenman put it, ‘a",Paragraph
"house, for example, is no longer conceived as a house (a",Paragraph
social or ideological entity) or as an object (in itself) but,Paragraph
rather as a painting of an object’.,Paragraph
"As with Graves, so with many figures who had hitherto",Paragraph
"occupied Late Modernist positions - not only James Stirling,",Paragraph
"Philip Johnson and Hans Hollein, but other more recent",Paragraph
converts to the Post-Modernist position such as Romaldo,Paragraph
"Giurgola, Moshe Safdie and Kevin Roche. In each instance,",Paragraph
"and to different degrees, the discourse of a ‘dematerialized’",Paragraph
historicism has been self-consciously embraced and virtually,Paragraph
mixed at random with modernist fragments. More often than,Paragraph
not the result is an inconclusive and seemingly pointless,Paragraph
‘cacophony’ in which the architect loses control of his,Paragraph
material. This latter-day version of the ‘disappearance of the,Paragraph
"author’ is manifest in Stirling’s work, notably in his Stuttgart",Paragraph
Staatsgalerie [317]. While that is the most distinguished,Paragraph
"public building of Stirling’s later career - emerging, as it did,",Paragraph
out of three successive ‘neo-classical’ designs for German,Paragraph
museums in the second half of the 1970s - it is also a,Paragraph
strangely mixed and conflictive design. Framed in reinforced,Paragraph
"concrete, meticulously detailed and finished in finely",Paragraph
"wrought ashlar, the Staatsgalerie, while far from",Paragraph
"scenographic, is nonetheless atectonic in its general",Paragraph
"expression; that is to say, it is closer to Hoffmann and",Paragraph
"Asplund, above all to Asplund’s Woodland Cemetery",Caption
"Crematorium, Stockholm, of 1939, than it is to the avant-",Paragraph
"gardist, Constructivist precepts which inspired Stirling’s",Paragraph
early career. The differences between Stirling and Asplund,Paragraph
"are equally significant, in particular the replacement of",Paragraph
Asplund’s sense of liberal civitas - his feeling for an,Paragraph
egalitarian civic identity - by Stirling’s ‘classical-populism’. |,Paragraph
"am referring to Stirling’s conviction, derived no doubt from",Paragraph
"modern museum management, that today the museum is",Paragraph
not only an edifying institution but also a place of distraction,Paragraph
and amusement. This last accounts for the mediation of the,Paragraph
overall monumentality of the Staatsgalerie by certain,Paragraph
"Constructivist-influenced episodes, by a dramatically",Paragraph
"undulating curtain wall, by outsize tubular handrails, by",Paragraph
"symbolic aedicules in light tubular steel, in fact a whole",Paragraph
"plethora of brightly-coloured, toy-like elements designed to",Paragraph
appeal to the man in the street.,Paragraph
ee,Title
"317 Stirling, Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart, 1980-83.",Caption
A similar approach asserted itself in other museum work,Paragraph
"by Stirling, the extension to the Fogg Museum at Harvard",Paragraph
and the extension to the Tate Gallery in London. As far as,Paragraph
the Tate is concerned it is as though the tradition of tectonic,Paragraph
culture was being consumed before our eyes by the,Paragraph
fashionable rediscovery of architectural rendering.,Paragraph
Another form of ‘disappearance’ is to eliminate the,Paragraph
"building altogether, to bury it in the earth so that it at once",Paragraph
becomes an introverted interior rather than a testament to,Paragraph
civic virtue. Hollein’s Ménchengladbach museum (1983) and,Caption
Giurgola’s Australian Parliament Building in Canberra,Caption
(completed in 1988) are but two examples of this approach.,Paragraph
Hollein seems to be the only figure among the Post-,Paragraph
Modernists who was able to combine an indulgence in craft,Paragraph
aestheticism with a revealing critical distance. This,Paragraph
dichotomous brilliance was unequivocally demonstrated in,Paragraph
"his ‘anti-fagade’ for the Venice Biennale of 1980, wherein he",Paragraph
rang the changes from ‘reality’ to ‘illusion’ and from ‘art’ to,Paragraph
‘nature’ around the theme of the archetypal column (fig.,Paragraph
315). Greater scope for wit and high-quality finish had in,Paragraph
fact already presented itself to Hollein some three years,Paragraph
"earlier, when he realized an elaborate ceramic exhibition at",Paragraph
the Tehran Museum (1977). In many respects that,Paragraph
"commission served to crystallize his high metaphoric style,",Paragraph
which he also demonstrated in his Israeli and Austrian travel,Paragraph
bureaus in Vienna realized between 1976 and 1978 [318]. It,Paragraph
"is no accident, as Friedrich Achleitner implied in his essay",Paragraph
"‘Viennese Positions’ (1981), that Hollein was at his best in",Paragraph
the design of interiors. Achleitner’s brilliant analysis of,Paragraph
Hollein’s relationship to Viennese culture merits quoting at,Paragraph
length:,Title
"318 Hollein, travel agency in Opernring, Vienna, 1976-78.",Caption
"To do justice to Hollein, one cannot ignore the Viennese",Paragraph
"reality, where there is a tradition that is too old and a",Paragraph
sensibility that is too highly developed with regard to the,Paragraph
architectural setting as a counter-reality or a substitute,Paragraph
"reality. Going right back to Baroque, and maybe even",Paragraph
"earlier, the ambivalence of the media of music and",Paragraph
architecture (arising out of the repression of literature by,Paragraph
the Hapsburgs) was favoured above the presentation of,Paragraph
"evident realities, and came to reflect collective and",Paragraph
individual psychic states. The funeral processions and,Paragraph
parades of the Hapsburgs had heralded the enactment of,Paragraph
the passing away of the aristocratic-upper bourgeois world,Title
that preceded the first world war and was reflected on the,Paragraph
aesthetic level within the Viennese secession. Vienna,Caption
"possessed a tradition of aesthetic heightening of reality, a",Paragraph
long praxis of artificial remoteness. The techniques of,Paragraph
"montage, collage, alienation, striking allusions and",Paragraph
disarming quotation are not cultivated in language alone.,Paragraph
"Hans Hollein seems not only to incorporate this tradition,",Paragraph
"but his works, seen in an extreme perspective, are to the",Paragraph
Viennese the unwelcome confirmation of an unchanged,Title
situation. The backdrops become visible once more: he,Paragraph
possesses the instruments to give them prominence. Or is,Paragraph
the travel office perhaps something different from the visual,Paragraph
treatment of the satisfaction of needs that are in,Paragraph
"themselves simple, represented by the task of supplying",Paragraph
information and travel tickets? But what many may find,Paragraph
disturbing is that the aesthetic handling of the subject does,Paragraph
not illustrate the content in a reductive fashion but the,Paragraph
"subject itself in all its facets. It is not a question, here, of",Paragraph
"information and travel documents, but of illusions, of",Paragraph
"desires, of dreams and even of clichés about the aims of",Paragraph
"travel. The client enters a world of references and illusions,",Paragraph
no object is merely itself. The hall itself is not the lobby of a,Paragraph
"travel bureau but of a railway station, or at least it creates",Paragraph
this association. The allusions possess differing degrees of,Paragraph
immediacy; they range from the banal legibility of the,Paragraph
"airline counter (Adler), of shipping companies (Reling), up to",Paragraph
the counter for theatre tickets (moving piece of scenery -,Title
the student has to guess the reason for himself) and the,Paragraph
"most subtle references to Egypt, Greece, India. Illusion and",Paragraph

accomplished parallel to Jahn’s Popular Machinism,Paragraph
understandably entails a total denial of the values placed on,Paragraph
"the monument by the Tendenza, for while this is by no",Paragraph
means the first time that mass housing has been given a,Paragraph

"architectural point of view, that there is little",Paragraph
accommodation or representation in Bofill’s work of those,Paragraph
"‘social condensers’ - nursery schools, meeting rooms,",Caption

springs up from there. We have the feeling that this single,Paragraph
world civilization at the same time exerts a sort of attrition,Paragraph
or wearing away at the expense of the cultural resources,Paragraph
which have made the great civilizations of the past. This,Paragraph
"threat is expressed, among other disturbing effects, by the",Paragraph

colonialist’s personality. But in order to take part in modern,Paragraph
"civilization, it is necessary at the same time to take part in",Paragraph
"scientific, technical, and political rationality, something",Paragraph

"how to revive an old, dormant civilization and take part in",Paragraph
universal civilization. ...,Paragraph
No one can say what will become of our civilization when,Paragraph
it has really met different civilizations by means other than,Paragraph
the shock of conquest and domination. But we have to,Paragraph
admit that this encounter has not yet taken place at the,Paragraph

dogmatism of a single truth and in which we are not yet,Paragraph
capable of conquering the skepticism into which we have,Paragraph
"stepped. We are in a tunnel, at the twilight of dogmatism",Paragraph
and the dawn of real dialogues.,Paragraph
Paul Ricoeur,Title
"‘Universal Civilization and National Cultures’, 19611",Caption
The term ‘Critical Regionalism’ is not intended to denote the,Paragraph
vernacular as this was once spontaneously produced by the,Paragraph
"combined interaction of climate, culture, myth and craft, but",Paragraph
rather to identify those recent regional ‘schools’ whose,Paragraph
primary aim has been to reflect and serve the limited,Paragraph
constituencies in which they are grounded. Among other,Paragraph
factors contributing to the emergence of a regionalism of,Paragraph
this order is not only a certain prosperity but also some kind,Paragraph
of anti-centrist consensus - an aspiration at least to some,Paragraph
"form of cultural, economic and political independence.",Paragraph
The concept of a local or national culture is a paradoxical,Paragraph
proposition not only because of the present obvious,Paragraph
antithesis between rooted culture and universal civilization,Title
"but also because all cultures, both ancient and modern,",Paragraph
seem to have depended for their intrinsic development on a,Paragraph
certain cross-fertilization with other cultures. As Ricoeur,Paragraph
"seems to imply in the passage quoted above, regional or",Paragraph
"national cultures must today, more than ever, be ultimately",Paragraph
constituted as locally inflected manifestations of ‘world,Paragraph
culture’. It is surely no accident that this paradoxical,Paragraph
proposition arises at a time when global modernization,Paragraph
"continues to undermine, with ever increasing force, all forms",Paragraph
"of traditional, agrarian-based, autochthonous culture. From",Paragraph
the point of view of critical theory we have to regard,Paragraph
regional culture not as something given and relatively,Paragraph
"immutable but rather as something which has, at least",Paragraph
"today, to be self-consciously cultivated. Ricoeur suggests",Paragraph
that sustaining any kind of authentic culture in the future,Paragraph
will depend ultimately on our capacity to generate vital,Paragraph
forms of regional culture while appropriating alien influences,Paragraph
at the level of both culture and civilization.,Paragraph
Such a process of assimilation and reinterpretation,Paragraph
seems to be evident in the work of the Danish master Jgrn,Paragraph
"Utzon, above all in his Bagsvaerd Church [323], completed",Caption
"in a suburb outside Copenhagen in 1976, wherein precast",Paragraph
concrete infill elements of standardized dimensions are,Paragraph
"combined, in a particularly articulate way, with /n-situ",Paragraph
reinforced-concrete shell vaults which span the principal,Caption
public volumes. And while this combination of modular,Paragraph
assembly and /n-situ casting may appear at first to be,Paragraph
nothing more than an appropriate integration of the full,Paragraph
"range of concrete techniques which are now at our disposal,",Paragraph
the case can be made that the way in which these,Paragraph
techniques are combined alludes to a number of dialogically,Paragraph
opposed values.,Paragraph
"323 Utzon, Bagsvaerd Church, near Copenhagen, 1976: longitudinal section.",Caption
"At one level, we may claim that prefabricated modular",Paragraph
assembly not only accords with the values of universal,Paragraph
civilization but also ‘represents’ its capacity for normative,Paragraph
"application, whereas an in-situ shell vault is a ‘one-off’",Paragraph
structural invention built into a unique site. It may be,Paragraph
"argued, in the light of Ricoeur, that where the one affirms",Paragraph
"the norms of universal civilization, the other proclaims the",Paragraph
"values of idiosyncratic culture. Similarly, we may construe",Paragraph
these different forms of concrete construction as setting the,Paragraph
rationality of normative technique against the arationality of,Paragraph
symbolic structure.,Paragraph
Yet another dialogue is evoked as soon as one passes,Paragraph
from the economically optimum modular cladding of the,Paragraph
exterior (be it the concrete panels or the patent glazing in,Paragraph
the roof) to the far from optimum /n-situ frame and shell,Paragraph
"vault spanning the nave. Such vaulting, a relatively",Paragraph
uneconomic mode of construction when compared say to,Paragraph
"steel trusswork, has been deliberately selected for its",Paragraph
symbolic capacity: the vault signifies the sacred in Western,Paragraph
culture. And yet the highly configurated section adopted in,Paragraph
this instance can hardly be regarded as Western. Indeed the,Paragraph
only precedent for such a section in a sacred context is,Paragraph
"Eastern - the Chinese pagoda roof, cited by Utzon in his",Paragraph
"seminal essay of 1962, ‘Platforms and Plateaus: Ideas of a",Paragraph
Danish Architect’.,Paragraph
The subtle and contrary allusions incorporated into this,Paragraph
folded concrete shell roof have far greater consequence,Paragraph
than the seeming perversity of reinterpreting an oriental,Paragraph
timber form in occidental concrete technology; for while the,Paragraph
main vault over the nave suggests by its scale and top,Caption
"illumination the presence of a religious space, it does so in",Paragraph
such a way as to preclude an exclusively occidental or,Paragraph
oriental reading of the form by which it is constituted. A,Paragraph
similar occidental/oriental interpenetration also occurs in,Paragraph
the wooden fenestration and slatted partitions which seem,Paragraph
to allude both to the Nordic vernacular of the stave church,Paragraph
and to the fretted traditional timberwork of China and Japan.,Paragraph
The intention behind these procedures of deconstruction,Paragraph
"and resynthesis seems to be as follows: first, to revitalize",Paragraph
certain devalued Occidental forms through an Oriental,Paragraph
recasting of their essential nature; and second to indicate,Paragraph
the secularization of the institutions represented by these,Paragraph
forms. This is arguably a more appropriate way to render a,Paragraph
"church in a secular age, where traditional ecclesiastical",Paragraph
iconography always risks degenerating into kitsch.,Paragraph
This revitalization of occidental elements with oriental,Paragraph
profiles and vice versa by no means exhausts the ways in,Paragraph
which the Bagsvaerd Church is inflected with regard to its,Paragraph
situation in time and place. Utzon has also given ita,Paragraph
"barnlike form, using an agricultural metaphor as a way of",Paragraph
giving public expression to a sacred institution. But this,Paragraph
"somewhat cryptic metaphor, associating religion with",Paragraph
"agrarian culture, may well change somewhat with the",Paragraph
"passage of time, for when the surrounding saplings have",Paragraph
matured the church will for the first time appear within its,Paragraph
"own proper boundaries. This natural temenos, established",Paragraph
"by a veil of trees, will no doubt encourage a future reading",Paragraph
of the building as a temple rather than a barn.,Paragraph
Exemplary of an explicitly anti-centrist regionalism was,Paragraph
the Catalan nationalist movement which first emerged with,Paragraph
"the foundation of Grup R in Barcelona in 1952. This group,",Paragraph
"led by J.M. Sostres and Oriol Bohigas, found itself caught",Paragraph
from the beginning in a complex cultural situation. On the,Paragraph
"one hand, it was obliged to revive the Rationalist, anti-",Paragraph
Fascist values and procedures of GATEPAC (the pre-war,Title
"Spanish wing of CIAM); on the other, it remained aware of",Paragraph
"the political responsibility to evoke a realistic regionalism,",Paragraph
accessible to the populace at large. This double-headed,Paragraph
programme was first publicly announced by Bohigas in his,Paragraph
"essay, ‘Possibilities for a Barcelona Architecture’, published",Caption
in 1951. The various cultural impulses that made up this,Paragraph
heterogeneous Regionalism tend to confirm the unavoidably,Paragraph
"hybrid nature of modern regional culture. In the first place,",Paragraph
there was the Catalan brick tradition which dated back to,Paragraph
the period of ‘Modernismo’; then there was the influence of,Paragraph
Neutra and Neo-Plasticism - the latter indubitably,Paragraph
stimulated by Bruno Zevi’s La Poetica dell’architettura,Paragraph
neoplastica of 1953. There followed the influential Neo-,Paragraph
"Realist style of the Italian architect Ignazio Gardella, who",Paragraph
"employed traditional shutters, narrow windows and wide",Paragraph
"overhanging eaves in his Casa Borsalino at Alessandria, Italy",Caption
"(1951-53). To this must be added, particularly for the",Paragraph
"practice of Mackay, Bohigas and Martorell, the influence of",Paragraph
British New Brutalism (see their Paseo de la Bonanova,Title
apartments in Barcelona of 1973).,Paragraph
The career of the Barcelona architect J.A. Coderch has,Paragraph
"been typically regionalist inasmuch as it has oscillated, until",Paragraph
"recent date, between a Mediterraneanized, modern brick",Paragraph
vernacular first formulated in his eight-storey ISM apartment,Paragraph
"block [324, 325], built in Barcelona in the Paseo Nacional in",Caption
1951 (‘traditionally’ articulated like the Casa Borsalino with,Paragraph
"full-height shutters and thin overhanging cornices), and the",Paragraph
"avant-gardist, Neo-Plastic cum Miesian composition of his",Paragraph
Casa Catasus completed at Sitges in 1956 [326].,Caption
"324, 325 Coderch, ISM apartment block, Barcelona, 1951: view and typical floor",Caption
plan.,Paragraph
"326 Coderch, Casa Catasus, Sitges, 1956: ground plan.",Caption
The more recent deliquescence of Catalan Regionalism is,Paragraph
possibly most evident in the work of Ricardo Bofill and the,Paragraph
Taller de Arquitectura. For where Bofill’s Calle Nicaragua,Caption
apartments of 1964 displayed an affinity for the,Paragraph
"reinterpreted brick vernacular of Coderch, the Taller was to",Paragraph
adopt an overtly Gesamtkunstwerk approach in the late,Paragraph
"1960s. With their Xanadu complex built in Calpe in 1967,",Paragraph
they indulged in a form of kitsch romanticism. This,Paragraph
obsession with castle images reached its apotheosis in their,Paragraph
"heroic, but ostentatious, tile-faced Walden 7 complex at",Caption
"Sant Just Desvern, Barcelona (1970-75). With its twelve-",Paragraph
"storey voids, underlit living rooms, minuscule balconies and",Caption
"its now disintegrating tile cladding, Walden 7 marks that",Paragraph
unfortunate boundary where what was initially a critical,Paragraph
impulse degenerates into highly photogenic scenography. In,Paragraph
"the last analysis, despite its passing homage to Gaudi,",Paragraph
Walden 7 displays an affinity for admass seduction. It is an,Paragraph
"architecture of narcissism par excellence, for the formal",Paragraph
rhetoric addresses itself to high fashion and to the mystique,Paragraph
of Bofill’s flamboyant personality. The Mediterranean,Paragraph
hedonistic utopia to which Walden 7 pretends collapses on,Paragraph
"closer inspection, above all at the level of the roofscape",Paragraph
where a potentially sensuous environment has not been,Paragraph
realized in occupation (compare Le Corbusier's Unité,Paragraph
d’Habitation at Marseilles).,Paragraph
Nothing could be further from Bofill’s intentions than the,Paragraph
"architecture of the Portuguese master Alvaro Siza Vieira,",Paragraph
"whose career, beginning with his swimming pool at the",Paragraph
"Quinta da Conceicgao, Matosinhos (1958-65), has been",Paragraph
anything but photogenic. This much can be discerned not,Paragraph
only from the fragmentary evasive nature of the published,Paragraph
images but also from a text written in 1979:,Paragraph
Most of my works were never published; some of the things,Paragraph
"| did were only carried out in part, others were profoundly",Paragraph
changed or destroyed. That’s only to be expected. An,Paragraph
architectonic proposition whose aim is to go deep... a,Paragraph
proposition that intends to be more than a passive,Paragraph
"materialization, refuses to reduce that same reality,",Paragraph
"analysing each of its aspects, one by one; that proposition",Paragraph
"can't find support in a fixed image, can’t follow a linear",Paragraph
"evolution. ... Each design is bound to catch, with the utmost",Paragraph
"rigour, a precise moment of the flittering image, in all its",Paragraph
"shades, and the better you can recognize that flittering",Paragraph
"quality of reality, the clearer your design will be. ...That may",Paragraph
"be the reason why only marginal works (a quiet dwelling, a",Paragraph
holiday house miles away) have been kept as they were,Paragraph
originally designed. But something remains. Pieces are kept,Paragraph
"here and there, inside ourselves, perhaps fathered by",Paragraph
"someone, leaving marks on space and people, melting into",Paragraph
a process of total transformation.”,Paragraph
This hypersensitivity to the transformation of a fluid and,Paragraph
yet specific reality renders Siza’s work more layered and,Paragraph
rooted than the eclectic tendencies of the Barcelona School,Paragraph
"for, by taking Aalto as his point of departure, he has",Paragraph
grounded his buildings in the configuration of a specific,Paragraph
topography and in the fine-grained texture of the local,Paragraph
fabric. To this end his pieces are tight responses to the,Paragraph
"urban, land and marinescape of the Porto region. Other",Paragraph
"important factors are his deference towards local material,",Paragraph
"craftwork, and the subtleties of local light, a deference",Paragraph
which is sustained without falling into the sentimentality of,Paragraph
excluding rational form and modern technique. Like Aalto’s,Paragraph
"Saynatsalo Town Hall, all of Siza’s buildings are delicately",Paragraph
laid into the topography of their sites. His approach is,Paragraph
"patently tactile and tectonic, rather than visual and graphic,",Paragraph
from his Beires House built at P6voa de Varzim in 1973-77,Caption
[327-329] to his Bouca Residents’ Association Housing in,Paragraph
"Porto (1973-77). Even his small urban buildings, of which",Paragraph
the best is probably the Pinto branch bank built at Oliveira,Paragraph
"de Azemeis in 1974, are topographically structured.",Paragraph
"327-329 Siza, Beires House, Pévoa de Varzim, 1973-77: view, and plans of the",Caption
upper floor and ground floor.,Paragraph
The projected work of the New York-based Austrian,Paragraph
architect Raimund Abraham seems to be informed by similar,Paragraph
"concerns, inasmuch as this architect has always stressed",Paragraph
place creation and the topographic aspects of built form.,Paragraph
The House with Three Walls (1972) and the House with,Paragraph
Flower Walls (1973) are typical of his pieces of the early,Paragraph
"1970s, wherein the project evokes an oneiric image while",Paragraph
insisting on the inescapable materiality of building. This,Paragraph
concern for tectonic form and for its capacity to transform,Paragraph
the surface of the earth has been carried over into,Paragraph
Abraham's designs made for the International Building,Caption
"Exhibition in Berlin, above all into his project for South",Paragraph
Friedrichstadt designed in 1981 [330].,Paragraph
"330 Abraham, project for South Friedrichstadt, Berlin, 1981: detail showing half",Caption
the site.,Paragraph
An equally tactile attitude obtains in the work of the,Paragraph
"veteran Mexican architect Luis Barragan, whose finest",Paragraph
"houses (many of which have been erected in Mexico City, in",Paragraph
the suburb of Pedregal) assume a topographic form. As,Paragraph
"much a landscape designer as an architect, Barragan has",Paragraph
always sought a sensual and earthbound architecture; an,Paragraph
"architecture compounded of enclosures, stelae, fountains",Caption
and watercourses; an architecture laid into volcanic rock,Paragraph
and lush vegetation; an architecture that refers indirectly to,Paragraph
the Mexican estancia. Of Barragan’s feeling for mythic and,Paragraph
rooted beginnings it is sufficient to cite his memories of the,Paragraph
apocryphal pueb/o of his youth:,Paragraph
My earliest childhood memories are related to a ranch my,Paragraph
family owned near the village of Mazamitla. It was a pueblo,Paragraph
"with hills, formed by houses with tile roofs and immense",Paragraph
eaves to shield passersby from the heavy rains which fall in,Paragraph
that area. Even the earth’s color was interesting because it,Paragraph
"was red earth. In this village, the water distribution system",Paragraph
"consisted of great gutted logs, in the form of troughs, which",Paragraph
"ran on a support structure of tree forks, 5 meters high,",Paragraph
"above the roofs. This aqueduct crossed over the town,",Paragraph
"reaching the patios, where there were great stone fountains",Paragraph
"to receive the water. The patios housed the stables, with",Paragraph
"cows and chickens, all together Outside, in the street, there",Paragraph
"were iron rings to tie the horses. The channeled logs,",Paragraph
"covered with moss, dripped water all over town, of course. It",Paragraph
"gave this village the ambience of a fairy tale. No, there are",Paragraph
no photographs. | have only its memory.3,Caption
This remembrance was surely influenced by Barragan’s,Paragraph
lifelong involvement with Islamic architecture. Similar,Paragraph
feelings and concerns are evident in his opposition to the,Paragraph
invasion of privacy in the modern world and in his criticism,Paragraph
of the subtle erosion of nature which has accompanied post-,Paragraph
war civilization:,Title
"Everyday life is becoming much too public. Radio, TV,",Paragraph
telephone all invade privacy. Gardens should therefore be,Paragraph
"enclosed, not open to public gaze. ... Architects are",Paragraph
"forgetting the need of human beings for half-light, the sort",Paragraph
"of light that imposes a tranquility, in their living rooms as",Paragraph
well as in their bedrooms. About half the glass that is used,Paragraph
in so many buildings - homes as well as offices - would have,Paragraph
to be removed in order to obtain the quality of light that,Paragraph
enables one to live and work in a more concentrated,Paragraph
manner...,Paragraph
"Before the machine age, even in the middle of cities.",Paragraph
"Nature was everybody’s trusted companion. ... Nowadays,",Paragraph
"the situation is reversed. Man does not meet with Nature,",Paragraph
even when he leaves the city to commune with her.,Paragraph
"Enclosed in his shiny automobile, his spirit stamped with the",Paragraph
"mark of the world whence the automobile emerged, he is,",Paragraph
"within Nature, a foreign body. A billboard is sufficient to",Paragraph
stifle the voice of Nature. Nature becomes a scrap of Nature,Paragraph
and man a scrap of man.4,Caption
By the time of his first house and studio built around an,Paragraph
"enclosed court in Tacubaya, Mexico D.F., in 1947, Barragan",Caption
had already moved away from the syntax of the,Paragraph
International Style. And yet his work has always remained,Paragraph
committed to that abstract form which has characterized,Paragraph
"the art of our era. Barragan’s penchant for large, almost",Paragraph
inscrutable abstract planes set into the landscape is,Paragraph
perhaps at its most intense in his gardens for the residential,Paragraph
districts of Las Arboleadas (1958-61) and Los Clubes (1961-,Paragraph
"64) and in his freeway monument, Satellite City Towers,",Caption
designed with Mathias Goeritz in 1957 [331].,Caption

address which he first gave to the North West Regional,Paragraph
"Council of the AIA in Eugene, Oregon, in 1954. This was the",Paragraph
occasion when he first advanced his felicitous distinction,Paragraph
between restricted and liberated regionalism:,Title
Opposed to the Regionalism of Restriction is another type of,Paragraph
regionalism; the Regionalism of Liberation. This is the,Paragraph
manifestation of a region that is especially in tune with the,Paragraph
emerging thought of the time. We call such a manifestation,Paragraph
‘regional’ only because it has not yet emerged elsewhere. It,Paragraph
is the genius of this region to be more than ordinarily aware,Paragraph
and more than ordinarily free. Its virtue is that its,Paragraph
manifestation has significance for the world outside itself. To,Paragraph
express this regionalism architecturally it is necessary that,Paragraph
there be building - preferably a lot of building - at one time.,Paragraph
"Only so can the expression be sufficiently general,",Paragraph
"sufficiently varied, sufficiently forceful to capture people’s",Paragraph
imaginations and provide a friendly climate long enough for,Paragraph
a new school of design to develop. ...,Paragraph
San Francisco was made for Maybeck Pasadena was,Paragraph
made for Greene and Greene. Neither could have,Paragraph
accomplished what he did in any other place or time. Each,Paragraph
used the materials of the place; but it is not the materials,Paragraph
that distinguish the work. ... A region may develop ideas. A,Paragraph
region may accept ideas. Imaginations and intelligence are,Paragraph
necessary for both. In California in the late Twenties and,Paragraph
Thirties modern European ideas met a still developing,Paragraph
"regionalism. In New England, on the other hand, European",Paragraph
Modernism met a rigid and restrictive regionalism that at,Paragraph
first resisted and then surrendered. New England accepted,Paragraph
European Modernism whole because its own regionalism,Title
had been reduced to a collection of restrictions.°,Paragraph
"Despite an apparent freedom of expression, such a level",Paragraph
of liberative regionalism is difficult to achieve in North,Paragraph
America today. Within the current proliferation of highly,Paragraph
individualistic forms of expression (work which is often,Paragraph
patronizing and self-indulgent rather than critical) only a few,Paragraph
firms today display any profound commitment to the,Paragraph
unsentimental cultivation of a rooted American culture. An,Paragraph
atypical example of current ‘regional’ work in North America,Paragraph
is the sensitively sited houses designed by Andrew Batey,Paragraph
and Mark Mack for the Napa Valley area in California;,Paragraph
"another is the work of the architect Harry Wolf, whose",Paragraph

Today’s Ticinese Regionalism has its ultimate origins in,Paragraph
the pre-war protagonists of the Italian Rationalist movement,Title
"in Switzerland, above all the work of the Italian Alberto",Paragraph
Sartoris and the Ticinese Rino Tami. Sartoris’s main,Paragraph
"realizations were in the Valais, most notably a church at",Paragraph

in association with viticulture and under construction,Paragraph
"between 1934 and 1939, of which the most renowned is the",Paragraph
Morand-Pasteur residence at Saillon (1935). Of the,Paragraph
compatibility between Rationalism and rural architecture,Title
"Sartoris wrote: ‘Rural architecture, with its essentially",Paragraph
"regional features, is perfectly at home with today’s",Paragraph
rationalism. In fact it embodies in practice all those,Paragraph
functional criteria on which modern building methods are,Paragraph
essentially based.’ Where Sartoris was primarily a polemicist,Paragraph
keeping the Rationalist precepts alive throughout the,Paragraph
"Second World War and its aftermath, Tami was mainly a",Paragraph
"builder, and the Ticinese architects of the 1960s were able",Paragraph
to take his Cantonal Library at Lugano (1936-40) as an,Paragraph
exemplary Rationalist work.,Paragraph
"Ticinese practice in the mid-1950s, with the exception of",Paragraph
"Galfetti, was orientated towards the work of Frank Lloyd",Paragraph
Wright rather than the prewar Italian Rationalists. Of this,Paragraph
period Tita Carloni wrote: ‘We naively set ourselves the,Paragraph
"objective of an “organic” Ticino, in which the values of",Paragraph
modern culture were to be interwoven in a natural way with,Paragraph
local tradition.’ Of Ticinese Neo-Rationalism in the early,Paragraph
1970s we find him writing:,Paragraph
"The old Wrightian schemata were superseded, the chapter",Paragraph
"of ‘big commissions’ for the State, with good reformist",Paragraph
"intentions, was closed. It all had to be begun all over again,",Paragraph
"from the ground upwards, housing, schools, minor didactic",Paragraph
"restorations, competition entries as an opportunity to",Paragraph
investigate and critically assess the contents and forms of,Paragraph
"architecture. In the meantime cultural confrontation in Italy,",Paragraph
"political commitment, and the exacting confrontation with",Paragraph
"our own native intellectuals, especially Virgilio Gilardoni,",Paragraph
"meant that history books started to appear on our desks,",Paragraph
and above all faced us with the challenge of critically,Paragraph
"reappraising the whole evolution of modernism, most",Paragraph
especially that of the 1920s and 1930s.’,Paragraph
"As Carloni suggests, the strength of provincial culture",Paragraph
resides in its capacity to condense the artistic and critical,Paragraph
potential of the region while assimilating and reinterpreting,Paragraph
"outside influences. The work of Carloni’s prime pupil, Mario",Paragraph
"Botta, is typical in this respect, with its concentration on",Paragraph
issues which relate directly to the specific place while,Paragraph
adapting methods and approaches drawn from outside.,Paragraph
"Formally educated under Scarpa, Botta was fortunate",Paragraph
"enough to work, however briefly, for both Kahn and Le",Paragraph
Corbusier during the short period when they projected civic,Paragraph
"works for Venice. Evidently influenced by these men, Botta",Paragraph
went on to appropriate the Italian Neo-Rationalist,Paragraph
"methodology as his own, while simultaneously retaining,",Paragraph
"through Scarpa, an unusual capacity for the craft",Paragraph
enrichment of his form. One of the most exotic examples of,Paragraph
this occurs in his application of intonaco lucido (polished,Paragraph
plaster) to the fireplace surrounds of a converted farmhouse,Caption
at Ligrignano in 1979.,Paragraph
Two other traits in Botta’s work may be seen as critical:,Paragraph
"on the one hand, his constant preoccupation with what he",Paragraph
"terms ‘building the site’, and on the other, his conviction",Paragraph
that the loss of the historical city can only be compensated,Paragraph
for by ‘cities in miniature’. Thus Botta’s school at Morbio,Paragraph
Inferiore is interpreted as a micro-urban realm - as a,Paragraph
cultural compensation for the evident loss of civic life in,Paragraph
"Chiasso, the nearest large city. Primary references to the",Paragraph
culture of the Ticino landscape are also evoked by Botta at a,Paragraph
"typological level, such as the house at Riva San Vitale",Paragraph
"[337], which refers obliquely to the traditional towerlike",Paragraph
country summer houses or roco/i which were once plentiful,Paragraph
in the region.,Paragraph
"337 Botta, house at Riva San Vitale, 1972-73.",Caption
"Aside from these references, Botta’s houses serve as",Paragraph
markers in the landscape - as indicators of limits or,Paragraph
"boundaries. The house in Ligornetto, for example,",Paragraph
establishes the frontier where the village ends and the,Paragraph
agrarian system begins: its main aperture (a large ‘cut-out’,Paragraph
opening) turns away from the fields and towards the village.,Paragraph
"Botta’s houses are often treated as bunker/belvederes,",Paragraph
where the fenestration opens onto choice views in the,Paragraph
"landscape, concealing the rapacious suburban development",Paragraph
that has taken place in the Ticino since 1960. Instead of,Paragraph
"being terraced into the site, they ‘build the site’, after the",Paragraph
thesis advanced by Vittorio Gregotti in // territorio,Paragraph
dell’architettura (1966). They declare themselves as,Paragraph
"primary forms, set against the topography and the sky. Their",Paragraph
capacity to harmonize with the partially agricultural nature,Paragraph
of the region stems directly from their analogical form and,Paragraph
"finish; that is to say, from the fair-faced concrete block of",Paragraph
their structure and from the silo or barnlike shells in which,Paragraph
"they are housed, these last alluding to the traditional",Paragraph
agricultural structures from which they are derived.,Paragraph
Despite this feeling for a domestic sensibility which is at,Paragraph
"once modern and traditional, the most critical aspect of",Paragraph
Botta’s achievement resides in his public projects; in,Paragraph
particular in the two large-scale proposals which he,Paragraph
designed in collaboration with Luigi Snozzi. Both of these,Paragraph
are ‘viaduct’ buildings and as such owe something to Kahn’s,Paragraph
Venice Congress Hall project of 1968 and to Rossi’s first,Paragraph
sketches for Gallaratese. The 1971 Botta/Snozzi project for,Caption
"the Centro Direzionale, Perugia, is projected as a ‘city within",Paragraph
"a city’, and the wider implications of this design clearly stem",Paragraph
from its potential applicability to many megalopolitan,Paragraph
"situations throughout the world. Had it been realized, this",Paragraph
"centre, conceived as a ‘viaduct-megastructure’, could have",Paragraph
established its presence in the urban region without,Paragraph
compromising the historic city or fusing with the chaos of,Paragraph
the surrounding suburban development. A comparable,Paragraph
clarity and appropriateness obtained in their Zurich Station,Paragraph
"proposal of 1978, where a multilevel bridge concourse",Paragraph
"would not only have accommodated shops, offices,",Paragraph
restaurants and parking but would also have constituted a,Paragraph
new head building while some of the original functions were,Paragraph
retained in the existing terminus [338].,Paragraph

"It is no accident that Tadao Ando, who is one of the most",Paragraph
"regionally conscious architects in Japan, should be based at",Paragraph
Osaka rather than Tokyo and that his theoretical writings,Paragraph
should formulate more clearly than any other architect of,Paragraph
his generation a set of precepts which come close to the,Paragraph
idea of Critical Regionalism. This is most evident in the,Paragraph
tension that he perceives as obtaining between universal,Paragraph
modernization and the idiosyncrasy of rooted culture. Thus,Paragraph
we find him writing in an essay entitled ‘From Self-Enclosed,Paragraph
Modern Architecture toward Universality’:,Title
"Born and bred in Japan, | do my architectural work here. And",Paragraph
| suppose it would be possible to say that the method | have,Paragraph
selected is to apply the vocabulary and techniques,Paragraph
"developed by an open, universalist Modernism in an",Paragraph
enclosed realm of individual life styles and regional,Title
differentiation. But it seems difficult to me to attempt to,Paragraph
"express the sensibilities, customs, aesthetic awareness,",Paragraph
"distinctive culture, and social traditions of a given race by",Paragraph
"means of the open, internationalist vocabulary of",Paragraph
Modernism.8,Title
By ‘enclosed modern architecture’ Ando intends the,Paragraph
literal creation of walled enclaves by virtue of which man is,Paragraph
able to recover and sustain some vestige of his former,Paragraph
intimacy with both nature and culture. Thus he writes:,Paragraph
"After World War Il, when Japan launched on a course of rapid",Paragraph
"economic growth, the people’s value criteria changed. The",Paragraph
"old, fundamentally feudal family system collapsed. Such",Paragraph
social alterations as concentration of information and places,Title
of work in cities led to overpopulation of urban centers and,Paragraph
underpopulation of agricultural and fishing villages and,Paragraph
towns (as was probably true in other parts of the world as,Paragraph
well). Overly dense urban and suburban populations made it,Paragraph
impossible to preserve a feature that was formerly most,Paragraph
characteristic of japanese residential architecture: intimate,Paragraph
connection with nature and openness to the natural world.,Paragraph
What | refer to as an enclosed Modern Architecture is a,Paragraph
restoration of the unity between house and nature that,Paragraph
Japanese houses have lost in the process of modernization.?,Paragraph
"In his small courtyard houses, often set within dense",Paragraph
"urban fabric, Ando employs concrete in such a way as to",Paragraph
stress the taut homogeneity of its surface rather than its,Paragraph
"weight, since for him it is the most suitable material ‘for",Paragraph
realizing surfaces created by rays of sunlight ... [where],Paragraph
"walls become abstract, are negated, and approach the",Paragraph
"ultimate limit of space. Their actuality is lost, and only the",Paragraph
space they enclose gives a sense of really existing.’,Paragraph
While the cardinal importance of light is stressed in,Paragraph
"theoretical writings of both Kahn and Le Corbusier, Ando",Paragraph
sees the paradox of spatial limpidity emerging out of light as,Paragraph
being peculiarly pertinent to the Japanese character and,Paragraph
with this he makes explicit the broader meaning which he,Paragraph
attributes to the concept of a self-enclosed modernity:,Paragraph
Spaces of this kind are overlooked in the utilitarian affairs of,Paragraph
everyday and rarely make themselves known. Still they are,Paragraph
capable of stimulating recollection of their own innermost,Paragraph
forms and of stimulating new discoveries. This is the aim of,Paragraph
what | call closed modern architecture of this kind is likely to,Paragraph
alter with the region in which it sends out roots and to grow,Paragraph
"in various distinctive individual ways. Still, though closed, |",Paragraph
feel convinced that as a methodology it is open in the,Paragraph
direction of universality.1°,Caption
What Ando has in mind is the development of an,Paragraph
architecture where the tactility of the work transcends the,Paragraph
initial perception of its geometric order. Precision and,Paragraph
density of detail are both crucial to the revelatory quality of,Paragraph
his forms under light. Thus he wrote of his Koshino House of,Paragraph
"1981 [339, 340]:",Paragraph
"339, 340 Ando, Koshino House, Osaka, 1981: view and ground plan.",Caption
Light changes expressions with time. | believe that the,Paragraph
architectural materials do not end with wood and concrete,Paragraph
that have tangible forms but go beyond to include light and,Paragraph
wind which appeal to our senses. ... Detail exists as the,Paragraph
most important element in expressing identity. ... Thus to,Paragraph
"me, the detail is an element which achieves the physical",Paragraph
"composition of architecture, but at the same time, it is a",Paragraph
generator of an image of architecture.,Paragraph
In their article on the Critical Regionalism of the Greek,Paragraph
"architects Dimitris and Susana Antonakakis, entitled ‘The",Paragraph
"Grid and the Pathway’ (Architecture in Greece, 1981), Alex",Caption
Tzonis and Liane Lefaivre demonstrate the ambiguous role,Paragraph
played by the Schinkelschidler in the building of Athens and,Caption
the founding of the Greek state:,Title
In Greece historicist regionalism in its neoclassical version,Paragraph
had already met with opposition before the arrival of the,Paragraph
Welfare State and of modern architecture. It is due to a very,Paragraph
peculiar crisis which explodes around the end of the,Paragraph
nineteenth century. Historicist regionalism here had grown,Paragraph
not only out of a war of liberation; it had emerged out of,Paragraph
interests to develop an urban élite set apart from the,Paragraph
peasant world and its rural ‘backwardness’ and to create a,Paragraph
dominance of town over country: hence the special appeal,Paragraph
"of historicist regionalism, based on the book rather than",Paragraph
"experience, with its monumentality recalling another distant",Paragraph
and forlorn élite. Historical regionalism had united people,Paragraph
"but it had also divided them.""",Paragraph
The various reactions which followed the proliferation of,Paragraph
the 19th-century Greek Nationalist Neo-Classical style,Title
varied from the vernacular historicism of the 1920s to the,Paragraph
committed modernism of the 1930s as this became,Paragraph
manifest in the work of such architects as Stamo Papadaki,Paragraph
"and J.G. Despotopoulos. As Tzonis points out, a consciously",Paragraph
regionalist modernism emerged in Greece with the earliest,Paragraph
works of Aris Konstantinidis (his Eleusis house of 1938 and,Paragraph
"his Kifissia garden exhibition of 1940), and this line was",Paragraph
"developed further by Konstantinidis in the 1950s, in various",Paragraph
low-cost housing schemes and in the hotels he designed for,Paragraph
the Xenia national tourist organization between 1956 and,Paragraph
1966. In all of Konstantinidis’s public work a tension appears,Paragraph
between the universal rationality of the trabeated,Title
reinforced-concrete frame and the autochthonous tactility of,Paragraph
the native stone and blockwork which is used as infill. A,Paragraph
much less equivocal regionalist spirit permeates the park,Paragraph
and promenade that Dimitris Pikionis designed for the,Paragraph
"Philopappou Hill in 1957, on a site adjacent to the Acropolis",Paragraph
"in Athens [341]. In this archaic landscape, as Tzonis and",Paragraph
"Lefaivre point out,",Paragraph
"341 Pikionis, park paving on the Philopappou Hill, Athens, 1957.",Caption
Pikionis proceeds to make a work of architecture free from,Paragraph
technological exhibitionism and compositional conceit (so,Paragraph
"typical of the mainstream of architecture of the 1950s), a",Paragraph
"stark naked object almost dematerialized, an ordering of",Paragraph
"‘places made for the occasion’, unfolding around the hill for",Paragraph
"solitary contemplation, for intimate discussion, for a small",Paragraph
"gathering, for a vast assembly. ... To weave this",Paragraph
"extraordinary braid of niches and passages and situations,",Paragraph
Pikionis identifies appropriate components from the lived-in,Paragraph
"spaces of folk architecture, but in this project the link with",Paragraph
the regional is not made out of tender emotion. In a,Paragraph
"completely different attitude, these envelopes of concrete",Paragraph
"events are studied with a cold empirical method, as if",Paragraph
documented by an archaeologist. Neither is their selection,Paragraph
and their positioning carried out to stir easy superficial,Paragraph
emotion. They are platforms to be used in an everyday,Paragraph
"sense but to supply that which, in the context of",Paragraph
"contemporary architecture, everyday life does not. The",Paragraph
investigation of the local is the condition for reaching the,Paragraph
"concrete and the real, and for rehumanizing architecture.",Paragraph
Tzonis sees the work of the Antonakakis partnership as,Paragraph
combining the topographic path of Pikionis with the,Paragraph
universal grid of Konstantinidis. This dialectical opposition,Paragraph
seems to reflect once again that split between culture and,Paragraph
civilization remarked on by Ricoeur. Perhaps no work,Paragraph
expresses this duality more directly than their Benaki Street,Paragraph
"apartments built in Athens in 1975 [342, 343], a layered",Paragraph
structure wherein a labyrinthine route drawn from the Greek,Paragraph
island vernacular is woven into the regular grid of the,Paragraph
supporting concrete frame.,Paragraph
"342, 343 Antonakakis, apartment building in Benaki Street, Athens, 1975.",Caption
Transverse section and view.,Paragraph
As with the largely overlapping categories used in the,Paragraph
"previous chapter, Critical Regionalism is not so much a style",Paragraph
as it is a critical category orientated towards certain,Paragraph
"common features, which may not always be present in the",Paragraph
"examples cited here. These features, or rather attitudes,",Paragraph
may perhaps be best summarized as follows.,Paragraph
(1) Critical Regionalism has to be understood as a marginal,Paragraph
"practice, one which, while it is critical of modernization,",Paragraph
nonetheless still refuses to abandon the emancipatory and,Paragraph
progressive aspects of the modern architectural legacy. At,Paragraph
"the same time, Critical Regionalism’s fragmentary and",Paragraph
marginal nature serves to distance it both from normative,Paragraph
optimization and from the naive utopianism of the early,Title
Modern Movement. In contrast to the line that runs from,Paragraph
"Haussmann to Le Corbusier, it favours the small rather than",Paragraph
the big plan.,Paragraph
(2) In this regard Critical Regionalism manifests itself as a,Paragraph
"consciously bounded architecture, one which rather than",Paragraph
emphasizing the building as a free-standing object places,Paragraph
the stress on the territory to be established by the structure,Paragraph
erected on the site. This ‘place-form’ means that the,Paragraph
architect must recognize the physical boundary of his work,Paragraph
as a kind of temporal limit - the point at which the present,Paragraph
act of building stops.,Paragraph
(3) Critical Regionalism favours the realization of,Paragraph
architecture as a tectonic fact rather than the reduction of,Paragraph
the built environment to a series of ill-assorted scenographic,Paragraph
episodes.,Paragraph
(4) It may be claimed that Critical Regionalism is regional to,Paragraph
the degree that it invariably stresses certain site-specific,Paragraph
"factors, ranging from the topography, considered as a three-",Paragraph
"dimensional matrix into which the structure is fitted, to the",Paragraph
varying play of local light across the structure. Light is,Paragraph
invariably understood as the primary agent by which the,Paragraph
volume and the tectonic value of the work are revealed. An,Paragraph
articulate response to climatic conditions is a necessary,Paragraph
corollary to this. Hence Critical Regionalism is opposed to,Paragraph
the tendency of ‘universal civilization’ to optimize the use of,Paragraph
"air conditioning, etc. It tends to treat all openings as",Paragraph
delicate transitional zones with a capacity to respond to the,Paragraph
"specific conditions imposed by the site, the climate and the",Paragraph
light.,Paragraph
(5) Critical Regionalism emphasizes the tactile as much as,Paragraph
the visual. It is aware that the environment can be,Paragraph
experienced in terms other than sight alone. It is sensitive,Paragraph
to such complementary perceptions as varying levels of,Paragraph
"illumination, ambient sensations of heat, cold, humidity and",Title
"air movement, varying aromas and sounds given off by",Paragraph
"different materials in different volumes, and even the",Paragraph
"varying sensations induced by floor finishes, which cause",Paragraph
"the body to experience involuntary changes in posture, gait,",Paragraph
etc. It is opposed to the tendency in an age dominated by,Paragraph
media to the replacement of experience by information.,Paragraph
(6) While opposed to the sentimental simulation of local,Paragraph
"vernacular, Critical Regionalism will, on occasion, insert",Paragraph
reinterpreted vernacular elements as disjunctive episodes,Paragraph
within the whole. It will moreover occasionally derive such,Paragraph
elements from foreign sources. In other words it will,Paragraph
endeavour to cultivate a contemporary place-orientated,Paragraph
"culture without becoming unduly hermetic, either at the",Paragraph
level of formal reference or at the level of technology. In this,Paragraph
"regard, it tends towards the paradoxical creation of a",Paragraph
"regionally based ‘world culture’, almost as though this were",Paragraph
a precondition for achieving a relevant form of,Paragraph
contemporary practice.,Paragraph
(7) Critical Regionalism tends to flourish in those cultural,Paragraph
interstices which in one way or another are able to escape,Paragraph
the optimizing thrust of universal civilization. Its appearance,Paragraph
suggests that the received notion of the dominant cultural,Paragraph
"centre surrounded by dependent, dominated satellites is",Paragraph
ultimately an inadequate model by which to assess the,Paragraph
present state of modern architecture.,Paragraph
Part IV,Title
World Architecture and,Title
the Modern Movement,Title
"344 BBPR, Torre Velasca, Milan, 1956-58.",Caption
Two publications issued around the millennium attempted to,Paragraph
arrive at an assessment of the overall impact of modern,Paragraph
architectural culture on a world scale. The first of these,Paragraph
"surveys consisted of ten volumes, under the series title",Paragraph
"World Architecture: A Critical Mosaic, 1900-2000. This work",Caption
"divided the world into ten ‘continental’ regions, with each of",Paragraph
ten regional committees nominating 100 significant,Title
"buildings, making 1,000 in total for the whole 20th century.",Paragraph
"A second publication, with a similar (but not identical)",Paragraph
"aim, was Luis Fernandez-Galiano’s survey Atlas: Global",Paragraph
"Architecture Circa 2000, published in Madrid in 2007. This",Paragraph
work also involved dividing the world into ten ‘continental’,Paragraph
"regions, although it yielded rather different subsets. Galiano",Paragraph
expanded this survey three years later into four separate,Paragraph
volumes published under the title Atlas: Architectures of the,Paragraph
21st Century. This taxonomy paradoxically broadened the,Paragraph
survey by breaking it down into four separate megaregions.,Paragraph
"Each was further subdivided into ten separate segments,",Paragraph
with each segment illustrating works selected by a single,Paragraph
commentator who was also commissioned to write a,Paragraph
comprehensive critical essay.,Paragraph
Any such critical assessment under the rubric of a single,Paragraph
author is subjective. The general question arises as to what,Paragraph
criteria justify the selection of particular works and the,Paragraph
exclusion of others seemingly accorded a comparable value.,Paragraph
One may oppose any kind of reductive aestheticism,Paragraph
whereby architecture is conceived of as fine art writ large.,Paragraph
"At the same time, we know that certain places at certain",Paragraph
times have the capacity to yield a particularly rich collective,Paragraph
"culture of architecture and that, conversely, in other places",Paragraph
"and at other times, the situation remains obdurately",Paragraph
unproductive and discordant.,Paragraph
Much of this has to do with the absence of consistent,Paragraph
"patronage. Architecture is an expensive material culture,",Paragraph
one that is highly dependent on the development of a,Paragraph
society in a particular place over a specific time period. In,Paragraph
this regard the impact of underdevelopment and,Paragraph
overdevelopment in each instance must be acknowledged:,Paragraph
"in the former, the lack of necessary wherewithal to develop",Paragraph
"the society and in the latter, too much development at a",Paragraph
pace too fast to allow for the sufficiently critical level of,Paragraph
creative mediation.,Paragraph
Another anomalous condition arising out of globalization,Paragraph
is the fact that many architects work today outside their,Paragraph
home countries. Even if we exclude the spectacular work of,Paragraph
"peripatetic, so-called ‘starchitects’ because they depend on",Paragraph
"branding for their worldly success, we are nonetheless left",Paragraph
with the fact that a work designed by a foreign architect,Paragraph
should be considered part of the architectural culture of the,Paragraph
region in which it is realized.,Paragraph
Although the ensuing Part IV is devoted largely to works,Paragraph
"produced in the last fifty years, on occasion | go back",Paragraph
another two decades to the aftermath of the Second World,Title
"War in both Europe and the United States, or in the case of",Paragraph
"China, by the Communist Revolution of 1949. Part IV should",Paragraph
therefore be read as a mosaic in more ways than one - an,Paragraph
assembly of pieces that have a necessarily disjunctive and,Paragraph
fragmentary character.,Paragraph
A culture of architectural quality is a relatively ineffable,Paragraph
phenomenon. It is sometimes carried forward by a single,Paragraph
exceptionally talented individual who will exercise an,Paragraph
extremely fertile influence on an entire epoch; or by a,Paragraph
"school, whether a more literal academic establishment or a",Paragraph
shared architectural ethos or collective practice sustained,Title
"intensely for a decade or more, but that will peter out owing",Paragraph
to a change in patronage or the swings of fashion and,Paragraph
"economic fortune. Thus, one might identify another deeper",Paragraph
"strand of ‘regionalism’ that is critically creative in itself, but",Paragraph
also ‘critical’ in the sense of its fragile and unique poetic,Paragraph
character. This is the key of momentary culture that | seek,Paragraph
to identify and recognize in Part IV of this global history.,Paragraph
Works that do not rise to this level do not make the cut.,Paragraph
Chapter 1,Title
The Americas,Title
The architecture of the North American continent has,Paragraph
"always been strongly influenced by that of Europe, above all",Paragraph
by the prestigious Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. This school,Paragraph
played a crucial role in the formation of North American,Paragraph
"architects throughout the last half of the 19th century,",Paragraph
"especially such pioneering figures as Richard Morris Hunt,",Paragraph
who was the first American to study there. He was followed,Paragraph
"by Henry Hobson Richardson and, briefly, Louis Sullivan. At",Caption
"the same time, Frank Lloyd Wright’s affectionate reference",Paragraph
to Sullivan as his Lieber Meister (‘dear master’) testifies to,Paragraph
the extent to which Germanic culture was also influential in,Paragraph
"the United States, particularly on the so-called Chicago",Paragraph
"School. At the turn of the century, a third of the city’s",Paragraph
population was of German origin and many people still,Paragraph
"spoke the language, which in turn served to sustain German",Paragraph
"theatres and newspapers and, above all, performances of",Paragraph
Wagnerian operas in Adler and Sullivan’s Auditorium,Title
Building of 1889. This Teutonic influence would become,Paragraph
more widespread in the 20th century through successive,Paragraph
waves of talented German architects who escaped the Third,Paragraph
Reich after 1933 and who would eventually have a decisive,Paragraph
impact on the evolution of modern architecture in the,Paragraph
"United States. Even so, the Ecole des Beaux-Arts still",Paragraph
"exercised an influence, mainly through the activity of French",Paragraph
"architects who, at the turn of the century, were appointed",Paragraph
as professors in a number of leading American universities.,Paragraph
The first German-speaking modernists to arrive in the States,Paragraph
after the First World War were the Austrians Rudolf Schindler,Paragraph
"and Richard Neutra, who went to the Mid-West to work for",Paragraph
"Wright in 1914 and 1923 respectively, and thereafter",Paragraph
established their own practices in Los Angeles. Apart from,Paragraph
"Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who arrived in Chicago in 1937",Paragraph
to take up the directorship of the Armour Institute (which,Paragraph
"would later become the Illinois Institute of Technology, or",Paragraph
"IIT), the next wave of influential Germans included the",Paragraph
"Bauhaus refugees Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer,",Paragraph
accompanied by the former Berlin planner Martin Wagner;,Paragraph
these three joined forces to establish the Graduate School of,Paragraph
Design (GSD) at Harvard University. They were soon,Paragraph
accompanied by the Swiss-German architectural historian,Paragraph
"Sigfried Giedion, whose Charles Eliot Norton Lectures given",Paragraph
at Harvard in 1939 were published in 1941 under the title,Paragraph

"greatly influenced the education of architects in the States,",Paragraph
particularly during the first two decades (1945-65) of the,Paragraph
"Pax Americana, the period of relative peace worldwide",Title
overseen by the United States. The scope of this influence is,Paragraph
indicated by the technologically advanced but expressively,Paragraph

(SOM) and by the works of Gropius’s post-war GSD protégés,Paragraph
"such as John Johansen, Edward Larrabee Barnes, Ulrich",Paragraph

their own versions of the New Monumentality. As far as the,Paragraph

"the Quebecois architect Ernest Cormier, whose magnificent",Paragraph
"Supreme Court of Canada building in Ottawa, with its",Paragraph

his crypto-modernist University of Montreal of 1944. The,Paragraph
proto-Art Deco aspects of Cormier’s work meant that the,Paragraph
Modern Movement per se did not fully emerge in Canada,Paragraph
"until well after the Second World War, most decisively with",Paragraph
Arthur Erickson’s Simon Fraser University campus laid out,Paragraph
"on high ground just outside Vancouver in 1962. However, a",Paragraph
more general adoption of modern architecture in Canada,Title
"came with Expo ’67, built in Montreal on an island in the St",Paragraph
Lawrence River. This happens to be the last time that the US,Paragraph
"participated seriously in a world exhibition, which it did via",Paragraph
"the US Pavilion, a large geodesic sphere designed by R.",Paragraph
Buckminster Fuller. This technological tour de force was,Paragraph
matched by Moshe Safdie’s equally radical multistorey,Paragraph

potential for delivering some of the benefits of suburban,Paragraph

"Both before and after the Second World War, South",Paragraph
America would be seen from Europe and even from the,Paragraph

possible for successive governments to introduce significant,Paragraph
socio-economic reforms irrespective of whether they happen,Paragraph

leftist government in this regard was the presidency of,Paragraph
Lazaro Cardenas in Mexico. He redistributed land to,Paragraph
"previously landless tenants and, further, in 1938,",Paragraph
expropriated the international oil companies that had,Paragraph

emerged in the 1980s as a ‘culture of materials’. This,Paragraph
practice was pursued by the East Coast modernists of the,Paragraph
"next generation, above all by Steven Holl and by the New",Paragraph
York practice of Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. Holl’s initial,Paragraph
"abstract approach, predicated on the idea of type, stemmed",Paragraph
from his admiration for the Italian Neo-Rationalist architect,Paragraph
Aldo Rossi. He modified this stance in favour of a species of,Paragraph
vernacular modernism evident in his first built work of,Paragraph
"consequence, the Berkowitz House on Martha’s Vineyard",Caption
"[355], in 1988. This work was inspired by the evocation of a",Paragraph
"regional literary myth, namely Herman Melville’s Moby Dick,",Paragraph

"the house, given the maritime affinities of the site and the",Paragraph
all but mythical Native American experience of transforming,Title
"the skeleton of a whale into a dwelling. This long, single-",Paragraph
"storey building terminated in a two-storey form at one end,",Paragraph
suggestive of a wheelhouse and thus embodying a nautical,Paragraph
"metaphor. While evocative of a ruined vessel, the exposed",Paragraph
board and batten 4-inch by 6-inch construction also evokes,Paragraph
the framework of a primitive hut. In these multiple ways the,Paragraph
"Berkowitz House exemplified Holl’s habitual, heuristic",Paragraph
method of introducing a mythical paradigm into the design,Paragraph
process.,Paragraph
"355 Holl, Berkowitz House, Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, 1988.",Caption
A similar method is evident in Holl’s school of art and art,Paragraph
"history [358] at the University of lowa (1999-2006), which,",Paragraph
"apart from the unusual brief, was predicated formally on",Paragraph
Picasso’s metal sculpture Guitar of 1912. Holl and his,Paragraph
"business partner, Chris McVoy, translated the rusted cubistic",Paragraph
form of this sculpture into a set of faceted planes in,Paragraph
weathered steel which they then employed to articulate the,Paragraph
"building within and without. In addition, channel glass was",Paragraph
used extensively to illuminate and express the larger,Paragraph
volumes of the interior. This juxtaposition of contrasting,Paragraph
material surfaces in relation to dynamic form can be found,Paragraph
"throughout Holl’s career from the mid-1980s onwards,",Paragraph
"including his Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City,",Caption
which is also covered throughout in channel glass. Although,Paragraph
the socially progressive aspects of the Modern Movement,Title
"are implicit throughout Holl’s work, there is a notable shift in",Paragraph
"the scale and density of detailing as he passed, for example,",Paragraph
from the so-called ‘Void Space/Hinged Space’ housing that,Paragraph
"he built in Osaka, Japan, in 1991, to the large urban works",Paragraph

The regionally inflected modernism that emerged on the,Paragraph

their significant career in Vancouver with their Seabird,Paragraph
"Island School, built at Agassiz in 1991 for an Indian band",Paragraph
"living in the Fraser Valley. The hump-backed, shingle-",Paragraph

"in some measure as a topographic metaphor, consciously",Paragraph
harmonizing with the profile of an adjacent mountain range.,Paragraph
Its deep eaves sweep low over a south-facing porch and are,Paragraph
"held in position by a canted pergola, which consciously",Paragraph
alludes to the fish-drying racks of the indigenous coastal,Paragraph
villages of the Pacific Northwest. Of this and similar,Paragraph
structures Patricia Patkau has remarked:,Paragraph
Many of our buildings have covered porches for various,Paragraph
"purposes: to modify the sun, shed the rain, or to provide a",Paragraph
sense of shelter. Most of our roofs come down l/ow at their,Paragraph
"edges; some, however, go up to capture light at the top.",Paragraph

important component of the interior climate-control system,Paragraph
"of the building: it acts as a huge thermal-storage mass, a",Paragraph
"giant static heat pump that absorbs, stores and releases",Paragraph
"energy to create an extremely stable indoor climate,",Paragraph
regardless of the exterior environment. Radiant heating and,Paragraph
cooling in both floors and walls maintains a set temperature;,Paragraph
the concrete surfaces act alternately as emitters or,Paragraph
absorbers. The thermal energy for this system is provided,Paragraph
by water-to-water heat pumps via a ground-source heat,Paragraph

"used for climate control, opening windows and doors does",Paragraph
not affect the performance of the heating and cooling,Paragraph

The most significant public work to be completed by this,Paragraph
practice to date is their Grande Bibliotheque du Québec in,Paragraph
"Montreal of 2005 [370], said to be the largest public library",Paragraph

In the late 1920s the Russian émigré architect Gregori,Paragraph
Warchavchik played a fundamental role in the development,Paragraph

Escola de Belas Artes (School of Fine Arts) in Rio de Janeiro.,Paragraph
"385 Warchavchik, Casa Mariana, Sao Paulo, 1929.",Caption
An intriguing aspect of Lucio Costa’s career is that he,Paragraph
was as much involved with historic preservation as with,Paragraph
modernism and to this end he became involved in research,Paragraph
"into the Portuguese vernacular, first in 1948, when the",Paragraph
Brazilian government sent him to Portugal to study the,Paragraph
evolution of agrarian typologies in the ‘home country’. His,Paragraph
initial research in this area informed his contribution to the,Paragraph
"1950 Luso-Brazilian Congress in Washington, DC, when he",Paragraph
argued that masterpieces of the Minas Gerais region in,Paragraph
south-eastern Brazil should be seen as the colonial version,Paragraph
of the original Portuguese Baroque. His second visit to,Paragraph
Portugal in 1953 not only confirmed his initial findings but,Paragraph
also prompted the Salazar regime to conduct a Survey of its,Paragraph
own into the Portuguese vernacular with the similar aim of,Paragraph
"deriving an authentic, yet hybrid national style, appropriate",Paragraph
"to the modern epoch. Carlos Ramos, director of the School",Caption
"of Architecture of Porto, became profoundly involved in",Paragraph
orchestrating this state-sponsored research into the,Paragraph
Portuguese vernacular.,Paragraph

version of modern architecture to the world with the,Paragraph
"Brazilian Pavilion, built for the New York World’s Fair of 1939",Caption

pavilion was complemented by an equally organic aquatic,Paragraph

been responsible for the roof garden of the Ministry of,Paragraph
Education and Health in Rio de Janeiro of 1938. This building,Caption
had been designed by a team of young architects under the,Paragraph
leadership of Costa and enriched with murals by the painter,Caption
Candido Portinari made of blue and white traditional,Paragraph
Portuguese tiles (azu/ejos) [386]. This was the first,Paragraph
synthesis of the lyrical manner that Niemeyer would,Paragraph
develop further with the various buildings he realized,Paragraph

as we find in the 60-metre (197-foot) portico spanning the,Paragraph

da Rocha’s work is his penchant for designing waterscapes,Paragraph
"at a territorial scale, such as his 1988 proposal for",Paragraph
transforming the bay of Montevideo into a perfect square. A,Paragraph
similar territorial scale obtains in the Sports Boulevard that,Paragraph
he planned for Paris in 2008 as part of the French bid for the,Paragraph

the level of the bus floor speeded up the process of entry,Paragraph

realized a small mixed-use studio building in downtown,Paragraph
Buenos Aires. Later this practice became the nexus of the,Paragraph
"Grupo Austral, which, inspired by Le Corbusier's program of",Paragraph

campaign chair. In the interim Bonet emerged as an,Paragraph
architect of stature with a number of vacation houses on the,Paragraph

Plata in the 1940s. Bonet’s penchant for vaulted space,Paragraph
"came into its own with his Berlingieri House [417, 418] of",Paragraph
"1947, wherein the shell vaults were designed by the young",Paragraph
Uruguayan engineer Eladio Dieste. Bonet’s feeling for the,Paragraph
integration of his work into the dune landscape was,Paragraph

foundation of two key institutions: the Peruvian Architectural,Paragraph
Association and the Urban Institute of Peru. Belaunde,Caption
eventually started on a political career in 1944 by joining,Paragraph
the National Democratic Front. In 1956 he founded the,Paragraph
"Accién Popular (Popular Action) Party, which, among other",Paragraph
"things, aimed at recapturing the Inca traditions of",Paragraph
community and cooperation while occupying the middle,Title
ground between the traditional right-wing oligarchy and the,Paragraph
radical left. When Belaunde was first elected to the Peruvian,Paragraph
Congress in 1945 he introduced legislation expanding the,Paragraph
role of the state in the production of social housing. This,Paragraph
eventually led to the creation of the Corporacién Nacional,Paragraph
"de Vivienda (CNV), the first completed project of which was",Paragraph
"1,200 apartments built as the Unidad Vecinal Numero 3",Caption
(UV3). These units were designed by a team of young,Paragraph
"architects comprising Alfredo Dammert, Carlos Morales,",Paragraph
"Manuel Valega, Luis Dorich, Eugenio Montagne and Juan",Title
Benites. The work was eventually integrated into Belaunde’s,Paragraph
plan for Lima. The CNV continued to function through,Paragraph

department of architecture in the National University of,Title
"Engineering, which he conceived along the lines of the",Paragraph
"Bauhaus. This led him to hire a progressive teaching staff,",Paragraph

European talent. Belaunde invited Walter Gropius and José,Paragraph

"work for two years as the field director of an inter-American,",Paragraph

planning sponsored by the Peruvian government and the,Paragraph
Organization of American States (OAS). The immediate,Paragraph
success of this programme encouraged Belaunde to,Paragraph
establish a department of urban planning under Land’s,Paragraph
direction within the school. In 1966 Belatinde took a further,Paragraph
proactive step by inviting Land to organize an international,Paragraph
"low-rise, high-density housing exhibition, known as PREVI.",Paragraph
Land conceived this exhibition along the lines of the,Paragraph
Deutscher Werkbund Weissenhofsiedlung housing exhibition,Title
staged in Stuttgart of 1927. Carried out under the auspices,Paragraph

the most exceptional designs was by a team comprising,Paragraph

also made a major contribution to the design of medical,Paragraph

built in the centre of Cusco from 1978 to 1985. In advance,Paragraph
"of its time, this work was exemplary in terms of both",Paragraph
sustainability and its sensitivity to the local context. The,Paragraph
architects were able to reduce energy consumption by,Paragraph
minimizing the use of lifts in a complex restricted to four,Paragraph

It is not possible to broach the development of modern,Paragraph

"acknowledging a debt to Udo Kultermann, whose pioneering",Paragraph
study New Architecture in Africa was first published in 1963.,Paragraph
While noting the extraordinary variations obtaining across,Paragraph
"the continent with regard to topography, climate, vegetation",Paragraph
"and inflected native traditions, Kultermann nonetheless",Paragraph
noted how architecture in the formal sense in Africa was,Paragraph
"mainly being designed by European architects, with the",Paragraph
exception of such sophisticated practices as that of the,Paragraph
"distinguished Nigerian architect Oluwole Olumuyiwa, who in",Paragraph
1960 designed a particularly elegant cultural centre for,Paragraph
"Lagos. Like Latin America, Africa is a Eurocentric construct",Paragraph
that has never been able to characterize adequately the,Paragraph
ethnic and geopolitical complexity of a vast and diverse,Paragraph
continent. This is even more the case today in the post-,Paragraph
"colonial epoch, when many ostensibly democratic nation",Paragraph
states are still unable to achieve a more equitable society.,Paragraph
As this chapter suggests through its conventional,Paragraph
"distinctions between South, East, West and North Africa, this",Paragraph
continent has remained somewhat inimical to the cultivation,Paragraph
"of a modern sensibility in architecture, despite the fact that",Paragraph
modernization continues unabated. All of this may go some,Paragraph
"way towards explaining the ad hoc, somewhat disconnected",Paragraph
"character of this account, for unlike in my comparable",Paragraph
"treatment of Latin America, the evolution of modern",Title
architecture in Africa cannot even be provisionally,Paragraph
assembled as a panorama of distinct national architectural,Paragraph
cultures dating back to the foundation of independent,Paragraph
"states, as has seemingly transpired in South America. In this",Paragraph
respect it is perhaps significant that some of the more,Paragraph
convincing architectural solutions documented in this sector,Paragraph
"have been achieved in smaller states - namely, Burkina",Paragraph
"Faso, Guinea and Senegal - that make up the mosaic of",Paragraph
West Africa. Apart from the brilliant school buildings,Paragraph
designed by Francis Kéré for Burkina Faso and built by its,Caption
"people, who not only cast the handmade bricks and laid",Paragraph
"them in place, but also handwelded the steel trusses",Paragraph
"supporting corrugated metal roofs, there have been equally",Paragraph
sensitive works designed by foreign architects in West,Paragraph
"Africa, above all, surprisingly, Finnish architects.",Paragraph
Among the German refugees from the Third Reich who,Paragraph
came to East Africa during the Second World War was the,Paragraph
"distinguished city architect of Frankfurt-am-Main, Ernst May,",Paragraph
who would then play a seminal role in cultivating a modern,Paragraph
architecture in Kenya and Uganda. Elsewhere Mussolini’s,Paragraph
"colonial ambitions also affected building in East Africa, most",Paragraph
notably in Ethiopia and Eritrea. One should also emphasize,Paragraph
in this regard the much later extraordinary creative role,Paragraph
"played by the Dutch Foreign Service in East Africa, above all",Paragraph
in the diplomatic compounds built by Claus en Kaan in,Paragraph
Ethiopia and by De Architectengroep in Mozambique.,Caption
One has to acknowledge that modern architectural,Paragraph
culture is possibly more deeply embedded in the north and,Paragraph
the south of the African continent rather than in either West,Paragraph
"or East Africa, due largely to the socio-cultural institutions",Paragraph
"installed by British, Dutch and French colonizers. Moreover,",Paragraph
"North Africa, beyond the Atlas Mountains, is a distinct region",Paragraph
separated from the rest of the continent by the Sahara,Paragraph
Desert and by the fact that since time immemorial this has,Paragraph
been profoundly influenced by Mediterranean culture.,Paragraph
"Paradoxically, the one exception is Egypt, which, across",Paragraph
"time, has been focused on the River Nile rather than the",Paragraph
sea. For centuries Islam has also played a fundamental role,Paragraph
in the formation of North African architecture extending as,Paragraph
"far south as the three great mosques of Timbuktu, Mali.",Paragraph
"Of all the sections in Part IV of this book, the one treating",Paragraph
"the Middle East is possibly the most inadequate, for so",Paragraph
much has transpired in the region since the dissolution of,Paragraph
the Ottoman Empire in 1917 that it is difficult to cover the,Paragraph
full impact of modernization in the space of a short essay.,Paragraph
The first figure to unequivocally embrace the modern,Paragraph
project in the Middle East was surely the soldier-statesman,Paragraph
"Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. He created modern Turkey, first by",Paragraph
resisting the dismemberment of the country by Britain and,Paragraph
"France after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, and then",Paragraph
by establishing the state as a secular republic in 1923 and,Paragraph
adopting the Latin alphabet for the inscription of the,Paragraph
"language. There followed, in short order, the emancipation",Paragraph
"of women, the adoption of occidental dress, the",Paragraph
development of industry and the substitution of a new,Title
nationalism in place of the obsolete allegiances of,Paragraph
transnational Islam.,Paragraph
Elsewhere the Middle East has been such an,Paragraph
exceptionally complex and turbulent part of the world as to,Paragraph
make it a difficult environment in which to develop a,Paragraph
modern architectural culture. A modernizing cultural,Paragraph
impulse first appeared in the Middle East indirectly by virtue,Paragraph
of the Zionist movement founded in 1897 and the,Paragraph
"subsequent migration of Jews to Palestine, particularly after",Paragraph
the foundation of the Jewish city of Tel Aviv in 1909 and the,Paragraph
"Balfour Declaration of 1917, which announced the British",Paragraph
government’s support for the establishment of a ‘national,Title
home for the Jewish people’ in Palestine. This led to the,Paragraph
contradictory fusion of Zionism with socialism during the,Paragraph
foundation of Jewish agricultural settlements throughout the,Title
first part of the 20th century. The first vehicle for modern,Paragraph
architecture in this area were Jewish housing settlements,Paragraph
"built during the interwar period, prior to the British",Paragraph
departure from Palestine and the ensuing conflict with the,Title
Arab League leading to Israel’s declaration of independence,Title
in 1948. It is clear that prior to the foundation of the state,Paragraph
German-Jewish architects played a fundamental role in the,Paragraph
development of modern architecture in Palestine.,Paragraph
"My coverage of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran and the Gulf",Title
States largely disregards the ideological and religious,Paragraph

"Martienssen, whose Transvaal Group of architects was",Paragraph
brought to international attention in Le Corbusier’s,Paragraph

(1910-29). Martienssen’s initial prowess as an architect is,Paragraph
"evident from his masterly Corbusian Stern House [461],",Paragraph

its unequivocal modernity of expression by the work of a,Paragraph
number of other equally talented architects who had been,Paragraph
"educated at the Witwatersrand University, among them John",Paragraph

poverty that continues to prevail everywhere in South Africa,Paragraph
"than the partnership of Jo Noero and Heinrich Wolff, who",Paragraph
have consistently striven for a socially accessible,Paragraph

in this regard was their Museum of the Struggle Against,Paragraph
"Apartheid, the so-called Red Location Building [464] erected",Paragraph
"in Port Elizabeth in 2005, the sawtooth roof of which alluded",Paragraph

active in the same movement. Although the building,Paragraph
"received the RIBA Lubetkin Prize in 2006, its",Paragraph

when it came to architecture as is evident from the career of,Paragraph

stylistically however was the Exposition Internationale des,Paragraph

"Salvisberg and who, on graduating, continued to work for",Paragraph
him for a number of years. In 1939 Korayem founded the,Paragraph
first periodical proselytizing modern architecture in Arabic.,Paragraph
"The appearance of this magazine, simply entitled a/-‘Iméra",Paragraph
"(Architecture), coincided with the high point of a particularly",Paragraph
"liberal spirit in Egypt, presaged by the subsidized housing",Paragraph

early 1920s. Along similar lines the Misr textile group,Paragraph
started to build large company towns in the 1940s at,Paragraph
"Mahalla al-Kubra, designed by Ali Labib Gabr; these",Paragraph
"developments included restaurants, markets, welfare",Paragraph

By 1950 well over twenty companies in Egypt had built,Paragraph

company towns did little to improve the living conditions of,Paragraph

with the model villages built under the auspices of the,Paragraph

"of virtually the same date, the Modern Movement in Egypt",Paragraph
"appears to have had a particularly chequered history, most",Paragraph

that a/-‘imara frequently published works by Le Corbusier,Paragraph

"on housing and planning, caused it to be viewed with",Paragraph
"suspicion by the new military government, which subjected",Paragraph
it to increased censorship and eventually brought about its,Paragraph
closure in 1959. The 1956 appropriation of the Suez Canal,Paragraph
"by the then president of the republic, Gamal Abdel Nasser,",Paragraph
led immediately to an abortive military intervention on the,Paragraph

Egyptian Department of Antiquities to design the village of,Caption
New Gourna [480] wherein he employed traditional sun-,Paragraph
dried bricks for a set of self-centring vaults and domes made,Paragraph
by local craftsmen. The purpose of this new village was to,Paragraph
move the existing population out of the Antiquities Zone so,Paragraph

Istanbul (1978):,Title
One might ask why it is necessary to look into the past. Why,Paragraph
can we not simply look forward? The answer is that Islam’s,Paragraph

requirement is a solid foundation.,Paragraph
"On the occasion of the first Venice Biennale of 1980, which,",Paragraph
under the curatorship of Paolo Portoghesi had a decidedly,Paragraph

effectively transformed their initial proposal through the,Paragraph

proportional system. Each upper tier of the three-storey,Paragraph
"town hall, with its square plan, was cantilevered out beyond",Paragraph

sponsored in the 1960s by the Israeli Ministry of Housing as,Paragraph
part of a nationwide initiative to upgrade Palestinian,Paragraph

dwelling with load-bearing stone cross walls and with a,Paragraph

"Architecture 1900-2000: A Critical Mosaic, which was",Paragraph
published by the China Architecture and Building Press at,Caption
the millennium. The territory covered in this account begins,Paragraph
with the development of modern architecture in South Asia,Title
"after the declaration of Indian independence in 1947,",Paragraph
together with the partitioning of the former colony into,Paragraph
"India, with its largely Hindu population, and the",Paragraph
predominantly Muslim societies of East Pakistan and West,Title
"Pakistan, later to become Bangladesh. Modern architecture",Paragraph
in India was largely championed by the charismatic first,Paragraph
"prime minister of the country, Jawaharlal Nehru, who,",Paragraph
"having received an elite British education, returned to India",Paragraph
in 1912 to become the leader of the left wing of the Indian,Paragraph
"National Congress. Thereafter, Nehru remained committed",Paragraph
"to the development of India as a secular, multi-faith,",Paragraph
independent nation state. The implementation of this vision,Paragraph
"caused him to become a patron of modern architecture,",Paragraph
which he saw as being capable of both embodying and,Paragraph
representing the Indian modern project. At the same time he,Paragraph
was interested in a modern manner of building that was not,Paragraph
"only appropriate to the monsoon climate, but was also",Paragraph
enriched by the cultural legacies of the Hindu and Mughal,Paragraph
traditions. This led to his unequivocal support for the new,Paragraph
"Punjabi capital of Chandigarh, designed and realized by Le",Caption
"Corbusier, along with his patronage of a rising generation of",Paragraph
"Indian architects who are prominently featured here, namely",Paragraph
"Achyut Kanvinde, Charles Correa, Balkrishna Doshi and Raj",Title
Rewal. These talented professionals were followed by the,Paragraph
"equally gifted representatives of the post-Nehru generation,",Paragraph
"such as Bijoy Jain, Sanjay Mohe and Rahul Mehrotra.",Paragraph
The more varied developments in the other nations that,Paragraph
"make up the South Asia subcontinent -Pakistan, Bangladesh",Title
and Sri Lanka - are in part due to the absence of a,Paragraph
comparable modernizing vision of the same power and,Paragraph
"conviction as that of Nehru. Nevertheless, in the case of",Paragraph
"Bangladesh, we have to nevertheless acknowledge the",Paragraph
equally exceptional leadership of the master architect,Paragraph
"Muzharul Islam, who was not only a sensitive architect in his",Paragraph
"own right, but also the primary inspiration for the successive",Paragraph
"generation of Bengali architects, such as Kashef Chowdhury,",Paragraph
"Marina Tabassum and Rafiq Azam. Similarly, the leading",Paragraph
"Sinhalese architects who emerged in the 1950s, Minnette de",Paragraph
"Silva and Geoffrey Bawa, would make seminal contributions",Paragraph
to the architectural culture and identity of Ceylon prior to its,Paragraph
declaration of independence in 1972 and its transformation,Title
into the independent state of Sri Lanka.,Paragraph
The development of a similarly inflected modern,Paragraph
"architectural culture came into being much later in China,",Paragraph
partly because of its relatively undeveloped state prior to,Paragraph
"the Second World War and then the subsequent civil war,",Paragraph
culminating in the triumph of the Communist Revolution in,Paragraph
1949. Despite the pioneering efforts of the architect and,Paragraph
scholar Liang Sicheng in the late 1930s and 1940s to survey,Paragraph
"and document traditional Chinese architecture, and his",Paragraph
subsequent attempts to dissuade Mao Zedong from,Paragraph
following the Socialist Realism of the Soviet line in,Paragraph
"architecture, it proved impossible to overcome the cultural",Paragraph
hard line of the party. Given the reductive nature of,Paragraph
"capitalist development, it is ironic that the cultivation of a",Paragraph
modern architecture in China ultimately stems from Deng,Paragraph
Xiaoping’s opening up of the country to trade with the West,Paragraph
in 1983. Immediately after this Western corporate practices,Paragraph
arrived in China en masse to design and build one,Paragraph
"spectacular building after another, while the central",Paragraph
committee of the Chinese government pursued a policy of,Paragraph
"rapid large-scale urbanization, ultimately leading to an",Paragraph
"environmentally unsustainable, maximizing pattern of urban",Paragraph
development virtually bereft of any redeeming features.,Paragraph
This policy has since been drastically changed as much,Paragraph
more attention is now being paid to the resuscitation of rural,Paragraph
"China, with the restoration and economic expansion of",Paragraph
traditional settlements and villages. One of the,Paragraph
consequences of this has been the emergence of a new,Paragraph
generation of Chinese architects who have come to the fore,Paragraph
by designing and building exceptionally sensitive and,Paragraph
appropriate works in remote parts of the country.,Paragraph
A generalizable modern architectural culture has yet to,Paragraph
emerge in South East Asia. For most of the countries making,Paragraph
"up the labyrinthic complexity of this region, including even",Paragraph
"the authoritarian welfare state of Singapore, the cultivation",Paragraph
of a sophisticated culture of architecture has proven elusive.,Paragraph
Part of the reason for this has been the war-torn nature of,Paragraph
"the region, as the Singaporean master architect William Lim",Paragraph
has written:,Paragraph
"In the decades after World War II, the states of South Asia",Paragraph
became independent after the departure of colonial powers,Paragraph
"- some like Malaysia and Philippines, in a relatively peaceful",Paragraph
"manner, while others only after tragic and brutal struggles.",Paragraph
"Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were the unfortunate victims",Paragraph
of the cold war. These countries were to witness half a,Paragraph
century of great turmoil and ideological divisions. They have,Paragraph
been engulfed by an extremely bloody form of warfare and,Paragraph
destruction.,Paragraph
"This traumatic experience, along with the fact that large",Paragraph
parts of South East Asia have since time immemorial been,Paragraph
"water-based societies, has made it extremely difficult for",Paragraph
South East Asia to evolve and sustain a truly compelling,Paragraph
culture of modern architecture.,Paragraph
Within this context Japan stands out as a civilization that,Paragraph
was able to transform itself in the space of half a century,Paragraph
"from a feudal society into a modernized, quasi-industrialized",Paragraph
"nation state, capable, as it happened, of overwhelming the",Paragraph
Russian imperial fleet in a single encounter during the,Paragraph
"Russo-Japanese War of 1905, thereby paving the way for its",Paragraph
emergence as an East Asian colonizing power. After,Paragraph
"occupying Manchuria in northeast Asia in 1931, Japan",Paragraph
launched the idea of its so-called Greater East Asia Co-,Paragraph

expansionism ended with the country being the involuntary,Paragraph
testing ground for the first use of the atomic bomb. The,Paragraph
post-war reconstruction of Japan enabled it to play a leading,Paragraph
"role in the development of modern architecture, which",Paragraph
"accounts for its inclusion in Part III of this history. However,",Paragraph
this section features the work of two Japanese architects,Paragraph
who belong to quite different generations: Fumihiko Maki,Paragraph
and the much younger Kengo Kuma. The first is celebrated,Paragraph
in this overview for the vitality and refinement of his,Paragraph
practice while the second is acknowledged for the particular,Paragraph
way in which he integrates traditional Japanese crafts into,Paragraph
his architecture.,Paragraph
Korea has had a time-honoured role of acting as a,Paragraph
conduit for the introduction of Chinese civilization into,Title
"Japan, but was also the first Asian country to be annexed by",Paragraph
Japan as early as 1910. Half a century later Korea became,Paragraph
the site of a bitter conflict lasting from 1950 to 1953,Paragraph
"between the Communist government of North Korea, under",Paragraph
"Soviet influence, and the American-aligned South Korea.",Paragraph
"This war culminated in an uneasy peace, with the stalemate",Paragraph
of a demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea,Title

This continental trajectory concludes with two,Paragraph
independent nations that throughout the first half of the,Paragraph
19th century represented the most remote extent of the,Paragraph
"British Empire, namely Australia and New Zealand. The first",Paragraph
significant architectural intervention in the largely barren,Paragraph
expanse of the former was the foundation of the Australian,Paragraph
"capital of Canberra in 1912, designed by the American",Paragraph
architects Marion Mahony and Walter Burley Griffin. While,Paragraph
these same architects came up with a proto-modern,Paragraph
"architecture for Australia as early as 1917, a general culture",Paragraph
"of modernism did not begin to evolve there until the 1950s,",Paragraph
when it emerged out of the domestic work of such architects,Paragraph
"as Peter Muller, Ken Woolley, Robin Boyd and Harry Seidler.",Paragraph
A similar delayed effect also occurred in New Zealand; a,Paragraph
rigorous modern architecture appeared for the first time in,Paragraph
1940 with the work of the émigré Austrian architect Ernst,Paragraph
Plischke.,Paragraph

"at Mehsana in the state of Gujarat (1970-73), the Nehru",Paragraph
Science Centre at Mumbai (1978-82) and the National,Paragraph

"to achieve a low-rise, high-density pattern with more",Paragraph
extensive urban connotations than had hitherto been,Paragraph
achieved elsewhere. In his Asian Games housing Rewal,Paragraph

differences that still prevail in India.,Paragraph
Mehrotra’s comprehensive and wide ranging survey,Title

The other major talent to emerge in India in the late,Paragraph
"1990s was Bijoy Jain, and his firm, Studio Mumbai, adopted",Paragraph

the division of labour separating architects from craftsmen.,Paragraph
"Having been trained as an architect in the United States,",Paragraph
where he worked for some time in the model shop of the Los,Paragraph
"Angeles office of Richard Meier, Jain returned to India to",Paragraph
establish himself as a latter-day master builder. In this role,Paragraph
he worked not only as a designer but also as the coordinator,Paragraph

were to prove to be as capable of precise fabrication in steel,Paragraph
and ceramics as they were of executing traditional,Paragraph
"components in wood, such as doors, windows and detailed",Paragraph
cabinetwork of all kinds. Through this uniquely integrated,Paragraph
"approach, Studio Mumbai would not only demonstrate",Paragraph
"mastery over the aforementioned crafts, but also equal skill",Paragraph
in the handling of masonry and milled stonework in,Paragraph
"conjunction, if needs be, with paint and coloured plaster. As",Paragraph
Peter Wilson has written: Studio Mumbai's locus is in fact,Paragraph

courtyard house known as the Silver Hut (built in 1984 but,Paragraph

"potential of what he came to define as ‘group form’, as",Paragraph
articulated in his 1964 essay ‘Some Thoughts on Collective,Paragraph

While Maki’s concept was as much indebted to Team X as to,Paragraph
"Japanese Metabolism, his distinctive approach towards the",Paragraph
aggregation of urban form came from his formative,Paragraph
experience in the Graduate School of Design (GSD) at,Paragraph

"taut and dynamic, divide the membranes of the main hall",Paragraph

Maki’s highly refined tectonic approach moved him in two,Paragraph
"different but complementary directions: first, towards taut",Paragraph
"orthogonal volumes, clad with thin metal skins that",Paragraph
dematerialize at their extremities into paper-thin louvres,Paragraph
"and perforated translucent screens, as in his Tepia Pavilion,",Paragraph
"Tokyo, of 1990; and, second, towards light-weight",Paragraph

The most prominent Japanese architect of virtually the,Paragraph

"567 Ando, Chapel-on-the-Water, Tomamu, 1985-88.",Caption
It would be hard to find a contemporary Japanese,Paragraph
architect who is more concerned with integrating Japanese,Paragraph
traditional crafts into his work than Kengo Kuma. In this,Paragraph
"regard Ando, who is only thirteen years older, seems to",Paragraph
"belong to a different generation, a division that is reinforced",Paragraph
by Kuma’s antipathy for reinforced concrete. Kuma’s,Paragraph
aversion dates back to Ando’s Row House in Sumiyoshi of,Paragraph
"1976, for which Ando was awarded the much-coveted Japan",Paragraph
Architectural Prize.,Paragraph
"In contrast, Kuma’s parti pris - his so-called Water/Glass",Paragraph
"project of 1995, an addition to a villa overlooking Atami Bay",Paragraph
- depended on a paradoxical illusory combination of glass,Paragraph
"and water. Kuma’s Hiroshige Ando Museum, completed at",Caption
"the millennium in Nasu-gun in Tochigi Prefecture, was built",Paragraph
of wood in such a way as to exemplify the traditional,Paragraph
tectonic propensity of timber construction through an,Paragraph
obsessive reiteration of wooden louvres. This aesthetic,Paragraph
assembly not only depends upon a rain-proof membrane of,Paragraph
plate glass but also on the support of a structural steel,Paragraph
"frame throughout, in effect a technological subterfuge by",Paragraph
which Kuma was able to evoke in built form Hiroshige’s,Paragraph
ukiyo-e vision of the world wherein rain is rendered as,Paragraph
‘particlized’ phenomena.,Paragraph
For successive generations of Japanese architects the,Paragraph
reinterpretation of tradition has been an integral part of the,Paragraph
modernization process and in this regard Kuma is no,Paragraph

the competition for the design of the Korean National,Title
"Assembly, which in the event was never realized.",Paragraph
"Nevertheless, on the strength of this success he returned to",Paragraph
Seoul in 1961 to open his own office and establish his Space,Paragraph
Design research group. His first work of consequence in,Paragraph
"Korea was his concrete Freedom Centre of 1963, which was",Paragraph
evidently influenced by Le Corbusier’s Assembly Building in,Paragraph
Chandigarh. Equally ‘baroque’ was his Buyeo National,Paragraph
"Museum built in Seoul in 1967. However, the work that",Paragraph
established his ultimate leadership in the field of,Paragraph
architecture was his 1971 concrete-framed Space Group,Paragraph
"building in Seoul [570, 571], clad in fair-faced brickwork",Caption
inside and out. This building not only housed his,Paragraph
professional office but also the editorial offices of Space,Paragraph
"Design (SD) magazine, a journal of art and architecture that",Paragraph
Kim had founded in 1966. This publication was dedicated to,Paragraph
cultivating a modern Korean cultural identity in part through,Paragraph
scholarly research and in part through evaluating the native,Paragraph
tradition in relation to international developments. The SD,Paragraph
building also housed an art gallery and an experimental,Paragraph
theatre and in its prime was one of the city’s most,Paragraph
important cultural centres.,Paragraph
In retrospect it becomes clear that the Space Group,Paragraph
building was only the beginning of Kim’s mastery over a,Paragraph
"medium-rise built form, invariably composed of rhythmically",Paragraph
arranged and articulated brick masses set on a concrete,Paragraph
"frame, as is found in the School of Fine Arts complex for the",Paragraph
Seoul National University (1973) and in similar works,Paragraph
"designed to accommodate large institutions, for example his",Paragraph
Korean Culture and Arts Foundation building of 1979. Such,Paragraph
"syncopated brick masses also appear in his domestic work,",Paragraph
including the large houses that he built north of Seoul in a,Paragraph
forested landscape as an early gated community. Typical of,Paragraph
"such work is his Chang Am Jang House of 1974 [569, 572],",Paragraph
"which, although influenced by Dutch Neo-Plasticism, was",Paragraph
given a Korean character through the use of local timber,Paragraph
boarding and grey brick. Kim’s last major accomplishments,Paragraph
in Korea were his brick-faced Seoul Teachers’ College of,Paragraph
1975 and three projects dating from 1977: the Seoul Sports,Paragraph
"Complex, the Dae Woo Arcade and the Korean National",Title
Museum Tea House. Much like Kenzo Tange after Osaka,Paragraph

"Sydney. Like Mies van der Rohe’s Farnsworth House of 1950,",Paragraph

of this house was elevated 80 centimetres (2 feet 7 inches),Paragraph
"above grade, not only to raise the building above the",Paragraph
"surrounding floodplain, but also to prevent poisonous snakes",Paragraph
from entering. This was Murcutt’s first application of a,Paragraph
"corrugated-iron roof to a timber-framed, single-storey",Caption
"house, a formula that he would repeat with variations in",Paragraph
both framing and roof form over the next two decades. The,Paragraph
"61-centimetre (24-inch) radius of the bent, corrugated-iron",Caption
sheet that Murcutt employed to cap the ridge of the Marie,Paragraph
Short House was the tightest bend one could press into a,Paragraph
corrugated sheet. Due to the relative remoteness of his,Paragraph
"houses, Murcutt was often obliged to employ a",Paragraph
constructional repertoire with which rural builders were,Paragraph
familiar - above all timber framing and corrugated-iron,Paragraph
roofing - to which he habitually added multiple layers of,Paragraph
"protective screens, a filtering layer derived from the",Paragraph
Japanese domestic tradition. It is interesting to observe in,Paragraph
this regard that the Marie Short House has three,Paragraph
membranes: a sliding sunscreen outer layer of adjustable,Title
louvres; an intermediate sliding screen to keep out insects;,Paragraph
and another layer of adjustable louvres in metal and glass in,Paragraph
order to secure the house at night or during the winter,Paragraph
months. Perhaps no one has written more appreciatively of,Paragraph
Murcutt’s use of multiple membranes combined with sheet-,Paragraph
metal roofs than Philip Drew in his 1987 study of Murcutt’s,Paragraph
"work entitled Leaves of /ron, with its knowing allusion to",Paragraph
John Ruskin’s Stones of Venice of 1851. As Drew put it:,Paragraph
"585 Murcutt, Marie Short / Glenn Murcutt House, Kempsey, New South Wales,",Caption
1974.,Paragraph
One of the consequences of the side use of louvered,Paragraph
screens is to enhance the continuity of the building surface,Paragraph
since the louvers read as a change in the surface texture,Paragraph
"rather than as a break in the material. Moreover, the louvers",Paragraph
add to the delicacy of the forms. The thinness of the iron,Paragraph
sheets and the hard leaf-like character of the buildings is,Paragraph
advanced by expressing the edges of the sheets and,Paragraph
projecting the profile end sections of the break-pressed,Paragraph
gutters.?,Paragraph
Drew explains how Murcutt enhanced the ecological,Paragraph
profile of his roofs by using skylights covered with fixed,Paragraph
"louvres, raised clear of the glass and angled at 32 degrees",Caption
so as to exclude summer sun while permitting the entry of,Paragraph
"winter sunlight. Moreover, a second layer of break-pressed,",Paragraph
corrugated iron was invariably added to the apex of the roof,Paragraph
as a means of evacuating hot air from the house. Break,Paragraph
pressing is a technique employed to bend metal sheet into,Paragraph
the required profiles.,Paragraph
"Throughout his career, Murcutt has built in wood save for",Paragraph
the structural frame and metal roof as we find in his Marika-,Paragraph
"Alderton House [586, 587], erected on the beach in Yirrkala",Caption
in the Northern Territory in 1994. Commissioned by the,Paragraph
"aboriginal leader Banduk Marika, this single-storey house",Caption
"was also raised off the ground, not only to avoid flooding but",Paragraph
also to provide a clear view of the horizon - a defensive,Paragraph
feature that remains particularly important in aboriginal,Paragraph
"culture. Its location, 12% degrees south of the equator,",Paragraph
"where humidity reaches eighty per cent, demanded that the",Paragraph
house should be as open as possible in order to facilitate,Paragraph
"cross ventilation. This entailed full-height, counterbalanced,",Paragraph
"pivoting, louvred shutters, which also doubled as a means of",Paragraph
securing the house at night or in the off season. In addition,Paragraph
a slatted timber floor was provided throughout to filter out,Paragraph
sand tracked in from the beach. This permeability was,Paragraph
combined with roof vents capable of releasing the build up,Paragraph
of air pressure when the house is exposed to winds of,Paragraph
cyclonic force. Large timber-faced panels extended beyond,Caption
"the house at every structural bay, in order to provide",Paragraph
privacy for the occupants. Reminiscent of Le Corbusier’s,Paragraph

Another shortfall that this edition seeks to redress is the,Paragraph
second modernity that came into being with the,Paragraph
reconstruction of Italy after 1945. This saw the rise of such,Paragraph
"committed intellectuals as Bruno Zevi and Ernesto Rogers,",Paragraph
and the architectural practices of Carlo Scarpa in Venice and,Paragraph
"of BBPR, Franco Albini, Gio Ponti, Giancarlo de Carlo and Pier",Paragraph
Luigi Nervi in Milan. This Italian generation would be,Paragraph
followed by equally significant figures including the,Paragraph
"historian-theorist Manfredo Tafuri, who, together with the",Paragraph
"philosopher Massimo Carriari, transformed the discourse of",Paragraph
the Italian architectural scene in the 1960s. They and such,Paragraph
"architects as Vittorio Gregotti, Aldo Rossi and Giorgio Grassi",Paragraph
were barely mentioned in previous editions. Although,Paragraph
developments towards the end of the 20th century were,Paragraph
"featured in the fourth edition - notably those in Finland,",Paragraph
"France, Spain and Japan - among the mid-century European",Paragraph

First among the continental émigrés to have an impact,Paragraph
on the British scene was the Russian-Jewish émigré Berthold,Paragraph
"Lubetkin, not least with his founding of the Tecton office",Paragraph
upon his arrival from Paris in 1931; this led to the design,Paragraph

In 1937 Samuely collaborated with the émigré German-,Paragraph
Jewish architect Arthur Korn on the extremely radical MARS,Title
plan for London. MARS (Modern Architecture Research,Caption

influenced by the canonical Sied/ung Halen housing estate,Paragraph
completed outside Berne in Switzerland in 1960. This,Paragraph
"paradigm of stepped terrace housing, between exposed",Paragraph

Martin played a key role during his tenure as head of the,Paragraph

"rising talent, not only that of his own office, but also through",Paragraph
"his advisory position on the University Grants Committee,",Paragraph
"which, amongst other things, commissioned James Stirling",Paragraph
and James Gowan in 1957 to design the Engineering,Paragraph

Alison and Peter Smithson as contenders for the design of,Paragraph
"The Economist Building in London, which, in retrospect,",Paragraph
"turned out to be their last significant work, realized in 1964.",Paragraph
"This building, much like their Hunstanton School in Norfolk",Paragraph

structural mullions were set back as the building rose in,Paragraph

"1949. Of equal import, however, was the facing of these",Paragraph

revetment to protect the exposed concrete against uneven,Paragraph
weathering was echoed in Stirling’s St Andrews University,Paragraph
"dormitories [613, 614], also dating from 1964, where the",Paragraph

In retrospect it is evident that British Brutalism,Paragraph
represented a concerted effort to arrive at a socially,Paragraph
accessible and yet rigorous architecture in opposition to the,Paragraph
"overtly popular appeal of the New Empiricism, which",Paragraph
"possibly explains Stirling’s remark, ‘Let’s face it, William",Paragraph
"Morris was a Swede!’, with its double irony in the fact that",Paragraph
Morris was preoccupied with the tradition of Nordic culture,Paragraph
and the Swedish welfare state was preoccupied with the,Paragraph
"social accessibility of architecture. Even so, among the early",Paragraph
Brutalist works that testify to a concern for social relevance,Paragraph
"are the Smithsons’ SoHo House project of 1952, with its so-",Paragraph
"called ‘warehouse’ aesthetic, and Stirling and Gowan’s",Paragraph
"social housing built in Preston, Lancashire, in 1957 [615].",Paragraph

"concrete floor slabs are typical of this moment, as is Alan",Paragraph
Colquhoun and John Miller’s Kahnian Forest Gate School,Title

Paradoxically this heroic cultural stance was at odds with,Paragraph
"a shift to populism in British politics, first with the 1964",Paragraph
"election victory of Harold Wilson’s Labour Party, followed by",Paragraph
the Conservative Party’s victory of 1970. The latter first,Paragraph
brought Margaret Thatcher to the fore as education,Paragraph
"secretary, in which capacity she eliminated government",Paragraph
funding for British students aspiring to enter the,Paragraph
"Architectural Association School of Architecture, London.",Caption
This was the beginning of the influence of the economist,Paragraph
Friedrich Hayek on the British government: an anti-socialist,Title
ideology opposed to the Keynesian economics of the welfare,Title
state. This stance was reinforced by the rise of Anglo-,Paragraph
"American neo-liberalism, following the election of Ronald",Paragraph
Reagan to the US presidency in 1981 and Thatcher’s,Title
election as UK premier in 1979. The Thatcher government,Paragraph
liquidated the British coal industry and undermined the,Paragraph

culminating in the eclipse of the Greater London Council,Paragraph
(GLC) and the elimination of government subsidies for,Title
affordable housing.,Paragraph
Although one cannot claim a direct relationship between,Paragraph

after his appointment to a professorship in the Delft,Paragraph

works and projects designed for the Netherlands and,Paragraph
Scandinavia. Fretton’s most significant work at an urban,Paragraph

largest and most monumental complex work to date is his,Paragraph

conservatory with the same plan area. This provision of,Paragraph
additional space at minimal cost was the raison d’étre,Paragraph
behind their habitual use of ‘off-the-peg’ greenhouse,Paragraph

made up the poetic ethos of their steel-framed single-storey,Paragraph
"Cap Ferret house [642], built at Lege in 1998 on a pine-",Paragraph
covered dune site overlooking Arcachon Bay to the west of,Caption
Bordeaux. Here they were able to preserve six existing trees,Paragraph
on the site by incorporating them into the house: an,Paragraph
ingenious solution that was achieved through the invention,Paragraph
"of flexible collars to allow the trees, which rise up through",Paragraph
"the roof, to move with the wind. The kitchen/bathroom and",Paragraph
the sleeping space are both reduced to the minimum to,Paragraph
afford generous living space. Lacaton and Vassal followed,Paragraph
this achievement with their restoration and transformation,Paragraph
"of an eleven-storey apartment tower at La Chesnaie, near",Caption
Saint-Nazaire [643]. Between 2006 and 2017 the plan of,Paragraph
"this building, dating from the 1970s, was rearranged and its",Paragraph

"Nathan Rogers in their article ‘Per la citta corporativa’,",Paragraph

"Lodovico Barbiano di Belgiojoso, Enrico Peressutti and",Caption
Ernesto Rogers - along with the architects Luigi Figini and,Paragraph

‘Urbanistica corporativa’. The earliest fruits of the Valle,Paragraph
d'Aosta plan were the housing and schools designed for the,Paragraph

"Ernesto Rogers. Given that both had Jewish origins, they",Paragraph
were compelled eventually to leave Italy following,Paragraph
Mussolini’s alliance with the Third Reich in 1936. Zevi went,Paragraph

The publication of Henry-Russell Hitchcock’s pioneering,Title

Italy in that year he founded his school for organic,Paragraph
"architecture and, more importantly, the Associazione Per",Paragraph
"l’Architettura Organica (APAO). Following Wright, by the",Paragraph
term ‘organic’ Zevi had in mind a functionally and,Paragraph
structurally expressive architecture which was,Paragraph
simultaneously responsive to the topography of the site and,Paragraph
the exigencies of the local climate.,Paragraph
"In 1948 Zevi was appointed by Giuseppe Samona, the",Paragraph
"director of the Venice School of Architecture, to take over",Paragraph
the teaching of history and theory as part of a new,Paragraph
curriculum. Zevi would remain in Venice for the next fifteen,Paragraph
years before going to the University of Rome in 1960 to take,Paragraph
up the professorship left vacant by the death in 1960 of,Paragraph
Marcello Piacentini. One of the most paradoxical figures to,Paragraph
be seemingly influenced by Zevi's organicism was Luigi,Paragraph
"Moretti, whose masterly Girasole apartment building [685],",Paragraph

Ernesto Rogers’s most significant post-war contribution,Title
as an architect was his twenty-six-storey Torre Velasca,Paragraph
"apartment building, built in the centre of Milan in 1956, a",Paragraph
work that featured an exposed steel frame structure,Paragraph
inspired by the structural rationalism of Auguste Perret. The,Paragraph
shaft of the tower was crowned by a seven-storey element,Caption
cantilevered out on all four sides so as to resemble the,Paragraph
silhouette of a 14th-century fortified turret. Although this,Paragraph
"was not the most exotic example of the Neo-Liberty style,",Paragraph
which the British critic Reyner Banham attacked in his,Paragraph
provocative essay ‘Neoliberty: The Italian Retreat from,Title
"Modern Architecture’, published in The Architectural Review",Paragraph
"in 1959, it was nonetheless symptomatic of the historicizing",Paragraph
mannerism that was prominent in Italian work at the time,Paragraph
(compare Franco Albini’s La Rinascente store in Rome of,Caption
"1961). What Banham failed to acknowledge, however, was",Paragraph
that for the architects of Rogers’s generation the legacy of,Paragraph
the Modern Movement in Italy had been profoundly,Paragraph
compromised by its association with Fascism. This unease,Paragraph
with the Rationalist architecture of the interwar period,Paragraph
surely also accounts for Zevi's reluctance to acknowledge,Paragraph
"the importance of Giuseppe Terragni, which he did not do",Paragraph
until 1968 when he devoted an entire issue of his magazine,Paragraph
L’architettura: cronache e storia to documenting Terragni’s,Title
work.,Paragraph
"Banham was not alone in his critique of Neo-Liberty, as is",Paragraph
evident from the British and Dutch criticism of the Torre,Paragraph
Velasca during the last CIAM meeting in Otterlo in 1959. By,Paragraph
then Rogers had already outlined the nature of the Italian,Paragraph
dilemma two years earlier in the editorial he wrote for,Paragraph
"Casabella (issue 215), entitled ‘Continuity or Crisis’. In this",Paragraph
"piece, subject to the influence of Enzo Paci’s",Paragraph
"phenomenology, Rogers had first posed the problem of how",Paragraph
one may develop a humanist mode of building without,Paragraph
succumbing to the materialist logic of reductive,Paragraph
functionalism. The critical humanism advocated by both,Paragraph
Rogers and Zevi would be repudiated by Zevi’s prime pupil,Paragraph
"at the University of Rome, namely Manfredo Tafuri, whose",Paragraph
"critical judgement, fully articulated in his books Theory and",Paragraph
History (1968) and Architecture and Utopia: Design and,Title
"Capitalist Development (1973), challenged the very idea of",Paragraph
an operative history upon which Zevi had placed so much,Paragraph
"store. Instead Tafuri, profoundly influenced by Marxism,",Paragraph
advocated a radical modernity in which any trace of,Paragraph
bourgeois humanism would be eliminated - the evocation of,Paragraph
a socialist ‘degree zero’ that foreclosed on the possibility of,Paragraph
architecture participating in any kind of ameliorative,Title
practice in the interim.,Paragraph
To one side of this closure lay the independent position of,Paragraph
"Giancarlo de Carlo, who was both a critical intellectual and",Paragraph
an architect - first via his editing of his journal Spazio e,Paragraph
"societa, published from 1978 to 2001, and second through",Paragraph
"his lifelong commitment to the development of Urbino,",Paragraph
typical of which were the new university classrooms and a,Paragraph
lecture hall that he built into the historical fabric of the city.,Paragraph
Later De Carlo was commissioned to design a new,Paragraph
"residential college for the University of Urbino [690], which",Paragraph
he proceeded to organize as if it were a terraced,Paragraph
interpretation of an Italian hill town. There followed further,Paragraph
"colleges for the university on nearby hilltop sites, with",Paragraph

slopes.,Paragraph

From 1969 to 1974 De Carlo was involved with the design,Paragraph
"of social housing for the Villaggio Matteotti at Terni, sited",Caption
some 100 kilometres (62 miles) north-west of Rome.,Paragraph
"Commissioned by a state-owned steelworks, this housing",Paragraph
was ultimately successful largely due to the fact that De,Paragraph
Carlo had stipulated that the future inhabitants should be,Paragraph

should be paid for doing so.,Paragraph
"As rooted as De Carlo was, one of the most fertile",Paragraph
"practices in Italy in the 1960s was that of Gino Valle, whose",Paragraph
work was restricted for the most part to Udine and its,Paragraph
"immediate vicinity, where one of his most arresting",Paragraph
buildings was the Zanussi Rex offices [691] that he built in,Paragraph
Pordenone in 1961. Of all the Italian post-war architectural,Paragraph
"practices, the ones that came closest to the American",Paragraph
corporate practice were those of Gregotti Associati and,Paragraph

Greece,Title
Although the influence of Classical Greece on the German,Paragraph
"Enlightenment is well known, the reciprocal influence of",Paragraph
German Neo-Classicism on Greek architecture after the,Paragraph
nation gained its independence from the Ottoman Empire in,Paragraph
"1829 is less familiar. This cultural transfer, so to speak, is",Paragraph
partly explained by the superimposition of Prince Otto of,Paragraph
Bavaria as a monarch for the newly constituted Greek state,Title
in 1832. This new nationalistic culture was accompanied by,Paragraph
the adoption of Demotic Greek as the spoken language of,Paragraph
"the country, which conversely possibly accounts for the",Paragraph
attempt to arrive at a modern architecture for Greece based,Paragraph
on an inflection of the native vernacular.,Paragraph
"The pioneer in this endeavour was Dimitris Pikionis, who",Paragraph
became a member of the architectural faculty at the,Paragraph
National Technical University in Athens in 1921. He took his,Paragraph
students on trips to Aegina in order to study the vernacular,Paragraph
architecture of the Greek islands. There he came across the,Paragraph
"vernacular stone ruin of the Rhodakis House, which became",Caption
"a symbol of his unattainable ideal in architecture. However,",Paragraph
Pikionis’s quasi-archaeological attempt at a new,Title
autochthonous modern manner was his 1925 Karamanos,Paragraph
"House in Athens [693], ultimately based on the remains of a",Paragraph
Greek house excavated in the ancient city of Priene. This,Paragraph

whom he had met when they were both students at the,Paragraph
Athens Polytechnic in 1904.,Paragraph

"The year 1922 was a disastrous one for Greece, when,",Paragraph
"abetted by Britain and France, it invaded Turkey only to",Paragraph
have its army routed at Smyrna by the forces of Kemal,Paragraph
"Ataturk, who consequently expelled the Greek population",Paragraph
from Asia Minor. This debacle placed an enormous burden,Paragraph
"on the Greek state, which had to absorb a large number of",Paragraph
"refugees overnight. Moreover, no adequate accommodation",Paragraph
"seems to have been made for them until the early 1930s,",Paragraph
when some low-rise housing was built for the refugee,Paragraph
population [694]. This kind of housing was subsequently,Paragraph
matched by an extensive school building programme,Paragraph
"initiated by Eleftherios Venizelos’s government, which was",Paragraph
the first to be democratically elected in Greece after the,Paragraph
proclamation of the new constitution in 1927. This led to the,Paragraph
"stage for the emergence of a modern, rationalist",Paragraph
architecture in Greece that first appeared in a number of,Paragraph
new schools designed by emerging architects including,Paragraph
"Nikos Mitsakis, Patroklos Karantinos, Kyriakos Panayotakos",Caption
and Dimitris Pikionis. Pikionis’s rationalist school built on the,Paragraph
"lower slopes of Mount Lycabettus, Athens, in 1932 was his",Paragraph
only unequivocally modern building. All of this activity would,Paragraph
"be documented and celebrated in Karantinos’s book, The",Paragraph

book came out just before the fourth congress of CIAM that,Paragraph
took place in 1933 on the SS Patris en route from Marseille,Paragraph
"to Athens and subsequently in Athens itself, by virtue of",Paragraph
Stalin’s refusal to host the congress in Moscow. As the,Paragraph
"architect and historian Andreas Giacumacatos informs us,",Paragraph
the Berlin architect Fred Forbat had already prepared the,Paragraph
ground for this change in venue by virtue of his familiarity,Paragraph
with modern architecture in Greece. A small Greek CIAM,Paragraph
group had been formed in Athens in 1932 by Stamo,Paragraph
"Papadaki, whose own modern house, completed in Glyfada",Paragraph
"in 1933 [695], was of reinforced-concrete frame",Paragraph

SUCCESS:,Title
"695 Papadaki, K.F. House, Glyfada, Athens, 1932-33.",Caption
the reception accorded to the Congress was an outstanding,Paragraph
"example of Greek hospitality at its best and, at the same",Paragraph
"time, resulted from an enthusiasm dictated by the vision of",Paragraph
modernization which had become mature and urgent in,Paragraph
Greek society. The 1930s in Greece were rather similar to,Paragraph
"the 1960s: the first part of the decade, down to 1936 (as to",Paragraph
"1967), was one of a strong progressive drive forward which,",Paragraph
"however, was doomed to be cancelled out by politics and by",Paragraph
the totalitarian governments on which the drive ran,Paragraph
aground.,Paragraph
The worldwide economic depression that followed the,Paragraph
stock market crash of 1929 would ultimately undermine,Paragraph
"Greek democracy, leading to the fall of the Venizelos",Paragraph
government and then to the military dictatorship of General,Title
"loannis Metaxas, which endured from 1936 to his death in",Paragraph
"1941. These events led up to the Second World War, during",Paragraph

An ultimate standoff between the universal rationalism of,Paragraph
the Modern Movement and a locally inflected functionalism,Title
inspired by the vernacular would be represented by two,Paragraph
"schools built in Thessaloniki between 1933 and 1937, first,",Paragraph
an eminently rational girls’ school designed by Nikos,Paragraph
"Mitsakis in 1935, predicated on the regular spacing of its",Paragraph

"logically arranged in section and plan, Pikionis was able to",Paragraph
take advantage of a sloping site to provide the school with,Paragraph
courtyard/playgrounds at different levels. At the same time,Paragraph
the building reflected the climate and the vernacular,Paragraph
"architecture of northern Greece, through its use of shallow-",Paragraph
pitched tiled roofs with deep eaves plus delicately detailed,Caption
timber verandas and fenestrations which testified to the,Paragraph

verandas contrasted with an underlying reinforced-concrete,Paragraph

built in Filothei [698] shortly after and in the timber pavilion,Caption
erected on Philopappou Hill [700] in the landscape that he,Paragraph

Two totally contrasting talented architects of the second,Paragraph

tectonically rationalist reference to Byzantine building in his,Paragraph

Thessaloniki between 1978 and 1993. Through Krokos’s,Paragraph
"intricate use of red brick, this work metaphorically",Paragraph
represented the Byzantine culture it was destined to house.,Paragraph
No one has characterized the essence of this work better,Paragraph
than Savas Condaratos: The basic theme of the building is,Paragraph
perpendicular access: a spiral upward route - a kind of,Paragraph
"internal street - leads to the various gallery levels, though",Paragraph
without making it compulsory to visit them. The gentle,Paragraph
tunnel-like progression is transformed into an architectural,Paragraph
tour and takes on a symbolic nature ... The Museum of,Paragraph
Byzantine Culture is one of the most important buildings in,Paragraph
post-War Greek architecture because it embarks on an,Paragraph
exemplary dialogue with history ... It stands out for the,Paragraph
meditatic sobriety which pervades it and for its ability to,Paragraph
transverse the entire Greek tectonic tradition and to,Paragraph
reconstruct its archetypal essence.?,Paragraph

Yugoslavia was the one European nation in which a liberal,Paragraph
socialist society - as this had been envisaged by the pre-war,Paragraph
"Modern Movement - endured for nearly forty years, from the",Paragraph
"end of the Second World War to the death of its leader,",Paragraph
"Marshal Josip Broz Tito, in 1980. Key to Tito’s success was",Paragraph
his prestige as a triumphant leader of the partisans during,Paragraph
the war and the fact that - after the expulsion of Yugoslavia,Title
from the Soviet Bloc in 1948 - he was able to maintain a,Paragraph
one-party state while unifying six distinct ethnic identities.,Paragraph
"Of the six republics that made up Tito’s Yugoslavia,",Paragraph
Slovenia was the most cosmopolitan by virtue of bordering,Paragraph
"on Italy and Austria, which border it to the west and the",Paragraph
north. At the same time it seems to have had an affinity,Paragraph
post-1918 for the then newly created state of,Paragraph
"Czechoslovakia, with which the Slovenian master architect",Paragraph
Joze Plecnik was profoundly involved by virtue of being,Paragraph
"commissioned by the first Czech president, Tomas Masaryk,",Paragraph
with the task of transforming Prague Castle into a,Paragraph
presidential residence [710]. By way of responding to this,Paragraph
"task, Pleénik designed a number of Neo-Baroque set pieces",Paragraph
of varying size and extent with which to convert and,Paragraph
"embellish the castle, in such a way as to erase all traces of",Paragraph
the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. First among the cryptic,Paragraph
symbolic elements that Pleénik added to the castle was a,Paragraph
monumentally symbolic stone basin resting precariously on,Caption
two stone blocks. This was followed by a sequence of,Paragraph
equally oneiric works that Plecénik designed for the castle,Paragraph
before returning definitively in 1921 to found and direct a,Paragraph
school of architecture in Ljubljana. Under Tito post-war,Caption
Yugoslavia under Tito became a modernist utopia both,Paragraph
socially and architecturally. As Vladimir Kuli€é has written:,Paragraph
"710 Pleénik, Prague Castle, 1931.",Caption
"In the early post-war years, mass volunteer labor was a",Paragraph
matter of practical necessity in a war-ravaged country,Title
sorely lacking an education cadre and modern technology ...,Paragraph
there was a great deal of genuine enthusiasm in this period,Paragraph
"as young brigadiers built new roads, railway lines, dams,",Paragraph
"irrigation canals, factories and cities. One of the largest",Paragraph
"early sites of volunteer labor was New Belgrade, where in",Paragraph
the late 1940s bare-handed youths from all over the country,Paragraph
filled in the marshland with sand to consolidate the unstable,Paragraph
terrain of the new federal capital. Another example was the,Paragraph
Adriatic Highway whose route along the coast from Slovenia,Paragraph
"through Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, to Montenegro",Title
enabled the emergence of mass tourism. As the country,Paragraph
"developed, however, the practical need for mass volunteer",Paragraph
"labor abated, and youth labor campaigns shifted to less",Paragraph
"physically taxing projects such as afforestation, the",Paragraph
construction of youth resorts or archeological excavation. At,Paragraph
"the same time, the motivation to participate also shifted to",Paragraph
"travel in the country, as volunteering in effect became a",Paragraph
form of active vacationing under the banner of brotherhood,Paragraph
and unity.+,Paragraph
"It is clear that between 1945 and the mid-1960s, amid a",Paragraph
"major socio-economic transformation, a remarkable panoply",Paragraph
"of modern architecture was achieved in Yugoslavia,",Paragraph
including such distinguished works as the Federal Executive,Paragraph
"Building, designed by a team led by Vladimir Potoénjak and",Paragraph

Zehrfuss.,Paragraph
"711 Potoénjak, Government Building, New Belgrade, Serbia, 1947-62.",Caption
During this same period two particular building types,Paragraph
"emerged in Yugoslavia: first, apartment buildings of",Paragraph
"exceptional ingenuity, reflecting the state’s guarantee to",Paragraph
"provide a high-quality apartment for every Yugoslav citizen,",Paragraph
"and, second, tourist hotels as a reiteration of the idea of the",Paragraph
"social condenser, found in the Soviet dom kommuna and",Paragraph
workers’ clubs of the late 1920s. The former were,Paragraph
exemplified by the mid-rise apartment blocks of New,Paragraph
"Belgrade [712], and in the extraordinary twenty-three-",Paragraph
storey slab blocks designed by Vladimir Braco Musié and,Caption
built in the industrial city of Split from 1968 to 1980 [717].,Paragraph
The latter were manifest in the sophisticated medium-rise,Paragraph
modernist hotels built at intervals on the motorway running,Paragraph
down the Adriatic Coast from Slovenia to Dubrovnik and,Paragraph
"beyond, such as the Solaris Hotel, designed by Boris Magal",Paragraph
"and built at Sibenik, Croatia, in 1968. Of this hotel building",Paragraph
"boom, Maroje Mrduljas has written:",Paragraph
"712 Music and others, Block 23, New Belgrade, Serbia, 1968-74. Plan.",Caption
The Yugoslav model of modernization managed to channel,Paragraph
the development of mass tourism toward the creation of a,Paragraph
"new urban layer, one that was both culturally compelling",Paragraph
and competitive on the international market. Thanks to the,Paragraph
policy of free access to all types of interior and exterior,Title
"public spaces, locals were able to appropriate tourism",Paragraph
infrastructure for everyday use. Supported by reasonable,Paragraph
"planning and preservation, the architects of Yugoslavia",Title
merged modernist concepts with lessons of the,Paragraph
Mediterranean and utilized the hotel typology for research in,Paragraph
"cultural, and in some extent, social authenticity.”",Paragraph
"Like Pleénik, Edvard Ravnikar was initially trained in",Paragraph
"Vienna, from 1926 to 1930. He returned to Ljubljana to",Paragraph
study with Plecnik for another five years. Thereafter he,Paragraph
"worked as an assistant on Plec¢nik’s National Library, under",Paragraph
"construction from 1936 to 1941, and completed a memorial",Paragraph
to the fallen of the 1914-18 war in a manner reminiscent of,Paragraph
Pleénik. In 1939 Ravnikar went to Paris where he worked,Paragraph
briefly for Le Corbusier on the Quartier de la Marine project,Caption
"for Algiers. Ravnikar’s Modern Gallery, designed for",Caption
"Ljubljana in 1939, was an exemplary rationalist work with a",Paragraph
"classical stone fagade, recalling the stonework of Otto",Paragraph
Wagner. After the formation of the republic of Yugoslavia in,Paragraph
"1945, Ravnikar was involved in various state projects",Paragraph
"including the new town of Nova Gorica, situated on the",Paragraph
Italian-Slovenian frontier. In 1952 he designed a series of,Paragraph

evident in both the basic structural form and in its surface,Paragraph
treatment. This brilliant articulation is never more vital than,Paragraph
in his design for the Revolution Square complex in Ljubljana,Caption
(1961-74) [714]. There Ravnikar was able to evoke the,Paragraph
image of Bruno Taut’s mythical ‘city crown’ (see p. 124),Caption

It was Otto Wagner who first coined the term ‘Modern,Paragraph

"Under Neumann ‘Red Vienna’, as the city was then known,",Paragraph
entered into an extensive programme of building workers’,Paragraph
housing in the form of a loose ‘ring’ of mid-rise perimeter,Paragraph

"designs of Karl Ehn [718], who had been a pupil of Wagner.",Paragraph
"718 Ehn, Karl Marx-Hof, Vienna, 1930.",Caption
Soon after its completion the Karl Marx-Hof was besieged by,Paragraph
artillery in a show of force by the government to repress a,Paragraph
workers’ rebellion. Despite this violent hiatus the emphasis,Paragraph
on social housing reappeared in the Wiener,Title

Austrian architecture did not easily recover from the,Paragraph
country’s annexation by the Third Reich in 1938 and from,Paragraph
"the Second World War until the early 1950s, when Roland",Paragraph
"Rainer came to the fore with his Sports Hall, Vienna, of 1952",Paragraph
"and his prefabricated, timber-framed Fertighaus Siedlung of",Paragraph
1953. Thereafter Rainer’s practice was largely devoted to,Paragraph
"the development of low-rise, high-density housing as a new",Paragraph
universally valid form of land settlement appropriate to an,Paragraph
"automotive age, as he demonstrated most persuasively in",Paragraph
"his Puchenau housing estate [723], under continuous",Paragraph
development on the banks of the river Danube between,Paragraph
1963 and 1995. The cultural ecological advantages of this,Paragraph
approach were fully documented in his book Livable,Paragraph
Environments of 1972.,Paragraph
After graduating from Clemens Holzmeister’s masterclass,Paragraph
"in the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts in 1955, Gustav Peichl",Paragraph
became an influential figure on the Austrian scene in 1964,Paragraph
"by founding the magazine Bau along with Hans Hollein,",Paragraph
Walter Pichler and Oswald Oberhuber. Four years later he,Paragraph
won a competition for the design of a group of provincial,Paragraph
"radio stations [721], which were built between 1969 and",Paragraph
"1984 as five concentrically planned stations in Eisenstadt,",Paragraph
"Salzburg, Innsbruck, Linz and Dornbirn, with Peichl giving",Caption
"each one a precisely detailed, machine-like, metallic",Paragraph
identity.,Paragraph
"721 Peichl, typical ORF Regional Studio, 1969-81.",Caption
Anton Schweighofer was equally committed as Peichl to,Paragraph
"the invention of new building types, hence the stepped",Paragraph
format of his Neo-Constructivist orphanage proposed for,Paragraph
Vienna in 1969 [722]. In retrospect this may be read as a,Paragraph
transitional work between Rainer’s ecological rationalism,Title
and the emerging anarchic artist-architects of the Graz,Paragraph
School of architecture of whom the most extreme was,Paragraph
"Gunther Domenig. The Steinhaus of 1986, designed for his",Caption
"Domenig’s occupation, veered towards sculpture rather than",Paragraph
"architecture, although its internal spaces were of a liveable",Paragraph
size and generous proportions. Coop Himmelb(l)au’s steel,Paragraph
"construction Blazing Wing, installed in Graz in 1980, was",Paragraph
"equally artistic. However, the overall Neo-Constructivist line",Paragraph
"of the Graz School, as represented by the work of Volker",Paragraph
"Giencke, Helmut Richter and Klaus Kada, would distinguish",Paragraph
itself from the de-constructivist approach of Coop,Paragraph
Himmelb(l)au as we first encounter this in 1986 in the,Paragraph
penthouse lawyer’s office that they designed for the top of a,Paragraph
classical block in Vienna as a cataclysmic concatenation of,Paragraph
steel and glass [725]. Nothing could be more removed from,Paragraph
this than Kada’s glass museum at Barnbach of 1988 or,Paragraph
Giencke’s conservatory for the botanical garden of Graz of,Paragraph
"1992, where the necessary hothouse heating was integrated",Paragraph
with the tubular metal framing supporting the glass.,Paragraph
"Giencke’s collage-like, multi-material approach to building",Paragraph
"was distinguishable from Richter’s maximizing use of glass,",Paragraph
"as this is found in the long, entirely glazed facade of his",Paragraph
Brunnerstrasse housing in Vienna of 1990 or in the large,Paragraph
secondary school that he built in Kinkplatz in the same city,Paragraph
"in 1994. Again, as with Peichl’s radio stations, there is a",Paragraph
discernible affinity with Anglo-Italian High-Tech architects,Paragraph
but without the same concern for typological invention or,Paragraph
"functional technique. Coop Himmelb(l)au, for its part, would",Paragraph
eventually arrive at a modus operandi that was as much,Paragraph
"constructivist as deconstructivist, for example in the",Paragraph
concatenation of planar surfaces of the office building that,Paragraph
they erected at Seibersdorf in Lower Austria in 1995. Of an,Paragraph
"equally organic but much more plastic character,",Paragraph

Germany,Title
"The ‘Man and Space’ symposium, held in Darmstadt in",Paragraph
"1951, was the first gathering of German architects and",Paragraph
intellectuals after the apocalyptic destruction and defeat of,Paragraph
the Third Reich in 1945. The philosopher Martin Heidegger,Paragraph
made a significant contribution to this event with his,Paragraph
"seminal essay ‘Building, Dwelling, Thinking’, which",Paragraph
emphasized the importance of the place-form as a bounded,Paragraph
domain rather than the abstract and functional space,Paragraph
favoured by modern architecture throughout the late 1920s,Paragraph
and the 1930s.! Heidegger’s emphasis on the bounded,Paragraph
domain was matched by Hans Scharoun’s presentation of,Paragraph
one of his first organically planned schools with the,Paragraph
implication that Darmstadt might be persuaded to build a,Paragraph
prototype [727]. This building was a categorical departure,Paragraph
"from the reductive functionalism of the Neue Sachlichkeit,",Paragraph
which had been a dominant feature of modernism in the,Paragraph
Weimar Republic. Scharoun’s subsequent practice was,Paragraph
mostly devoted to the design of schools and housing. The,Paragraph
most consummate example of the former was his,Paragraph
"Geschwister-Scholl School built at Linen (1959-62), named",Paragraph
after Hans and Sophie Scholl - the anti-Nazi martyrs of the,Paragraph
White Rose movement - while the most striking example of,Paragraph
the latter was his Romeo and Juliet apartments built in,Paragraph
"Stuttgart in 1959 [728]. However, his masterwork was the",Paragraph
"Philharmonie concert hall, built in the Berlin Tiergarten in",Caption
1963 [729]. This work was predicated on the radical,Paragraph
concept of placing the orchestra in the middle of the,Paragraph
"chamber, surrounded on all sides by inclined planes of",Paragraph
‘vineyard’ seating. Beneath the seating was suspended a,Paragraph
"sequence of cascading foyers, provided to accommodate",Paragraph
the audience during the intermission. The outstanding,Paragraph
acoustics of the chamber made it one of the most successful,Paragraph
concert halls of the 20th century.,Paragraph

Another accomplished German architect to emerge,Paragraph
"immediately after the war was Egon Eiermann, who, having",Paragraph
"studied with Hans Poelzig in the early 1930s, had enjoyed a",Paragraph
modest pre-war career. In 1947 Eiermann was appointed to,Paragraph
"the professorship of architecture at Karlsruhe University,",Paragraph
which greatly facilitated his post-war practice. From the,Paragraph
outset his work was characterized by an elegantly,Paragraph
"proportioned rationalism, which was already evident in the",Paragraph
"single-storey weaving shed, faced in corrugated asbestos,",Caption
that he built in the Schwarzwald in 1951. He followed this,Paragraph
"simple, elegant structure with one powerfully rhythmic work",Paragraph
"after another, including the Neckermann mail order",Paragraph
"warehouse in Frankfurt (1951) [730], the German Pavilion at",Paragraph
"the Brussels World’s Fair (1958), his own house in Baden-",Paragraph
Baden (1962) and the Olivetti Training Centre in Frankfurt,Paragraph
(1968-72). Eiermann’s key contribution to West Berlin was,Paragraph
"his Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church of 1962 [731], built",Caption
next to the bombed-out shell of a 19th-century Neo-,Paragraph
Romanesque church of the same name. This took the form,Paragraph
"of a steel-framed octagonal nave and campanile, each prism",Paragraph
"being faced in coloured glass lenses, which were back-lit at",Paragraph
night.,Paragraph
"730 Eiermann, Neckermann Mail Order Building, Frankfurt, 1951.",Caption
"731 Eiermann, Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, Berlin, 1962. Section.",Caption
One of the most prominent talents to emerge from,Paragraph
Eiermann’s teaching in Karlsruhe was Oswald Mathias,Paragraph
"Ungers, who by the early 1960s had already designed and",Paragraph
executed a considerable amount of brick-faced housing in,Paragraph
"Cologne, most of which was around six storeys in height,",Paragraph
including an exceptionally elegant mixed-use block in,Paragraph
"Hansaring [733], of 1959, with projecting balconies and",Paragraph
exposed concrete floor slabs. This Brutalist brick syntax,Paragraph
culminated in his own pinwheeling house [732] built in the,Paragraph
MUungersdorf district of the city in the same year. This was,Paragraph
Ungers’s Brutalist signature before he moved to Berlin in,Paragraph
1965 and then to Cornell University in the United States in,Paragraph
"1968, when he adopted a more rationalist, hardline",Paragraph
approach indirectly inspired by his passing interest in,Paragraph
Russian Constructivism. He abandoned this reductive,Paragraph
"functionalism after his return to Berlin in 1975, when he",Paragraph
embraced a kind of Post-Modern classicism that remained,Paragraph
his modus operandi until the end of his career.,Paragraph
"732 Ungers, Ungers House, Cologne, 1959.",Caption
"733 Ungers, housing block in Hansaring, Cologne, 1959.",Caption
Another important figure on the German post-war scene,Paragraph
"was the engineer-constructor Frei Otto, who began his",Paragraph
career with the design of translucent canvas tents erected,Paragraph
as temporary tensile structures for German flower shows.,Paragraph
The characteristic undulating form of these tents depended,Paragraph
"as much on the domed apices, held in place by tent poles,",Paragraph
as on the pull of guy-lines clustered around circular concrete,Paragraph
sumps that allowed water to drain off the roofs. Otto later,Paragraph
devised a transparent acrylic undulating roof similarly held,Paragraph
in place over a wire network on tubular-steel pylons and tied,Paragraph
back by wire cables to the perimeter of Gunter Behnisch’s,Paragraph
stadium erected for the Munich Olympic Games in 1972,Caption
[734]. This almost dematerialized organic roof form,Paragraph
sheltering the stadium was seen as being symbolic of the,Paragraph
"new democratic Germany, in contrast to the monumental",Paragraph
symmetrical stadium designed by Werner March for the,Caption
"Reichssportfeld, Berlin, for the Nazi Olympic Games of 1936.",Caption
"Behnisch’s equally organic, High-Tech ferrovitreous manner",Paragraph
attained its apotheosis in his Hysolar Research Institute built,Paragraph
for Stuttgart University in 1987.,Paragraph
"734 Behnisch and Otto, Olympic Park, Munich, 1967-72.",Caption
The year 1972 saw the completion of a unique,Paragraph
"experimental housing complex in Munich, built to the",Paragraph
designs of Otto Steidle in collaboration with Doris and Ralph,Caption
Thut [735]. Predicated on a 7.2 x 8.8-metre (23% x 29-foot),Paragraph
"prefabricated concrete frame, this three-storey matrix was",Paragraph
"realized as a flexible modular system, modelled on the so-",Paragraph
called ‘supports’ system developed by the Dutch architect,Paragraph
John Habraken. Habraken’s concept was that residents,Paragraph
would be free to modify their living units over time in,Paragraph
accordance with their changing needs by adding or,Paragraph
"subtracting components, conforming dimensionally to the",Paragraph
modularity of the basic structure. This technological ideal,Paragraph
"proved impossible to achieve, largely because such",Paragraph
"components were never industrially produced, although this",Paragraph

Around this time Josef Paul Kleihues arrived on the Berlin,Paragraph
"architectural scene, where he established his standing with",Paragraph
"two exceptional works: his five-storey, brick-faced,",Paragraph
perimeter apartment block erected in Vinetaplatz in 1977,Caption
"(fig. 303) and the immaculately detailed, curtain-walled",Paragraph
vehicle repair shop built for the Berlin street cleaning,Caption
department in 1978. Thereafter Kleihues’s career was,Paragraph
"devoted, between 1984 and 1987, to directing the Berlin",Paragraph
Internationale Bauausstellung (IBA; International Building,Paragraph
"Exhibition), a para-governmental operation similar in its",Paragraph
administrative capacity to the authority of the Hansaviertel,Title
building exhibition that was built adjacent to the Berlin Wall,Paragraph
in 1958.,Paragraph
The municipalities of Barcelona and Bologna were,Paragraph
similarly dedicated to the modernization of the obsolete,Paragraph
"European city, partially echoing in actual practice the so-",Paragraph
called reconstruction of the traditional city advocated by,Paragraph
"Leon Krier and Maurice Culot. However, unlike Krier and",Paragraph
"Culot, and even Ungers, Kleihues did not consider the pre-",Paragraph
"war Modern Movement as negative. Instead, as the",Paragraph
"architectural historian Winfried Nerdinger explains, Kleihues",Paragraph
envisaged the reconstruction of the city as a dialectical,Paragraph
confrontation between a progressive modernity and the,Title
traditional ‘place-form’ provided by the streets and blocks of,Paragraph
the 18th- and 19th-century urban fabric.,Paragraph
The unexpected fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 effectively,Paragraph
"brought Kleihues’s reconstruction of Berlin to a close and,",Paragraph
"regrettably, the building boom that followed favoured a",Paragraph
return to one-off free-standing buildings. This trend was,Paragraph
exacerbated by the neo-liberal laissez-faire economic,Paragraph
"policies emanating from the US and the UK, and this led to",Paragraph
"the growth of suburban fabric, accompanied by the",Paragraph
"supermarket, which had the effect of undermining",Paragraph
traditional shopping frontage and with it the viability of the,Paragraph
city as a whole. With the reunification of Germany in 1989,Paragraph
the tax base and the purchasing power of the society shifted,Paragraph
from the traditional city to the suburbs.,Paragraph
This transformation led to the rise of the ecological,Paragraph
"movement as a critical alternative, divided between a",Paragraph
technological approach and a ‘greener’ socio-cultural,Title
stance. The limitations of the former are suggested by the,Paragraph
"cold character of Werner Sobek’s steel-framed, totally",Paragraph
"glazed, zero-carbon house built in Stuttgart at the",Caption
millennium [736]. A more comprehensive alternative is,Paragraph
"evident in the sustainable practice of Thomas Herzog, such",Paragraph
as in his twenty-storey Deutsche Messe building erected for,Paragraph
"the Hannover Fair in 1999 [737, 739]. The remarkable",Paragraph
aspect of this ‘sustainable’ office prototype is the way in,Paragraph
which the 24 x 24-metre (979 x 979-foot) plan office space,Paragraph
"may be arranged either as totally open space, articulated",Paragraph
"solely by office furniture, or subdivided into individual",Paragraph
"offices, or even as a mixture of both. Either way round all",Paragraph
users can enjoy a modicum of natural ventilation by opening,Paragraph
"the glazed full-height, sliding doors separating the interior",Caption
"and exterior glazed skins, with the outer envelope being",Paragraph
open at the corners to allow for the natural movement of,Paragraph
"air, while simultaneously shielding the space from",Paragraph
turbulence induced by the wind. Since the building is still,Paragraph

the next two decades to a Swedish environmental /ingua,Paragraph
franca in which a whole generation of architects and,Paragraph

in 1937 in order to familiarize himself with the new,Paragraph
architecture of the Swedish welfare state. Unable to return,Paragraph
"to the UK owing to the outbreak of the Second World War,",Paragraph

More than any other contemporary British or Swedish,Paragraph
architect Erskine demonstrated an exceptional capacity,Paragraph
"early in his career to work at different scales, from enclaves",Paragraph
providing a protective microcosm capable of sustaining a,Paragraph
"community in a hostile natural environment to large, self-",Paragraph
"contained forms in otherwise rather placeless contexts, such",Paragraph
as his well-known theoretical project for an arctic town,Paragraph
"[759] as an enclave, enclosed by a thick perimeter wall",Paragraph
stacked with housing facing within the artificial crater. This,Paragraph
audacious project gained him a hearing within the elite,Paragraph
Team 10 circle dominated by Aldo van Eyck and the,Title
Smithsons. This idea of conceiving housing as a continuous,Paragraph
landscape form reoccurred throughout his prolific career: at,Paragraph
"Kiruna in Lapland (1961-66); in Clare College, Cambridge",Paragraph
(1968-69); in Resolute Bay in the Northwest Territories of,Paragraph
Canada (1973-77); and finally in the Byker Wall complex in,Paragraph
"Newcastle, England, in 1981. However, this preoccupation",Paragraph
with residential megaforms did not prevent Erskine from,Paragraph
"also designing, when appropriate, relatively small-scale",Paragraph
urban complexes comprising medium-rise residential,Title
perimeter blocks. Erskine practised throughout his life as a,Paragraph
"brilliantly inventive, pragmatic architect, whose organic",Paragraph
"syntax came close to that of Aalto, as in his paper-making",Paragraph
"factory at Avesta of 1953, faced in brick, and in the",Paragraph
"beautifully detailed, prefabricated concrete flats that he",Paragraph
built at Vaxj6 in 1954. He was also capable of giving his,Paragraph
"work a powerful, almost Constructivist character, as in the",Paragraph
ski hotel built early in his career at Borgafjall in 1950 [760].,Paragraph
Although the building of Swedish social democratic housing,Paragraph

"sense compromise. First, Lewerentz proposes to use it for all",Paragraph
"purposes: wall, floor, vault, roof light, altar, pulpit, seat.",Caption
"Second, he will use only the standard, full-size brick; there",Paragraph
"will be no specially shaped bricks. Third, no brick is to be",Paragraph
cut. The only way these conditions can be met is by a very,Paragraph
free proportioning in the ratio of mortar to brick; to achieve,Paragraph
such jointing (often very large) a very dry mortar mix that,Paragraph
included ground slate was employed.,Paragraph
"The work of Peter Celsing seems, in many respects, to be",Paragraph
"an uncanny synthesis of the work of Asplund and Lewerentz,",Paragraph
although Celsing himself seems to have never have worked,Paragraph
"for either of them. Despite this, his brick churches, built",Paragraph
"between 1952 and 1959, anticipated the atmosphere of",Paragraph
"Lewerentz’s late churches, even featuring, in the case of the",Paragraph
"church he built in Vallingby new town, Lewerentz’s penchant",Caption
"for thick mortar joints. At the same time, he proved himself",Paragraph
to be a heroic public architect within the long tradition of,Paragraph
"the Swedish welfare state, above all in his Film House,",Paragraph
"Stockholm (1964-70) [764, 766], and in his Culture Centre,",Paragraph
completed in 1976 on the south side of Sergels torg square,Caption
in the centre of the capital - a building that briefly served as,Paragraph
the seat of the Swedish Parliament while its own building,Paragraph

rationally and ingeniously planned and without any,Paragraph
superfluous ornament. They recall through the generosity,Paragraph

condenser as envisaged in the Soviet Union in the 1920s. At,Paragraph

by Charles and Ray Eames’ house in Pacific Palisades. They,Caption
were equally captivated by other houses built in the city,Paragraph
under the sponsorship of John Entenza’s Case Study House,Paragraph
programme. Despite the enduring influence of his American,Paragraph

"Danish architect Jorn Utzon, whom he had first met in",Paragraph
"Stockholm in 1944, and with whom he subsequently",Paragraph
collaborated on a number of projects in the late 1940s. The,Paragraph
ultimate outcome of his US tour was the twin houses that he,Paragraph
"built in Planetveien (1953-55), outside Oslo [768]: one for",Paragraph
the architect-historian Christian Norberg-Schulz and the,Paragraph
other for his own occupation. The timber-lined interiors of,Paragraph
"Korsmo’s own house went beyond the light-weight,",Paragraph
technological rationality of Mies and Eames by which he was,Paragraph
patently influenced. This is particularly evident in the,Paragraph
importance that he attached to the hearth as the spiritual,Paragraph

expressivity: first with his laminated timber-framed,Paragraph

"possesses a distinctly Japanese flavour, Fehn arrived at a",Paragraph
surprisingly articulate interaction between the exposed,Paragraph
timber framing of the roof - which accommodated a brick,Caption
core housing a free-standing chimney shaft and an adjacent,Paragraph

was developed further in the Underland and Wessel Houses,Paragraph
"(1960-65), close to Oslo, culminating in his quasi-Palladian",Paragraph

This symmetrical exercise in load-bearing brickwork and,Paragraph
"timber framing is based on a ‘square-within-a-square’ plan,",Paragraph
which is beautifully articulated by the built-in cabinetwork of,Paragraph
its four corner windows. This precision had the effect of,Paragraph
giving a single-storey house a formal presence comparable,Paragraph
to that of Mies van der Rohe’s Farnsworth House of 1953.,Paragraph
"Equally tectonic, though of a more majestic public",Paragraph

which pass around two sides of an existing tree. This,Paragraph
"magnanimous structural gesture supports a grid of thin,",Paragraph
"prefabricated, long-span concrete planks forming the roof.",Caption
These primal elements establish the main volume of the,Paragraph
"exhibition space, which is top lit through plastic gutters",Paragraph

Many reasons besides prosperity may be invoked to,Paragraph
account for the manifestation of so much talent in such a,Paragraph

influence of one of the most rigorous architectural schools in,Paragraph
"the world, that of the Helsinki Technical University, with its",Paragraph
traditions going back to the leadership of Usko Nystrém (see,Paragraph
p. 224). Other predisposing factors are: (1) the enormous,Paragraph
national prestige enjoyed by Aalto in his lifetime; (2) the,Paragraph
long-established principle of holding open competitions for,Paragraph
virtually every public building in Finland; and (3) the high,Paragraph
design standards established by such furnishing firms as,Paragraph
Marimekko and Artek. To all this must be added the didactic,Paragraph
cultural support provided by the Museum of Finnish,Title

Komonen and Marja-Riitta Norri - particularly for the,Paragraph

The consideration of construction and materials deepens,Title
the counterpoint at all scales of design. The sound intention,Paragraph
has been to steer clear of literal uses of wood. Geometry as,Paragraph
well as function determines the contrast of materials used;,Paragraph
"stairs and ramps, for instance, are of concrete structure and",Paragraph
glass enclosure and grey-painted steel is used in an,Paragraph
understated support role. ... The interior experience of the,Paragraph

"functions as a kind of sundial for the visitor, who, entering",Paragraph
"at the top level of the entrance court, is propelled down the",Paragraph
switchback ramp into the exhibition levels themselves. The,Paragraph
overlapping of spaces and visible interconnection through,Paragraph

always returned for orientation to the absolute centre of the,Paragraph
"drum, tracing and retracing their steps across a giant",Paragraph
"horizontal slice of tree-trunk embedded in the floor,",Paragraph
metaphorically always returned to the life of wood itself.,Paragraph
Three other works by this practice merit particular,Paragraph
mention: an addition to the Tampere University of,Caption
Technology (1995); the Folk Art Centre at Kaustinen (1997);,Paragraph
and the Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw,Title
(2013). Each of these works manifests the capacity to,Paragraph
combine dynamic plastic form with a rational organization of,Paragraph

Constructivist avant garde.,Paragraph

Globalization,Title
"The globalization of capital is, of course, somewhat",Paragraph
spurious. Yet it is an important ideological innovation. The,Paragraph
capitalist system undergoes a kind of mutation to its,Paragraph
"essential form, the culmination of which would be the",Paragraph
complete (notional) capitalization of nature in which there,Paragraph
no longer remains any domain external to capital. This is,Paragraph
tantamount to the assumption that an external nature does,Paragraph
not exist. The image is no longer Marx’s (or the classical,Paragraph
economists’) of human beings acting on external nature to,Paragraph
"produce value. Rather, the image is of the diverse elements",Paragraph
of nature (including human nature) themselves codified as,Paragraph
"capital. Nature is capital, or, rather, nature is conceived in",Paragraph
the image of capital. The logic of the system is thus the,Paragraph
subsumption of all the elements of nature-considered-as-,Paragraph
capital to the finality of capital’s expanded reproduction.,Paragraph
Theoretical difficulties immediately arise as a result of,Paragraph
the fact that this is a largely imaginary functional,Paragraph
integration. The rhetoric stresses harmonization and,Paragraph
"optimization, the reality is disorder and conflict. As",Paragraph
"Baudrillard remarks, ‘Everything is potentially functional and",Paragraph
nothing is in fact.’ Two sources of contradiction are inherent,Paragraph
"in the process of the capitalization of nature, which furnish",Paragraph
our justifications for proposing a shift from an industrial to,Paragraph
"an ecological Marxist perspective on production, on the",Paragraph
"‘eventual’ and ‘inevitable’ collapse of capitalism, and thence",Paragraph
on the conditions for some sort of socialism. The first is the,Paragraph
"fact that the planet is materially finite, a situation that",Paragraph
creates biophysical limits to the accumulation process. The,Paragraph
"second, which is synergetic with the first, is the fact that",Paragraph
capital does not and cannot control the reproduction and,Paragraph
modification of the ‘natural’ conditions of production in the,Paragraph
same way it purports to regulate industrial commodity,Paragraph
production.,Paragraph

judge from the international celebrity architects who are,Paragraph

spectacular imagery is such that today the worldwide,Paragraph

Topography,Title
Two seminal publications dating from the mid-1960s and,Paragraph
early 1970s announce the emergence of topography and,Paragraph
sustainability as the two environmental meta-discourses of,Paragraph
our time; together they exercise a pervasive influence not,Paragraph
"only on landscape and urban design, but also on the field of",Paragraph
"architecture in general. The two texts in question, Vittorio",Paragraph
"Gregotti’s // territorio dell’architettura, of 1966, and lan",Paragraph
"McHarg’s Design with Nature, of 1971, were to emphasize in",Paragraph
different ways the significant integration of man-made form,Paragraph
with the Earth’s surface. Gregotti saw the marking of ground,Paragraph
"as a primordial act, undertaken in order to establish a man-",Paragraph
made cosmos in the face of the chaos of nature; he,Paragraph
emphasized the fabrication of territory as a strategy for,Paragraph
establishing a public place-form in the face of the new,Paragraph
nature brought into being by the emergence of the,Paragraph
urbanized region. He first demonstrated this thesis in his,Paragraph
"designs for the University of Calabria, built as a linear",Caption
megastructure across a large swathe of agricultural land in,Paragraph
"Cosenza, southern Italy, in 1973. Eschewing architectonic",Paragraph
"intervention, McHarg’s research was focused more on the",Paragraph
need for a comprehensive approach to the biosphere in,Paragraph
order to facilitate and maintain the mutual interdependence,Paragraph
"of regional ecosystems across a wide front. In retrospect,",Paragraph
both approaches were attempts to mediate the effect of the,Paragraph
continual expansion of megalopoli throughout the world.,Paragraph
"Today, they may still be regarded as viable strategies with",Paragraph
which to resist the reduction of the man-made world to a,Paragraph
"limitless diffusion of ill-related, freestanding objects, as",Paragraph
alienated from the needs of humans as from the processes,Paragraph
of nature.,Paragraph
To advance territorial modification as the basis of a new,Paragraph
cultural discipline is to accord a compensatory status not,Paragraph
only to the art of landscape but also to built work,Paragraph
"formulated as if it were a landscape in itself or,",Paragraph
"alternatively, an object so integrated into the ground as to",Paragraph
be inseparable from the surrounding topography. It is just,Paragraph
such a reconception of the scope of landscape that currently,Paragraph
favours the emergence of the new subdiscipline of,Paragraph
"landscape urbanism, conceived as a mode of intervention",Paragraph
with a totally different strategic aim from the now largely,Paragraph
discredited practice of master planning. The American,Caption
landscape architect Peter Walker was able to demonstrate,Paragraph
this in an exemplary way in his 324-hectare (800-acre),Paragraph
"layout for the IBM Campus in Solana, west Texas (1992)",Caption
"[787], realized in collaboration with the architects Romaldo",Caption
"Giurgola, Ricardo Legorreta and Barton Myers. Walker",Caption
characterized the reparatory scope of his intervention in the,Paragraph
following terms:,Title
"787 Walker, IBM Campus, Solana, Texas, 1992.",Caption
"When we found the site, it was not a particularly rich",Paragraph
meadow. It had been grazed very heavily and over half the,Paragraph
topsoil had been lost. There were a few handsome trees that,Paragraph
stood up to the grazing and somehow survived ... To repair,Paragraph
"the rest of it, we took the topsoil off of every single road,",Paragraph
"building, or parking lot site, stockpiled it, and put it on the",Paragraph
"meadow, thereby doubling the amount of topsoil.2",Paragraph
Walker pursued an equally large-scale topographic,Paragraph
"transformation in his Marina Linear Park, San Diego,",Caption
"California (1988), designed with Martha Schwartz, where the",Paragraph
right of way of an existing light rail system was converted,Paragraph
into an exotic subtropical park. Comparable infrastructural,Paragraph
landscape interventions have been standard policy in,Paragraph
"France, where one third of the state budget allocated to",Paragraph
either regional high-speed transit or local light rail has been,Paragraph
given over to the design of landscape settings that are,Paragraph
capable of integrating new infrastructure into the existing,Paragraph
topography. Michel Desvigne and Christine Dalnoky’s,Caption
implantation of a new TGV station outside Avignon in 1995,Paragraph
"is typical in this regard, as are numerous other works",Paragraph
"executed by them in relation to public transit. In Avignon,",Paragraph
plane trees were employed to reinforce the linear extent of,Paragraph
"the station, while the adjacent parking lots were shaded by",Paragraph
rows of lime trees selected for their resemblance to the,Paragraph
"orchards of the surrounding apple-growing region, thereby",Paragraph
integrating the station into the character of the existing,Paragraph
landscape.,Paragraph
Despite the popular success of both the American,Paragraph
"parkway and the German Autobahn in the 1930s, the",Paragraph
universal expansion of autoroutes over the last half-century,Paragraph
has not always been accompanied by environmental design,Paragraph
of a comparable quality. An exception to this in Europe is the,Paragraph
concrete viaducts and tunnel entrances that the Swiss,Paragraph
architect Rino Tami designed for the Ticinese motorway,Caption
extending from the St Gotthard Tunnel in the Alps to the,Paragraph
Italian frontier at Chiasso - a large-scale infrastructure,Paragraph
realized over a twenty-year period between 1963 and 1983.,Paragraph
"More recent, and of more limited scope, are interventions",Paragraph
such as Bernard Lassus’s somewhat exotic autoscapes in,Paragraph
north-western France.,Paragraph
A comparable awareness of the impact of the automobile,Paragraph
"was evident in the early bridges of Santiago Calatrava, with",Paragraph
which he demonstrated that he was as much concerned,Paragraph
with the urban footprint of his bridges as with their,Paragraph
structural articulation. This was especially true of his Bach,Paragraph
"de Roda bridge, built just outside Barcelona in 1987, in",Paragraph
which the four coupled pairs of bowspring arches in,Paragraph
concrete and steel carried the roadbed and also provided for,Paragraph
pedestrian viewing platforms on either side of the span.,Caption
Both the bridge and the axiality of the railway that it,Paragraph
traversed were mutually enhanced by pocket parks that the,Paragraph
engineer established on either side of the cutting. As part of,Paragraph
"the bridge abutment, pairs of concrete stairs at either end",Caption
of the span provided direct access to these parks from the,Paragraph
bridge. It is significant from both a cultural and an,Paragraph
environmental standpoint that the pedestrian footpaths,Paragraph
were elevated above the roadbed so that a person crossing,Paragraph
the bridge could see over traffic to the landscape on either,Paragraph
"side. Moreover, the provision of such panoramic views was",Paragraph
combined with raising the pedestrian above the level of the,Paragraph
exhaust fumes.,Paragraph
The cultivation of landscape as a matter of ecological,Paragraph
policy at a regional scale has become almost second nature,Paragraph
"in Germany, where the extension of Peter Latz’s Emscher",Paragraph
"Park, which started as a demonstration project for the",Paragraph
"detoxification and reuse of obsolete industrial plants, has",Paragraph
evolved to become a recreational area stretching some 70,Paragraph
kilometres (43 miles) on either side of the Emscher River,Paragraph
"near the Ruhr Valley. It is significant that Karl Ganser, one of",Paragraph
"the main architects of the Emscher reclamation programme,",Paragraph
would come to regard the universal megalopolis as another,Paragraph
"‘brownfield’ site in the making, one that will prove to be",Paragraph
even more resistant to future decontamination and adaptive,Paragraph
reuse.,Paragraph
"As in much of Alvar Aalto’s architecture, large and",Paragraph
complex buildings may be rendered as though they were,Paragraph
natural extensions of the topography in which they are,Paragraph
situated. This paradigm was surely the primary motivation,Paragraph
"behind Arthur Erickson’s Robson Square development,",Paragraph
"Vancouver (1983), wherein a megaform comprising law",Paragraph
courts and municipal offices was integrated with a parking,Paragraph
garage in such a way as to assume the profile of a stepped,Paragraph
escarpment.,Paragraph
A more modestly scaled megaform was realized in,Paragraph
"Barcelona, in the form of the L’Illa complex [788, 789],",Paragraph
completed on the Avenida Diagonal in 1992 to the designs,Paragraph
of José Rafael Moneo and Manuel de Sola-Morales. This,Paragraph
"block, 800 metres (2,600 feet) in length, houses a five-",Paragraph
storey shopping mall in addition to commercial frontage on,Paragraph
"the avenue itself, and accommodates offices and a hotel as",Paragraph
an integral part of the medium-rise slab. Built at the edge of,Paragraph
Cerda’s original Eixample and served by a multistorey,Paragraph
subterranean car park running the entire length of the,Paragraph
"complex, the block was designed to respond to the scale of",Paragraph
"both the existing 19th-century urban grid and the random,",Paragraph
ad hoc suburban development surrounding the historic core,Title
of the city. The stepped profile of this building enabled it to,Paragraph
"be read as a prominent landmark, particularly when seen",Paragraph
from the inner suburban high ground overlooking the city.,Paragraph
This megadevelopment effectively demonstrated Sola-,Paragraph
Morales’ concept of urban acupuncture - namely a,Paragraph
"strategically limited urban intervention, programmed and",Paragraph
conceived in such a way as to augment an existing urban,Paragraph
condition in a defined but open-ended manner.,Paragraph

section through galleria.,Paragraph
Urban acupuncture was also a term adopted by the,Paragraph
Brazilian architect-politician Jaime Lerner in order to,Paragraph
introduce an efficient public transit system into the city of,Paragraph
Curitiba during his tenure as mayor between 1971 and,Paragraph
1992. Among the most innovative aspects of this system are,Paragraph
"the use of doubly articulated 100-seat buses, and elevated,",Paragraph
totally glazed boarding-tubes that facilitate the efficient,Paragraph
boarding of such vehicles at each stop. Today this network,Paragraph
comprises 72 kilometres (45 miles) of designated bus lanes,Paragraph
plus numerous other feeder lines. Over the same twenty-,Paragraph
"year period, Lerner was also able to introduce many other",Paragraph
"socially beneficial services in the areas of public health,",Paragraph
"education, food distribution and waste management. At the",Paragraph
"same time, despite the city’s population having tripled, the",Paragraph
administration was able to achieve a hundred-fold increase,Paragraph
in the amount of green space per capita: a provision of 52,Paragraph
"square metres (560 square feet) per person, in the form of",Paragraph
an extensive network of parks running through the city. This,Paragraph
"general upgrading of public facilities, accompanied by the",Paragraph
"introduction of a high-speed bus system, was replicated in",Paragraph
"Bogota, Colombia, during the successive political",Paragraph
leaderships of Enrique Penalosa and Antanas Mockus.,Paragraph
Megaforms conceived as cities-in-miniature may also be,Paragraph
used to emphasize the structure of existing topography and,Paragraph
to establish identifiable places. The Mexican architect,Paragraph
Ricardo Legorreta has demonstrated this approach on a,Paragraph
"number of occasions, from the stepped formation of his",Paragraph
Camino Real Hotel overlooking the beach in Ixtapa (1981) to,Caption
the Renault assembly plant that he realized as an ochre-,Paragraph
"coloured, virtually windowless horizontal form in the arid",Paragraph
"landscape of Gémez Palacio, Durango, in 1985. Similar",Caption
large-scale megaforms set against dramatic topographies,Paragraph
"can be found in a great deal of Latin American work, from",Paragraph

architects Auer and Weber in 2001. Cutting across the,Paragraph
"Atacama desert in Cerro Paranal, Chile, it constitutes a",Paragraph
latterday testament to Gregotti’s thesis that architecture,Paragraph
begins with the marking of ground.,Paragraph
A propensity for landscape with an urban character is,Paragraph
evident in the architecture of Enric Miralles and Carme,Paragraph
"Pinéds, who came into their own with two brilliant",Paragraph
competition designs of the late 1980s: an archery complex,Title

"Igualada into a cemetery [790]. The former design, inspired",Paragraph
by Gaudi and the structurally rationalist precepts of Viollet-,Paragraph

"Between the topographic, which pertains to the contours",Paragraph
"of the Earth’s surface, and the morphological, which",Paragraph
seemingly emulates the structure of biological and botanical,Paragraph

The fact that the primary reference tends to be natural,Paragraph
"rather than cultural is evinced in the amorphous, tentacular",Paragraph
shape of Frank Gehry’s Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao.,Caption
Apart from any allusion that this distorted ‘hull’ might make,Paragraph
"to the pre-existing shipyards, it is obvious that its",Paragraph
"exceptionally fluid shape, along with its seductive titanium",Paragraph
"skin, exists quite independently of anything that takes place",Paragraph
"within its interior. In other words, notwithstanding its organic",Paragraph
"shape, it is paradoxically removed from any kind of",Paragraph

much a formative presence in architecture as it is in nature.,Paragraph
"All of this is apparent from the disjunctive, inelegant",Paragraph
"conditions that this shape engenders, from the perverse,",Paragraph
inconvenient system of pedestrian circulation that leads,Paragraph
"from the river walk to the main entrance, to the total",Paragraph
indifference the building displays towards the topographic,Paragraph
context in which it is situated. We may count among its,Paragraph
"infelicities not only the ill-proportioned top-lit galleries, but",Paragraph
also the uneconomic and inelegant steel frame that was,Paragraph
devised to prop up the extravagant configuration of the,Paragraph
skin. Thus an unbridgeable gulf separates the emptiness of,Paragraph
Gehry’s Bilbao from the organic interdependence of the,Paragraph

2001 [793]. This exceptionally sensitive work was,Paragraph
commissioned by a local authority as a measure to reduce,Paragraph
city-centre traffic and pollution by encouraging commuters,Paragraph

"journey into the city by light rail. Here, well-engineered",Paragraph

The main theoretician of the morphological as an end in,Paragraph
"itself has been the architect Greg Lynn, whose writings have",Paragraph
"appeared in two successive publications, Folds, Bodies and",Paragraph
Blobs of 1998 and Animate Form of 1999. As far as,Paragraph
"architecture is concerned, certain unavoidable problems",Paragraph
arise with this kind of analogical reasoning - not only the,Paragraph
dubious stratagem of positing the metabolic processes of,Paragraph
"nature as the basis of a new architecture, but also the",Paragraph
implicit repudiation of building culture as it has emerged,Paragraph
overtime as a pragmatic response to the constraints of,Paragraph
"climate, topography and available material, not to mention",Paragraph
those implacable forces of nature such as gravity and,Paragraph
climate that always tend to undermine the durability of,Paragraph
man-made form.,Paragraph

Port Terminal (2002) [794] on the basis of a topological,Paragraph
interplay between earthwork and roofwork. In an account of,Paragraph
"their first seven years of practice, entitled Phylogenesis:",Paragraph
"FOA’s Ark (2003), they write:",Paragraph
"794 Zaera Polo and Moussavi (Foreign Office Architects), Yokohama International",Caption
"Port Terminal, 2002.",Caption
The Yokohama project started from the possibility of,Paragraph
"generating organization from a circulation pattern, as a",Paragraph
development of the idea of a hybridization between a shed -,Paragraph
a more or less undetermined container - and a ground...,Paragraph
Our first move was to set the circulation diagram as a,Paragraph
structure of interlaced loops that allow for multiple return,Paragraph
paths... .,Paragraph
The second decision in the process was that the building,Paragraph
"should not appear on the skyline, to be consistent with the",Paragraph
"idea of not making a gate on a semantic level as well, by",Paragraph
avoiding the building becoming a sign. This immediately led,Paragraph
"to the idea of making a very flat building, and from there we",Paragraph
moved into turning the building into a ground. Once we,Paragraph
"decided that the building would be a warped surface, we",Paragraph
sought to produce an argument of consistency between the,Paragraph
no-return diagram and the surface ... To spread the building,Paragraph
"mass as thin as possible, we occupied the maximum area",Paragraph
possible within the site. This and the requirement of placing,Paragraph
straight boarding decks 15m from the pier’s edge along,Paragraph
both sides of the building to connect to moving bridges is,Paragraph
what determined the rectangular footprint of the building ...,Paragraph
The next decision was how to make the form structural. The,Paragraph
obvious solution of supporting the surfaces with columns,Paragraph
was not consistent with the aim to produce space and,Paragraph
"organization literally out of the circulatory diagram, and a",Paragraph
more interesting possibility was to try to develop a,Paragraph
structural system out of the warped surface.?,Paragraph
As far as the contemporary pursuit of a morphological,Paragraph
"architecture is concerned, what puts the Yokohama terminal",Paragraph
in a class of its own is the way in which a constantly warping,Paragraph
"complex of inclined roofs, ramps and open-air promenades",Caption
is generated out of faceted bifurcating planes held in place,Paragraph
by a geometrically coherent steel-framed superstructure.,Paragraph
"Unlike almost all of the morphological works cited above,",Paragraph
this superstructure provides not only for the spatial,Paragraph
"articulation of the interior, but also for the",Paragraph
"phenomenological character of the work, including, in this",Paragraph
"instance, a large passenger-transit hall covered by wide-",Paragraph
"span, folded-plate roofs in sheet steel.",Paragraph
The method by which FOA were able to generate and,Paragraph
realize this complex work led them to appropriate the,Paragraph
concept of phylogenesis as a transformable ‘evolutionary’,Paragraph
"system, with which they were able to approach a wide",Paragraph
spectrum of programmes in an equally diverse range of,Paragraph
sites and climatic conditions. What is evoked by the term,Paragraph
‘phylogenesis’ is an aspiration towards the postulation of an,Paragraph
appropriate geometrical scheme rather than the selection of,Paragraph
an arbitrary shape. Thus the work of FOA was distinguished,Paragraph
"by the fact that each new commission, together with its",Paragraph
"topographic context, was used not only to engender a",Paragraph
different parti but also to imagine mathematically distinct,Paragraph
"spatiotectonic networks, so that the received programme",Paragraph
was invariably transformed through an unforeseen,Paragraph
"geometrical format that, however much it may have been",Paragraph
"derived from typological precedent, was equally likely to",Paragraph
have been conditioned by the morphology of the site. In the,Paragraph
"case of the Yokohama terminal, the tectonic play between",Paragraph
earthwork and roofwork is so symbiotic as to become a,Paragraph
"multilayered topography, rising and falling along the length",Paragraph
of the pier. This undulation tends to confirm the fact that it,Paragraph
is the superstructure rather than the earthwork that lends,Paragraph
itself most readily to being treated as a topological surface.,Paragraph
"A comparable topological ethos characterizes the glazed,",Paragraph
undulating canopy that runs down the circulation spine of,Paragraph
"the Fiera di Milano complex [795], built outside Milan in",Paragraph
2005 to the designs of Massimiliano Fuksas. A large-span,Caption
glazed roof of slightly varying profile in section also covers,Paragraph
"Nicholas Grimshaw’s former Eurostar Terminal [796], added",Paragraph
to Waterloo Station in London in 1993. In this instance the,Paragraph
sectional variation is a direct consequence of the changing,Paragraph
configuration of the site in plan. In this context one should,Paragraph
also remember the trope of the crustacean glass roof as it,Paragraph
was variously pursued by Austrian architects during the,Paragraph
1980s and 1990s; examples are the crystalline penthouse,Paragraph
that Coop Himmelblau planted on top of a traditional Neo-,Paragraph

Sustainability,Title
In his study Ten Shades of Green: Architecture and the,Paragraph
"Natural World (2000-05), Peter Buchanan supplements his",Paragraph
descriptive analysis of ten exemplary green buildings with,Paragraph
ten precepts that cover a wide spectrum of sustainable,Paragraph
"practices, from the optimization of natural shade, light and",Paragraph
ventilation to the use of renewable sources of natural,Title
energy; from the elimination of waste and pollution to the,Paragraph
reduction of the amount of energy embodied in the,Paragraph
construction materials themselves. Buchanan writes:,Paragraph
The common building material with the least embodied,Paragraph
"energy is wood, with about 640 kilowatt-hours per ton...",Paragraph
Hence the greenest building material is wood from,Paragraph
sustainably managed forests. Brick is the material with the,Paragraph
"next lowest amount of embodied energy, 4 times (X) that of",Paragraph
"wood, then concrete (5X), plastic (6X), glass (14X), steel",Paragraph
"(24X), aluminum (126xX). A building with a high proportion of",Paragraph
aluminum components can hardly be green when,Paragraph
"considered from the perspective of total life cycle costing,",Paragraph
no matter how energy-efficient it might be.*,Paragraph
Statistics such as these should certainly give us pause for,Paragraph
"thought, including the sobering fact that the built",Paragraph
environment accounts for some 40 per cent of total energy,Paragraph
"consumption in the developed world, comparable to what is",Paragraph
consumed by road and jet travel. Much of this profligate use,Paragraph
"is due to artificial lighting, which swallows up some 65 per",Paragraph
"cent of our total consumption of electricity, with air",Paragraph
conditioning and digital equipment coming a close second.,Paragraph
It is equally sobering that a large part of any contemporary,Paragraph
land-fill is invariably made up of building waste: it accounts,Paragraph
for some 33 per cent of the average municipal waste stream,Paragraph
in the United States.,Paragraph
"In the face of these dystopic statistics, Buchanan’s",Paragraph
"recommendations have a markedly cultural character, such",Paragraph
as his advocacy of building according to the anti-ergonomic,Paragraph
principle of ‘long life/loose fit’. This precept was naturally,Paragraph
"integral to the load-bearing masonry structures of the past,",Paragraph
"bequeathing us a legacy of eminently adaptable buildings,",Paragraph
"mostly dating from the 18th and 19th centuries, many of",Paragraph
which we have been able to put to new uses. Such residual,Paragraph
value is more difficult to achieve today on account of our,Paragraph
standards of minimal space and our commitment to the,Title
paradoxically inflexible lightweight building techniques of,Paragraph
our time.,Paragraph
Buchanan insists that every building should be closely,Paragraph
integrated into its context. He therefore urges architects to,Paragraph
"pay as much attention to such factors as microclimate,",Paragraph
topography and vegetation as to the more familiar,Paragraph
functional and formal concerns addressed in standard,Title
practice. Exemplary in this regard is Renzo Piano’s Jean-,Paragraph
"Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre [797], built in Noumea, New",Caption
"Caledonia, in 1998, where the so-called laminated timber",Paragraph
"‘cases’, 20 to 30 metres (65 to 88 feet) in height, refer, at a",Paragraph
"giant scale, to the traditional Kanak hut. These cases are",Paragraph
capped halfway up by sloping roofs that are either solid or,Paragraph
"glazed according to the function of the spaces beneath,",Paragraph
which range from meeting halls to exhibition spaces and,Paragraph
dance studios. The inclined roofs are framed and stiffened,Paragraph
"by steel rings, and, where glazed, are covered by a layer of",Paragraph
external louvres. The remainder of the complex consists of a,Caption
"single-storey orthogonal structure, housing exhibition space,",Caption
"administration and research offices, and a 400-seat lecture",Paragraph
"hall. Informally arranged along one side of this mat-building,",Paragraph
the timber cases evoke through their spire-like forms of,Paragraph
varying height the profile of a traditional Kanak village.,Paragraph
"While this allusion was endorsed by the Kanak themselves,",Paragraph
one can hardly overlook the post-colonial context of this,Paragraph
"work - above all the paradoxical fact that, funded by the",Paragraph
"French state, it stands as a memorial to the Kanak freedom",Paragraph
fighter Tjibaou.,Paragraph
"797 Piano, Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre, Noumea, New Caledonia, 1998.",Caption
The timber ‘cases’ simulate the profile of the traditional Kanak hut.,Paragraph
Buchanan’s eighth precept stresses the crucial role to be,Paragraph
played by public transport in sustaining the ecological,Paragraph
"balance of any particular land settlement pattern, since",Paragraph
"urban sprawl, no matter how green it might be in itself, can",Paragraph
hardly outweigh the energy consumed in the daily commute,Paragraph
by automobile between home and work and its,Paragraph
accompanying environmental pollution. In opposing this,Paragraph
"entropic prospect, Buchanan stresses the benefits to public",Paragraph
health that derive from dense urban form that is well served,Paragraph
by public transport and thus sustainable in the wider sense,Paragraph
of the term.,Paragraph
An entirely different stratagem towards sustainability is,Paragraph
"evident in the forty-five-storey Commerzbank [798, 799],",Paragraph
"realized by Foster Associates in Frankfurt in 1997, structured",Paragraph
"around an atrium rising for the full height of the building,",Paragraph
with four-storey-high sky-gardens alternating from one side,Paragraph
of the atrium to the other to admit light and air into the,Paragraph
central shaft. The Commerzbank is also clad in double,Paragraph
"glazing throughout. Here, the outer skin serves to buffer the",Paragraph
"wind and weather, so that the manually operated lights of",Paragraph
the inner skin may be opened at will to ventilate the offices.,Paragraph
The building is automatically sealed and air-conditioned only,Paragraph
when the climate is extremely hot or cold. The design’s,Paragraph
most radical spatio-social innovation turns on the,Paragraph
displacement of the service core to the apices of the,Paragraph
"triangular plan, thereby affording visual access across the",Paragraph
atrium to the elevated sky gardens and vice versa. These,Paragraph
garden terraces not only serve to ventilate the atrium but,Paragraph
also to provide an interim semi-public breakout space.,Paragraph
Adjustable glass dampers span the atrium at the level of,Paragraph
every twelve floors in order to modulate the Venturi effect of,Paragraph
air movement within the central shaft.,Paragraph
"798 Foster Associates, Commerzbank, Frankfurt, 1997. Section showing air",Caption
movement through the atrium.,Paragraph
"799 Foster Associates, Commerzbank, Frankfurt, 1997. Sketch of a typical view",Caption
across the offices into the ‘sky-gardens’.,Paragraph
"In the United States, where 5 per cent of the world’s",Paragraph
"population consumes 24 per cent of the world’s energy,",Paragraph
there has been a tendency to deny the reality of global,Paragraph
warming and to continue with the maximized consumption,Paragraph
of non-renewable energy. This denial is evident in the,Paragraph
reluctance of the American government to enforce,Title
progressive environmental regulations as a standard mode,Title
"of practice, an obtuseness that has sometimes been",Paragraph
welcomed by architects on the grounds that sustainable,Paragraph
design curbs their freedom of expression. Such an attitude,Paragraph
"is as reactionary as it is perverse, given that responding",Paragraph
symbiotically to the exigencies of both climate and context,Paragraph
has invariably served as a mainspring for tectonic invention,Paragraph
since time immemorable. Equally sustainable - given our,Paragraph
proliferating of building waste through wanton destruction -,Paragraph
"is, as Buchanan implies, the potential for conservation,",Paragraph
"conversion, repair and reuse of existing buildings. This is",Paragraph
"exemplified by the brilliant restoration, expansion and",Paragraph
"refurbishment in 2012 of Astley Castle, Nuneaton,",Caption
"Warwickshire, UK, by the architects Witherford Watson",Caption
"Mann, for which they were awarded the Stirling Prize in",Paragraph

Materiality,Title
Unlike the ubiquitous white architecture of the early Modern,Paragraph
"Movement, when buildings were invariably rendered in",Paragraph
cement over a light skeleton frame and treated as though,Paragraph
they were made of a neutral material verging on the,Paragraph
immaterial (a condition that was virtually achieved after,Paragraph
"1945 with the ubiquitous, totally glazed Miesian office",Paragraph
"building), the expressive materiality to which this section",Paragraph
alludes has at least some of its origins in the load-bearing,Paragraph
brick churches that the Swedish master Sigurd Lewerentz,Caption
designed during the last two decades of his life: St Mark’s in,Caption
"Bjorkhagen (1958-60) and St Peter’s, Klippan (1963-66). No",Caption

"vaults, which span between steel joists, swelling gently like",Paragraph
ocean waves ... what photographs cannot convey is the,Paragraph
"almost preternatural darkness, which binds the fabric into",Paragraph
an all-enveloping unity.°,Paragraph
Among the most accomplished practitioners of this,Paragraph
emphasis on material have been the Swiss-German,Paragraph
"minimalists Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, beginning",Paragraph
"with their holiday house in Tavole, Italy (1988), in which",Paragraph
stones from the site were loosely packed into a delicate,Paragraph
"reinforced-concrete frame, and their Ricola Warehouse in",Paragraph
"Laufen, Switzerland (1987), which, set before the cliff-face",Paragraph
"of a disused quarry, was faced by way of contrast with fibre-",Paragraph
cement planks of varying depth. The simple spatial,Paragraph
requirements in each instance enabled the architects to,Paragraph
treat the material as the primary aesthetic presence in,Paragraph
contrast to the rather passive character of the space-form.,Paragraph
This emphasis on the tactile character of material would,Paragraph
"henceforth become the hallmark of their practice, a mode",Paragraph
that invariably has been at its most effective in small and,Paragraph

predicated on the striking use of contrasting materials: fair,Paragraph

Corten steel retaining walls in Osnabruck.,Caption
Swiss-German minimalism would also seem to have,Paragraph
"exercised a certain influence outside the country, notably",Paragraph
"affecting the work of the Dutch architect Wiel Arets, whose",Paragraph
Maastricht Academy of Art (1989-93) [801] was deftly,Paragraph

configuration of this building consists of a four-storey,Paragraph
trabeated reinforced-concrete frame filled with glass blocks.,Caption
"801 Arets, Maastricht Academy of Art, 1989-93.",Caption
A comparable emphasis on a single all-enveloping,Paragraph
material also characterizes the work of the Japanese,Paragraph
"architect Kengo Kuma, whose Stone Museum in Nasu in the",Paragraph
Tochigi Prefecture (2000) is constructed out of narrow bands,Paragraph

and wood display their original in nature with a,Paragraph
phenomenological intensity that can hardly be rivalled; it is,Paragraph
this intensity that endows them with a primordial sensibility,Paragraph
that other building materials lack.,Paragraph
Timber has also played a remarkable role in recent,Paragraph
"bridge construction, particularly in Switzerland, in the hands",Paragraph
of such distinguished engineers as Jurg Conzett and Walter,Paragraph
"Bieler - the former for the inverted, cable-tied timber",Paragraph
"trusswork of his Traversina footbridge, erected in 1996",Caption

An additional factor that has completely transformed the,Paragraph
scope of material expression today is the greatly increased,Paragraph
ease with which materials can be transported across the,Paragraph
"globe, from their site of origin to the point of their final",Paragraph
"application, with stops for specialized fabrication in",Paragraph
between. This was already the case with Arata Isozaki’s,Paragraph

exercise in global production was the totally glazed,Paragraph

Habitat,Title
"Our failure to develop a sustainable, homeostatic pattern of",Paragraph
residential land settlement over the past half-century is the,Paragraph
tragic corollary of our incapacity to curb our appetite for,Paragraph
consuming every possible resource. Towards an Urban,Paragraph
"Renaissance, pointedly published by the British government",Paragraph
"at the millennium, estimated that 3.8 million new",Paragraph
households would be required in the UK up to 2025. It,Paragraph
recommended that two-thirds of these units should be built,Paragraph
on existing intra-urban detoxified brownfield sites rather,Paragraph
than be allowed to contribute to the subdivision of formerly,Paragraph
agricultural greenfield land. A rider to the report published,Paragraph
in 2005 showed that 70 per cent of then-current British,Paragraph
"development was on brownfield sites, as opposed to 56 per",Paragraph
cent in 1997.,Paragraph
Although aspiration to a middle-class way of life tends,Paragraph
"increasingly to be the norm irrespective of class, the",Paragraph
challenge for architects is how to create a sense of ‘home’,Paragraph
without resorting to kitsch or indulging in a nostalgic,Paragraph
iconography that has no relation to our contemporary way,Paragraph
"of life. Low-rise, high-density housing has long been a viable",Paragraph
"option: one thinks of the Siedlung Halen, Berne, built to the",Paragraph
"designs of Atelier 5 in 1960 (see p. 360), and the equally",Paragraph
"canonical, more extensive Puchenau settlement built in",Paragraph
stages along the Danube near Linz to the designs of the,Paragraph
"Austrian architect Roland Rainer (see p. 587), the first phase",Paragraph
of which was completed between 1964 and 1967. What is,Paragraph
remarkable about this carpet housing model is the way in,Paragraph
which it may be brought to serve the housing needs of,Paragraph
"different classes, from the urban poor of the developing",Paragraph
"world, who continue to construct low-rise ‘squatter’",Paragraph
"settlements, to the urbanized middle classes of the",Paragraph
"developed world, who are served by the car and",Paragraph
occasionally by public transport. It is perhaps indicative of,Paragraph
certain cultural differences that while this mode of,Paragraph
settlement may be found fairly frequently throughout,Paragraph
"Continental Europe, it has generally been resisted as a",Paragraph
residential pattern in Anglo-American society. As the,Paragraph
transportation specialist Brian Richards noted in his first,Paragraph
"study, New Movement in Cities of 1966, it is economically",Paragraph
impossible for public transport to complement car use,Title
without the residential land-settlement pattern having a,Paragraph
much higher density than the average suburban,Paragraph
subdivision.,Paragraph
"While considering the genre of low-rise, high-density",Paragraph
"housing as designed for low-income urban populations, we",Paragraph
should acknowledge two separate experimental housing,Paragraph
"estates, built in Latin America some forty years apart, that",Paragraph
now appear as mirror images of one another: the Previ,Paragraph
"estate outside Lima, Peru, built in 1974 during the",Paragraph
"government of Fernando Belaunde Terry, under the direction",Caption
of the British architect Peter Land; and the realization of a,Paragraph
"prototypical settlement, designed by the Chilean architect",Paragraph
Alejandro Aravena and built under the auspices of the,Paragraph
"Chilean Ministry of Housing in Iquique, Tarapaca, in 2004",Caption
[802]. The Previ estate entailed the construction of twenty-,Paragraph
three different types of low-rise units designed by various,Paragraph
"teams of Peruvian and international architects, while the",Paragraph
Elemental project represented a collective effort to provide,Paragraph
affordable dwellings without overloading the occupants with,Paragraph
debt. The first phase at Iquique comprised one hundred,Paragraph
"‘starter’ units, each 30 square metres (323 square feet) in",Paragraph
"area and built at the cost of $7,500 per unit. These three-",Paragraph
"storey narrow-fronted megara, built of concrete block,",Caption
"provide for a living room/kitchen, a bathroom, a bedroom",Paragraph
and an access stair. In order to allow for enlargements by,Paragraph
"the occupants themselves, the units are spaced apart at",Paragraph
"intervals equal to their width, so that additional rooms may",Paragraph
be constructed easily between the party walls. The block,Paragraph
layout also yields a series of small squares capable of,Paragraph
functioning as communal spaces.,Paragraph
"802 Aravena, housing project, Iquique, Tarapaca, 2004. Elevation.",Caption
The most crucial change that has occurred in the late,Paragraph
20th and early 21st centuries is the engineered eclipse of,Paragraph
"subsidized rental housing, which had been central to welfare",Paragraph
state policy between 1945 and 1975. This has now been,Paragraph
"replaced, more or less universally, by the ‘housing market’,",Paragraph
which has done little to alleviate either the perennial,Paragraph
housing crisis or the proliferation of suburban sprawl. A one-,Paragraph
"off exception is the medium-rise Quartier McNair [803],",Paragraph
completed in the Zehlendorf district of Berlin in 2003 to the,Paragraph
designs of Baumschlager and Eberle together with the Swiss,Paragraph
"architect Anatole du Fresne, who was formerly a member of",Paragraph
Atelier 5. The settlement consists of an orthogonal,Paragraph
"permutation of 263 dwellings of two to three storeys, of",Paragraph
"varying plan type and size, arranged in an alternating block",Paragraph
pattern reminiscent of Le Corbusier’s Pessac housing of,Paragraph
1926 (see p. 168). Despite the green roofs and the,Paragraph
"deployment of solar panels, it is regrettable from the",Paragraph
viewpoint of sustainability that the parking areas were not,Paragraph
finished with permeable perforated-concrete paving rather,Paragraph
"than asphalt. In Switzerland this method, facilitating the",Paragraph
absorption of storm water and the seeding of parking areas,Title
"with grass, is virtually a standard technique; it is only",Paragraph
marginally more expensive and is capable of offsetting the,Paragraph
‘urban heat-island effect’ that is exacerbated by the use of,Paragraph
"asphalt. In the final analysis, it is the overall form rather",Paragraph
than the detail that allows the Quartier McNair to function as,Paragraph
a potential alternative ‘market’ model for inner-city housing.,Paragraph
Not least among its virtues is the fact that it is but twenty,Paragraph
minutes by public transport from the centre of Berlin.,Caption
"803 Baumschlager, Eberle and du Fresne, Quartier McNair, Zehlendorf, Berlin,",Caption
2003.,Paragraph
In terms of providing for the housing needs of the middle,Paragraph
"classes, Baumschlager and Eberle have designed some of",Paragraph
the most viable medium-rise housing settlements of any,Paragraph
practice in Europe over the past two decades. Nowhere,Paragraph
have they been more successful in this regard than in their,Paragraph
"Lohbach Siedlung in Innsbruck, Austria (2000) [804]. This",Caption
generic four- to six-storey development is predicated on,Paragraph
"apartments of varying size, planned around four sides of a",Paragraph
light-court. What imparts a culturally ecological dimension,Paragraph
to these blocks is the fact that apartment balconies on the,Paragraph
perimeter may be closed off with full-height folding shutters,Paragraph
"so that, depending on the movement of the sun and on the",Paragraph
"presence or absence of the occupants, the blocks appear as",Paragraph
forms of varying opacity. The overall composition has been,Paragraph
"carefully considered in relation to the alpine backdrop, while",Paragraph
pedestrian movement at ground level has been enhanced,Paragraph
by sensitively landscaped gardens. In addition to the folding,Paragraph
"shutters, the sustainability of this project stems from the",Paragraph
"provision of photovoltaic panels, from the harvesting of",Paragraph
"rainwater, and from the provision of a heat-recovery plant in",Paragraph
the basement. At the same time the luxurious ambience of,Paragraph
the whole derives from its facing materials: from the,Paragraph
"combination of copper-clad shutters, glass balustrading, and",Paragraph
the sliding full-height timber-louvred screens that cover the,Paragraph
window openings.,Paragraph
"804 Baumschlager and Eberle, Lohbach Siedlung, Innsbruck, 2000.",Caption
All of these housing schemes are but various attempts to,Paragraph
reintegrate the individual dwelling into some kind of,Paragraph
"collective whole, and it is just this drive to recover a former",Paragraph
unity that has led late modern architects like Steven Holl to,Paragraph
"search for new forms of residential aggregation, from his",Paragraph
"Fukuoka housing complex, completed in Japan in 1992, to",Paragraph
his Hybrid Building in Beijing. The latter comprises a self-,Paragraph
"contained urban fragment of 728 apartments housing 2,500",Paragraph
people together with the essential services required by a,Paragraph
neighbourhood of this size. These services are housed partly,Paragraph
"in glazed bridges that link the eight apartment towers,",Paragraph
"ranging from twelve to twenty-two storeys in height, so as",Paragraph
to form a loop around the central open space at ground,Paragraph
"level. The latter is focused about a cinema complex,",Paragraph
suspended above a reflecting pool. The harvesting of,Paragraph
rainwater in this ornamental retention basin is only part of,Paragraph
the comprehensive sustainable strategy adopted in this,Paragraph
"development, which includes green roofs, naturally",Paragraph
"ventilated and illuminated underground parking, external",Caption
"sun blinds, openable windows, and, above all, geothermal",Paragraph
heating and cooling.,Paragraph
Civic Form,Title
"In a world increasingly depoliticized by the media, ‘the",Paragraph
space of public appearance’ (to use Hannah Arendt’s,Paragraph
memorable phrase) still remains as a democratic ideal for,Paragraph
"both architecture and society, particularly at a time when a",Paragraph
homeostatically balanced way of life is increasingly,Paragraph
undermined by the commodification of both the natural and,Paragraph
the man-made worlds. What Arendt intends by this term is,Paragraph
made explicit in her study The Human Condition of 1958:,Paragraph
The only indispensable material factor in the generation of,Paragraph
power is the living together of people. Only when men live,Paragraph
so close together that the potentialities of action are always,Paragraph
"present can power remain with them, and the foundation of",Paragraph
"cities, which as city-states have remained paradigmatic for",Paragraph
"all Western political organization, is therefore indeed the",Paragraph
most important material prerequisite for power.©,Paragraph
With these words Arendt characterized not only the latent,Paragraph
"political and cultural potential of civic form, but also the",Paragraph
space of assembly wherever this may still be found within,Paragraph
public institutions in general. Over the past few decades,Paragraph
civic building of quality has been particularly noticeable in,Paragraph
"France, above all in the work of Henri Ciriani and Jean",Paragraph
"Nouvel, with the former subtly continuing the programmatic",Paragraph
"approach of Le Corbusier, and the latter favouring a",Paragraph
"technocratic aesthetic that is, at times, equally concerned",Paragraph
with the representation of the cultural institution as a space,Paragraph
of public appearance.,Paragraph
"In the case of Ciriani, the emphasis has fallen not only on",Paragraph
"the museum as a microcosmos, but also on its potential to",Paragraph
serve as a surrogate for the socially unifying religious,Paragraph
building. This aspect manifests itself particularly forcefully in,Paragraph
two museums realized by Ciriani towards the end of his,Caption
"career: the Archaeological Museum at Arles, completed in",Caption
"1991, and the Museum for the First World War at Peronne",Caption
"[806, 807], which was integrated into the remains of a",Paragraph
17th-century fortress in 1994. Notwithstanding the,Paragraph
undeniably arresting image of a building faced completely in,Paragraph
"cobalt-blue glass, the museum in Arles is not easily",Paragraph
"accessible, largely because, detached from the urban core,",Paragraph
it can only be approached via a ring road encircling the city.,Paragraph
"The articulation of its internal space, with freestanding",Paragraph
"cylindrical columns, conveys the impression of a Neo-Purist",Paragraph
"enclave, as removed from everyday life as the collection it",Paragraph
houses. Such hermeticism does not arise in the case of the,Paragraph
"Peronne museum, on account of the immediate proximity of",Paragraph
the urban fabric and the presence of an adjacent riverside,Paragraph
"park. Moreover, the elevation of its concrete mass on pilotis",Paragraph
enables a carefully orchestrated promenade through the,Paragraph
sombre relics of the 1914-18 war to be relieved by views,Paragraph
over the park that flanks the building on its south-western,Paragraph
face.,Paragraph

"806 Ciriani, Museum for the First World War, Peronne, 1994. Transverse section.",Caption
"807 Ciriani, Museum for the First World War, Peronne, 1994. General view.",Caption
The eventual size of museums is limited if they are to,Paragraph
retain their institutional viability and civic significance. As Le,Paragraph
Corbusier’s 1934 proposal for a ‘Musée a croissance,Paragraph
"illimitée’ demonstrated, a museum of unlimited expansion is",Paragraph
self-contradictory both conceptually and urbanistically. This,Paragraph
"limit, difficult to specify in advance, may partially explain",Paragraph
why the new Museum of Modern Art in New York (2004) has,Paragraph
now attained a size at which it has begun to lose its,Paragraph
capacity to be read within the city as a discrete civic,Paragraph
institution. This has come about despite the brilliant,Paragraph
orchestration of its penultimate extension by the Japanese,Paragraph
"architect Yoshio Taniguchi, who attempted to compensate",Paragraph
for its extraordinary size and scale by introducing a public,Paragraph
"galleria, as a virtual right of way through the building, within",Paragraph
the street grid of its Manhattan mid-block site.,Paragraph
"Richard Meier’s Getty Center, completed as a city-in-",Paragraph
miniature on a prominent hilltop site in the Brentwood area,Caption
"of Los Angeles in 1997, has an indisputable civic character,",Paragraph
"as does his Hague City Hall complex, realized in 1995. Apart",Paragraph
"from being a megaform accommodating offices, shops, a",Paragraph
"municipal library and a council chamber, what is decisive",Paragraph
about this institution is the fact that its thirteen-storey mass,Paragraph
"encloses a top-lit galleria [809] 183 metres (600 feet) long,",Paragraph
"modulated by footbridges, fed by freestanding elevators,",Paragraph
which link the corridors of the flanking offices. This is a civic,Paragraph
volume rivalling in its extent and height the largest galleria,Paragraph
"of the 19th century, the Galleria Umberto | erected in Naples",Paragraph
"in 1891. In a city that in recent years has seen its intimate,",Paragraph
"low-rise, brick-lined street fabric overwhelmed by random",Paragraph
"high-rise development, Meier’s City Hall presents itself as a",Paragraph
"civic oasis, capable of consolidating a new scale around",Paragraph
itself while compensating for the loss of urbanity in the city,Paragraph
as a whole. The civic appeal of the galleria itself stems in no,Paragraph
"small measure from the fact that it is a large, top-lit public",Paragraph
space permanently shielded from the inclemencies of the,Paragraph
Dutch climate.,Paragraph
A sense of civitas on a heroic scale is to be found in the,Paragraph
work of the Berlin architects Axel Schultes and Charlotte,Caption
"Frank, most notably in their winning Spreebogen",Paragraph
competition entry of 1993. The scheme assumed the form of,Paragraph
a temenos - a strip of federal buildings to be known as the,Paragraph
‘Band des Bundes’ - initially projected as the administrative,Paragraph
centre of a reunified Germany four years after the fall of the,Paragraph
Berlin Wall in 1989. The Wall had hitherto divided not only,Paragraph
"East and West Berlin, but also, on a global scale, the",Paragraph
democratic West from the Communist East. The Schultes-,Paragraph
Frank entry for this international competition was the only,Paragraph
scheme to capture the urbanistic and symbolic importance,Paragraph
"of the site, in terms both of the history of the previous half-",Paragraph
century and of the way in which this void in the heart of the,Paragraph
city had served repeatedly as the context for tragically,Paragraph
contrasting conceptions of Germany’s destiny.,Paragraph
Out of this proposal came the architects’ German,Paragraph
"Chancellery [808], completed in 2001 as a partial",Paragraph
"realization of their original scheme, the full extent of which",Paragraph
will not now be realized - a regrettable circumstance given,Paragraph

to achieve in our commodified world of universal,Paragraph
