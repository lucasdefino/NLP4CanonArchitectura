It can be understood to refer to all buildings of the modern period regardless of their ideolog- ical basis, or it can be understood more specifically as an architecture conscious of its own modernity and striving for change. It is in the latter sense that it has generally been defined in histories of contem- porary architecture, and the present book follows this tradition. Already in the early nineteenth century, there was wide dissatisfaction with eclecticism among architects, historians, and critics. This well- documented attitude justifies a history of modern architecture concerned primarily with reformist, avant-garde tendencies, rather than one that attempts to deal with the whole of architectural produc- tion as if it operated within a non-ideological, neutral field. It is in the space between the idealist utopias of the historical avant- gardes and the resistances, complexities, and pluralities of capitalist culture that this book seeks to situate itself. Though not attempting to be in any way encyclopedic, the narrative follows an overall chronolog- ical sequence, and tries to be, perhaps, less certain in its outcome and less triumphalist than those of most previous histories of modernism. The book consists of a number of essays that can be read either as self- contained narratives or as part of a larger whole, each dealing with a cluster of related themes reflecting an important moment in the con- frontation of architecture with the external conditions of modernity. If it is still largely a history of the masters, that is because that was the nature of modernism itself, despite its many claims to anonymity. A word on terminology: I use more or less interchangeably the terms modern architecture , Modernism, the avant-garde , to mean the progressive movements of the 1910s and 19208 as a whole. I also occasionally use the term historical avant-garde , which has the effect of historicizing the movement and distinguishing it from contempo- rary practice. I do not follow Peter Birger (Theory of the Avant-Garde, 1984), who, in the context of Dada photomontage, distinguishes between an avant-garde that sought to change the status of art within the relations of production and a Modernism that sought only to change its forms. That these two polar positions can be applied to architecture is undeniable. But the line between them is hard to define, \r",{"entities":[[2066,2078,"PER"]]}],["and even the work of the Left Constructivists and Marxists like Hannes Meyer does not, in my opinion, escape aestheticism. This is hardly sur- prising, since, before it could be separated from the classical-academic theory of the arts, aesthetics had first to become an autonomous cate- gory. Apart from the general terms mentioned above which are useful precisely because of their semantic vagueness other terms are used, either to define well-attested sub-movements, such as Futurism, Con- structivism, De Stijl, LEsprit Nouveau, and the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity), or migratory tendencies within the overall phe- nomenon of modernism, such as organicism, neoclassicism, Expressionism, functionalism, and rationalism. I have tried to explain what I mean by these slippery terms in the appropriate chapters. From a certain perspective, general terms such as modernism can also be applied to Art Nouveau as, indeed, the temporal span of this book implies. To try to avoid such ambiguities would be to make unsustainable claims for logic. Art Nouveau was both the end and the beginning of an era, and its achievements as well as its limitations were the result of this Janus-like perspective. Many aspects of Modernist theory still seem valid today. But much in it belongs to the realm of myth, and is impossible to accept at face value. The myth itself has now become history, and demands critical interpretation. One of the main ideas motivating the protagonists of the Modern Movement was the Hegelian notion that the study of history made it possible to predict its future course. But it is scarcely possible any longer to believe as the Modernist architects appear to have believed that the architect is a kind of seer, uniquely gifted with the power of discerning the spirit of the age and its symbolic forms. Such a belief was predicated on the possibility of projecting the condi- tions of the past onto the present. For progressive-minded architects of the nineteenth century and their twentieth-century successors, it seemed essential to create a unified architectural style that would reflect its age, just as previous styles had reflected theirs. This meant the rejec- tion of an academic tradition that had degenerated into eclecticism, imprisoned in a history that had come to an end and whose forms could only be endlessly recycled. It did not imply a rejection of tradition as such. The architecture of the future would return to the frve tradition, in which, it was believed, a harmonious and organic unity had existed between all the cultural phenomena of each age. In the great historical periods artists had not been free to choose the style in which they worked. Their mental and creative horizons had been circumscribed by a range of forms that constituted their entire universe. The artist came into a world already formed. The study of history seemed to reveal that these periods constituted indivisible totalities. On the one hand, there were elements unique to each period; on the other, the organic unity that bound these elements together was itself a universal. The new age \r",{"entities":[[64,76,"PER"]]}],["must exhibit the cultural totality characteristic of all historical periods. The question was never asked how a cultural totality, which by defi- nition had depended on an involuntary collective will, could now be achieved voluntarily by a number of individuals. Nor did it ever seem to have occurred to those who held this view that what separated the past from the present might be precisely the absence of this inferred organic unity. According to the model of the organic unity of culture, the task of the architect was first to uncover and then create the unique forms of the age. But the possibility of such an architecture depended on a defin- ition of modernity that filtered out the very factors that differentiated it most strongly from earlier traditions: capitalism and industrialization. William Morris, the founder of the Arts and Crafts movement, had rejected both capitalism and machine production, a position that was at least consistent. But the theorists of the German Werkbund, while they rejected capitalism, wanted to retain industrialization. They con- demned what they saw as the materialistic values of both Marxism and Western liberal democracy, but sought an alternative that would combine the benefits of modern technology with a return to the pre- ndustrial community values that capitalism was in the process of destroying. The Modern Movement was both an act of resistance to social modernity and an enthusiastic acceptance of an open technologi- cal future. It longed for a world of territorial and social fixity, while at the same time embracing, incompatibly, an economy and technology in flux. It shared this belief in a mythical third way between capitalism and communism with the Fascist movements of the 1930s, and though it would be completely wrong to brand it with the crimes of Fascism, it is surely no accident that the period of its greatest intensity coincided be with the anti-democratic, totalitarian political movements that were such a dominant feature of the first half of the twentieth century. The conclusion would seem inescapable that the cultural unity and shared artistic standards whether deriving from folk or from aristo- cratic traditions demanded by the modern movement from its inception were increasingly out of step with the political and economic realities of the twentieth century. Based on an idealist and teleological conception of history, modernist theory seems radically to have mis- read the very Zeitgeist it had itself invoked, ignoring the complex and indeterminate nature of modern capitalism, with its dispersal of power and its constant state of movement. The revolution of modernism partly voluntary, partly involun- tary has irrevocably changed the course of architecture. But in the process it has itself become transformed. Its totalizing ambitions can no longer be sustained. Yet, the adventure of the Modern Movement is still capable of acting as an inspiration for a present whose ideals are so much less clearly defined. It is the aim of this book to sharpen our image of that adventure. \r",{"entities":[[801,815,"PER"]]}],["1 Victor Horta View within the octagonal stair hall, H tel Van Eetvelde, 1895, Brussels The real structure is masked by a thin membrane of iron and coloured glass. The space is lit from the roof. Art Nouveau | 1890-1910 In 1892 the short-lived but vigorous Art Nouveau movement was launched in Belgium and quickly spread, first to France and then to the rest of Europe. Its inspiration came from the English Arts and Crafts movement and developments in wrought iron technology, particularly as interpreted by the French architect and theorist, Eug ne-Emmanuel Viollet- le-Duc (1814-79). The movement was closely associated with the rise ofa new industrial bourgeoisie on the one hand and, on the other, with the many movements for political independence in fin-de-si cle Europe. It spread rapidly by means of journals such as The Studie, which included high-quality, mass-produced images, made possible by the new print- ing techniques of offset lithography and photolithography which came into commercial use in the 1880s and 18gos. Art Nouveau was the first systematic attempt to replace the classical system of architecture and the decorative arts that had been handed down from the seventcenth century and was enshrined in the teaching of the Beaux-Arts academies. The new movement abandoned the post-Renaissance convention of realism, drawing inspiration from styles outside the classical canon from Japan, from the Middle Ages, and even from Rococo. Though it lasted barely 15 years, many of its pre- cepts were incorporated into the avant-garde movements that followed. Like all progressive movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Art Nouveau was caught in an inherent dilemma how to preserve the historical values of art under condi- tions of industrial capitalism. The Industrial Revolution had radically altered both the individual and the collective conditions of artistic production. In the face of this situation Art Nouveau artists and architects reacted in a way that would become typical of later avant- gardes: they leapt over recent history to a remote and idealized past in order to find an art that could be historically justified and yet be absolutely new. Although Art Nouveau was preceded and profoundly influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement, the two continued in parallel, cach modifying the other. In Austria, and to some extent in England, there was a fusion of the two movements. In Germany the influence of the \r",{"entities":[[2,14,"PER"],[31,51,"ARCH"],[59,71,"PER"],[79,87,"LOC"],[294,301,"LOC"],[331,337,"LOC"],[362,369,"LOC"],[544,575,"PER"],[771,778,"LOC"],[2386,2393,"LOC"],[2439,2446,"LOC"]]}],["Arts and Crafts proved the stronger of the two, leading to the Deutscher Werkbund and the alliance between industry and the decorative arts. Antecedents The reform of the industrial arts Art Nouveau was the outcome of a transformation in the industrial, or decorative, arts that had been initiated in England and France earlier in the nineteenth century. As early as 1835 a parliamentary commission had been set up in England to study the problem of the decline in artis- tic quality of machine-made objects and the consequent damage to the export market. In 1851 a Great Exhibition of Industry of all Nations was organized in London, following a similar but abortive project in France. (France had led the way in industrial exhibitions but these had been exclusively national.) The Great Exhibition was a huge commer- cial and political success, but it confirmed the low quality of decorative products not only in England but in all the industrial countries, com- pared to those of the East. This realization prompted a succession of initiatives both in England and France . In England, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Department of Practical Art were founded in 1852, and a spate of books on the decorative arts appeared, including the influential Grammar of Ornament (1856) by Owen Jones (1809-74). In France, the Comit central des beaux-arts appliqu s 4 l'industrie was founded (also in 1852), followed by the Union centrale des beaux- arts appliqu s a I ndustrie (1864), which later became the Union centrale des arts d coratifs. Though originating from the same concerns, these institutional reforms resulted in a different development in each country. In England, after the government initiatives of the 1830s, the reform of the arts became a private affair, dominated by a single individual, the artist and poet William Morris (1834-96). For Morris, as for the philosopher-critic John Ruskin (1819-1900), the reform of the indus- trial arts was impossible under the present conditions of industrial capitalism by which the artist was alienated from the product of his labour. In 1861, he set up the firm of Morris, Marshall, and Faulkner to create a context for artists to relearn the various crafts under conditions as near as possible to those of the medieval guilds. Morris s initiative was followed up by others, creating what was to become known as the Arts and Crafts movement. The situation in France was different. First there was a politically influential art establishment, based on the Academy, fundamentally conservative, but aware of the need for reform and eager to promote it.* Secondly, the abolition of the guilds during the French Revolution had \r",{"entities":[[301,308,"LOC"],[313,319,"LOC"],[418,425,"LOC"],[627,633,"LOC"],[679,686,"LOC"],[915,922,"LOC"],[1055,1062,"LOC"],[1067,1073,"LOC"],[1079,1086,"LOC"],[1287,1291,"PER"],[1312,1318,"LOC"],[1669,1676,"LOC"],[1827,1841,"PER"],[1857,1863,"PER"],[1895,1906,"PER"],[2122,2128,"PER"],[2130,2138,"PER"],[2144,2152,"PER"],[2285,2291,"PER"]]}],["not destroyed artisanal traditions in France as thoroughly as the Industrial Revolution had those of England. When they began experi- menting with new techniques and forms in the 1870s, artists and craftsmen working in the decorative arts such as Eug ne Rousseau (1827-91), Felix Bracquemond (1833-1914), and Emile Gall (1846-1904) were able to build upon existing craft traditions. The ultimate model for both English and French artists was the medieval guild, but in France this model was combined with the more recent domestic tradition of Rococo. Viollet-le-Duc and structural rationalism The Arts and Crafts movement and its off-shoot, the English free- style house were to have a considerable influence on the development of Art Nouveau. But there was another influence at work as well the use of iron as an expressive architectural medium. The role of iron in architecture had been central to the debates between traditionalist and progressive-positivist architects in France throughout the nineteenth century. The debate was stimulated by the projects of the Saint- Simonian engineers and entrepreneurs who were largely responsible for laying down the French technical infrastructure in the 1840s and 1850s, and by discussions in the progressive magazine Revue de l'Architecture under the editorship of C sar-Denis Daly (1811-93). But it was chiefly through the theories and designs of Viollet-le-Duc that iron became associated with the reform of the decorative arts, and that an idealist decorative movement became grafted onto the positivist structural tradition. The career of Viollet-le-Duc had been devoted to the distillation of the rational and vitalistic core of Gothic architecture, which he saw as the only true basis for a modern architecture. The main precepts Viollet bequeathed to the Art Nouveau movement were: the exposure of the armature of a building as a visually logical system; the spatial organization of its parts according to function rather than to rules of symmetry and proportion; the importance of materials and their properties as generators of form; the concept of organic form, deriving from the Romantic movement; and the study of vernacular domestic architecture. Through two of his many books, Entretiens sur [ Architecture (Lectures on Architecture) and the Dictionnaire Raisonn de l Architecture Francaise (Dictionary of French Architecture), Viollet-le-Duc became the rallying point for all those opposed to the Beaux-Arts. This was true not only in France, where alternative ateliers were set up (though these were soon reabsorbed into the Beaux-Arts system), but also elsewhere in Europe and in North America. His influence on the Art Nouveau movement came from both his theory and his designs. \r",{"entities":[[38,44,"LOC"],[101,109,"LOC"],[247,262,"PER"],[271,291,"PER"],[309,319,"PER"],[551,565,"PER"],[1311,1327,"PER"],[1394,1408,"PER"],[1589,1603,"PER"],[2388,2402,"PER"],[2496,2502,"LOC"]]}],["Symbolism Most historians* agree that important changes took place in the intel- lectual climate of Western Europe in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. The century had been dominated by a belief in progress made possible by science and technology, a belief that found its philosophical formulation in the movement known as Positivism founded by Auguste Comte (1798-1857). In literature and art it was Naturalism that corresponded most closely to the prevailing Positivist frame of mind. But by the 1880s belief in Positivism had begun to erode, together with the faith in liberal politics that had supported it. Several political events no doubt contributed to this phenomenon, including the terrible European economic depression that began in 1873. In France, the home of Positivism, the change of intellectual climate was especially noticeable, and it was accompanied by a signifi- cant increase in the influence of German philosophy. In literature, the Symbolist movement led the attack. The Symbolists held that art should not imitate appearances but should reveal an essential underly- ing reality. This idea had been anticipated by Baudelaire, whose poem Correspondences (which incorporated Emanuel Swedenborg s theory of synaesthesia, though probably unknowingly), gives voice to the idea that the arts are intimately related to each other at a profound level: like long echoes which from afar become confused . . . Perfumes, colours, and sounds respond to each other. In describing the move- ment, the Belgian Symbolist poet Emile Verhaeren compared German to French thought, to the detriment of the latter: In Naturalism [is found] the French philosophy of the Comtes and the Littr s; in [Symbolism] the German philosophy of Kant and Fichte . . . In the latter, the fact and the world become a mere pretext for the idea; they are treated as appearance, condemned to incessant variability, appear- ing ultimately as dreams in our mind. * The Symbolists did not reject the natural sciences, but looked on science as the verification of subjec- tive states of mind.

Naturalistic representation is sacrificed to an overall formal concept. work of the 1870s and 1880s [2]. Common to these proto-Art Nouveau works was the principle that in ornament the imitation of nature should be subordinated to the organization of the plane surface. In his book Du dessin et de la couleur (Drawing and Colour), published in 1885, the ceramicist Felix Bracquemond defined the new concept in the following terms: Ornament does not necessarily copy nature even when it borrows from her . . . Its infidelity to her . . . [is] due to the fact that it is solely concerned with embellishing surfaces, that it depends on the materials it has to adorn, on the forms it has to follow without altering them. In Art Nouveau, this functional dependency of ornament led to a paradoxical reversal. Instead of merely obeying the form of the object, ornament began to merge with the object, animating it with new life. This had two effects: first, the object became thought of as a single organic entity rather than as an aggregation of separate parts, as in the classical tradition; second, ornament was no longer thought of as space filling , and a dialogue was set up between two positive values orna- ment and empty space. The discovery of what might be called spatial silence probably mainly derived from Japanese prints was one of Art Nouveau s chief contributions to modern Western aesthetics. In this redefinition, the accepted boundary between ornament and form became blurred. The classical attitude had been that ornament was a supplementary form of beauty. It was the German archaeologist Karl B tticher (1806-89) who first suggested that ornament (Kunst- form) was organically related to the underlying substance of the object, giving the inert mechanical structure (Kernform) the semblance of organic life an idea later used by Gottfried Semper (1803-79) in his book Der S#/.* Though Art Nouveau was obviously not the direct result \r",{"entities":[[6,17,"PER"],[1954,1970,"PER"]]}],["3 Henry van de Velde Chair, 1896 This chair demonstrates Van de Velde s theory of the integration of ornament and structure.

The ornament ona chair by Henry van de Velde (1863-1957) not only completes the struc- ture, the two become indistinguishable, the product of an artistic will striving for total symbolic expression [3]. In his book Formules de la Beaut Architectonique Moderne (Principles of Modern Architectonic Beauty) of 1917, Van de Velde described this fusion of subjective and objective, of ornament and structure, in the following terms: Ornament completes form, of which it is the extension, and we recognize the meaning and justification of ornament in its function. This function consists in structuring the form and not in adorning it . . . The relations between the structural and dynamographic ornament and the form or surfaces must be so intimate that the ornament will seem to have determined the form. In their desire to extend these principles beyond the isolated object, Art Nouveau designers became preoccupied with the design of whole interiors. In many rooms and ensembles individual pieces of furniture tended to lose their identity and become absorbed into a larger spatial and plastic unity [4].

An educational programme of cultural events was organized by the Section d Art of the POB s Maison du Peuple (for example, Emile Verhaeren s play Les Aubes received its first performance there in 1897). Influenced by William Morris, the Belgian Symbolist journal L drt Moderne, founded in 1885 by Octave Maus and Edmund Picard, increasingly advocated the application of art to daily life. In 1892, Willy Finch (1854-1936) and Henry van de Velde, members of the painters group Les XX, inaugurated a decorative art movement based on the English Arts and Crafts Society. A year later the salon of Les XX devoted two rooms to the decorative arts, which were thereby associated with the fine arts rather than the industrial arts. Les XX was superseded by Libre Esth tique in 1894. At the group s first salon, Van de Velde delivered a series of lectures which were published under the title D blaiement d'Art (The Purification of Art) and established him as the ideologue of the movement. In these lectures Van de Velde fol- lowed Morris in defining art as the expression of joy in work, but unlike Morris he recognized the necessity of machine production a contra- diction that he was never able to resolve. Influential as these lectures were in spreading the movement and providing it with a theoretical apparatus, two other figures were of greater importance in establishing its formal language. The first of these, the Li ge-based architect and furniture designer Gustave Ser- rurier-Bovy (1858-1910), had been the first to introduce the work of the Arts and Crafts movement into Belgium.

After receiving a Beaux-Arts architectural training, Horta spent over ten years working in a neoclassical style, slightly modified by Viollet-le-Duc s construc- tional rationalism.

In each, the plan was divided from front to back into three sections, the central section containing a top-lit staircase which became the visual and social hub of the house. In each, the piano nobile consisted of a suite of reception rooms and con- servatories with a spatial fluidity that was accentuated by extensive use of glass and mirror, somewhat recalling the theatre foyers built in Brus- sels in the 1880s by Alban Chambon (1847-1928). The houses were intended for social display.

An imaginary world half mineral, half vegetal is created, with an air of unreality enhanced by the timeless, subaqueous light filtering down from the roof. Horta s most important public building was the new Maison du Peuple in Brussels of 1896-9 (demolished 1965}. He received this com- mission through his domestic clients, whose social milieu and socialist ideals he shared. As in the houses, the Beaux-Arts symmetry of the plan is carefully undermined by asymmetrical programmatic elements. The facade, though it appears to be a smooth undulating skin follow- ing an irregular site boundary, is in fact a classical composition arranged round a shallow exhedra. Nonetheless, because of its continu- ous glazing (and in spite of its allusion to the heavily glazed Flemish Renaissance buildings to be found in Brussels) it must have had a shocking effect when it was built. If architecture was a passion for Horta, for Van de Velde (who was trained as a painter) it was more the logical culmination of the house- hold of the arts (the phrase is Rumohr s). Starting from 1896, he exhibited a number of interiors at the Libre Esth tique salon, influ- enced by Serrurier s rooms. In 1895 he built a house called Bloemenwerf for his family, in Uccle, a suburb of Brussels, in which he set out to create a domestic environment where daily life could be infused with art he even designed his wife s clothes. This house was a prototype for the villas built in the Utopian artists colonies that sprang up, mostly in the German-speaking countries, around 1goo.

His work was based on a craft tradition with its roots in French Rococo his father, a ceramicist, having rediscov- ered the ceramic moulds used by the Lorraine craftsmen of the eighteenth century. It was, however, highly innovative, deliberately playing on the neurasthenic and decadent aspects of the Symbolist tradition. The architecture of the Nancy School has a distinctly literary flavour. Two houses built in 1903, one by Emile Andr (1871-1933) and the other by Lucien Weissenburger (1860-1928) [7], are suggestive of castles in a medieval romance. The slightly earlier house for the ceram- icist Louis Marjorelle by Henri Sauvage (1873-1932), is less dependent on literary associations, more abstract and formal, with solid stone walls gradually dissolving into a light, transparent superstructure. \r",{"entities":[[11,40,"PER"],[176,181,"PER"],[226,234,"LOC"],[365,382,"ARCH"],[419,424,"LOC"],[688,695,"PER"],[786,791,"PER"],[878,888,"PER"],[1238,1250,"ARCH"],[1319,1329,"PER"],[1359,1379,"PER"],[1514,1527,"PER"]]}],["Dutch Art Nouveau and the work of H. P. Berlage The Dutch Art Nouveau movement was split between two opposed groups, the first inspired by the curvilinear Belgian movement,the second associated with the more rationalist circle of Petrus Josephus Hubertus Cuijpers (1827-1921) and the Amsterdam group Architectura et Amicitia. This group's members included H. P. Berlage (1856-1934), K. P. C. Bazel (1896-1923), W. Kromhaut (1864-1940), and J. L. M. Lauweriks (1864-1932), and their affinities lay more with Viollet-le-Duc and the Arts and Crafts movement than with Belgian and French Art Nouveau, of which they were critical. 4 After 1890, structural and rationalist tendencies became pro- nounced in the work of Hendrick Petrus Berlage. In both the Diamond Workers Building in Amsterdam (1899-1900) and the Amsterdam Stock Exchange (1897-1903), Berlage reduced his earlier eclecticism to an astylar neo-Romanesque in which basic volumes are articulated and structural materials exposed, with Art Nouveau orna- ment used sparingly to emphasize structural junctions. Compared to Horta s Maison du Peuple also a significant public building the Exchange, with its calm, expansive brick surfaces, reinforces rather than subverts the traditional fabric of the Amsterdam with its solid burgher-like values. In Berlage s private houses we find the same qualities. The plan of the Villa Henny in the Hague (1898), like many Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau houses, is organized round a central top-lit hall. But, unlike the evanescent metal structure surrounding the central hall of Horta s H6tel Van Eetvelde, Berlage s hall is defined by a brick arcade [8], with groin vaults in the spirit of Viollet-le-Duc. The furniture, with its structural rigour, anticipates that of De Stijl and the Constructivists. Modernisme in Barcelona The first signs of Modernisme as Art Nouveau was called in Catalan seem to pre-date the Belgian movement by several years and the Catalan movement appears to have been inspired independently by the publications of Viollet-le~Duc and the Arts and Crafts movement. Modernisme was more closely related to the nineteenth-century eclec- tic tradition than was the Art Nouveau of France and Belgium. In 1888 Lluis Dom nech 1 Montaner (1850-1923), the most important architect of early Modernisme, published an article entitled En busca de una arquitectura nacional ( In Search of a National Architecture ), which shows the movement s eclectic intentions: Let us apply openly the forms which recent experience and needs impose on us, enriching them and giving them expressive form through the inspiration of \r",{"entities":[[34,47,"PER"],[230,263,"PER"],[356,369,"PER"],[383,397,"PER"],[411,422,"PER"],[440,458,"PER"],[507,521,"PER"],[713,737,"PER"],[750,774,"ARCH"],[778,787,"LOC"],[808,832,"ARCH"],[846,853,"PER"],[1078,1083,"PER"],[1086,1102,"ARCH"],[1255,1264,"LOC"],[1304,1311,"PER"],[1361,1384,"ARCH"],[1392,1397,"LOC"],[1416,1454,"ARCH"],[1574,1579,"PER"],[1582,1600,"ARCH"],[1602,1616,"PER"],[1686,1701,"PER"],[1765,1773,"PER"],[1813,1822,"LOC"],[2037,2051,"PER"],[2225,2250,"PER"]]}],["8 Hendrick Petrus Berlage The ground floor of the top-lit stair hail, Villa Henny, 1898, theHague The solid, exposed: brick structure makes a striking contrast with the lightness and transparency of the equivalent stair hall in Horta s Hotel Van Eetvelde. nature and by the ornamental riches offered us by the buildings of every period. Barcelona had grown at an even faster rate than Brussels in the second half of the nineteenth century. The new industrial bourgeoisie of Catalonia men like Eusebio Giiell and the Marqu s de Comil- las saw Modernisme as an urban symbol of national progress, as did Art Nouveau's patrons in Belgium. But, while in Belgium the move- ment was associated with an anti-Catholic international socialism, in Catalonia its affiliations were Catholic, nationalist, and politically conservative. In the early works of the movement, Moorish (Mudejar ) motifs were used to suggest regional identity. This can be seen in the Casa Vicens (1878-85) by Antoni Gaudi i Cornet (1852-1926), and the Bodegas Giiell (1888) by Francesc Berenguer (1866-1914).

One of the strongest expressions of this ten- dency is found in the writings of the Viennese art historian Alois Riegl (1858-1905).! According to Riegl, the decorative arts were at the origin of all artistic expression. Art was rooted in indigenous culture, not derived from a universal natural law. This idea meshed closely with the ideas of John Ruskin and William Morris as well as with the aesthetic theories of Felix Bracquemond and Van de Velde, and it stood in stark contrast to the idea (derived from the Enlightenment) that archi- tecture should align itself with progress, science, and the Cartesian spirit. In the context of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the conflict between these diametrically opposed concepts was exacerbated by the political struggle between the metropolis, with its liberal and rational- ist programme, and ethnic minorities seeking to assert their own identity.

In Austria, the liberal, rationalist spirit was epitomized by the work of Otto Wagner (1841-1918), the most celebrated architect of the time. Wagner stood on the other side of the ideological divide from the urbanist Camillo Sitte (1843-1903), whose internationally influential book, Der Stddtebau nach seinen Kiinstlerischen Grundstatzen (City Building According to its Artistic Principles) of 1889, had promoted an urban model of irregular, closed spaces, based on the medieval city. For Wagner, on the contrary, the modern city should consist of a regular, open-ended street grid containing new building types such as apart- ment blocks and department stores. In his buildings, Wagner's rationalism reaches its peak in the Post Office Savings Bank in Vienna (1904-6). It is a rationalism, however, that does not abandon the alle- gorical language of classicism but extends it. In the bank we find allegorical figurative ornament: but there are also more abstract metaphors, such as the redundant bolt-heads on the facade (the thin marble cladding was in fact mortared to a brick wall). These, like the functional glass and metal banking hall, are both symbols and manifes- tations of modernity [10, 11]. In 1893 Wagner was appointed director of the School of Archi- tecture at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts where he came into close contact with the younger generation of designers. His two most bril- liant students were Joseph Maria Olbrich (1867-1908) and Josef Hoffmann (1870-1956). Wagner employed Olbrich as the chief drafts- man on his Stadtbahn (City Railway) project from 1894 to 18g8. Due to Olbrich s influence, decorative motifs derived from Jugendstil (as the German Art Nouveau movement was called) began to replace traditional ornament in Wagner s work, though without affecting its underlying rational structure as shown in the Majolica House apart- ment building in Vienna (1898). The early careers of Olbrich and Hoffman had almost identical trajectories. They both belonged to the Wiener Secession (Vienna Secession) a group that split from the academy in 1897 and both worked with equal facility in architecture and the decorative arts. Olbrich received the commission for the Secession s headquarters in Vienna, and in 1899 the Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig of Hesse appointed him as architect for the artists colony at Darmstadt. In 1903 Hoff- mann with designer Kolo Moser (1868-1918) founded the Wiener Werkstitte, a furniture workshop modelled on Charles R. Ashbee's Guild of Handicraft in London, and conceived as a cottage industry. The Secession marked the introduction of Jugendstil into Austria. But after working in the curvilinear style of high Art Nouveau for about three years, Olbrich and Hoffmann abandoned Van de Velde s dynamic integration of ornament with structure and reverted to a more \r",{"entities":[[3,14,"PER"],[17,41,"ARCH"],[51,57,"LOC"],[170,179,"LOC"],[181,188,"LOC"],[198,212,"LOC"],[216,223,"LOC"],[287,298,"PER"],[355,361,"PER"],[430,443,"PER"],[497,566,"ARCH"],[703,709,"PER"],[894,900,"PER"],[939,963,"ARCH"],[967,973,"LOC"],[1428,1434,"PER"],[1639,1659,"PER"],[1676,1690,"PER"],[1704,1710,"PER"],[1720,1727,"PER"],[1819,1826,"PER"],[1971,1977,"PER"],[2100,2106,"LOC"],[2136,2143,"PER"],[2148,2155,"PER"],[2374,2381,"PER"],[2442,2448,"LOC"],[2466,2489,"PER"],[2596,2606,"PER"],[2631,2648,"ARCH"],[2683,2702,"PER"],[2703,2722,"ARCH"],[2726,2732,"LOC"],[2828,2836,"LOC"],[2923,2930,"PER"],[2935,2943,"PER"],[2954,2966,"PER"]]}],["12 Joseph Maria Olbrich Adecorated casket, 1901 The neoclassical body of this casket, in the form of a truncated pyramid, is delicately incised and inlaid with stylized ornament.

Although it aspired to be a popular movement, its hand-crafted products were only affordable by a wealthy minority and it disintegrated with the decline of a certain set of bourgeois and nationalist fantasies, and with the inexorable rise of machine produc- tion and mass society. In the work of the Vienna Secession and in that of Riemerschmid and Paul in Germany, we witness the Art Nouveau movement, with its stress on individuality and originality, being trans- formed into repeatable forms based on vernacular and classical models. But the high Art Nouveau movement left a permanent, if sub- merged, legacy the concept of an uncoded, dynamic, and instinctual art, based on empathy with nature, for which it was possible to pre- scribe certain principles but not to lay down any unchanging and normative rules. This concept of an art without codes can be and often has been challenged, but its power of survival in the modern world can hardly be questioned. \r",{"entities":[[0,4,"PER"],[92,104,"PER"],[236,240,"PER"],[425,434,"LOC"],[446,458,"PER"],[605,617,"PER"],[622,632,"PER"],[710,716,"LOC"],[1271,1283,"PER"],[1288,1292,"PER"],[1296,1303,"LOC"]]}],["19 Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan The Auditorium Building, 1886-9, Chicago By combining Richardson's vertical hierarchy with Burnham and Root's elimination of the wall, Adler and Sullivan were able to achieve in this building some measure of balance between classical monumentality and the expression of modern structure. Organicism versus Classicism: Chicago 1890-1910 In a lecture entitled Modern Architecture , delivered in Schenectady on g March 1884, the New York journalist and architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler set out what he saw to be the problem facing American architecture. Schuyler presented his argument in the form of thesis and antithesis. He asserted the need for a universal culture of architecture such as existed in Europe but was lacking in America due to the absence of good models. The Beaux-Arts system, he said, might provide the basis for such a culture, one that would inculcate the qualities of sobriety, measure, and discretion , were it not for the fact that it failed to produce an architecture appropriate to modern life. Architecture, he says, is the most reactionary of the arts: Whereas in literature the classical rules are used, in architecture they are copied . . . in architecture alone does an archaeological study pass for a work of art .. . It is not the training that I am depreciating, but the resting in the training as not a preparation but an attainment. He went on to describe a confusion between language and architecture: A word is a conventional symbol, whereas a true architectural form is a direct expression of a mechanical fact. Schuyler praised American architects, particularly those of Chicago, for attempting to adapt architecture to such technical prob- lems as the elevator and the steel frame, unhampered by too many scruples about stylistic purity. Yet he felt that the problem had not been fully solved. The real structure of these towering buildings the Chicago construction is a structure of steel and baked clay, and when we look for the architectural expression of it, we look in vain. Such an articulated structure, being the ultimate expression of a struc- tural arrangement, cannot be foreseen, and the form .. . comes as a surprise to the author . Schuyler thus came out in favour of a direct and expressive modern architecture. Yet he never explicitly rejected the Beaux-Arts tradition. Does he think that sobriety, measure, and dis- cretion should be sacrificed on the altar of verisimilitude? That Europe should be rejected? We are not told, and, in spite of his preference for the second alternative, one has the impression that the first has not been completely abandoned.

This can be broken down into a series of further oppositions: collectivism versus individualism, identity (nation) versus difference (region); the normative versus the unique; representation versus expression, the recognizable versus the unexpected. These oppositions constantly reappeared in the architectural debates of the early twentieth century. But in America, more transpar- ently than in Europe, they tended to be connected with problems of high national policy. It is in Chicago that this tendency manifested itself most dramatically. The Chicago School After the fire of 1871 and the subsequent economic depression, Chicago experienced an extraordinary boom in commercial real estate. The architects who flocked to the city to profit from this situation brought with them a strong professional sense of mission. They saw their task as the creation of a new architectural culture, believing that architec- ture should express regional character and be based on modern techniques. The situation in Chicago seemed to offer the possibility of a new synthesis of technology and aesthetics and of the creation of an architecture that symbolized the energy of the Mid-west. The term Chicago School was first used in 1908 by Thomas Tallmadge to refer to the group of domestic architects, active between 1893 and 1917, to which both he and Frank Lloyd Wright (1867-1959) belonged. It was not until 1929 that it was also used for the commercial architects of the 1880s and 1890s by the architectural critic Henry Russell Hitchcock (1903~87) in his book Modern Architecture: Rom- anticism and Reintegration. Hitchcock associated both groups of architects with pre-modern Symbolists such as Victor Horta. In the 19408 he made a new distinction between a commercial and a domestic phase of the school. But in contemporary usage, a complete reversal has taken place and Chicago School now generally refers to the com- mercial architecture of the 1880s and 1890s, while the work of Frank Lloyd Wright and his colleagues is referred to as the Prairie School . This is the terminology that will be adopted here. The importance of the Chicago School was recognized during the 19208 and 19308, as the writings of Hitchcock, Fiske Kimball (American Architecture, 1928) and Lewis Mumford (The Brown Decades, 1931) testify. But it was given a quite new claim to modernity by the Swiss art historian Sigfried Gicdion (1888-1968) in Space, Time and Architecture (7941), where he presented the Chicago School in Hegelian terms as a stage in the progressive march of history.

Chicago architects were not rejecting tradition as such. But the tradi- tion they endorsed was vague, pliable, and adaptable to modern conditions. These conditions were both economic and technical. On the one hand, building plots were large and regular, unencumbered with hereditary freehold patterns. On the other, the recently invented electrical elevator and metal skeleton made it possible to build to unprecedented heights, multiplying the financial yield of a given plot. The last restrictions in height were removed when it became possible, due to developments in fireproofing techniques, to support the exter- nal walls, as well as the floors, on the steel frame, thus reducing the mass of the wall to that of a thin cladding.\" Ever since the mid-eighteenth century French rationalists such as the Jesuit monk and theoretician Abb Marc-Antoine Laugier had argued for the reduction of mass in buildings and for the expression of a skeleton structure.

But since this building had external walls of solid masonry, the Chicago problem of expressing the frame did not arise. from the writings of Viollet-le-Duc, the Chicago architects started from the assumption that window openings should be increased so that they spanned from column to column and provided maximum day- light. But they still felt the need to retain the hierarchies of the classical facade characteristic of the palaces of the Italian quattrocento. This resulted in a compromise in which the masonry cladding took one of two forms: classical pilasters carrying flat architraves, and piers with round arches the so-called Rundbogenstil which had originated in Germany in the second quarter of the nineteenth century and been brought to America by immigrant German architects. In the earliest solutions, groups of three storeys were superimposed on each other, as can be seen in the Rookery Building (1885-6) [20] by Daniel H. Burnham (1845-1912) and John Wellborn Root (1850-91) and in William Le Baron Jenney s Fair Store (1890). Henry Hobson Richardson (1838-86) in the Marshall Field Wholesale Store [21] with its external walls of solid masonry, overcame the stacking effect of these solutions by diminishing the width of the openings in successive tiers, and Dankmar Adler (1844-1900) and Louis Sullivan (1856-1924) adapted this idea to a steel-frame structure in their Auditorium Building (1886-9) [19, see page 34].

The Reliance Building, 1891-4, Chicago Designed by Charles Atwood, this building has always been seen as proto-Modernist in its lightness and lack of hierarchy. Without striving for the monumental, Atwood achieved a different kind of harmony through the use of materials it is faced entirely with terracotta tiles and the subtle handling of the simplest tectonic elements, such as the proportion of the windows and the dimensions of glazing mullions. Roche (1853-1927), in the Monadnock Building (1884-91, a severe masonry structure, completely without ornament) by Burnham and Root, and in the Reliance Building (1891-4) by Burnham and Co., the floors were not grouped in a hierarchy but expressed as a uniform series, the loss of vertical thrust being compensated for by projecting stacks of bay windows. In the Reliance Building the cladding was of terracotta rather than stone and achieved an effect of extraordinary lightness [22]. It was Louis Sullivan s achievement to have synthesized these two antithetical types. If the palace type, as represented by the Auditorium Building, can be said to have had a weakness, it was that it did not reflect the programme, since, in fact, every floor had exactly the same function. The type represented by the Tacoma Building suffered from the opposite fault: the similarity of functions was expressed, but the building, being a mere succession of floors, was lacking in monumental expression. In the Wainwright Building in St. Louis (1890-2) [23] Sullivan subsumed the floors under a giant order rising between a strongly emphasized base and attic. At the same time he ignored the column spacing of the real structure, reducing the spacing of the pilasters to the width of a single window. In doing this, he produced a phalanx of verticals that could be read simultaneously as columns and as mullions, as structure and as ornament, one of the effects of which was that the intercolumnation no longer aroused expectations of classical \r",{"entities":[[23,40,"ARCH"],[50,57,"LOC"],[70,84,"PER"],[496,514,"ARCH"],[614,631,"ARCH"],[963,977,"PER"],[1084,1103,"ARCH"],[1465,1484,"ARCH"],[1488,1497,"LOC"],[1512,1520,"PER"]]}],["23 Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan The Wainwright Building, 1890-2, St. Louis The problem that Sullivan solved so brilliantly in the elevations of this building was that of reconciling the monumental classical facade with the democratic repetition inherent in an office building. proportion. This system was independent of the exact number of floors, though it would certainly not have worked visually in a building of rad- ically different proportions from those of the Wainwright Building. In his essay entitled The Tall Office Building Artistically Con- sidered (1896), Sullivan claimed that the organization of the Wainwright type of building into three clearly stated layers, with their corresponding functions, was an application of organic principles. In order to judge the validity of this claim, it will be necessary briefly to consider Sullivan s architectural theory, as found in his two books, Kindergarten Chats and The Autobiography of an Idea. More than any of the other Chicago architects, Sullivan had been influenced by the New England philosophical school of Transcendentalism. This philosophy, whose chief spokesman had been Ralph Waldo Emerson, was largely derived from German Idealism, into which Sullivan had been initiated by his anarchist friend John H. Edelman. The organic idea can be traced back to the Romantic movement of around 1800 particularly to such writers as Schelling and the Schlegel brothers, who believed that the external form of the work of art should, as in plants and animals, be the product ofan inner force or essence, rather than being mechanically imposed from without, as they judged to be the case with classicism.* Those architectural theorists who, in their different ways, were heirs to this idea and to the concomitant notion of tectonic expres- sion such as Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Horatio Greenough, and Viollet-le-Duc had acknowledged that, when applied to human artefacts, the concept of a natural aesthetic had to be extended to include socially derived normative values. Sullivan ignored this cul- tural factor and based his argument purely on the analogy between architecture and nature. But in practice he tacitly accepted customary norms. The Wainwright facade was derived from the tradition he so vehemently condemned the classical -Baroque aesthetic enshrined in Beaux-Arts teaching. In correcting the Chicago architects mis- taken interpretation of this tradition, he was, in fact, returning to the classical principle they had discarded: the need for the facade to have a tripartite hierarchy corresponding to the functional distribution of the interior. The Wainwright Building can certainly be called a solution to the problem of the Chicago office fagade. But its very brilliance brought with it certain problems. The impure solutions of the Chicago School, including Sullivan s own Auditorium Building, had the merit of presenting to the street a complex, contrapuntal texture capable of being read as part of a continuous urban fabric. The Wainwright Building, with its vertical emphasis and strongly marked corner pilasters, isolated itself from its context and became a self-sufficient entity, emphasizing the individuality of the business it both housed and represented. In this, it anticipated later developments in \r",{"entities":[[3,16,"PER"],[21,35,"PER"],[40,59,"ARCH"],[73,78,"PER"],[96,104,"PER"],[519,539,"ARCH"],[574,582,"PER"],[847,855,"PER"],[1272,1288,"PER"],[2034,2042,"PER"],[2209,2226,"ARCH"],[2629,2648,"ARCH"],[2706,2728,"ARCH"],[2841,2849,"PER"],[2856,2875,"ARCH"],[3015,3034,"ARCH"]]}],["24 Louis Sullivan The High Building Question , 1891 In this drawing, Sullivan attempted another reconciliation, this time between the demands of real estate and those of urban aesthetics. Human scale and a sense of order were maintained by establishing a datum at about eight to ten storeys and allowing random development above it. skyscraper design. However, Sullivan showed that he was aware of the danger to urban unity that this kind of solution implied when, in 1891, in the journal The Graphic, he sketched a hypothetical street of varie- gated skyscrapers united by a common cornice line [24]. All Sullivan's buildings depend to a greater or lesser extent on orna- ment, and in his theoretical writings he refers to ornament as an extension of structure. In a body of delicate drawings he developed an ornamental system of arabesques analogous to that of Horta, though denser and less fluid and more independent of the structure. This ornamentation is applied in large bands of terracotta, and contrasted with flat, unornamented surfaces, suggesting the influence of Islamic architecture, and also relating his work to the European Art Nouveau movement. Sullivan was originally offered a partnership by Adler on the strength of his skill as an ornamentalist and designer of facades. Sullivan believed that the visible expression of a building spiritualized an otherwise inarticulate structure. Adler, on the other hand, thought that the facade merely gave the finishing touches to an organizational and structural concept. This difference of view, whether it shows Adler to have been the better organicist or merely more practical, seems to have given rise to a simmering conflict between the two men, and this is indirectly revealed in a statement made by Adler after the partner- ship had broken up (due to lack of commissions): The architect is not allowed to wait until, seized by an irresistible impulse from within, he gives the world the result of his studies and musings.

But already in the 1890s the climate of opinion in Chicago was changing. Architects no longer listened to the Transcendental message they had found so compelling a short time before, nor were they so interested in Sullivan's doctrine of the redemption of a materialistic society through inspired individual creativity. As was soon to be the case in Europe, individual- ism was giving way to a more nationalistic and collectivist spirit. The World s Columbian Exposition The turn towards classicism inaugurated by the Chicago World s Exposition of 1893 was related to a number of contemporary political and economic events in America. The most important of these were the change from /aissez faire to monopoly capitalism, the inaugura- tion of the open-door trade policy for a country now ready to take its place on the world stage, and the rise of a collectivist politics both mirroring and challenging the emerging corporatism of industry and finance. In The Autobiography of an Idea, Louis Sullivan was to recall these developments: During this period [the 1890s] there was well under way the formation of mergers, corporations, and trusts in the industrial world ... speculation became rampant, credit was leaving terra firma... monopoly was in the air According to Sullivan, Daniel Burnham was the only architect in Chicago to catch this movement, because, in its tendency towards bigness, organization, delegation, and intense commercialism, he sensed the reciprocal workings of his own mind . These developments were responsible for sounding the death knell of the philosophy of individualism that had inspired the Chicago School and been the basis of Sullivan's theory. Despite his own generalizing and typological propensities, Sullivan resisted the emerging tendency towards collectivism, standardization, and massification that Burnham welcomed so avidly. Although Chicago was chosen as the site for the World s Fair because it was seen to represent the dynamism of the Mid-west, the fair s promoters were more interested in the creation of a national mythology than a regional one. They were looking for a ready-formed architectural language that could allegorically represent the United States as a unified, culturally mature, imperial power. According to Henry Adams, Chicago was the first expression of America thought of as a unity: one must start from there. Planning for the World s Fair started in 1890, under the joint direc- tion of Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903) (landscape) and Daniel Burnham (buildings). The site chosen was that of Olmsted s unbuilt project for the South Park System.

The core of the fair was Jackson Park, where all the American pavilions were sited. Midway Pleasance contained the foreign pavilions and amuscments, while Washington Park was laid out as a landscape. Jackson Park was conceived on Beaux-Arts principles. The Beaux- Arts system had already made inroads on the East coast by the mid-188o0s. By ensuring that at least half the architects selected to design the pavilions came from the East the promoters signalled their support for classicism as the style of the fair s architecture.* This choice reversed the Chicago School s practice in two ways: it proposed first that groups of buildings should be subjected to total visual control, and second that architecture was a ready-made language rather than the product of indi- vidual invention in a world ruled by contingency and change.

The Conway Building, 1912, Chicago This was one of the many offices built in American cities after about 1910 that conformed to the new classical fashion of the City Beautiful movement. design, and was to be revived in the rg6o0s by Louis Kahn at the Salk Institute in La Jolla within a Modernist idiom (see pages 248-54). Until the Paris Exposition of 1889, international exhibitions in Europe had favoured the display of new technologies in their buildings, but the Paris Exposition of rg00 marked a change to something more decora- tive and popular. The Chicago World s Fair, though it lacked the Art Nouveau aspects of the Paris Exposition and maintained an unremit- ting pompier style, anticipated this approach, differing only in its display of uninhibited kitsch (according to the original plan, authentic gondoliers were to be hired to navigate the basin). The City Beautiful movement The World s Fair initiated a wave of classical architecture in America. As the historian Fiske Kimball was to write in 1928: The issue whether function should determine form or whether an ideal form might be imposed from without, had been decided for a generation by a sweep- ing victory for the formal idea. One of the consequences of the fair was that, after the turn of the century, tall commercial buildings in America began to show increased Beaux-Arts influence. This can be seen in the evolution of Burnham's work. In his Conway Building in Chicago (1912) [27], and in many other examples, he followed Sullivan s clear tripartite division, but ornamented it with a classical syntax, often treating the attic as a classical colonnade, reducing the size of the windows in the middle section of the facade and playing down the expression of structure. The World s Fair had a great effect on the City Beautiful move- ment. The movement was triggered by the Senate Park Commission plan for Washington (the Macmillan Plan ), which was exhibited in 1902. Both Burnham and Charles McKim (1847-1909) were on the commission, and they were responsible for the design, which envis- aged the completion and extension of Pierre Charles LEnfant s plan of the 1790s. After this Burnham was asked to prepare many city plans, only a few of which the plan for the centre of Cleveland, for example were executed. The most spectacular of these was his plan for Chicago, prepared in collaboration with E. H. Bennett (1874-1945) [28].* The plan was financed and managed by a group of private citi- zens, and was the subject of an elaborate public relations campaign. Its most characteristic feature was a network of wide, diagonal avenues superimposed on the existing road grid in the manner of Washington and of Haussmann s Paris. At the centre of this network, there was to be a new city hall of gigantic proportions. Though never executed, the plan was to some extent used as a guide for the future development of the city.

But in spite of this apparent conflict between two incompatible concepts of city planning, one aesthetic and symbolic and the other social and practical, many social reformers, including the sociologist Charles Zucblin, supported the City Beautiful movement, claiming that the World s Fair had instituted scientific planning , stimulated efficient municipal government, and curbed the power of the bosses. It is clear that enlightened collectivism , with its rejection of /aissez faire and its stress on normative standards, was able to carry both conserva- tive and progressive connotations. In Europe, where there was a simultancous burst of planning activity, a reconciliation between the aesthetic and the social was consciously attempted. At the London Town Planning conference of tg1o, the German planner Joseph Stiibben claimed that planners in his own country had been able to combine the rational French with the medieval British traditions. Whether justified or not, this claim was only plausible within the context of the traditional European city. In America, the conceptual and physical split between living and work, the suburb and the city, made such a reconciliation impossible. Social reform and the home The reaction of intellectuals against the excesses of uncontrolled capi- talism in 1880s America is represented by two Utopian texts: Henry George s Progress and Poverty (1880), which proposed the confiscation of all yield from increased land value, and Edward Bellamy s novel Looking Backward (1888), which described a future society based on a perfected industrial system, in which there was no longer any space between freedom and total political control (see pages 220-2: Systems theory ). A third text Thorstein Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class (1899) is of particular interest, not only because Veblen taught at the University of Chicago in the 1890s, but also because his book advanced the theory that there was a conflict in capitalism between the produc- tion of money and the production of goods. Chicago was the centre of a vigorous social reform movement which reflected this anti-/aissez-faire mood. Whereas the Transcen- dentalists had rejected the city as a corrupting influence, the Chicago reformists saw it as an essential instrument of industrialization, but one that needed to be domesticated. The Department of Social Sciences and Anthropology, which opened in 1892 in the University of Chicago under the leadership of Albion Small, became an important centre of urban sociology, its wide influence continuing into the 1920s. \r",{"entities":[[3,17,"PER"],[22,36,"PER"],[37,58,"ARCH"],[91,99,"PER"],[668,683,"PER"],[1061,1067,"LOC"],[1216,1236,"ARCH"],[1276,1291,"PER"],[1821,1833,"PER"],[1941,1955,"PER"],[2194,2210,"PER"],[2313,2334,"LOC"],[2498,2505,"LOC"],[2885,2906,"LOC"]]}],["The department and the institutions connected with it, such as the Department of Household Science at the University of Illinois, focused their attention on the nuclear family and the individual home in the belief that the reform of the domestic environment was the nec- essary first step in the reform of society as a whole. Thus, the design and equipment of the home became one of the key elements in a radical and wide-ranging social and political agenda.\"* The problem of the home was addressed at two levels. Hull House, founded by Jane Addams in 1897, and the numerous settlement houses that it helped to set up, worked at the grass-roots level, providing domestic education to immigrant workers living in slum conditions. One of the essential ingredients of this education was training in the crafts, which was organized by the Chicago Arts and Crafts Society, also based at Hull House. Classes and exhibitions in cabinet-making, bookmaking, weaving, and pottery were set up. Some small workshops were founded, but much of the furniture was made by commercial manufacturers, sometimes, but not always, under the supervision of outside designers. The work was promoted by mass-circulation maga- zines like the Ladies Home Journal and The House Beautiful and sold by mail order. Low income groups were targeted, and the furniture was mass produced. In design, it was somewhat heavier and simpler than contemporary Arts and Crafts furniture in England and Germany, tending towards the geometrical forms in the work of I loffmann and Mackintosh, but without their hand-crafted refinement. Ata more theoretical level, the problem of the modern home was analysed in the department of Social Sciences and the closely affiliated Home Economies group. Vhis nationwide movement had its epicentre in Chicago and one of its leading figures, Marion Talbot, taught at the Department of Social Sciences. The movement was strongly feminist and sought to revolutionize the position of women, both in the home and in society. According to the [Tome Economics group there was an imperative need to rethink the house in the wake of rapid urbanization and inventions such as the telephone, electric light, and new means of transport. The home should be organized according to Frederick Winslow Taylor s principle of scientific management. The more radical members of the group, like the Marxist Charlotte Perkins Gillman, argued against the nuclear house and advocated the social- ization of eating, cleaning, and entertainment in serviced apartment buildings, but generally the group accepted the nuclear house. In matters of design the Home Economics group followed William Morris in his belief that the house should contain nothing but useful and beautiful objects. But they also believed in mass production and the use of new, smooth materials, invoking the railroad-car buffet and the laboratory as models for the design of kitchens, and stressing the \r",{"entities":[[106,128,"LOC"],[514,524,"ARCH"],[537,548,"PER"],[882,893,"ARCH"],[1448,1455,"LOC"],[1460,1467,"LOC"],[1524,1532,"PER"],[1537,1547,"PER"],[1796,1803,"LOC"],[1836,1849,"PER"],[2262,2286,"PER"],[2381,2406,"PER"],[2654,2668,"PER"]]}],["importance of sunlight, ventilation, and cleanliness.

They called for standardization at all levels of design, attaching great importance at the urban level to the design of groups of identical houses order and repetition being thought to make a harmonious and egalitarian com- munity. * In this, their views were not unlike those of the City Beautiful movement, with its preference for classical anonymity in the planning of unified groups. Frank Lloyd Wright and the Prairie School The Prairie School was a closely knit group of young Chicago archi- tects continuing to design houses in the organicist tradition under the spiritual leadership of Louis Sullivan, and active between 1896 and 1917. The group included, among others, Robert C. Spencer, Dwight H. Perkins, and Myron Hunt. The group was closely associated with Hull House and the Arts and Crafts Society. Some of the original group later reverted to eclecticism notably Howard Van Doren Shaw (1869-1926), whose work resembles that of the English architect Edwin Lutyens in its simultaneous allegiance to the Arts and Crafts and to eclectic classicism.\"* The most brilliant member of the group was Frank Lloyd Wright. He, more than any of the others, was able to forge a personal style that embodied the group s common ambitions. Wright s natural talent was stimulated and guided by the theory of pure design , which was the subject of lectures and discussions at the Chicago branch of the Archi- tectural League of America around 1901.'* This concept was promoted by the architect and teacher Emil Lorch, who had transferred to architecture the geometrical principles of painting and design taught by Arthur Wesley Dow at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. According to this theory, there were fundamental ahistorical principles of composition, and these principles should be taught in schools of architecture.'? This idea was a commonplace of late-nineteenth- century and early-twentieth-century art and architectural theory in Europe in academic as well as avant-garde circles.'* Although it was antagonistic to eclecticism, its promotion of systematic design theory in architectural schools was probably due to the example of the Beaux-Arts. Wright's houses show the influence of this theory [29, 30]. Their plans are geometrically more rigorous than anything being built in Europe at the time.

The plans of Wright s houses consist of an additive system of simple volumes interlocking with or relating freely to each other in a way that resembles the Arts and Crafts tradition. However, not only is there greater continuity between one space and another than can be found in the English movement, in which the traditional room remains dominant, but the plans exhibit a geometrical order which stems from Beaux-Arts rather than English sources. At the macro scale, the plans tend to develop along the two orthogonal axes, crossing at a central hearth and reach- ing out into the surrounding landscape, while at the micro scale there are carefully controlled local symmetries and sub-axes, showing the influence of the Beaux-Arts-trained H. H. Richardson. Internally, as in the houses of Voysey, Mackintosh, and Hoffmann, the rooms are unified by low cornices at door-head level. But in Wright s work these have the effect of compressing the vertical dimension, producing a primitive, cave-like sensation [31]. The system of ornament consists of dark-stained wood trim, recall- ing that of Mackintosh and Hoffmann. Electric light and ventilation fittings are absorbed into the general ornamental unity. Art still dom- inates, but it is now produced by the machine, not by the craftsman, and is totally controlled by the architect working at his drawing-board [32]: The machine . . . has placed in artist hands the means of idealizing the true nature of wood . . . without waste, within reach of all. In fact, Wright came early on to the conclusion that mass produc- tion was necessary if good design was to be democratically enjoyed. In rgor he gave a lecture at Hull House entitled The Art and Craft of the Machine in which he argued that the alienation of the craftsman due to machine production would be outweighed by the artist s ability to create beauty with the machine an anti-Ruskinian argument that would soon be taken up within the Deutscher Werkbund in its support of machine work as opposed to handwork. This philosophy was com- pletely consistent with Wright s search for universal laws of design, with its privileging of the artist over the craftsman. Yet Wright s position on industrialization was ultimately ambiva- lent. It was poised between an endorsement of that greatest of machines , as he called the industrial city, and a nostalgic image of the American suburb as a new Arcadia uncontaminated by industrialism. This conflict was reflected in his daily life, divided between his radical friends at Hull House and the suburb of Oak Park where he practised and lived with his young family, and where his neighbours were the practical-minded businessmen who commissioned his houses. This enormously creative and influential phase of Wright s life came to an abrupt end when in 1909, at the age of 42, he abandoned Oak Park, \r",{"entities":[[3,21,"PER"],[22,40,"ARCH"],[48,71,"LOC"],[97,103,"PER"],[164,182,"PER"],[183,201,"ARCH"],[209,232,"LOC"],[234,269,"ARCH"],[306,312,"PER"],[691,697,"PER"],[1419,1436,"PER"],[1469,1475,"PER"],[1477,1487,"PER"],[1493,1501,"PER"],[1568,1574,"PER"],[1771,1781,"PER"],[1786,1795,"PER"],[2344,2354,"ARCH"],[3202,3212,"ARCH"],[3231,3239,"LOC"],[3434,3440,"PER"],[3515,3523,"LOC"]]}],["31 Frank Lloyd Wright Coonley House, 1908, Riverside, Illinois In his interiors, Wright uses all the main elements of the Arts and Crafts tradition but exaggerates the horizontality of the space and gives the fireplace a new symbolic status.

Montgomery Schuyler, in his anticipation of an American architec- ture, had been concerned with public and urban buildings, whether they took the form of cultural representation or organic expression. Frank Lloyd Wright, working within the tradition of the Arts and Crafts movement, turned away from such problems to concentrate mostly on the private house, the nuclear family, and the small commu- nity. Reviving dreams of the frontier, he sought, more passionately than any of his colleagues, to create a regional Mid-western domestic architecture of rural innocence. It was the formal skill with which Wright deployed an abstract and astylar architecture that impressed the European avant-garde archi- tects when his work was published in Germany by Wasmuth in 1910, at the moment when they were searching for a formula that would free them from traditional forms. But with this abstraction came an archi- tecture that was primitivist, regionalist, and anti-metropolitan. Through the influence of Frank Lloyd Wright, international Mod- ernism had at least one of its roots in the regional and democratic concerns of the American Mid-west and in the organicist theories of its architects. \r",{"entities":[[3,21,"PER"],[22,35,"ARCH"],[43,62,"LOC"],[81,87,"PER"],[260,273,"ARCH"],[356,374,"PER"],[379,390,"ARCH"],[401,424,"LOC"],[489,500,"ARCH"],[849,868,"PER"],[1050,1068,"PER"],[1454,1460,"PER"],[1591,1598,"LOC"],[1602,1609,"PER"],[1849,1867,"PER"]]}],["33 Peter Behrens AEG Turbine Factory, 1908-9, Berlin The literal use of steel structure in the interior is a complete contrast with the monumental expression of the exterior. Culture and Industry: Germany 1907-14 The international reform movement in architecture and the industrial arts was accompanied in Germany by special historical circumstances. In the German-speaking world, a self-image had begun to take shape in the second half of the eighteenth century in opposition to French cultural hegemony and Enlightenment universalism. The conscious- ness of a specifically German Ku/tur, as distinct from French-derived Zivilisation, was reinforced during the Napoleonic wars. The effect of this was to intensify the search for cultural identity, but at the same time to act as a powerful incentive to modernization. Romanticism and Rationalism coexisted, sometimes in mutual reinforcement, some- times in opposition. Modernization increased its pace after the unification of Germany s many states into the German Empire in 1871. But by the 1890s there was already widespread disappointment with its cultural results, and the beginning of an anti-liberal, anti-positivist backlash. This tendency mirrored similar tendencies in Europe as a whole, but in Germany it brought to the surface a latent ideology of the Volk According to the writer Julius Langbehn (1851-1907) modern civilization, especially that of America, was without roots. In his best- selling book Rembrandt als Erzieher (Rembrandt as Educator, Leipzig, 1903), he argued for a return to the rooted culture of the German Vo/f, the spirit of which he saw as embodied in the paintings of Rembrandt. The social philosopher Ferdinand T nnies (1856-1936), in his book Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft (roughly: Community and Society, Leipzig, 1887), drew attention to the ancient German forms of associa- tion, which were being replaced by modern industrial forms of association or companies . In fact, the movement for artistic reform in Germany was, from the start, deeply involved in the question of national identity. Those par- ticipating in the movement were caught between a desire to return to their pre-industrial roots and an equally strong impulse towards modernization as the necessary condition of competing commercially with the Western nations. \r",{"entities":[[3,16,"PER"],[21,36,"ARCH"],[46,52,"LOC"],[197,204,"LOC"],[306,313,"LOC"],[1255,1262,"LOC"],[1343,1358,"PER"],[1997,2004,"LOC"]]}],["The Deutscher Werkbund At the beginning of the twentieth century in Germany, the chief agent of artistic and cultural reform was the Deutscher Werkbund, which grew out of the German Arts and Crafts (Kunstgewerbe) movement. Many local reform groups had emerged since the onset of the Arts and Crafts movement in the late 1890s, including Alfred Lichtwark s Art Education Movement (1897), Ferdinand Avenarius s Diirerbund (1902), and the Bund Heimatschutz (1904).? In addition, a number of workshops modelled on the English guilds had been founded, the most successful of which were the Munich-based Vereinigten Werk- stitte (see page 62) and the Dresdner Werkstitte, both of which, unlike their English counterparts, were making semi-mass-produced furni- ture from their inception. The Deutscher Werkbund was founded in Munich in 1907 to con- solidate these separate initiatives and accelerate the integration of art and industry at a national level. The chief moving spirits behind its foundation were the Christian Socialist politician Friedrich Naumann (1860-1919), the director of the Dresdner Werkstiatte Karl Schmidt, and the architect-bureaucrat Hermann Muthesius (1861-1927). Initially 12 architects and 12 companies were invited to join. The archi- tects included Peter Behrens (1868-1940), Theodor Fischer (1862-1938), Josef Hoffmann, Joseph Maria Olbrich, Paul Schultze- Naumburg (1869-1949), and Fritz Schumacher (1869-1947). Most of the companies were manufacturers of domestic furniture and equip- ment, but two printers, a type founder, and a publisher were also included. All these firms withdrew from the existing conservative and commercially motivated Alliance for German Applied Arts to join the new organization and in so doing committed themselves to working with named architects. The Werkbund s orientation towards high-quality goods for mass consumption is clear from a speech given by Naumann in 1906: Many people do not have the money to hire artists, and, consequently, many products are going to be mass produced; for this great problem, the only solution is to infuse mass-production with meaning and spirit by artistic means. Speaking at the inaugural meeting of the Werkbund in Munich, Fritz Schumacher, professor of architecture at the Dresden Technische Hochschule and director of a highly successful Arts and Crafts exhibition in Dresden in 1906, stressed the need to bridge the gap between artists and producers that had developed with machine production: The time has come when Germany should cease to look on the artist as a man who .. . follows his inclination, and rather see him as one of the important powers for the ennobling of work and therefore for the ennobling of the entire \r",{"entities":[[68,75,"LOC"],[337,353,"PER"],[387,419,"PER"],[819,825,"LOC"],[1152,1169,"PER"],[1272,1285,"PER"],[1299,1314,"PER"],[1328,1342,"PER"],[1344,1364,"PER"],[1366,1389,"PER"],[1407,1423,"PER"],[2209,2215,"LOC"],[2217,2233,"PER"],[2514,2521,"LOC"]]}],["life of the nation, and to make it victorious in the competition among peoples ... there is in aesthetic power a higher economic value.* Despite this well-defined programme, the membership of the Werkbund represented a wide range of opinion. The organization's main areas of activity were: general propaganda (publishing, exhibi- tions, congresses); the education of the consumer (lectures, window dressing competitions, and so on); and the reform of product design (for example, persuading industrialists to employ artists}. Form or Gestalt The need to assimilate the machine to the artistic principles of the Arts and Crafts movement entailed a reconceptualization of the role of the artist. Morris s conception of the artist-craftsman as someone physi- cally involved with materials and functions gave way to that of the artist as form giver . The new concept was put forward at the Werkbund congress of 1908 by the sculptor Rudolf Bosselt, and reaffirmed by Muthesius in 1911. Both asserted that, in the design of machine prod- ucts, form or Gestalt should take precedence over function, material, and technique, which had been stressed by the Arts and Crafts and Jugendstil movements. Curiously enough, this idea did not originate in the context of the debate on art and industry, but in the field of aesthet- ics. It was the product of a century-long history of aesthetic thought, beginning with Immanuel Kant s isolation of art as an autonomous system, and culminating in the theory of pure visibility (Sicbrbarkeit) propounded by the philosopher of aesthetics Conrad Fiedler. Muthesius and the notion of type Closely connected with the idea of Gestalt was Muthesius s concept of Typisierung (typification) a word he coined to denote the establish- ment of standard or typical forms. His argument was the apparently trivial one that mass production entails standardization. But, relying on the ambiguity inherent in the word type , Muthesius conflated a pragmatic notion of standardization with the idea of the type as a Platonic universal. Only through typification, he said, can architecture recover that universal significance which was characteristic of it in times of harmonious culture . Muthesius s concept of a unified culture was an attack on /aissez- faire capitalism, though not on monopoly capitalism. For him, and for many within the Werkbund who shared his views, the degeneration of modern taste was due not, as Ruskin had thought, to the machine as such, but to the cultural disorder caused by the operation of the market, and the destabilizing effect of fashion. If the middle-man who manipulated the market could be eliminated it would be possible to \r",{"entities":[[694,700,"PER"],[928,942,"PER"],[962,971,"PER"],[1568,1583,"PER"],[1584,1593,"PER"],[1939,1948,"PER"]]}],["recover the direct relationship between producer and consumer and between technique and culture, that had existed in pre-capitalist soci- eties. Muthesius foresaw the emergence of large factories for the production of consumer goods similar to the trusts and cartels that were becoming increasingly characteristic of German heavy industry. These firms, producing goods of standardized artistic quality, would be able to dominate the market and act as the sole arbiters of taste, operat- ing as the modern equivalent of the medieval guilds. When Muthesius presented his notion of Typisierung at the Werkbund congress of rg14 at Cologne it was strongly criticized by a group of artists, architects, and critics which included Van de Velde, Bruno Taut (1880-1938) and Walter Gropius (1883-1969). Van de Velde, though a passionate disciple of William Morris, did not ques- tion the need for machine production, nor did he disagree with the notion of a unified culture. But he disagreed with the bureaucratic methods proposed by Muthesius. For him and his supporters, culture could not be created by the imposition of typical forms. High artistic quality depended on the freedom of the individual artist. Fixed types did indeed emerge in all artistic cultures, but they were the end-prod- ucts of an evolutionary process of artistic development, not its initial condition. Muthesius had simply reversed the order of cause and effect. This celebrated conflict has usually been interpreted as a battle between the avant-garde supporters of a new machine culture and the regressive supporters of an outdated handicraft tradition. The truth is more complex, and to understand the situation it is necessary to disen- tangle the confusion that reigned at the time as to the status of the artist in the modern industrial arts. The debate between Van de Velde and Muthesius cannot be seen merely as the conflict between handicraft and the machine (though it was this as well) since the ambiguous figure of the artist appears as chief protagonist on both sides. Both groups believed that, under con- ditions of machine production, division of labour had separated technique from art and that it was necessary to reintroduce the artist into the production process. They differed, however, in their interpreta- tion of role that the artist would now play. Insofar as he saw the artist as a specialist in pure form , divorced from the mechanics of craft (now the domain of the machine), Muthesius s position seems progressive , seeking to adapt the artist to the abstract processes of capitalism. But Van de Velde s concept of the evolutionary process of style formation was more compatible with the conditions of market capitalism, and in that sense more modern than Muthesius s bureaucratic model. To what extent Van de Velde, with his strongly held socialist views, grasped the connection between the artistic freedom he was proposing and the mar- ketplace is an intriguing question, but the connection is clearly reflected in the writings of his patron and supporter, Karl Ernst Osthaus. \r",{"entities":[[145,154,"PER"],[545,554,"PER"],[724,736,"PER"],[738,748,"PER"],[765,779,"PER"],[793,805,"PER"],[839,853,"PER"],[1024,1034,"PER"],[1368,1377,"PER"],[2470,2479,"PER"],[2751,2760,"PER"],[2798,2810,"PER"],[3055,3073,"PER"]]}],["Originally Muthesius had also held to this concept of the individu- alistic artist. For example, he had been in favour of the law of 1907 which gave the applied artist the copyright protection that was already enjoyed by the fine artist.! But some time between 1907 and 1910 he seems to have moved towards the idea that the artist should not seek originality, but should be the conduit for universal aesthetic laws, a view that was in line with the prevalent neo-Kantian aesthetic philosophy. Muthesius now argued that there was a kinship between the law-like stability and anonymity of the classical and vernacular traditions on the one hand, and the repetitiveness, regularity, and simplicity of machined forms on the other. Machined forms were the modern, historical instance of a universal law. Though this idea did not exclude the artist, it did demand that the personality of the artist should be controlled.\" Muthesius sought to implement these ideas by creating an organi- zational framework within which future artists would have to work, thus reverting to archaic processes similar to those that Karl Friedrich Schinkel had adopted when commissioned to normalize the rural architecture of Prussia a century earlier. In Muthesius, therefore, we see the fusion of two ideologies, the one bureaucratic and nationalistic, the other classicizing and normative. Though it is difficult to say at what level these ideologies are, in fact, connected, they appear to have been inseparable within the context of architectural discourse in the years leading up to the First World War in Germany. It was a combina- tion that took a particularly explosive form in Germany, but it was also present, in differing regional forms, in America, England, and France. Style and ideology Another aspect of the battle between Muthesius s concept of type and the spontaneity demanded by Van de Velde must now be addressed. The standardization required by machine production was seen to rec- oncile modernity with classical humanism. But the demand for the freedom of the artist was also associated with a Nietzschian, Dionysian, anarchistic urge not to try to tame the disorder of modernity but to plunge into its terrifying and nihilistic stream. These different attitudes correspond to two groups of architects. Among the classicizing group, two will be discussed here Heinrich Tessenow (1876-1950) and Peter Behrens and their work will be compared to that of the young Walter Gropius, who was poised between the two groups. Discussion of the opposite camp, the Expressionists, belongs to a later chapter. Heinrich Tessenow One of Heinrich Tessenow s major concerns was mass housing and the problem of repetition.

Behrens, Riemerschmid, Muthesius, as well as Tessenow, designed groups of houses for Karl Schmidt s workers settlement of Hellerau, just outside Dresden. These architects were influenced by the medieval models advocated by Camillo Sitte (see page 28) and continued by the Garden City movement. But this influ- ence was modified by that of Paul Mebes, whose popular book Um z800, which appeared in 1905, advocated a return to the classical Biedermeier tradition of the early nineteenth century as the last instance of a unified German culture. As we have seen, a similar shift towards the classical occurred in the furniture designed by the Vere- inigten Werkstitte (see page 58). This tendency was not restricted to Germany. For example, in the last years of the Arts and Crafts move- ment in England, there was a similar return to what might be called the classical vernacular of the eighteenth century (commonly known as Georgian ), which was seen to represent form and proportion as opposed to detail (though, characteristically, this development was not theorized to the extent that it was in Germany). Tessenow s housing projects were supported by a social theory that romanticized the petite bourgeoisie as the foundation of traditional German social order, and his fastidious drawings conjure up a lost world of neat Biedermeier innocence. He visualized small towns of between 20,000 and 60,000 inhabitants, with a handicraft industry accommodating a maximum of ten artisans per workshop.

Externally, the building itself was neo- classical, though in the final design the residential wings were given a more vernacular, Heimat-like appearance, with steep roofs which sit rather incongruously with the Greek portico of the central building. Another aspect of Tessenow s work becomes apparent in the Hellerau school: a quality of abstraction and formal purity that anticipates the work of Mies van der Rohe and corresponds to the Greek spirit of Appia s stage-sets and Dalcroze s choreography. Peter Behrens Behrens began as a painter associated with the Munich Secession of 1893. He was a founding member of the Darmstadt artists colony where in 1901 he built the only house not designed by Olbrich (see page 30). His approach to art and architecture was deeply tinged with the Symbolism that characterized the German secessionist move- ments. His mystical leanings had already shown themselves when he collaborated in organizing a highly ritualistic inaugural ceremony at the Darmstadt colony with Georg Fuchs, one of the leaders of theatri- cal reform in Germany. One of the crucial turning points in Behrens s architectural career came during his directorship of the School of Arts and Crafts at Diisseldorf between 1903 and 1907, where he was influ- enced by the Dutch architect J. L. M. Lauweriks and became interested in the mystical-symbolic implications of geometry.

These included a crematorium at Hagen (1905) and the Allgemeine Elektricitits-Gesellschaft (AEG) Pavilion for the Shipbuilding Exposition in Berlin (1908) [37], as well as a series of neoclassical villas such as the Cuno House at Hagen- Eppenhausen (1908-9) and the Wiegand House in Berlin (1911). But the climax of this classical phase of Behrens s career was his design for the huge AEG Turbine Factory in Berlin (1908-9). Behrens was appointed design consultant for the electrical giant in 1907 and was responsible for all AEG s design work, including logos, consumer products, and buildings a perfect example of Muthesius s ideal of col- laboration between the artist and big industry [38].

Certainly, another Symbolism than that of the fleeting and ephemeral is at work in the Turbine Factory.

The corner site makes possible a diagonal approach allowing the observer to view front and side elevations simultaneously, as in the case of the Parthenon. The metaphor is elaborated with great plastic skill. Behrens establishes two simultaneous systems, an outer columnar one, and an inner one of surface. An order of steel stanchions, resting on giant hinges [40], takes the place of the temple colonnade, in a direct metonymic displacement. The continuous side glazing, made opaque by a close pattern of glazing bars [33 (see page 56)], is inclined to the same slope as the inner face of the stanchions, giving a rather Egyptian effect. This is continued in the corner buttresses, their mass further emphasized by deep horizontal striations [41].

In an address entitled Kunst und Industriecbau given at the Volkwang Museum at Hagen in igi, Gropius tried to suggest a socially acceptable solution to this problem: Work must be established in palaces that give the workman, now a slave to industrial labour, not only light, air, and hygiene, but also an indication of the great common idea that drives everything. Only then can the individual submit to the impersonal without losing the joy of working together for that common good previously unattainable by a single individual. In exchange for being alienated from the end product of their work, workers, as consumers, are offered a transcendental collective experi- ence. This idea, which had been aired a few years earlier by Frank Lloyd Wright (see page 53) was to be given a philosophically more sophisticated formulation by the architect and critic Adolf Behne in the 1920s. ? But through the mists of a rather confused rhetoric one glimpses the troubled social Utopianism that was to throw Gropius into the camp of the anti-technological Expressionists at the end of the First World War. For the moment, however, Gropius did not doubt that the machine could be spiritualized by means of art, and advocated an architecture of technical rationalism, even presenting to Emil Rathenau, director of AEG, a memorandum on the rationalization of the housing industry. * Why, then, was Gropius the most implacable of all Muthesi critics at the Cologne congress? The answer must lic in the ambiguous nature of the concept of totalization to which both he and Muthesius subscribed. Both believed that the artist (or the architect-as-artist) was now an intellectual charged with the task of inventing the forms of the machine age, considered as a cultural totality. But for Gropius it was precisely this totalizing, legislative, quasi-ethical role that demanded that the artist should remain free of political interference.

In Gropius s architecture, however, there is something new, and we can get some idea of it if we compare his Fagus Factory (1911-12) [42, 43] at Alfeld an der Leine, built in collaboration with Adolf Meyer (1881-1929), with Behrens s Turbine Factory. Much of the difference between the two buildings can be attributed to their radically different programmes. Gropius and Meyer's small, provincial shoe-last factory or rather its administrative wing, which was the only part of the factory complex over which the architects had full control could hardly be said to invoke the world-historical themes of Behrens s factory, built in the nation s capital for one of Germany s most impor- tant cartels. Yet it was precisely the Fagus Factory s modesty and lack of symbolic charge that enabled Gropius to follow his more down-to- earth agenda and to produce a work which would come to be seen as prophetic of the objective (Sachlich) Modern Movement of the 1920s. Not that the building lacks optical tricks. But it no longer makes any of Behrens s grandiose symbolic claims. Gropius starts with Behrens s projecting bay window and recessed, tilted masonry as his main motifs, but transforms them. The tilt is now, it seems, a prag- matic (though probably expensive) solution, by means of which the brick piers can appear to be recessed without the glazing unit having to be cantilevered out at its sill. Whereas Behrens rhetoricizes his repeat- ing columns, giving them maximum corporeality to create the effect of classical monumentality, Gropius tries to make his necessarily massive brick piers disappear, so that the main fagade of his building looks as if it is made entirely of glass. Whereas Behrens strengthens his corners with illusionistic buttresses, Gropius voids his with real transparency. Whereas Behrens impressionistically rounds his corners, Gropius sharpens his with the precision of a surgeon s knife-cut. Finally, whereas the Turbine Factory abounds in overt classical references, the classicism of the Fagus Factory is discreet and abstract a matter of geometry. But though the Fagus Factory can thus be read off against the Turbine Factory, it is not simply a mannerist inversion; it has its own agenda. Its illusionism, though still owing something to Behrens, is a matter of bringing out the transcendent qualities of materials partic- ularly glass with its mystical connotations (see the discussion of glass symbolism on page 92) rather than working against the nature of materials as Behrens often did. In this Gropius was truer to the func- tional tradition of Jugendstil, even though he jettisoned most (if not all) of its craftsman-like individualism. In the Fagus factory, material- ity and form are synthesized in a new way a way that seems to show the influence of the American factories that Gropius had illustrated \r",{"entities":[[30,37,"PER"],[157,164,"PER"],[263,276,"ARCH"],[348,359,"PER"],[378,385,"PER"],[388,404,"ARCH"],[513,520,"PER"],[525,530,"PER"],[756,763,"PER"],[942,949,"PER"],[1223,1230,"PER"],[1560,1567,"PER"],[1688,1695,"PER"],[1847,1854,"PER"],[1960,1967,"PER"],[2008,2015,"PER"],[2172,2185,"ARCH"],[2248,2261,"ARCH"],[2295,2310,"ARCH"],[2659,2666,"PER"],[2686,2693,"PER"],[2837,2850,"ARCH"],[2974,2981,"PER"]]}],["42 Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer Fagus Factory, 1911-12, Alfeld an der Leine South-east facade, administration wing.
