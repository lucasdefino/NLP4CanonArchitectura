Strange as it may seem to ask this question today, after more than a century of answers by the movement's protagonists, apologists, and historians, the need to rethink this body of work is no less pressing in our time than it was in the past. No doubt there exists some consensus about which projects were especially important and influential; this volume presents 50 that will, we trust, seem sensible choices to most readers, more or less. But the basis for that consensus, the reasons why some, and not other projects, have been judged to be especially, if variously, modern are not self-evident. The date of construction or of conception is not enough, for not everything that was built or designed in the twentieth century expressed the modernity of the time. Nor were the buildings that were said to be modern consistently so, for formal elements and kinds of artic- ulation that appeared to observers as novel often concealed techniques of construc- tion that had been used for centuries. One should not say that adherence to pre- modern ways of building occurred by accident, or that it was a result of a desire to deceive on the part of designers or critics; some measure of continuity is inescap- able in the sorts of historical change that affect the material and spatial domains o: culture: cities, gardens, buildings, or rooms. Techniques, for example, accumulate in the history of building construction, new methods cooperate with old. Factory- made elements manufactured with the newest (today, digital) methods are stil assembled on structural foundations built into sites according to long-standing methods. Likewise, modern arrangements of inhabitable settings, in houses or libraries, for example, do not erase; they transform, alter, or modify earlier pat- terns. The history of cities shows something similar, for their cultural and historica. richness gives them the capacity to absorb even the most unprecedented o insertions and be better for it. All of this is to say that even the most strident proposals are never closed in on themselves. Modern architecture was not spoken into the void, even if Adolf Loos, who published essays under this title, said things and invented configurations that had not been said or seen before. Only by accepting the idea that modern projects adhered to inherited conditions as much as they rejected them can we understand why Loos admitted, I am a modern architect because I build in the manner of the ancient Viennese. \r",{"entities":[]}],["While many modernists would have rejected Loos statement, even a little his- torical study shows that no surpassing is ever complete, or desired. Advances always depend on conversations with predecessors. Rarely are they viva voce, of course; they are instead asymmetrical, because the past, having passed, cannot answer back. Yet silence does not prevent significance. For architects with non- dogmatic minds it seems to have invited unending inquiry. Who, among the mod- erns we still study, did not say both yes and no to work from the past? Because not one of the conversations between modernists and their predecessors was limited by or concluded in the twentieth century not Tadao Ando s with Louis I. Kahn, Kahn s with Le Corbusier, or Le Corbusier s with the ancient Greeks and Romans we should not be surprised that still today we find it hard to sum up what modern architecture was or is all about. Modernity, and by implication modern architecture, has been famously described as an incomplete project. * Rightly celebrated and often cited, this only reverses the direction of the observation we have just made: twentieth century modernism reaches forward into our present just as it extended itself backward into its past. Nor was there only one new architecture: first there was the modernism of the pioneers ; after this came the translations of formerly new vocabularies into local dialects; next followed the modernism of those who built in different regions throughout the world; and then still another modern tradition emerged as a result of the critical assessments that called for a renewal of early impulses. The history of modern architecture is less a line of development than a field of sequential begin- nings and returnings, including false starts, real initiatives, and renewals, each ela- borating new possibilities that appeared thanks to changed conditions. There is, as a result, a history of the histories of modern architecture. Through- out much of the twentieth century, reports on the new architecture insisted on the novelty and progressive character of its exemplary projects. The Latin stem modo can be translated as just now. For the early historians of the movement an acute sense of the unprecedented character of conditions just now meant stopping the clock of earlier ages and starting another one for the new time. According to this premise, historical change is not transitional but successive, distinct ages precede and follow one another; the Gothic, mannerist and baroque periods occurred in blocks or chunks of time, hewn out of the landscape of the past by historical science in order to be viewed independently, as separate and sequential architectural approaches. Two histories of the 1920s that were particularly emphatic about the epoch- making advances of modern works were Adolf Behne s The Modern Functional Building (1923) and Walter-Curt Behrendt s The Victory of the New Building Style (1927). To some degree these books were both histories of the movement and pro- posals for it, simultaneously retrospective, as Behrendt announced that a victory had been won; and prospective, because his history set forth an agenda. No less progressive were Henry-Russell Hitchcock s Modern Architecture: Romanticism and \r",{"entities":[[714,718,"PER"],[726,738,"PER"],[743,755,"PER"],[2836,2841,"PER"],[2886,2906,"PER"]]}],["Reintegration (1929) and Alberto Sartoris Gli elementi dell architettura (Elements of Functionalism, 1932), even if they had sharply different interpretations of what was essential about the movement. Two other texts, both published in 1936, like- wise accented the unprecedented character of avant-garde architecture: Nikolaus Pevsner s Pioneers of the Modern Movement from William Morris to Walter Gropius and George Nelson s Building a New Europe: Portraits of Modern Architects. But per- haps the most influential and widely read account of this epochal type was Sigfried Giedion s Space, Time and Architecture: The Growth of a New Tradition (1941). In the postwar decades, however, as the work of the modernists was coming under the tough criticism of a younger generation of modernists, the progress of the movement was reassessed. To some degree Giedion s use of the term new tradition suggested or anticipated this turn, by placing the modern period among traditions that had come before. Without disavowing the linearity of devel- opments, later historians offered what might be termed regional accounts, in both the geographic and disciplinary senses of the term: the world-wide locations of the new architecture were described and interpreted and the themes or topics of modern innovations came under closer review the expressive, technological, political, or environmental characteristics of the new ways of building. Historical works in this second group included Bruno Zevi s Storia dell architettura moderna (1950), Reyner Banham s Theory and Design in the First Machine Age (1960), Leo- nardo Benevolo s History of Modern Architecture (1960), Kenneth Frampton s Modern Architecture: A Critical History (1980), Manfredo Tafuri s The Sphere and the Labyrinth: Avant-Gardes from Piranesi to the 1970s (1980), and William Curtis Modern Architecture since 1900 (1982). Two more recent histories show the full complexity of the inheritance: Alan Colquhoun s Modern Architecture (2002) reaffirms the pro- gressive character of modern architecture s several movements in their nuanced variation, and Jean-Louis Cohen s The Future of Architecture since 1889 (2012) shows the amplitude and richness of its geographical and cultural diffusion. Additionally, in recent decades much historiographic work has focused on single figures, limited time frames, and under-studied territories. The result is an abun- dance of material that complicates the story of modernism. Partly because of this richness, few today are willing to accept epic narratives of the whole period. Addi- tionally, there is considerable doubt about the value and methodological assump- tions of such accounts. The ambition seems to have run its course. But the difficulty of the task and hesitations about method cannot free us from the basic task of all history writing: to tell a story, about architecture and for it; and also about the worlds it builds. For such a story to be told, selections must be made for wholly inclusive tabulations of events still want an explanation meaning that choices must be made. These must be guided by the double requirement for utmost plausibility (approximating objectivity) and intelligibility. For this second requirement to be fulfilled, imagination is required, for historical traces are always incomplete, terms are often used with ill-defined meanings, and the protagonists generally remain silent on their primary motivations. The historian s imagination, of course, limits \r",{"entities":[[25,41,"PER"],[319,335,"PER"],[375,389,"PER"],[393,407,"PER"],[412,425,"PER"],[567,583,"PER"],[853,860,"PER"],[1477,1487,"PER"],[1538,1544,"PER"],[1598,1617,"PER"],[1659,1675,"PER"],[1726,1741,"PER"],[1826,1840,"PER"],[1951,1965,"PER"],[2108,2124,"PER"]]}],["the account s objectivity. One nevertheless attempts to reconstruct a sequence that rectifies all available data, seeking a rendition that is inferior to none other in like- lihood. An intelligible narrative also requires judgments about importance that in turn invoke the historian s sense of what indeed is architectural. None of this can be avoided if the desire for both explanation and understanding is acknowledged. It is not only the breadth and systematic unity of the report that is important, but also the depth and singularity of the understanding the story creates. Accordingly, the historian s task today is to describe avenues of design practice hat were opened, pursued, and then abandoned, ways of working and of thinking hat initially built upon earlier achievements but later diverged, found their footing in the particularity of a given historical moment, but then sought to recall topics that have always defined the discipline. Concern for classical, primitive, and vernacular traditions, for example, went hand in hand with the celebration of contemporary possibilities. To see the historical depth of progressive propositions, we need to look beyond the claims of unprecedented novelty by the protagonists or their apologists. Consider this example from Le Corbusier: T wish it were possible for the reader, by an effort of imagination, to conceive of what such a vertical city [the Voisin City] would be like; imagine all this junk, which till now has lain spread out over the soil like a dry crust, cleaned off and carted away and replaced by immense clear crystals of glass... Despite what seems a rather thoroughgoing erasure, the clearing recommended in this transformation allowed the city s axes to stay where they were, along with what Le Corbusier called the great creations of the past: Invalides, Tuileries, Place de la Concorde, Camp de Mars, and the Etoile. One does not have to accept his preference for monuments over fabric to see his desire to assimilate the new into the old. A clear rendering of this assimilation emerges when we take a close reading of the full spectrum of architectural tasks: the work of intervening in a given site, of interpreting a program of uses, of selecting materials (many of which were familiar but used in unfamiliar ways), and of detailing construction. What might be called the different times of architectural work the prehistory, current expectations, and future possibilities of the site, program, materials, and labor practices were folded in on themselves, as if the past had been nothing more than a recent present and the future a present yet to come. It is precisely this interlapsing that is the subject matter of histories that seek to catch the growth and continuity of the modern tradition at its source: the actual practices of design and construction, which is to say project making. The basic premise of this book s structure is that a particularly good way of understanding the history of modern architecture (including the modern architec- ture of our time) is by looking again at the tradition s key projects. We would like this term to describe works that were not only built and persist to our time, even if altered, but also those we can no longer see because they were destroyed or intended to be temporary, or even only drawn or modeled. A history of projects can address and explain the themes that persist through a work s several stages and t t \r",{"entities":[[1277,1289,"PER"],[1767,1779,"PER"],[1820,1829,"ARCH"],[1831,1840,"ARCH"],[1842,1862,"ARCH"],[1864,1876,"ARCH"]]}],["alterations, as well as the concrete and limited conditions that allowed and expressed those changes. Given the weight of our historiographic tradition and of our naturalized sense of distinct ages succeeding one another in time, coming to grips with the interlapsing just mentioned means looking again at buildings and designs we thought we knew perfectly well. Each of the 50 chapters of this volume is an exercise in that task. When a built project is not the topic of study it is the idea of one, as represented in drawings or models. In some cases works that were built decades ago remain standing today. Other significant projects were destroyed or modified beyond recognition. Still others were meant to be temporary. Another set of projects that have been impor- tant in this history were never built at all. Regardless of the current state of a partic- ular work, its projective dimensions are the essential subject matter of the 50 chapters that follow. Although different interpretative instruments and proce- dures are required for the different embodiments of a project (built, altered, tempo- rary, or unbuilt), there seems to be no good reason to rank one kind of materialization over another. As shown in the chapters that follow, architectural pro- jects have the capacity to absorb and integrate ideas, material facts, cultural norms, and possibilities, as well as questions internal to the discipline of architecture. Because it refuses any categorical separation of fact and idea, of any discrete condi- tion and recurring theme, there is perhaps no better medium of architectural history than the project. A new story of the modern tradition unfolds as a result of this focus, even though the characters who play leading roles have names we have heard before. The projects presented in the book have been grouped into six chronologically structured sections, the subtitles of which introduce the term world. Our basic premise is that the modern architectural project is an instrument of world building. The book s sections show, however, that different understandings of the architec- tural project corresponded to different senses of the worlds that would result. We distinguish the ways projects were alternately anticipatory, imaginative, construc- tive, recursive, interrogative, and engaging. The story that results is thus an account of the modern period as well as an elaboration of the different aspects or dimensions of project making in these years. The ways of doing architecture and of world building that emerge in this story are modern architecture s gift to the present, representing at once an inheritance and a set of tasks. Notes 1.

All the buildings studied in the chapters of this section were designed by architects who were born at the end of the nineteenth century and practiced at the beginning of the twentieth century. They were part of a generation that witnessed unparalleled modernization first hand, an experience that deeply influenced the way they thought architecture had to engage the world. While the concept of the modern had been long in the making from the seventeenth century quarrel against the supremacy of the ancients to the Enlightenment ideas of critical reason industri- alization brought about an unprecedented world, so radically transformed that its inhabitants struggled to recognize it. Modern life was catapulted into existence through urban developments that took place at a record pace, changing the world more rapidly and dramatically than ever before. The industrial city witnessed an extreme urbanization, no longer composed of familiar expressions of communal intimacy, torn by political turmoil, and increasingly questioning established traditions and patterns of behavior. Modernization was inti- mately linked to the modern city, where the industrial environment with its factories, credit networks, new institutional systems, and communication and information tech- nologies drew an unmatched number of workers to urban areas. The flow of migra- tion into cities between 1800 and 1900 was dramatic and drastically changed urban- rural relationships. In Europe, London s population increased from 1.2 to 4.5 million, and Berlin s from 172,000 to 1.9 million. Cities in the United States surpassed these statistics, with New York growing from 60,000 to 3.5 million and Chicago developing from a settler s village around 1800 to a metropolis with 1.7 million inhabitants. This rapid growth in population did not match the construction efforts, resulting in den- sities that in many cities reached its all-time high by the end of the nineteenth century. Observing an environment that sharply contrasted with the previously known world, Friedrich Engels wrote: [the modern city is an] urban mess ... and the result of a gigantic accident. The poor working, living, and urban conditions of cities, were for Engels conditioned by modern industrial capitalism, giving The Companions to the History of Architecture, Volume IV, Twentieth-Century Architecture.

This notion of the city was passed on throughout the nineteenth century, and found one of the most outspoken opponents of the metropolis in Friedrich Nietzsche, who encouraged his Zarathustra to spit on the great city. * Driven by economic demands and new urban forms of living, mobility, and work required anew understanding of this recently transformed metropolitan space. The conver- gence of the desire to order the urban ground, the increasing rationalization of the city and of life, and the subsequent aesthetization of modern rational forms and life, marked the birthplace of an era in its anticipation of a new world. An industrial metropolis was born that was contingent on imperial models and colonial influ- ences a new kind of international scene with a more cosmopolitan understanding motivated by far-reaching communication and news outlets, and disciplines such as sociology and city planning determined to understand the urban world by relying heavily on new methods of information mining, such as statistics. These changes in the urban topography had a fundamental impact on architecture. In cities affected by the Industrial Revolution and with it the implementation of new policies the erosion of traditional urban and architectural forms and norms not only transformed existing typologies, such as prisons and schools, but introduced a multitude of new programs. Urbanization, economic development, and expansion simultaneously provoked and demanded a new make-up of the city. The exceptional rise of the railroad for example which in the United States largely conditioned monopolistic capitalism and the exploitation of the frontier not only shifted regional time and space ratios by bringing territories closer together but also demanded new building types in the form of the urban and suburban train station. Similarly, new manufacturing techniques and procedures required more and differently equipped factories, while new product lines and an ever-enlarging consumer culture carved new spaces of commerce into the city. The expansion of the latter proceeded during the nineteenth century from single stores along sidewalks to a collection of stores under colonnades, and the excavation of the urban block through arcades, only to culminate toward the end of the century in the house of goods the department store from the rue de Colonnes (1793) via the passage Delorme (1808) to Bon March (1887). At a national and, increasingly, international scale, new communica- tion networks enabled global trade and facilitated unprecedented organizational and bureaucratic structures. Different companies would congregate in buildings equipped with the newest technologies and devoted entirely to office space. It is, therefore, no coincidence that Louis H. Sullivan s famous famously mis- understood and notoriously overused dictum form ever follows function appears in his essay The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered. * As Joanna Merwood-Salisbury shows in her chapter, the Carson Pirie Scott building by Sullivan quickly became a symbol of the rational and universal expression of social progress achieved through technology, which Sullivan himself complicates through his selective use of ornamentation. The buildings of the Chicago School grew ever larger and taller by the end of the nineteenth century, effectively \r",{"entities":[[227,246,"PER"],[2435,2450,"LOC"],[2466,2481,"LOC"],[2492,2501,"LOC"],[2852,2869,"PER"],[3039,3063,"PER"],[3090,3108,"ARCH"],[3121,3129,"ARCH"],[3249,3257,"PER"],[3343,3357,"ARCH"]]}],["superseding conventional brick masonry construction, rapidly introducing the steel frame, and rethinking established methods, proportions, and materialities. Archi- tects had to come to terms with a new lightness, structural exuberance, material transparency, and prefabrication efficiency that engineers already utilized. Con- structs such as the poignantly named Crystal Palace by Joseph Paxton (1851) in London and the iron lattice tower by Gustave Eiffel (1889) in Paris are only two of the legendary products of modern technology that challenged architectural thinking and forever transformed the city. Not only were these new constructs utterly different, even alien, to the neighborhoods they occupied but they also seemed to transform their surroundings. Modernist painters such as Robert Delaunay depicted the buildings adjacent to the Eiffel Tower fractured and reflected into a cacophony of forms, and photographers were equally mesmerized by the tower's lightweight member through which the city was newly seen. Both works hinted at a new spatial condition that questioned the solidity of architecture and the opposition between interior and exterior. Sigfried Giedion, empowered by hindsight, would later lobby that in the air-flooded stairs of the Eiffel Tower, one experienced a new aesthetic, where through the delicate iron net suspended in midair stream things, ships, sea, houses, masts, landscape and harbor. * Here, mod- ern forms not only conditioned the modern city but assembled a new world from the fragments of the old. The kaleidoscopic capacities of the glass and iron structures of the nineteenth century were the precursors to the expressionist imagery of Paul Scheerbart, ulti- mately culminating in the urban scenarios and architectural experiments of Bruno Taut. Often, these explorations were supported by the use of materials that only slowly found their way from engineering into architecture. Markus Breitschmid s chapter, for example, begins by pointing out that concrete was the material that made Bruno Taut s Glass House possible; a structure, as Breitschmid later emphasizes, that simultaneously harvested technological pos- sibilities ... and a new and necessarily metaphysical foundation. Viollet-le-Duc had already argued for the power of new industrial materials; against the stylistic assemblage of historicism, he advocated for architecture as a logical system born from within contemporary functional and material rules: if we would invent that architecture of our own times ... we must certainly seek it no longer by mingling all the styles of the past, but by relying on novel principles of structure. For him, the rational structuring of iron trusses was the logical outcome of industrial pro- duction and current technological advancements. Viollet-le-Duc induced archi- tecture with the ambition toward a rational and true process of form-finding within the present, a dramatic shift in architectural thinking that was echoed by the coming generation and reinterpreted by associates in Art Nouveau, Jugendstil, Stile Liberty, and Secession. Designers in these groups no longer applied these new aesthetic principles to single elements alone but to interiors as a whole (from furniture to the dress). Here, families of forms created a thick- ened interior of a new parallel world of seeming fluidity and structural alliance, \r",{"entities":[[365,379,"ARCH"],[407,413,"LOC"],[444,458,"PER"],[469,474,"LOC"],[790,805,"PER"],[845,857,"ARCH"],[1164,1180,"PER"],[1262,1274,"ARCH"],[1686,1701,"PER"],[1784,1795,"PER"],[1930,1948,"PER"],[2050,2061,"ARCH"],[2088,2099,"PER"],[2794,2808,"PER"]]}],["or what Amy Kulper in her chapter on the House for an Art Lover by Charles Rennie Mackintosh calls a radicalized interior. Shortly after, however, these formal escalations were placed into perspective by considerations relating to the city, often by the very same protagonists. August Endell, an eccentric German architect who before 1900 deployed free form to provoke emotional responses, by 1908 sought to find aesthetic potential in the visual effects of the metropolis. Otto Wagner s Postal Savings Bank constituted a new urban archi- tecture, a vision that was followed by his proposal for a new metropolis of infinite growth. Similarly, Peter Behrens called for simplified architectural uniformity that responded to the increasing speed of the city. In his chapter on the Postal Savings Bank, B la Ker kgyart argues that one can identify the developments that Wagner made toward a rational approach, while Gabriele H. Bryant s chapter on the AEG Turbine Factory points at Behrens intense search for an architecture of our time. Behrens stipulated that architectural details had to be suppressed once the tempo of vehicular traffic allowed one to see only silhouettes of buildings passing by. This was only one year after Filippo Tommaso Marinetti had described in detail a car race that prematurely ended in a disastrous crash while singing to the multicolored and pol- yphonic tides of revolution. By 1914, Umberto Boccioni, followed by Antonio Sant Elia, supplied Futurism with an architecture that spoke to the dynamism of the industrial city and wholeheartedly committed to and even accelerated the infra- structural and technologically saturated metropolis. Here, architectural form as enor- mous machine had become a fully immersed urban construct, linking all aspects of urban movement and vertically erupting at transportation nodes. Only after the tech- nological and strategic mechanization of World War I caused an unprecedented num- ber of casualties, including many Futurists, a reassessment of some of their fundamentals took place. Michelangelo Sabatini s chapter contrasts the fast-paced urbanism of Sant Elia s Citta Nuova to what he calls a slow Futurism that developed by the early 1920s, captivated by the dramatic qualities of the rugged landscape on the island of Capri. Just before and immediately after 1900, architecture had tested disciplinary boundaries, deployed new materials (or utilized old ones in new dimensions), and advanced techniques in its search for an expression of the historical moment. This search can be read as an attempt to catch up to a world it no longer under- stood, and much less had sway over. As a result, these two decades constitute one of the most contested eras in architectural history. To give only three exam- ples in a long list of books that struggled with the historical significance of this period: Nikolaus Pevsner s Pioneers of the Modern Movement (1936) aimed to dem- onstrate how this timeframe was a historical unit that fully formed the legit- imate style of our century ; Reyner Banham, on the other hand, saw the first machine age as erupting around 1912 and argued that we are still the children of that turbulent generation ; and Manfredo Tafuri and Franceso Dal Co unhinged the master narratives of the time and understood the period as a final flare-up of romantic Sehnsucht. * More recently, writings by historians such as \r",{"entities":[[8,18,"PER"],[41,63,"ARCH"],[67,92,"PER"],[278,291,"PER"],[474,485,"PER"],[488,507,"ARCH"],[643,656,"PER"],[778,797,"ARCH"],[799,814,"PER"],[866,872,"PER"],[912,930,"PER"],[948,967,"ARCH"],[978,985,"PER"],[1034,1041,"PER"],[1227,1252,"PER"],[1414,1430,"PER"],[1444,1461,"PER"],[2053,2074,"PER"],[2122,2131,"PER"],[2134,2145,"ARCH"],[2282,2298,"LOC"],[2869,2885,"PER"],[3049,3062,"PER"],[3210,3225,"PER"],[3230,3245,"PER"]]}],["the late Detlef Mertins have expanded and opened up new insights in familiar territories by, for example, relating theories of glass to a much wider realm of influence. As much as these interpretations differ, all concur on the period s transformative capacities from nineteenth century aspirations to twentieth cen- tury formulations. Marshall Berman went so far as to identify a shift from an open-ended and dynamic engagement with modernity during the late-nineteenth century toward a more hermetic understanding of modernism in the following decades. He saw a polarization at the beginning of the twentieth century, when [ojpen visions of modern life have been supplanted by close ones, Both/ And by Either/Or. \" For Berman, the struggle with modernity by the first modernists, as he calls them, presented not only problems but also revelations, where their self-ironies and inner tensions were a primary source of their creative power. As such, these early projects of the late nineteenth and very early twentieth century hold a unique place in the history of modernity one of dualisms and twilights but, most of all, animated by an openness toward the modern world, which the Futurists were about to polarize between embrace and resistance. The few projects presented here as part of a much larger catalogue of works are not only vital to an understanding of the modernisms that followed but, to paraphrase Berman, may hold opportunities to better understand the modernities of today. While seemingly far-fetched, taking clues from the resourcefulness of these early modernists may just give us the right dose of foresight to engage the city of today, to detect openings in the immediate future, and to anticipate another world.

The essay features his suggestion that it would be greatly for our aesthetic good if we would refrain entirely from the use of ornament for a period of years, in order that our thought might concentrate acutely upon the perfection of build- ings well formed and comely in the nude. For much of the twentieth century, Sullivan s Schlesinger and Mayer department store, later known as Carson Pirie Scott (1899-1903), was regarded as the physical manifestation of that impulse, a building in which ornament had been stripped away from all but the base and attic, revealing the naked form of the frame underneath. In this way it seemed to herald a new aesthetic in which the representation of technology replaced con- ventional forms of ornament. Considered in the urban and social context of late nineteenth-century Chicago, the Schlesinger and Mayer building illustrates Sul- livan s belief in the ongoing viability of architectural ornament, in particular as a representation of American democracy. This contextual reading suggests an alternative narrative of architectural modernism, one in which the curtain wall, so long understood as a form of structural expressionism, is also recognized for its decorative function. A State Street Department Store In 1891 the Schlesinger and Mayer Company consulted architects Adler and Sul- livan about giving a unified architectural expression to their department store, then located in a series of adjoining buildings in the block bounded by State, Mad- ison, Wabash, and Monroe Streets in downtown Chicago. The partners had achieved success with a series of projects combining technological innovation with decorative creativity, including the Schiller Theater (1886-92) and the Chicago Auditorium (1886-90). These projects dealt with complex functional requirements, including the need for large, well-lit interior spaces, as well as the desire for the expression of a civic and cultural identity suitable to a city of recent immigrants, many newly wealthy. While the department store commis- sion came to nothing, in 1898, after his partnership with Adler was dissolved, Sul- livan was commissioned to design a new 12-story flagship building for the company, replacing the existing one. The new building was constructed in two stages: a nine-story, three-bay building facing Madison Street, completed in 1899, and the main 12-story corner block with three bays on Madison and seven on State, completed in 1903. In 1904, the rival Carson Pirie Scott Company took control of the business and the building, gradually extending it southwards with a five bay extension by D.H. Burnham and Co. in 1906, and a three-bay section by \r",{"entities":[[45,59,"PER"],[559,567,"PER"],[586,591,"PER"],[625,643,"ARCH"],[1055,1062,"LOC"],[1084,1089,"PER"],[1111,1121,"PER"],[1465,1494,"ARCH"],[1507,1518,"PER"],[1523,1528,"PER"],[1568,1578,"PER"],[1774,1791,"LOC"],[1929,1945,"ARCH"],[1964,1982,"ARCH"],[2358,2368,"PER"],[2562,2576,"LOC"],[2717,2743,"ARCH"],[2854,2866,"PER"]]}],["Holabird and Roche in 1961. Both these additions mimicked the style of Sullivan s original building. One of a series of department stores built along State Street, the Schlesinger and Mayer Company sold mass-market luxury goods to middle-class customers, predom- inantly women. State Street itself was the vision of dry goods magnate Potter Palmer who had it widened and developed as the city s premiere commercial boulevard in the 1860s. Along with his early partners, Marshall Fields and Levi Leiter, Palmer was responsible for the first commercial palaces built there, all influenced by the great Parisian department stores: Blondel s Grand Magasin du Louvre (1866); Laplanche and Boileau s Bon March (1869-76); and Paul Sedille s Au Printemps (1883). Each of these buildings exploited an iron structure to create huge, open shopping floors illuminated with copious natural light. In Chicago the architect William Le Baron Jenney, one of Sullivan s early employers, established a new precedent for buildings of this type with the second Leiter building and the Fair stores (both 1891). Though these were considerably plainer than their French counterparts, they were unprec- edented in their enormous size. With these buildings, eight and eleven stories high respectively, Jenney inaugurated the hybrid skyscraper-department store type. The skyscraper appeared in the early 1880s when, in the middle of a real estate boom, property owners began using a method known locally as the Chicago con- struction to build 12-, 16-, and even 20-story buildings. This method was made up of a series of related technologies including an internal metal structure, elevators, electric lighting, steam heating, and so-called curtain walls: lightweight assemblies of brick, terracotta tile, and plate glass connected to the frame with anchors and brackets. Faster to erect than masonry, this method allowed the construction of tall buildings with large volumes that produced significantly increased rental revenue for their owners. For architects, the method presented an accompanying aesthetic problem: what should the Chicago construction look like? In early experi- ments, such as Holabird and Roche s Tacoma building (1889), the inner frame was expressed on the exterior via an undulating wall of unusually large windows. While the Tacoma mimicked the brown color of masonry buildings, Daniel Burnham and Charles Atwood offered a radical new aesthetic in their design for the Reliance building (1895). The original home of the Carson Pirie Scott company, the Reliance presented an obviously non-load-bearing curtain wall of cream-colored glazed ter- racotta tile inset with unusually large panes of plate glass. This wall of windows was folded into a series of bays projecting out over dark brown granite and bronze framed display windows at the street level. With its large windows and dramatic chromatic distinction between base and upper stories, the Reliance was a precedent for the Schlesinger and Mayer building. In its design Sullivan drew on the formula he had established for tall office buildings in the early 1890s: a single block divided into three horizontal layers, with a two- story mercantile base decorated in a sumptuous way in order to attract the eye ; above this, an indefinite number of office tiers; and finally a decorative attic \r",{"entities":[[0,8,"PER"],[13,18,"PER"],[71,79,"PER"],[150,162,"LOC"],[278,290,"LOC"],[334,347,"PER"],[470,485,"PER"],[490,501,"PER"],[503,509,"PER"],[628,635,"PER"],[636,661,"ARCH"],[670,691,"PER"],[692,703,"ARCH"],[719,731,"PER"],[734,746,"ARCH"],[887,894,"LOC"],[909,932,"PER"],[941,949,"PER"],[1040,1055,"ARCH"],[1064,1075,"ARCH"],[1276,1282,"PER"],[1484,1491,"LOC"],[2107,2114,"LOC"],[2171,2179,"PER"],[2184,2189,"PER"],[2192,2207,"ARCH"],[2323,2329,"ARCH"],[2377,2391,"PER"],[2396,2410,"PER"],[2467,2484,"ARCH"],[2518,2544,"ARCH"],[2978,3009,"ARCH"],[3024,3032,"PER"]]}],["that signified the vertical termination of the building. Adler and Sullivan s Wain- wright (1891) and Guaranty (1895) buildings exemplify this approach. In most buildings of this type the dimensions of the individual office units dictated the width of the structural bays. In the case of the skyscraper department store, how- ever, the structural bays were wider, designed to maximize open floor area for the display of merchandise and allow the large windows necessary to light it. The wider spacing of the bays may explain why, in contrast to the Wainwright and the Guaranty, Sullivan gave the windows of the Schlesinger and Mayer store a hor- izontal orientation. Even more significant than the wider bays, the mercantile base was given spe- cial prominence. Unlike other commercial buildings, where the street level occu- pants were tenants, here it was the owner of the building and the expression of the Schlesinger and Mayer Company s identity was of primary importance. Working with his assistant, Grant Elmslie, Sullivan developed a distinctive dark green metallic frame for the street-level display windows. The design of these windows was part of a larger effort to brand the store with a specific visual identity. Beautiful and intri- cate, the foliated decorative motif contained within the geometric frames was repeated in the store s interior in the form of sawn mahogany panels, ornamental plasterwork capitals, and bronze-plated lighting fixtures. This motif even influenced the graphic design of Schlesinger and Mayer s newspaper advertising. With its sty- lized natural forms, this ormamental scheme echoed the art nouveau style popular in France, for example Frantz Jourdain s Samaritaine department store (1905), which included decorative ironwork and polychromatic terracotta tile with a floral motif. The most obvious feature of the Schlesinger and Mayer building is the dramatic contrast between the base and the facade above. Clad in a pale cream-colored terracotta tile, this facade is unornamented except for the inset borders of the win- dow frames. Above this an unbroken cornice appears to float above deeply recessed windows at the attic level. Connecting these horizontal layers, a rounded tower unites the State and Madison facades and acts as the main entrance to the store. Though it echoed the grid, Sullivan s design for the upper facade stood apart from the bulk of the building behind it. He employed no rhythm of vertical projecting bays, as in the Tacoma and Reliance, merely the simple repetition of cell-like windows. He chose not to follow the convention by which the interior structure was expressed on the exterior as a series of pronounced vertical piers mimicking the classical orders. Instead the pale-colored screen appears to stretch tightly across the surface from one edge of the building to the other like a thin veil. This veiling effect is particularly pronounced because the horizontal spandrels are deeper than the vertical mullions. Sullivan raised these mullions from the surface of the wall only on the tower where they are grouped close together, enhancing the appearance of a single surface wrapping around the corner, at which point it is puckered, or folded. It was this aspect of the building that would attract the attention of the architects and critics of the early twentieth-century avant-garde. \r",{"entities":[[57,62,"PER"],[67,75,"PER"],[78,90,"PER"],[102,110,"PER"],[549,559,"ARCH"],[568,576,"ARCH"],[578,586,"PER"],[1006,1019,"PER"],[1021,1029,"PER"],[1686,1725,"ARCH"],[1856,1886,"ARCH"],[2239,2264,"ARCH"],[2336,2344,"PER"],[2489,2495,"ARCH"],[2500,2508,"ARCH"],[2992,3000,"PER"]]}],["The Articulated Frame By the late 1920s, the construction of the Schlesinger and Mayer building, or Carson Pirie Scott as it was now known, was considered a crucial moment in the evolution of the modern style, the first overt expression of the curtain wall. Now the building was thought of primarily as a skyscraper and its function as a department store was given secondary importance. Attention was focused on the upper levels of the facade, and the ornamented base and cornice were treated as vestigial, a nineteenth-century relic. In 1924 the American critic Lewis Mumford described such ornament as the last gesture of traditional architecture, clinging to the highest and lowest stories of the draped cube. In 1939 the Museum of Mod- ern Art in New York claimed Carson Pirie Scott as a native precursor to the Inter- national Style. Because of this one great and prophetic building, which frankly exhibits its cage-like steel skeleton, sheathed only in terracotta, the Museum declared, Sullivan may claim his place with contemporary European pioneers of the Modern Movement, [Adolf] Loos, [Otto] Wagner, [Hendrik] Berlage, and [Henry] Van de Velde. * In this way the International Style was understood as a spontaneous movement arising not in the context of Europe alone, but also in the United States. The Swiss critic and historian Sigfried Giedion cemented this view in his canonical Space, Time and Architecture (1941), where Carson Pirie Scott figures as a forebear to the steel and glass facades of Walter Gropius Fagus Factory (1913) and Gropius entry to the Chicago Tribune Tower competition (1923). In this historiographic framework, Carson Pirie Scott was one of a series of piv- otal buildings that launched a global modern style, one in which the thick masonry wall was transformed into an articulated frame. For high modernists, the internal steel frame and the external curtain wall were conceptually interchangeable and universally applicable. This idea was to find its highest expression in the work of German migr Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who inaugurated the Second Chicago School of architecture in the mid-twentieth century. Mies believed that great architecture was the aesthetic fulfillment of technology: Construction not only determines form, but is form itself, he wrote. In buildings such as the Lake Shore Drive apartments (1948-51) and the Seagram building (1954-58), metal and glass skins evoke the steel structure underneath. For Mies and other modernists, technology was a metaphor for the rational and efficient organization of modern society irrespective of national or cultural differences. In such a society, good archi- tecture was the aesthetic expression of technology. The revitalization of the build- ing art can only come from construction and not by means of arbitrarily assembled motifs, he claimed. The privileging of technological expression (which was thought to further the progress of modern society) over the application of historicist ornament (which was thought to retard it), dates to a turn-of-the-century discourse about the place of ornament in architecture and design. At a time when traditional social bound- aries were less and less meaningful, the florid ornament of the Victorian era was \r",{"entities":[[4,21,"ARCH"],[65,95,"ARCH"],[100,118,"ARCH"],[563,576,"PER"],[751,759,"LOC"],[768,786,"ARCH"],[992,1000,"PER"],[1089,1093,"PER"],[1102,1108,"PER"],[1120,1127,"PER"],[1141,1154,"PER"],[1294,1308,"LOC"],[1340,1356,"PER"],[1436,1454,"ARCH"],[1511,1525,"PER"],[1526,1539,"ARCH"],[1572,1605,"ARCH"],[1649,1667,"ARCH"],[2037,2061,"PER"],[2090,2097,"LOC"],[2151,2155,"PER"],[2328,2355,"ARCH"],[2374,2390,"ARCH"],[2466,2470,"PER"]]}],["damningly associated with the bourgeois, or middle class. No longer an expression of social status, ornamented goods now signified a lack of taste. The Austrian archi- tect and critic Adolf Loos famously derided efforts to invent a modern form of orna- ment, arguing that conventional decoration appealed only to the culturally backward, to criminals and primitive peoples. The German sociologist Werner Sombart linked the problem of contemporary design (its debasement through the proliferation of cheap, industrially-produced goods) to the rise of capitalism. Prompted by the need to increase both production and consumption, he argued, the market preyed on the base urge of consumers, particularly women, for the lat- est fashion. Around the same time, the Chicago economist Thorstein Veblen coined the term conspicuous consumption, meaning lavish spending on clothing, jewelry and extravagant houses in order to demonstrate one s wealth. In this sense, aesthetes believed, the system of ornament had been corrupted by consumerism: the social status it once conferred could now be bought and sold. Veblen identified department stores in particular as an essential part of the propaganda of culture, inculcating the lower classes with a taste for fashionable rather than functional goods. In these terms the highly decorated base of Carson Pirie Scott was doubly problematic. Not only a throwback to an outmoded ornamental tradition, it was also designed specifically to promote the consumption of cheaply made, mass- produced goods. Organic Architecture and the Textile Wall Since the 1960s, the rise of post-modernism has bought a renewed appreciation of Sullivan s ornament. Historians have focused in particular on his drawing and writ- ing in order to understand how and why he produced such complex decorative facades, as well his intellectual influences and the social context in which he worked. This scholarship has shown that while Sullivan utilized innovative archi- tectural technologies, he also regarded ornament as a viable form of modern expression, one that made manifest not universal social progress but the particular benefits of American democracy. Like many of his contemporaries in Europe and the United States, Sullivan rejected the thoughtless replication of historical prece- dent in favor of a philosophy of organic architecture. The definition of organic architecture varied greatly. Broadly speaking it meant architectural form derived from the inner function of a building, whether structural or programmatic, and not from the imitation of existing examples. Sullivan summarized this idea in his famous and frequently misunderstood aphorism: form ever follows function. The adoption of this principle implied no particular style: quite the opposite, the outward appearance of a building depended entirely on its situation. Classical or Gothic styles could be appropriate, depending on the manner in which they were used. In Chicago, organic architecture came to mean the evolution of Euro- pean styles into a new American one as they were transplanted into the American \r",{"entities":[[184,194,"PER"],[397,411,"PER"],[778,794,"PER"],[1335,1353,"ARCH"],[1565,1577,"ARCH"],[1659,1667,"PER"],[1944,1952,"PER"],[2222,2235,"LOC"],[2237,2245,"PER"],[2591,2599,"PER"],[2956,2963,"LOC"]]}],[" west (as Illinois and the Midwestern states were then considered). Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, architects in Chicago adopted a simplified version of the fashionable neo-Gothic style for their commercial structures. By the mid-1880s, influenced by the French architect Eug ne Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc, they began to think of the Gothic as a constructive system, one adaptable to modern functions and materials. In these terms the steel frame rendered conventional forms of architectural expression derived from load-bearing tectonic systems (such as the classical orders) obsolete. Architectural historian Mark Wigley has suggested that, in their efforts to legitimate the curtain wall, Sullivan and his colleagues were influenced by the German architect Gottfried Semper s principle of cladding : the idea that the origins of architecture lay not in post and beam construction but in the textile cov- ering used to enclose space in early human societies.* Semper s theory was derived from the archetype of a Caribbean hut (a reproduction of which he saw at the Great Exhibition in London in 1851) in which the lightweight wall was a separate system from the masonry base and hearth. This idea was attractive to the Amer- icans because it implied that the curtain wall might represent not a deviation from architectural tradition, but a return to its origins: that to dress a steel-framed build- ing in a textile-like fagade, what Sullivan called the product of loom and mine, might be entirely appropriate. Certainly many of his designs evoked textiles, especially his polychromatic Transportation Building at the World s Columbian Exposition (1893), which he compared to an oriental rug. This leaves the question of what Sullivan was trying to express with his una- shamedly draped surfaces. His method of dividing the facades of his tall buildings into three horizontal zones followed the organic principle of form follows function, at least in an abstract sense. But though he was well aware of what he called the social conditions that produced the new building type real estate conventions, structural technology, interior program he had no interest in expres- sing them directly. Rather, he shared with the American transcendentalist move- ment the belief that the role of art was to make visible the invisible spiritual world behind the material one. In this sense ornament was the highest form of architec- ture, the emotional expression of the inner life of a building. In the case of his own practice this meant making manifest the energy he saw inherent in the urban landscape of Chicago, a city he described as crude and raw but full of big things to be done. ? Just as Jenney and Adler utilized the steel frame to construct buildings suited to those big deeds, Sullivan experimented with cast-iron, plate glass and ter- racotta tile to render them visible in decorative form. His ornamental plant motifs were above all a metaphor for growth: the fertility of the natural landscape sym- bolized for him the social and economic potential of the American Midwest. In this sense he sought to naturalize the capitalist processes that produced the department store and the skyscraper in two distinct ways, linking their invention to the biolog- ical process of evolution and their appearance to organic forms found in the surrounding landscape. \r",{"entities":[[123,130,"LOC"],[282,312,"PER"],[618,629,"PER"],[767,783,"PER"],[1094,1100,"LOC"],[1443,1451,"PER"],[1596,1619,"ARCH"],[1627,1655,"LOC"],[1735,1743,"PER"],[2604,2611,"LOC"],[2695,2701,"PER"],[2706,2711,"PER"],[2787,2795,"PER"]]}],["While the ornamented Carson Pirie Scott building undoubtedly had a com- mercial function to draw attention to the store and to establish an image for the company as a purveyor of affordable luxury Sullivan sublimated that prag- matic function into a broader, social one. Together with his prot g Frank Lloyd Wright, he linked organic architecture to the concept of democracy, which he understood not as a formal system of government but as a philosophy of individual freedom and self-reliance particular to the United States. The tall office building symbolized the power of the American businessman to achieve great things via sheer will. Architectural historian Joseph Siry sees the department store as a related, but different form of democratic institution. For department store owners, shopping was more than a leisure activity; it was also an aid to assimilation, a means for personal self-improvement if not reinvention. In an era of great social instability, it played an important role in the fashioning of new Americans: here the immigrant from Ireland, Ger- many, or Bohemia could learn how to dress, behave, and ultimately succeed. In this context architectural ornament derived from the plant life of the Midwest was not the expression of individual social status, either inherited or bought, but of the new society being forged there. Though Sullivan became increasingly pessimistic about the future of American society in the later years of his life, his Prairie School followers carried his par- ticular vision of American modernism into the twentieth century. For Wright, it was the single family house rather than the tall commercial building that best represented organic architecture. Opposing both the aesthetic and political bases of European functionalism, he continued to experiment with abstracted natural forms, not only as ornament, as in his turn-of-the-century Prairie Houses, but also as the basis for planning in his idealized Broadacre City (1932-35) and later Uso- nian Houses. In the same tradition, Sullivan s friend, the Rochester architect Claude Bragdon, created a system of projective ornament : geometric motifs designed to replace traditional forms of decoration. He realized these most suc- cessfully in a series of sound and light displays during the 1910s. Designed to accompany community singing concerts, they were intended to foster both musi- cal and political harmony. The early twentieth-century critique of ornament in design was that it was obsolete, no longer a meaningful form of aesthetic expression in modern soci- ety. Corrupted by the rise of capitalism, it served only as an indicator of wealth, not social position or even taste. In its place, modernist architects forged an aes- thetic of technology, one in which decoration was supposedly abandoned in favor of the sober representation of the facts of a building: its function and method of construction. In this understanding, the curtain wall was the rational and universal expression of social progress achieved through technology. Sulli- van s Schlesinger and Mayer/Carson Pirie Scott served as a symbol of the birth of this idea, its plain upper stories presenting a stark contrast to the ornamented display windows below. But Sullivan himself did not see architecture in these \r",{"entities":[[21,48,"ARCH"],[197,205,"PER"],[296,314,"PER"],[511,525,"LOC"],[664,675,"PER"],[1064,1073,"LOC"],[1356,1364,"PER"],[1581,1587,"PER"],[1890,1904,"ARCH"],[1958,1972,"LOC"],[1993,2010,"ARCH"],[2034,2042,"PER"],[2077,2091,"PER"],[3047,3057,"PER"],[3060,3100,"PER"],[3244,3252,"PER"]]}],["terms. Part of a group of Chicago-based architects searching for the appropriate expression of the steel-framed skyscraper, he argued that, judiciously applied, ornament was necessary in order for a building to exceed the realization of mere pragmatic need. Ornament, he claimed, had an ongoing role as the expression not of social status or technological progress, but of the potential of an entire nation.

Hermann Muthesius, a contemporary of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, once observed about his domestic interiors that they evoked a fairy-tale world in which a book in an unsuitable binding would disturb the atmosphere simply by lying on the table. * Hermetic and tightly composed, detailed and aesthetically complete, inward and palpably exclusive how best to describe and interpret Mackintosh s domestic interiors that are paradoxically both stylistically singular, yet sufficiently abstract and autonomous to be ubiquitous? This chapter will focus on a single interior, the music room in the House for an Art Lover (1901). The radicalized interiority of Mackintosh s domestic architecture will find its corollary in the emancipated reverberations of the acoustic echo, resonating through four interpretive readings. This sonorous analogy will facilitate the articulation of four claims about Mackintosh s domestic architecture: it aspires to a dialogical relation- ship with its situation; it conceptually eschews verbatim mimicry and exact copying in favor of re-presenting domestic habits and practices; it has the capacity to express meaning while subverting disciplinary categories from within; and it is atmos- pheric, explicating architecture s spatial and temporal roles in the preservation of culture. Echo Location: Between Seemliness and Seaminess In 1901, the Journal for Interior Decoration (Zeitschrift fiir Innendekoration) launched a competition for the design of a House for an Art Lover (Haus eines Kunstfreundes). Since none of the entries precisely followed the rules of the Darmstadt competi- tion, no first prize was awarded. While second prize went to Baillie Scott, it was Mackintosh s design (disqualified for its insufficient number of interior per- spectives) that piqued the most international interest and generated heated disci- plinary debate. One year later, Alexander Koch, a wallpaper manufacturer and the organizer of the Darmstadt competition, published the three best proposals in a portfolio provocatively titled Meister der Innenkunst (Masters of Interior Art.) \r",{"entities":[[523,540,"PER"],[560,585,"PER"],[1112,1134,"ARCH"],[1174,1184,"PER"],[1412,1422,"PER"],[2001,2023,"ARCH"],[2194,2207,"PER"],[2216,2226,"PER"],[2410,2424,"PER"]]}],["In the same year, 1902, Mackintosh delivered a lecture to an audience of fellow artists and teachers, entitled Seemliness. * Mackintosh began his lecture with the following admission: I have chosen as my theme Seemliness but the theme will often be lost in my wanderings, will sometimes be only faintly heard in the > Brom the beginning, the operations of the echo, only faintly heard in the conceptual variations and faintly manifested in the architectural variations, is apparent. In advocating for seemliness, Mackintosh searches for an ideal that might guide all artists, and finds it in the situated variation: variations. What one misses in most of the work I refer to is the large rhythm that undulates through that of the great masters antient |sic] and modern the sustained note of informing purpose the deep vibration of some unifying undertone /now rising to accent and emphasis now sounding faintly, beneath the multifariousness of accompanying motives but always visible to an attentive sense as the basis if not the burden of the theme with variations the ensamble [sic] which every artists [sic] work no matter how trivial, should constitute. Reason informed by emotion expressed in beauty and elevated by earnestness lightened by humour the is the ideal that should guide all artists. In his search for architectural seemliness, for spatial decorum, for constructed character, Mackintosh deploys the language of the echo, with its rhythm and undu- lations, sustained notes, deep vibrations, and unifying undertone. In fact, the orig- inal manuscript for the lecture utilizes gaps and dashes of various sizes, as if the author is ascribing notations to a resonating and diminishing sound. If this paean to seemliness is predicated upon the notion of appropriate beauty, and if for Mack- intosh this is found in specific spatial situations in which both aesthetic and utili- tarian concerns are met, then surely his use of auditory tropes and notational language suggest an awareness that acoustic events must be experienced from within. For as Peter Sloterdijk so poignantly observes in his essay, Wo sind wir, wenn wir Musik h ren? (Where Are We When We Listen to Music?), auditory experiences are always situated events the act of listening, deprived of the priv- ilege of distance granted to vision, is immersed in the specifics of a spatial setting.* How can we locate this architectural aspiration for seemliness in the actual music room of the House for an Art Lover? In his lecture, Mackintosh emphasized that the operations of seemliness reside in the clothing of invention architects must attempt the task of clothing in grace and beauty the new forms and condi- tions that modern developments of life social - commercial and religious insist upon... Echoing this sentiment in his seminal Stilarchitektur und Baukunst (Style- Architecture and Building-Art) published in the same year (1902 first edition, 1903 second edition), Hermann Muthesius writes: For the new cannot arise in such outward appearances; architecture, like every other expression, presumes a vital presence.

Architecture ... must seek its essence in content to which the external appearance must adapt. These allusions to the clothing of new inventions are not coincidental; rather they implicate architectural involvement in an emerging culture of abstraction epitomized by the embrace of whiteness. Just as Mackintosh embraced the abstractness of the white page of his lecture to disperse his words across the page as a composer might disseminate musical notations, so too does his architecture articulate an abstract language of spatial detailing predicated upon the whiteness of his interiors. This pursuit of an abstract, linear language of the architectural interior allows for the subtle transition from the ethical pursuit of seemliness in his writings to the architectural construction of seaminess in his domestic projects. In the music room of the House for an Art Lover such seaminess is evident in the insistent and visually dominant wainscoating, mullioning, and columnating of the space. Here, the clothing of invention echoes through the iterative details of the architecture: beginning with the elaborately encased piano, the central focus of the space, and reverberating outward through linear vertical motives that ulti- mately give shape to two flanking muse-like murals. The room is south facing, and architectural echoes also emanate from the 10 reed thin columns flanking and separating six sets of French doors that open out onto the adjacent outdoor terrace. On the terrace, Mackintosh positions five planters containing thin orna- mental trees, recalling his earlier description of an echo faintly heard in the varia- tions. As the sun tracks across this southern facade, long thin shadows are cast back into the music room, their systematic spacing resonating in the decorative engaged columns of the opposite wall. Similarly, the murals bordering the piano on each side are echoed in the reverberations of Margaret Macdonald s so-called linen ladies textiles representing elongated female forms sentinels marking the transition from interiority to exteriority. Finally, ensconced within the baldac- chino-like structure that houses the piano are two highly stylized roses, resonating from this musical source, and reappearing in two elongated floor vases across the room. How, then, can this dialogue between seemliness and seaminess in Mackin- tosh s domestic interiors be interpreted? The exchange is not unlike the conver- sation between the mythological figures of Echo and Narcissus. Though the many literary accounts and paintings that re-tell this story set the stage for a dia- logue, the reality of the narrative is that Echo is condemned by Hera to only ever repeat the words she hears, and Narcissus is too captivated by his own image to participate in a genuine dialogue. Latent within the figure of Echo is the prospect of sound displaced uprooted, multiple, abbreviated, translocated, and yet, anticipated in this displacement is the fact of this conversation s original situa- tion.\" In this sense, Echo is at once a withered genius loci, simultaneously scat- tered so widely that she expands into the spirit of every place, pure and singing. '* If the aspiration for the Darmstadt competition was for the design of a house for an art lover that was itself work of art (as the subsequent portfolio \r",{"entities":[[308,318,"PER"],[858,880,"ARCH"],[1499,1509,"PER"],[1933,1951,"PER"],[2364,2376,"PER"]]}],["title, Masters of Interior Art, suggests), then this dialogue between seemliness and seaminess is a manifestation of the tension between lived and aesthetic experi- ence in this domestic interior. If the mythological figure of Echo is transformed from the old me of ancient Echo described as a nymph out-of-doors, to the hold me of early modern Echo who was a figure of interiors, then this displace- ment of echoes from an exterior condition to the interior suggests the complicity of the natural world rendered immanent in the transition from echoes that are site-specific to echoes that are ubiquitous.'? In the threshold between park and terrace, and then again between terrace and music room, the domestication, interiorization, and abstraction of the natural world into the immanence of archi- tectural motives reverberates like a displaced echo. Echoes are, in a sense, inte- gral to the construction of modern privacy, heard not as a noise but as the sounding of a proper distance, a distance that made for domestic and other har- monies. \"* In this example of echo location, there is no genuine dialogue between seemliness and seaminess in Mackintosh s projects, rather, aesthetic experience supplants lived experience in a displacement of the domestic interior from an ethical realm to a realm of abstraction and autonomy. Asimilar gravitation toward the realms of abstraction and autonomy is evident in the work of Mackintosh s Belgian contemporary, Henry van de Velde, specif- ically in his design for the Nietzsche Archive between 1901 and 1903. Ina paralle demonstration of seaminess, van de Velde inserts what architectural historian Ole W. Fischer describes as a studiolo into the existing Villa Silberblick to house the philosopher s archive. Fischer argues that this addition epitomizes van de Velde s aspiration for ornamental transcription, or program art. Originated by composers Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt, program art provided music and architecture with a vehicle to shuttle non-figurative content and meaning into the highly abstract realms of music and architecture. Program music utilized a title, a parallel theoretical or philosophic text, and the arrangement of music into themes, or leitmotifs, and this appealed to van de Velde for its rejection of mimicry and imitation ... providing an abstract object with philosophica meaning beyond the application of symbolic ornament or classical tectonic lan- guage. ' Quite literally, in van de Velde s studiolo, the echoes of Wagner and Liszt and their quest for the manifestation of philosophical meaning in the abstraction of architecture and music are evident. The seaminess of van de Velde s archive resides in vertical ribs that appear to be simultaneously structural, spatial dividers, bookshelf armatures, and decorative support for the white pla- fond above. If Mackintosh s music room utilizes the title of a House for an Art Lover, the theoretical text of his lecture on Seemliness, and the thematic arrangement of interiorized and domesticated natural motives, then, van de Velde similarly deploys the title - Nietzsche-Archiv engraved above the villa s main entrance, the theoretical work of Wagner and Liszt s framing of program music, and the leitmotif of Nietzsche s reformulation of the natural into an organic unity of spirit and matter. Here, Mackintosh s music room and van \r",{"entities":[[1149,1159,"PER"],[1426,1436,"PER"],[1461,1479,"PER"],[1518,1527,"PER"],[1599,1611,"PER"],[1653,1663,"PER"],[1706,1723,"LOC"],[1760,1767,"PER"],[1805,1817,"PER"],[1901,1915,"PER"],[1920,1931,"PER"],[2466,2478,"PER"],[2505,2511,"PER"],[2660,2672,"PER"],[2849,2859,"PER"],[2897,2919,"ARCH"],[3057,3069,"PER"],[3183,3189,"PER"],[3194,3199,"PER"],[3340,3350,"PER"]]}],["de Velde s Nietzsche archive embody echoes of distant mythological figures and contemporary musical figures. These architectural ensembles raise questions about the possibility of importing content and meaning in the context of abstrac- tion, where the desire for seemliness and spatial decorum yields to an expression of seaminess or spatial synthesis through composition and detailing. Echo Replications and Echo Re-Presentations In 1901, the same year in which he executed the design of the House for an Art Lover, Mackintosh contributed to a Viennese book on artistic lettering, Beispiele kunstlerischer Schrift, deploying a font of his own making to inscribe a quotation by J.D. Sedding. * Though he never designed an alphabet, the distinctive lettering of Mackintosh s drawings attenuated, stylized, ornamental, and uniquely his own became reified in his contribution to this publication. Today, the CRM Font Company sells nine variations of Mackintosh s stylized typography, each modifica- tion named after a specific place, as with the Glasgow Font, or a specific project, as with the Artlover Font. ? Although these fonts preserve a residual reference to the place of their invention, in philosopher of communication theory Marshall McLuhan s sense they are autoamputations echoing technological extensions of Mackintosh himself, creating a closed system of reference a culture of copies that induces narcosis. In fact, the terminology of typography preserves something of this numbing effect in the word that describes a stereotype block intended to perpetuate phrases without change, the clich . Though this argument refers specif: ically to Mackintosh s practice of typography, a similar case can be made for his repetitive use of ornamental motives ubiquitous stylistic echoes more or less indifferent to the architectural settings in which they are deployed. If McLuhan s reading of Narcissus proffers an interpretive framework through which to understand the culture of replication and reproduction surrounding Mackintosh s oeuvre, then it is Athanasius Kircher s conceptualization of the echo in his seminal Musurgia Universalis (1650) that will contribute to an understanding of the re-presentational capacities of the term. What Kircher so beautifully evokes in this illustration of an echo is its nascent capacity for polysemy, the possibility that each one of the iterations might somehow re-present the original linguistic utter- ance. How does Mackintosh accommodate such polysemy in his domestic projects? How is the spatial utterance transformed in his work into manifold architectural expressions and meanings? To answer these questions it is critical to examine the operations of whiteness in his work. As an architect, Mackintosh s style evolves between 1893 and 1904, but there is a period of marked productivity and growth between 1900 and 1901, a juncture that is often described as his white period. Mackintosh s first white room was a bed- room designed for the publisher Robert Maclehose at Westdel in Glasgow in \r",{"entities":[[11,20,"PER"],[494,516,"ARCH"],[679,692,"PER"],[762,772,"PER"],[948,958,"PER"],[1233,1249,"PER"],[1319,1329,"PER"],[1653,1663,"PER"],[1876,1883,"PER"],[2026,2036,"PER"],[2058,2076,"PER"],[2247,2254,"PER"],[2466,2476,"PER"],[2746,2756,"PER"],[2931,2941,"PER"],[3004,3020,"PER"],[3035,3042,"LOC"]]}],["1898. The insertion of this single white room into a domestic setting was followed by a number of such discrete, white interventions: the director's room at the Glasgow School of Art (1899); the six rooms of Mackintosh s own flat at Mains Street (1900-06); and a series of tearoom projects for Miss Cranston, culminating in a complete white interior on Ingram Street (1900). Elements from these early white projects were then combined into a showcase room for the Vienna Secession Exhibition in 1900.7 All of the white projects leading up to the House for an Art Lover can be char- acterized as insertions: the insertion of a room (Westdel); the insertion of a sequence of spaces in a pre-existing structure (Mains Street and Miss Cranston s Tearooms); the insertion of a room within a larger exhibition space (the Secession Exhibition and later, the Universal Exposition of Turin in 1902). The role of white- ness within this strategic spatial insertion resides in the production of a harmonious and atmospheric space that is both radically interiorized and conceptually whole. Mackintosh s use of whiteness connotes interiority by rendering the interior a rep- resentational domain in which the materiality of the natural world is translated and domesticated. By producing a spatial monochrome, Mackintosh achieves a visual synthesis of the elements a spatial ensemble merging architecture, furnishings, fittings, and details into a novel stylistic whole. A simple comparison of Mackintosh s scheme for the House for an Art Lover with the second-place entry by Baillie Scott, demonstrates the degree to which whiteness allowed Mackintosh to eschew historical reference, and to some extent, materiality. And yet, in all of Mackintosh s white projects, even the Director s Office at the Glasgow School and the tearooms for Miss Cranston, the whiteness establishes a horizon of domesticity, operating at the level of spatial manicure or refinement to produce a hermetic domestic sanctuary. In an untitled paper on architecture dating back to 1892, Mack- intosh associates the use of white paint with an aspiration for comfort: Paint I say is no deception, for in wood, iron, plaster & sometimes even stone it is necessary for comfort.... ? Here, white paint provides a context that allows echoes of Mackin- tosh s domestic projects and the comfort they invoke, to bleach dimensions of his public projects, coating them in whiteness and infusing them with the coziness of home. Paradoxically, the whiteness of Mackintosh s domestic projects shares affi- nities with the whiteness of the exhibition space, especially those of the Vienna Secession in 1900, and the Universal Exposition held in Turin in 1902. In both, Mackintosh exhibited white rooms, embraced for their purity, so straightforward that they look as innocent and serious as young girls about to receive Holy Communion, and yet critiqued for their blanched emptiness: there was scarcely anything in these rooms except two upright chairs, with backs as tall as man, which stood on white carpet, looking at each other over a slender table, silently like ghosts. ** By the time Mackintosh designs the House for an Art Lover, the white- ness that was formerly a strategy for discrete spatial insertion has become ubiqui- tous and pervasive, as evidenced by the subtle exterior massing of the white \r",{"entities":[[294,307,"PER"],[353,366,"ARCH"],[464,491,"ARCH"],[546,568,"ARCH"],[632,639,"ARCH"],[709,721,"ARCH"],[726,739,"PER"],[1509,1531,"ARCH"],[1563,1576,"PER"],[1823,1836,"PER"],[3159,3181,"ARCH"]]}],["volumes of the house. This is the whiteness of abstraction, the whiteness that facil- itates the smooth importation of natural motives into the interior of the music room, the whiteness that Mackintosh posits as a blank canvas for the expression of cultural ideas. In his untitled paper on architecture of 1892, Mackintosh articu- lates the primary role of the artist and architect as that of giving expression to the ideas of the general cultured mind, and the role of architecture to offer pleasure to the mind and comfort and protection to the body. Thus, across the white gesso of the murals, the white linen of the wall hangings, the white paint of the architectural details, and the white fibers of the carpet, Mackintosh offers a blank canvas, sending echoes and reverberations throughout the European architectural community, promoting a novel white architecture that is interiorized, ahistorical, domesticated, exhibitionist, and abstract. Polysemous Echoes: Subverting Disciplinary Categories Though the mythological figure of Echo is often interpreted benignly as a figure who can only reiterate, it would be misguided to interpret the echoes of Mackintosh s music room in the House for an Art Lover as pale imitations lacking agency. In fact, it is possible to retrieve the nymph Echo who shows that iter- ation can explode a category from within, and that language s parrotings some- times do have salutary agency. * But how is this categorical dismantling accomplished? In what way does the repetition of an utterance achieve salutary agency? Echo does re-present, literally so. But what she presents back is no longer the original utterance. The word, now as thing, is wrenched into a novel sense or a nonsense, made stranger by the brute fact of its re-presentation alone or because its context has been lopped off. The echo emanates from a place, but the more distance that is accrued between the echo and the initial utterance, the greater the potential for de-contextualization. This capacity of the echo to de- contextualize is readily apparent in Mackintosh s work the coat of whiteness he utilizes in projects between 1900 and 1901 is just one manifestation of this ten- dency. However, in order to identify echoes within his work that not only re- present but also have the capacity to unmake disciplinary categories, we must look to Mackintosh s furniture design, and specifically to the so-called high- back. Near the piano in the music room of the House for an Art Lover sits a simple table surrounded by three high-backs; a fourth sits flush against the solid wall, a tacit reminder of the spatial agency of these furnishings. For the high-back is not simply a chair in its typical sense; rather it is charged with the difficult task of producing an alternative interior that is at once more private and more exclu- sive than its original context. Echoes of this strategy of territorializing space through the deployment of room-like furniture also appear in the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, perhaps most notably in the dining-room chairs of his \r",{"entities":[[1188,1210,"ARCH"],[2474,2496,"ARCH"],[3006,3024,"PER"]]}],["Robie House (1908 to 1910). Why, then, does Mackintosh make the curious choice of locating the fourth high-back against the wall, rather than fully enclos- ing this nascent room within a room? This high-back s language of slim repeti- tious verticals resonates with the numerous iterations of thin vertical elements in the room mullions, columns, even the rhythm of slim wires suspending the light fixtures from the ceiling. Here, in an interesting inversion of Robin Evans argument about the developed surface of the eighteenth-century domestic interior, rather than the interior elevation preserving all of the evidence of the objects that will ultimately populate the room, Mackintosh s high-backs function as a sort of lopped off context, with the capacity to generate a domestic interior in their next setting. * The high-backs are complicit both in the completion of the room within a room, and in the anticipation of possible future interiorities. The earliest versions of the high-backs were designed by Mackintosh for the inte- rior of Miss Cranston s Argyle Street Tearoom in 1898, executed in dark stained oak and topped with oval ornaments, likened by some observers to a human head atop an androgynous body. Within the context of the tearoom, the chairs were designed to create a domestic intimacy within a public venue, but their capacity to generate their own context is also noted: When these chairs are placed at a table, the anthropomorphic references intensify; even with no one sitting in them the chairs appear peopled. * Once again, as an ensemble, the high-backs have the capacity to recreate the context of intimate conversation, with or without occu- pants. While this echo of Mackintosh s work compellingly dismantles the category chair by allowing the ensemble of high-backs to lop off the context and gen- erate some version of it in their subsequent settings, the status of the high-back changed radically in 1973 when facsimiles were produced for the Triennale in Milan by Cassina. At precisely the moment in which the facsimile is produced, Mackintosh s high-backs become reified as iconic objects, as authored chairs, as his- torical reproductions, relinquishing their capacity to generate context, to sponsor privacy, and to proffer alternative interiorities. Ironically, in a Sotheby s auction just two years later, a Mackintosh high-back from the drawing room of the Hill House (1904) was sold for a record-breaking sum for twentieth-century decorative art objects at auction. As one observer remarked: Despite the efforts of scholars and others seeking to establish Mackintosh s place in history ... it was in fact the sale of a single chair that, through the activities of the commercial world, made Mackintosh a household name. * At this moment of the turn of the century, the role played by furniture in the definition or in-definition of space is critical. This is a moment of equipoise that marks the transition from the raumplan and its com- plicity with furnishings in the act of room making, and the free plan whose only concession to furniture is to provide an open floor plate upon which emancipated objects can be positioned. Equally, echoes of this moment can be found in the Werkbund debates of 1914, in which Muthesius and van de Velde debated the vir- tues of individually designed furnishings and objects (van de Velde) versus standar- dized and industrially produced goods (Muthesius.) \r",{"entities":[[0,11,"ARCH"],[462,473,"PER"],[1045,1082,"ARCH"],[2402,2412,"ARCH"],[3259,3268,"PER"],[3273,3285,"PER"]]}],["Conclusion: Atmospheric Echoes Over Time There is an intangible that remains to be addressed in this account of the figurative echoes of Charles Rennie Mackintosh s music room, and we must return to Hermann Muthesius characterization of Mackintosh s domestic interiors to retrieve it. What lies behind Muthesius observation that a book in an unsuitable binding would disturb the atmosphere of one of Mackintosh s domestic interiors? Harry Mal- lgrave sheds light on this question, when he identifies a text written by Richard Strei- ter in 1896 as a theoretical influence on Muthesius work. In the text, Streiter argues: Just as realism in poetry views as one of its central tasks the delineation of character in relation to its milieu, so the parallel program in architecture sees as its most desirable goal of artistic truth the development of the character of a building not only out of the determination of its needs but also from the milieu from the qualities of local mate- rials and from the environmentally and historically conditioned atmosphere of the place [Stimmung der Ortlichkeit. Somewhere between Mackintosh s first white ensemble in the Westdel bed- room and the production of facsimile chairs that made the architect a household name, lurks this question of character, seemliness, or environmentally and histor- ically conditioned atmosphere. For, as everyone knows, a critical component of any echo is the atmosphere in which it is immersed, the milieu through which it reso- nates. If an echo is the sounding of a proper distance that occasions domestic harmony, then in the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh one understands that when this distance is not in the service of architectural character, or environmen- tally and historically conditioned atmospheres, it can become the springboard for architectural styles, motives and objects, reified and fully emancipated from their respective contexts displaced interiors, both literally and figuratively. In 1960, Mackintosh s home at 78 Southpark Avenue in Glasgow, where he lived from 1906 to 1914, was demolished. In 1981, the Hunterian Art Gallery recon- structed the hall, the dining room, the studio, the drawing room, and the principal bedroom, within the museum, calling the exhibit The Mackintosh House. And though the House for an Art Lover was a hypothetical proposal for an architectural competition in 1901, the project was fully realized in Glasgow s Bellahouston Parkin 1996. The renovated structure boasts a Mackintosh exhibition, a heritage center, art studios and classes, the Art Lover s Shop selling countless Mackintosh facsimiles and reproductions, and the Art Lover's Caf ; and it is one of the premier venues for wed- dings in Glasgow. The same conditions that rendered the music room of Mackintosh s House for an Art Lover an environmentally and historically condi- tioned atmosphere, imbued each of its ingredients with the dual capacities of reification and emancipation.

Many echoes resonate from the source of Mackintosh s music room: echoes in the practice of architectural monochromy and in the aspirations of the Vienna Secession; echoes of a movement away from period styles and toward the white abstraction of early modernism; and echoes of the contemporary discourse on World Heritage Sites, historic preservation, and curatorial practices with their attendant cultures of facsi- miles and reproductions. Amidst these echoes, reverberations, and resonances, Mackintosh s aspiration for seemliness is displaced, both within the work itself and within the history of architecture. The hollow drumming of museum interiors and facile facsimiles supplants his desire for environmentally and historically condi- tioned atmospheres. The competition for the House for an Art Lover is the ultimate inducement for Mackintosh, an invitation to aestheticize experience through design, to create a house that is a work of art. The ambition of the music room, then, is not to function as a space for making music, but rather to show itselfas a room that is simul- taneously a work of art. Beneath the detritus of preservation, restoration, and repro- duction lurks the large rhythm, the sustained note, and the deep vibration of appropriate beauty, awaiting a context through which it can once again echo.

Modern art must offer us modern forms that are created by us and that express our abilities and actions. The Postal Savings Bank in Vienna was built in two phases from 1904 to 1906 and from 1910 to 1912. Its architect, Otto Wagner, was over 60 years old at the time, and perhaps the most influential architect in Vienna. He was also a highly controversial figure. Shortly after he was appointed professor at the Academy of Fine Arts he published his lectures, which were both a summary of his professional credo and a militant manifesto. This work, entitled Modern Architecture, demanded that architecture would no longer imitate past forms but become an up-to-date building art. Wagner's efforts were aided by a lucky coincidence of internal and external factors. In the 1890s a fundamental change in art and culture had swept through both Vienna and the rest of Europe. The break with historicism (referred to as revivalism) came along with a turn toward the new instead of the old, toward the creative rather than the receptive. These were widespread themes around 1890 and the revolutionary changes in art and architecture were only part of these pro- cesses. For Wagner this tendency was not without inner contradictions, as his ear- lier works seemed to relate him to a free renaissance style. The turn toward an ideological radicalism preceded visible changes in his practice. A paradoxical or according to his admirers tragic aspect of his career was that although he took part in many international and local competitions and developed, exhibited, and pub- lished many progressive and inventive projects, he received hardly any public com- missions until the mid-1890s. Most of his works were apartment buildings of mixed function, among them several important and spectacular houses in downtown Vienna. His big commission in the mid-1890s to design the station buildings and other structures and amenities of the Stadtbahn (urban railway) was to shape definitively the face of the modern metropolis. However, Wagner later complained of not having received the type of monumental commissions with which he could have demonstrated the superiority of the modern architectural principles he espoused. He initiated conceptual plans for buildings such as a modern church and a variety of museum types. His agitation project for the city museum (1900) was an attempt to pre-empt the announcement of a public competition in order to be awarded the commission directly. Although he did indeed win the competition, which was announced shortly after his action, he was not able to realize his plans even after a long and eventful battle. Nevertheless, he went on to build two monumental buildings at the beginning of the twentieth century, which were to be his major works: a church for the psychiatric hospital complex at \r",{"entities":[[227,246,"ARCH"],[250,256,"LOC"],[337,348,"PER"],[798,804,"PER"],[959,965,"LOC"],[982,989,"LOC"],[1286,1292,"PER"],[1923,1930,"LOC"],[2041,2065,"ARCH"]]}],["Steinhof on the outskirts of Vienna (1902-04) and the Postal Savings Bank (1903-12). Both are manifestations of his mature approach while naturally differing greatly in purpose and type. Whereas in the case of the church the aim was a mod- ern reformulation of a traditional type he had referred to it as the most interesting task for an architect the Postal Savings Bank was a prototype of an institution characteristic of modern mass society. Planning the Institution: The Modern Building Method Throughout Europe, Postal Savings Banks were new institutions based on the infrastructural and communication possibilities of the network of post offices. The Postal Savings Bank in Vienna was founded as a state institution in 1883. Its aim was to encourage thrift in wider and poorer circles of society and, at the same time, to collect and use these savings for the economic benefit of the state, which was to compete with the monopoly of the big private banks. The Postal Sav- ings Bank was a dynamic and extensive institution. The organization of work was strict, resembling a factory more than an office, with a 14-hour work day and poor conditions. The spaces in the Postal Savings Banks were very tight and considered unhealthy (due to the lack of ventilation and proper sanitation). As a consequence of these problems and the repeated protests of the employees about them, along with further plans for development, the government decided to support the erec- tion of a new building. An open competition was announced, which was unusual for state buildings in Vienna in this period. The relatively rare state commissions were usually given immediately to the officials of the government building departments. Architects repeatedly protested against this practice and demanded open competitions. The one for the Postal Savings Bank perhaps reflected the prestige of this new insti- tution, as the competition brief meticulously described the practical demands for light, healthy and hygienic workplaces, and sanitary equipment. As far as the building was concerned, the brief stipulated simple and dignified appointments and that an emphasis should be laid on durability and low maintenance. Two banking halls were to be developed: a larger, dignified one in a covered court- yard for checking transactions, and a smaller one for savings transactions. Prio- rities were given to pragmatic factors such as general appropriateness for business, sufficient usable space, and a well-functioning system of communica- tion, in addition to the feasibility of construction. Aesthetics were mentioned only among the lower priorities. Of the 32 participating architects, the projects varied from historicist to modern solutions but most stayed within the compe- tition brief and planned a functional building with relatively simple facades and ornamentation. Five prizes were awarded, together with Wagner s winning commission. \r",{"entities":[[0,25,"ARCH"],[29,35,"LOC"],[54,73,"ARCH"],[352,371,"ARCH"],[482,508,"ARCH"],[517,537,"ARCH"],[657,676,"ARCH"],[680,686,"LOC"],[966,987,"ARCH"],[1171,1191,"ARCH"],[1565,1571,"LOC"],[1816,1835,"ARCH"],[2893,2899,"PER"]]}],["Wagner was already familiar with the problems of the Postal Savings Bank as well as the conditions of the site. After winning a joint first prize with his city expan- sion plan in 1893, he was commissioned to elaborate on a plan for regulating the part of the Ringstrafe where the bank was to be located (the Stubenring). On the site of the huge military barracks, which were to be demolished, Wagner proposed a new central post office and the Postal Savings Bank nearby. Later, most of the plot was bought for the erection of the new bank building. Although the irregular, trap- ezoid plot was not directly a showpiece on the boulevard, it had immediate spatial and visual contact with the Ringstrafe because one plot between the Ring and the new bank building was left open for a small urban square and a forecourt to the building. The huge bank and office building was constructed in two phases. The first part, closer to the Ringstrafe, was erected between 1904 and 1906, and the second part was built in simplified form between 1909 and 1912. The building, which according to Wagner is an exemplary case of a modern building type, namely the office building (Amtshaus), is horizontal in character with a prominent middle part, long wings at the sides and a vast building mass. His design efforts were directed to fulfill the functional needs of the building and at the same time to express its overall character: The equivalent office rooms of the individual floors, the extension of the units for operative functions refer already in outlook to a certain uniformity. * The proportion of walls and windows, the varying heights of floors and the functional ornament brought some diversity to the uniformity of the huge building mass. As one of the main goals of the planning was to create healthy and hygienic working conditions, Wagner planned unusu- ally large windows in order to let more light in. The demand for more available space in the building required relatively low floor heights, which Wagner justified by referring to practicalities. He employed a hybrid construction with concrete floors and load-bearing walls made of brick. The brick walls are covered by a facade, which Wagner had already alluded to in his theory of a modern building method in the first edition of Modern Architecture, where he sought to demonstrate the superiority of modern construc- tion to the so-called Renaissance method. His example of the latter was Semper and Hasenauer s Burgtheater (1871-88) with its heavy and expensive materials and labor-intensive construction. In contrast, modern construction was cheaper and fas- ter: For the exterior cladding of a building ... a panel system will be used on the planar surfaces. Since these panels can be assumed to have significantly less cubic volume, they can be designed for a nobler material. ... They are to be fastened with bronze bolts (rosettes). * Wagner made use of a sophisticated stone cladding system for the facade. In ear- lier versions, he chose majolica and even the type of ornamentation recalled in its motifs the Secession, with its quasi-organic forms. In the final version, one can dis- cern different versions of the veneered patterns. The rusticated base is curved at the bottom to create a shadow line and increase the visual height, but reveals at the corners and through the fixing bolts that it is not solid masonry. In the middle \r",{"entities":[[0,6,"PER"],[53,72,"ARCH"],[309,319,"ARCH"],[394,400,"PER"],[444,463,"ARCH"],[1081,1087,"PER"],[1147,1172,"ARCH"],[1834,1840,"PER"],[2003,2009,"PER"],[2192,2198,"PER"],[2448,2468,"PER"],[2471,2482,"ARCH"],[2900,2906,"PER"]]}],["part, Wagner combined bonded and gridded configurations. The former was char- acteristic of the traditional building method; the latter emphasized the veneered nature of masonry. This duality expresses the difference between heavy and light structure, which recalls the classical order, where this facade becomes a columned portico between two towers. The ornamentation reinforces this reading as the ornaments at the bottom and upper part of the facade can be understood as the base and capital of columns.'? The different versions of the plan trace the evolution of Wagner s stylistic devel- opment from the use of explicitly historicist elements through the influences of the Secession to a rational, functionalist approach. At the same time, Wagner distanced himself more and more from tradition or the idea of continuity. He stated that art and architecture should always express their own time. Given the new materials, methods of construction, demands, and lifestyle, these should become the starting point for artistic creation. In the final phase of this evolution, Wagner arrived at a severe form of economic expression, where, as Otto Antonia Graf outlines, all the concepts and realized constructions result from the character and purpose of the building. * This did not entail a ban on tradition, which is present in a clear but more indirect, allusive way. Wagner emphasized two main functions on the facade: first, the position of the directorate on the piano nobile, expressing hierarchy and distinction; and second, the entrance with five doors and a canopy above them, which underscored the bustling public circulation. This construction is kept apart from the main body of the build- ing. It has a roof of glass on a metal frame supported by thin aluminum columns. Wagner, thus, created a number of transitions from the outer to the inner public space. First, the urban square functions as an anteroom to the stairs with the can- opy. In the building itself we enter an imposing, elegant vestibule with a broad, marble staircase, which leads up to a connecting passage that opens onto the hall. This ceremonial introduction heightens the effect of the main hall in the heart of the building. The Heart of the Building: The Counter Hall Counter halls with a public function have always formed the central part of modern bank buildings, beginning with Soane s spectacular Bank of England (1788-1834). Wagner's counter hall is a building within a building, a light iron and glass structure that contrasts with the stone clad exterior. From the very beginning Wagner placed the vestibule and the main hall in the center of a symmetric composition. Despite the explicit demand of the competition brief to allocate the counters for checking and savings activities in different rooms, he concentrated all of them in the main hall and situated the processing administration vertically in the floors on both sides of the courtyard. The individual floors were arranged flexibly. The safes and safety deposit boxes were placed below the courtyard along with a large mail room, \r",{"entities":[[6,12,"PER"],[568,574,"PER"],[746,752,"PER"],[1141,1158,"PER"],[1371,1377,"PER"],[1784,1790,"PER"],[2242,2254,"ARCH"],[2369,2374,"PER"],[2389,2406,"ARCH"],[2418,2424,"PER"],[2427,2439,"ARCH"],[2575,2581,"PER"]]}],["which was connected by lifts to the counters and the administrative offices for checking and savings, in order to provide an effective network of communication. However, compositional considerations were of equal importance to practical ones for Wagner. He divided the almost regular quadrilateral courtyard into three parts in order to achieve the desirable elongated form of the hall. This resulted in a basil- ica-like space with three naves, a higher one in the middle section and two lower aisles on each side. Perhaps the most effective and influential feature of the counter hall is the juxtaposition of a sacral type of space with industrial materials and structures. Iron glass constructions had been a novelty yielding great acclaim in public buildings since the middle of the nineteenth century. Examples of such anon- ymous, transitory spaces of the modern metropolis can be found in exhibition, trade, and commercial halls, as well as in department stores. However, the vis- ible use of iron structures and their aesthetic value sparked fierce debates in architectural theory and criticism. Until the last decade of the nineteenth cen- tury, the majority of architects and critics were rather skeptical about their artistic merits. Wagner expressed great interest in new materials and technol- ogies: he considered iron, and later also concrete, to be the most promising of the new materials and hoped to make fitting use of them as modern architec- ture advanced. Wagner had already used an iron-glass roof in his Landerbank 20 years earlier, but had combined it with traditional or conventional historicist architectural ele- ments. The same can be observed in the designs for the Stadtbahn stations. In the Postal Savings Bank, however, Wagner avoided any direct allusion to historical forms, and consciously used industrial structures without any traditional ornamen- tation. At the same time, he wanted to avoid the ignoble appearance of the iron trusses caused by the usual industrial green paint and, therefore, devised a method to ennoble the iron structure, as he described it: The naturally very precisely exe- cuted work will be transposed and then repeatedly painted white and the paint itself polished. * Next, he combined the iron with different cladding materials: After all the construction workers have finished their works and left the site, the greatest part of the iron surfaces thus treated would be embellished with adorn- ments in aluminum and golden bronze screwed onto the columns as diverse smal- ler parts. ...white as primary color remains partly visible and together with the similarly white toned decor of the room, it surely elicits a very noble impression. It is proper to maintain that the result is an effect not yet achieved elsewhere. A decor like this will, I hope, make the iron acceptable with the further highly val- uable advantage of easy cleaning. \"* Besides the de-materialized iron, glass is the ultimate material of the hall. The covering uses translucent industrial glass, which lets light in and allows the support- ing structure to glitter through the roof. Wagner wanted to build a second protec- tive glass roof at the top of the building but due to the wishes of the client had to lower it immediately above the visible membrane roof of the hall. Wagner was \r",{"entities":[[246,253,"PER"],[1478,1484,"PER"],[1528,1538,"ARCH"],[1696,1715,"ARCH"],[1723,1742,"ARCH"]]}],["afraid of the unpleasant effects of these changes, in consequence of which he had to lower and simplify the profiles of the side aisles, to thicken the iron trusses in order to be able to carry the second roof which will take away the ... lightness and daintiness of the banking hall. * On both sides of the central nave, five columns bear the double-skin structure, running through the lower membrane of the roof. Not only the roof but also the floor is made of glass, which is surprising at first sight. Perhaps because of the unusual application of glass bricks, this is the only point where Wagner refers to spectacular examples from abroad. It is no accident that these examples are from Paris, which was for Wagner the center of modern life.' The pragmatic argument for the use of the glass bricks was their translucency, which allowed the workplaces below the hall to receive natural light. Nevertheless, the compositional role and aesthetic effects were at least as important, or even more so. The field of glass bricks is ordered in a raster of a thin solid framework made of white granite with black frames and stripes indicating the main direction. The conception seems to be similar to the description of carpets in Modern Archi- tecture. Within an elongated, bigger field, the bricks are always ordered in units of four pieces, with two different prismatic patterns. The thick translucent material refracts light and produces spectacular effects. Wagner also used glass for cladding the walls. Together with the marble panels below and the artificial marble plaster above, the glass panels create a sleek com- posite surface. The rationale is again functional: the cladding served to protect the walls from the doodles of the public or clerks who might be tempted to scribble their calculations on them. However, the intentions of the composition seem to go beyond these practicalities as the combined effect of the different kinds and uses of glass and their harmony with other materials and structures result in complex aes- thetic effects. Wagner was even keen on the newest, rarely used materials such as aluminum, which he sought to use abundantly for both functional and aesthetic purposes. Its silver-like, glittering appearance, together with its ease of cleaning and non-fading nature, made it suitable for noble and elegant features both outside and inside the building. Aluminum columns by the entrance support the canopy, which acts as a kind of prelude to the banking hall, signaling the difference between the building s solid structure and the modern iron-glass construction inside. The iron columns of the hall are clad in aluminum with geometric ornamentation. Wagner also used aluminum for the design of the ventilation and heating pipes, which number among the most original and inventive elements of the interior. Another new material was linoleum, invented in the middle of the nineteenth century, an inexpensive material for high use areas. He carefully focused on the protection of the heavily used parts of the floor. To avoid buckling and the danger of stumbling, the linoleum is inverted into the floor and, with the other materials, creates an even surface. Each material and form is repeated, transformed, connected, and contrasted with others. Wagner consciously avoided the use of vivid colors in his design. The colors in both public counter hall and work places is a combination of white, gray, silver, \r",{"entities":[[693,698,"LOC"],[3378,3390,"ARCH"]]}],["and black, expressing the economic, hygienic, and impersonal character of the institution and the Grofstadt. Nevertheless, in the central hall the palate is nobler, while in the workplaces it is much simpler an assembly of a kind of colorless colors. The glass floor and roof, the combination of glittering marble and glass panels on the walls, as well as the added marble plaster above them all add to the effects of light. In addition, the exterior walls in the courtyard above the hall are plastered in white majolica, the brightness of which further amplifies the reflections and demonstrates the conscious manner in which Wagner made his choice of materials and effects. Whereas from a functional point of view cleanness and clearness are the keywords, the harmony of materials and effects, of transparency and reflections and the rich modulations of light result in a sort of industrial sublime and monumentality. The banking hall seems to be float- ing in light, strengthened and contrasted even by the artificial light of the pure electric bulbs. Wagner designed the Postal Savings Bank as a Gesamtkunstwerk, an integral work of art encompassing both the building and its furniture from the smallest detail to the whole. The functional aspects, the employment of objects and rooms and their ease of care and durability were expressed by Wagner in the different forms of covering, cladding and fixings. Not only the marble plates but also the glass panels are fixed to the walls with bolts. The feet and other heavily used parts of the furniture are cov- ered with aluminum. The use of fixed bolts and heads as structural ornaments can be observed in various forms and at different scales, from the furniture and the inner walls to the facade. There is a certain duality or even ambiguity in this use of bolts or rivets, which partly act as real structural joints and partly as ornaments. The Synthesis Wagner's original intention was that a final integration of the solid and the ethereal, the outer and inner construction, would be achieved with an iron and glass dome on the top of the building above the courtyard. While this was rejected by the direc- tor because of economic and practical reasons, Wagner insisted on the absolutely necessary crowning element and formulated a new version as a pierced structure at the attic. It is set back from the facade line in a way that can be seen only froma certain distance. * Wagner called this solution Scheinarchitektur (illusionary archi- tecture) because it lost the immediate connection with the inner iron and glass structure and, therefore, the chance to clearly stress the modem, integrative char- acter of the building; that is, the structural and compositional unity of the exterior and interior. However, it can be argued that the final version is in line with Wagner's efforts to use high expressions of artistic feeling and monumental exal- 19 and with the deletion of almost any explicit historical or Secessionist elements during the planning process.

The AEG Turbine Factory in Berlin, designed by the architect Peter Behrens (1868-1940) in collaboration with the building engineer Karl Bernhard (1859-1937), represents a milestone in the development of modern industrial archi- tecture. Built in just a few months in 1909 in glass, iron, and concrete as an enor- mous modern industrial production space the largest iron construction in Berlin at the time, with an enclosed volume of around 150,000 cubic meters uninterrupted by internal supports today, more than a hundred years later, it still fulfills its orig- inal function, the assembly of large industrial turbines. The Turbine Factory has long been hailed as representing the integration of industrial building types and modern construction methods and materials into the tradition of architecture, and an artistic elevation of the modern workplace and the world of industry into the realm of culture. The Turbine Factory constitutes an attempt at reconciling the modern disciplines of architecture and engineering or, as Behrens would put it, creating a new unity between art and technology and one of its historical achieve- ments is that it marks a new beginning in artists and architects engagement with the sites and products of modern industry in the early twentieth century. The iconic status of the AEG Turbine Factory in the history of modern architec- ture is based to a large extent on the combined effect ofa seemingly open display of modern constructive principles in the 127 meter street front along Berlichingenstrafe, and the image ofits unadorned yet monumental main facade toward Huttenstrage. It simultaneously provides the public face ofa giant modern factory and represents the power of modern industry. Its earliest commentators recognized in this facade a fusion of the motifs of an upright hammer standing on its handle anda stylized tem- ple-front, soon earning the Turbine Factory the critical epithet of a temple of work. And indeed, the historical reinterpretation of architectural prototypes and their symbolic transference to modern functional buildings, or, to put it differ- ently, the integration of new building types and industrial products into the time- honored tradition of art, is a recurring theme in the oeuvre of Peter Behrens. The design of modern monuments that go beyond being purely functional buildings, but which contribute to the symbolic expression as well as the very creation of cul- tural values, remained a lasting concern for this seminal early twentieth-century architect, who also became a kind of artistic father figure for some of the most impor- tant proponents of the modern movement in architecture. Behrens quest to give artistic form to the driving forces of his own time without uncritically embracing technological progress as an end in itself, and to engage with architectural tradition without succumbing to formal historicism that is, his ambition to achieve a balance between the demands of modern civilization and the desire for its artistic elevation to the level of culture informs the design of the AEG Turbine Factory and accounts for its key role in the history of (not just industrial) modern architecture. \r",{"entities":[[96,115,"ARCH"],[119,125,"LOC"],[223,236,"PER"],[1005,1020,"ARCH"],[1121,1128,"PER"],[1406,1425,"ARCH"],[1613,1631,"LOC"],[1697,1710,"LOC"],[1990,2005,"ARCH"],[2354,2368,"PER"],[2761,2768,"PER"],[3172,3191,"ARCH"]]}],["The Architect Peter Behrens The artistic development of the painter, architect, and designer Peter Behrens is representative of many of the paramount concerns of artists and architects at the beginning of the twentieth century. His career reflects the move of many artists at the turn of the century away from a concern with high art to an engagement with Lebensreform (life reform)* and the idea of a reconciliation of Life and Art via a synthesis of the arts, an all-encompassing new design on the basis of architecture, to eventually transfer these concerns into the realm of industry. Further, his artistic activity was accompanied by theoretical reflection, in which the complex relation- ship between art and technology, as well as the role of architecture as the founda- tion of a modern Gesamtkunstwerk (total work of art) was debated. Behrens embraced the Romantic-idealist quest for a total work of art as an agent of socio-cultural change, an ideal force in the creation of a new culture. A great admirer of the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche since the early stages of his career, Behrens adhered throughout his life to a strong faith in the artist s role and power to embody the spiritual forces of his time and to create new values, as the ref- ormation of the world, in order to be able to bear living in it, is the driving force. ' Peter Behrens started his career as a painter before turning to the applied arts, became a major influence in the theatre as well as the garden reform movement, and, though never formally trained, would eventually be one of the most promi- nent architects of his time in Germany. The different phases of Peter Behrens work have variously been characterized as belonging to Jugendstil (art nouveau), geomet- ric abstraction, Sachlichkeit (objectivity), neoclassicism, and expressionism, but while there has been an overemphasis on the changes in Behrens work on such stylistic grounds, it is the conceptual continuities that run through the seemingly disparate periods of Behrens oeuvre over four decades that need to be stressed.\"\" Behrens artistic creed in the creation of a unity of art and life, the fusion of the world of spirit and matter by means of artistic form creation, is apparent from his early experiments in creating a spiritually uplifting environment as a member of the Darmstadt artists colony of 1901, where he designed his first house, to his engagement with geometric abstraction as head of the Diisseldorf Kunstgewer- beschule (Academy of Arts and Crafts) from 1903 to 1907,'? and, most prominently, his later work for industry, both before and after the First World War.\"* Behrens received some of the most prestigious architectural commissions of his time, from private villas and an embassy building to major factory complexes and modern company headquarters, but he is still most widely known for his work as artistic consultant for the Allgemeine Elektricit ts-Gesellschaft (AEG) in Berlin from 1907 to 1914, described by art historian Tilmann Buddensieg as probably the wid- est-ranging commission of modern times. * Behrens artistic task was gradually extended to designing everything from letterheads and advertising posters to electrical appliances, factory buildings and workers housing.

In his work for the AEG, Behrens created a total new corporate image for this general electrical concern, which was one of the most powerful indus- trial corporations in Germany at the beginning of the twentieth century. Andithas to be emphasized that the role of artistic design in the creation of a corporate identity, the function of a building like the Turbine Factory beyond its practical purpose to serve as a piece of advertising architecture, with the much-reproduced image of the Turbine Factory facade itself advancing to the level of a new logo for the AEG company, was to be expressive not just of economic superiority, but of the role of industry as a national force and driver of socio-political change. As Schwartz notes in this context: In the years before World War I, the trademark arose in Germany as a symbol of redemption. Soon Behrens work for the AEG was recognized as an embodiment of the ideals of the German Werkbund, which was founded in the same year, and whose agenda is summarized in the famous slogan to design everything from sofa cushions to town planning * to such an extent that the architectural his- torian Julius Posener even referred to Behrens as Mister Werkbund. ' Architecture and Industry in the Early Twentieth Century The question of how to negotiate the demands of art and industry was at the fore- front of architectural debates in the early twentieth century. While the English Arts and Crafts Movement was regarded as largely negative in its attitude toward mod- em machine-production and technology, in Germany, the critical discussions before World War I turned toward the integration of modern technology into the realm of artistic activity. Concerned not so much with the work s actual mode of production, but rather questions of good form, the German debates centered on the problem of how to arrive at a new style that was expressive of its time, while satisfying the demands of the artist and the industrialist and their respective clients. Behrens AEG Turbine Factory is regularly presented as the epitome of such a successful union as well as an icon of modernism. However, the AEG Turbine Factory can also serve as an illustration of some of the inherent ambigu- ities that characterize Behrens approach. The first building Behrens designed for the AEG was a small octagonal pavilion for the first German Shipbuilding Exhibition in Berlin (1908). This was an austere, two-story construction of 20 meters height and 18 meters diameter, in which mod- erm machines were displayed like religious artifacts or beautiful sculptures, thus forming part of an aesthetic advertising strategy that famously requested that an engine must look like a birthday present. The temporary nature of the exhi- bition pavilion makes considerations of structural durability of secondary impor- tance here, and it can serve instead as a model in which an architectural idea is \r",{"entities":[[356,363,"LOC"],[543,558,"ARCH"],[675,690,"ARCH"],[907,915,"PER"],[995,1002,"LOC"],[1056,1059,"ARCH"],[1330,1344,"PER"],[1362,1369,"PER"],[2191,2210,"ARCH"],[2322,2341,"ARCH"],[2494,2497,"ARCH"],[2550,2583,"LOC"]]}],["given form, with the building itself becoming an exhibit, a piece of advertising art that combines aesthetic and economic interests, as well as providing an artistic manifesto that can throw some light on Behrens larger ambitions as an architect for industry. Housing some of the most modern and technologically advanced pro- ducts of its time, the design of Behrens AEG pavilion, the iconographic program of the architecture, and its interior, hardly suggests a prosaic presentation of these emblems of a new spirit of objectivity. If the transference of religious prototypes for the exhibition of art had become culturally acceptable in the nineteenth cen- tury, Behrens now uses one of the great European prototypes of religious architec- ture, aform reminiscent of, for example, the Baptistery in Florence, for the purpose of displaying industrial goods. In the Berlin exhibition, the octagon the eight refer- ring symbolically to the beginning of a new cycle, resurrection, a new life, unity, and eternity was oriented westward toward the main exhibition halls, which at night were illuminated by an arcade of thousands of electrical light bulbs. Behrens defined the combination of art and industry as the source of a new culture. In the AEG baptistery, water as the traditional symbol of a new life is replaced by the new power of electricity, and a large, octagonal, electrical chandelier surmounts the space in which the products are laid out, with the memorial address to the firm s 25th anniversary designed and exhibited like a medieval illuminated manu- script. On the exterior, the pavilion bears the new logo that Behrens designed for the company: the hexagonal pattern with the trinity of the letters A E G in a hon- eycomb arrangement, which later also features prominently in the gable on the facade of the Turbine Factory. A contemporary critic wrote: One calls for the Art- ist, so that out of the noise of work he can extract the great rhythms, so that he can seize the hidden organ tones and amplify them toward hymns, toward the conse- cration of the house, and this hymn to the house, to the AEG, became the eulogy of industrial culture in the monumental Turbine Factory. The AEG Turbine Factory is situated at the south-east corner of the old AEG factory site in the Moabit district of Berlin, at the corner of Huttenstrafe and Berlichingenstrage. Its monumental ochre-yellow facade with green iron bands accentuating the corners and a large central iron-glass window construction underneath a massive gable or pediment with the inscription Turbinenhalle and the hexagonal AEG logo in the tympanon still dominates the street-view. * The enormous dimensions required for this modern factory hall and the specific technical requirements for a light and spacious, efficient, and highly durable mod- ern production space, which had to accommodate a complex arrangement of large movable cranes with a lifting capacity of 100 tons, led to a collaboration of Behrens with the experienced engineer Karl Bernhard. While Bernhard s expertise was to make up for Behrens lack of technical and engineering training and experience, it was Behrens who clearly dominated in decisions concerning the overall design and its symbolic program.* The Turbine Factory consists of the main hall with a projected length of 207 meters (127 meters were realized in the first stage in 1909), approximately 25 meters high and 25.60 meters wide, \r",{"entities":[[205,212,"PER"],[367,379,"ARCH"],[1243,1246,"ARCH"],[2178,2194,"ARCH"],[2199,2218,"ARCH"],[2267,2278,"ARCH"],[2291,2316,"LOC"],[2335,2347,"LOC"],[2352,2371,"LOC"]]}],["with a long pitched skylight for light and ventilation on the roof, and a smaller flanking two-story side-hall with a basement to accommodate storage and sec- ondary manufacturing operations, which is also slightly set back from Huttenstrafe to give maximum impact to the main facade. Karl Bernhard s structural design for the main hall was based ona series of asym- metrical three-hinged arches with tie-rods, * and the way the structural elements are given artistic form on the outside of the building reveals the creative differences between the artist and the engineer: the constructive rationality of the side of the lower hall toward the factory yard which has also been linked to Mies van der Rohe, who worked in Behrens office at this time? stands in marked contrast to the street-front toward Berlichingenstrafe with its symbolic emphasis of the hall s constructive principles. The tectonic display of structural elements is intensified here by an aesthetic enhancement of the vertical metal members on the outside, lending them a greater visual solidity and mass, to create a dynamic image of a modern load-carrying structure. This effect is further enhanced by the 14.40 meter- high tinted glass walls, which alternate with the green iron trusses and incline toward the top so that the roof overhangs them by nearly two meters, resulting in a strong relief-like effect with the beam at the cornice suggestive of a classical entablature. The vertical iron members thus appear in a rhythmic sequence at 9.22-meter intervals as abstract, inverted classical columns or pillars which narrow toward the base and resolve in the striking detail of the lower hinges just above the concrete pedestal. The total visual impact of these features creates for Behrens the desired effect of a new, de-historicized classicism that is expressive of the essence of the modern machine-age.* Poetry and Truth in Modern Architecture As a straightforward formal exposure of a modern factory construction in glass and iron was out of the question for Behrens, because he aspired to an elevation of these materials and new forms into the tradition of architecture, he repeatedly emphasized the aesthetic need to achieve a sense of corporeality for the building, which is to act as a spatial enclosure, not its unveiling. This ambition comes most fully to the fore in the design of the main facade, with its 14.40 meter-high vertical plane of the iron-glass window in the center and the giant polygonal gable, but particularly its most strongly debated aspect: the visually massive rounded corners or pylons, which are executed in a thin layer of concrete and accentuated with hor- izontal iron bands. This corner treatment does not just lend a much-debated heavy monumentality and association with Egyptian temples to the building s public face, it has also given rise to fierce controversy over the aesthetic honesty of a design that has the appearance of a load-bearing masonry construction when in fact it is mere concrete infill.** It was not just the engineer Bernhard who voiced his dis- pleasure with this artistic solution; * the tenor of the critique can be summed \r",{"entities":[[285,298,"PER"],[687,704,"PER"],[802,820,"LOC"]]}],["up in Mies van der Rohe s later notebook entry that people who build factories like temples lie. ** The question of what constitutes artistic honesty is, of course, as central to the architectural debates of the time as it is complex. Behrens artistic maxim from his early involvement with the artists colony in Darmstadt had been that we want to be elevated, not deceived, that is, he proposed a view of art as providing a beautiful illusion that contains its own (higher) truth. For Behrens, an aesthetic lie might thus have consisted in not attempting to give the building a representative form that takes it beyond the display of constructive rationality, which would instead be seen as an all too literal and narrow, if not to say naive or even primitive notion of truth. Behrens explicitly rejected as a pseudo-aesthetic the idea of a beautiful form that arises directly from the laws of mechanical construction, for just as nature is not culture, the mere fulfillment of purpose and material intentions cannot create it either, and he repeatedly emphasized that genuine artistic form can only be derived from an orientation toward psychological or spiritual, not just material pur- poses and functions. If even the Berlichingenstrafe front of the AEG Turbine Fac- tory has to be understood as a direct display of both constructive principles and their aesthetic elevation, then its temple-like main facade most clearly demonstrates the primacy of artistic form over the logic of construction. Far from exhibiting a modernist will to functional directness or espousing a narrow echnical and in any case highly mythical functionalist ethos, it was precisely he desire to negotiate the technical demands of a modern industrial production space with the representative function of the factory building as a monument of its time that proved to be Behrens guiding concern. While it is clearly true that a formal allusion to classical temple fronts is intended, Behrens can hardly be accused of mere historicist disguise in this facade. Comparing the reduced formal- ism of Behrens Turbine Factory with most older factory buildings makes it clear that he goes beyond both the historicist facade treatments of earlier architect- designed examples, as well as the engineer-designed solutions to industrial produc- tion sites that aim to follow only the dictates of technical functionality. The artist whose work became more closely identified with the creation ofa new Industriekultur (industrial culture) than any other in his time, whose work was iden- tified with the AEG to such an extent that Behrens style and the AEG s style became synonymous, fervently rejected any mere Verkunstung (artistic surface dec- oration) of the products of industry. At the same time, he never dispensed with the idealist agenda of an architecture as Denkmal (monument). Behrens is an architect who frequently appears to subordinate function, material, and technique in his buildings for the sake of the expression of what he sees as a higher historical truth. In the famous Turbine Factory facade, ideas concerning form and symbolism over- whelmingly dictate the physical solution. Behrens inversion of classical form for this show-front of the AEG factory complex marks a new though perhaps not altogether whole-hearted endorsement of the power of modern industrial civili- zation. The evolution of monumental art has always been an expression of the t t \r",{"entities":[[6,23,"PER"],[312,321,"LOC"],[1254,1275,"ARCH"],[2082,2097,"ARCH"],[2618,2621,"ARCH"],[2834,2841,"ARCH"],[3058,3080,"ARCH"],[3229,3240,"ARCH"]]}],["concentration of power: if one can speak of the art of the Church in the Middle Ages; in the Baroque era of the art of the kings; of bourgeois art in the styles around 1800; then I believe that today our flourishing industry again forms a concentration of power which cannot remain without influence on the development of culture, states the most sought-after German architect of his time. It is Behrens determi- nation to go beyond utility in his will to monumentalize his culture s driving forces that subsequent generations have come to regard as both the strength and weak- ness of this building and its design ethos. Behrens solution can be seen as an attempt at mediation to lend dignity and meaning to the products of our material culture in an age of rapidly changing technological and socio-political conditions, without succumbing either to cultural pessimism or the uncritical embrace of tech- nological progress and the facade of the AEG Turbine Factory remains a mon- ument to such an attempt at historical synthesis, an enlightened vision that occupies a splendid and sometimes slippery middle ground between formal and ideological extremes. Behrens has been lauded as one of the earliest exponents of industrial design and one of the first artists to engage in creating what is now called corporate identity by means of a unified design program. However, Behrens also holds the curious position of being the first artist to devote special care to the beauty of form of peculiarly modern industrial products in terms of some larger cultural conception external to the immediate processes of production and use. ** Even during his AEG period, it has been argued, Behrens call for a unity of art and technology never meant identification or equality, but always a spiritual elevation of technology (the factory) to the level of art (the temple). Behrens takes the idea of the Gesamt- kunstwerk from the nineteenth-century theater to the turn-of-the-century villa and then to the modern factory as cult building. The program for a spiritual elevation of man through the contemplation of ideal form is transferred from the idealist thea- tre as moral institution (Friedrich Schiller), which had already informed the aes- thetic program of Behrens much-admired artistic forbear, the great nineteenth- century Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel (1781-1841) and his artistic pro- gram for a transformation of the modern city into a Kulturlandschaft, to the show front of the new power of industry. The facade of the Turbine Factory, proudly orientated toward the south-east, the center of Berlin, elevates the industrial eve- ryday into a meaningful manifestation of the spirit of the age, an expression of the Kunstwollen of the modern era, while expanding the notion of culture into the realm of modern production. But there is an even greater subtlety in the design of Behrens monumental Turbine Factory facade than it has yet been given credit for, and what is usually read as a straightforward elevation of the factory to the level of the temple is perhaps still more ambiguous than it seems. Friedrich Nietzsche had described his own philosophy as inverted Platonism, the appearance, the illusion, is the aim, * and we might also recognize this sentiment in the AEG Turbine Factory facade. The ambivalence here lies in Behrens putting forward a design that does \r",{"entities":[[946,965,"ARCH"],[1644,1647,"ARCH"],[2531,2546,"ARCH"],[2906,2921,"ARCH"],[3113,3132,"PER"],[3283,3302,"ARCH"]]}],["not so much imitate a temple front but instead inverts its very principles: the pro- truding gable is supported by the central window opening, while the seemingly load-bearing elements, the gently inclined concrete pylons at the corner, serve a purely aesthetic purpose. The Nietzsche-inspired architect Behrens, it seems, had absorbed and applied the lessons of the master s observations concerning Truth and lie in the extra-moral sense: [that all] truths are illusions that have been forgotten as suc A Nietzschean contention that all truth is created, that there is no one truth but only a multitude of different perspectives, can also be observed in the artistic treatment of the different sides of the Turbine Factory, culminating in its famous main facade, which presents an architecture of the asif. ** Instead of either celebrating the Turbine Factory as a temple of work, or condemning the design by perpetuating a moralistic reading of it as a structurally dishonest and/or ideologically questionable attermpt to make a fac- tory look like a sacred building, perhaps we should interpret Behrens AEG Tur- bine Factory design as an expression of a new and altogether different historical truth: that the truth is not what it seems; that a revaluation of all values, a Copernican turn has taken place; and that the modern world and industrial reality are turning classical culture on its head. The influence of Behrens and his oeuvre on the younger generation of architects we associate with the modern movement is unquestionable. Even where they con- ceived of their creations as antidotes to the precedents set by Behrens - whom they credited with having brought the industrial building into the realm of art, but cri- ticized for not having gone far enough in exploring the creative potential of the new materials and constructive principles a building like the AEG Turbine Factory set the standard and became the critical reference-point for subsequent architect- designed industrial buildings. This is clearly the case with the famous Fagus shoe-last factory of 1911 by Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer in Alfeld, another seminal modern industrial building of the pre-war period in Germany. It has been convincingly argued by Posener that the main building of the Fagus factory can be read as an architectural counter-demonstration or revision of Behrens AEG Tur- bine Factory, with Gropius and Meyer, who had both worked in the office of Beh- rens at the time of the Turbine Factory design, taking an antithetically dependent stand here against Behrens. Gropius and Meyer, suggests Posener, corrected Behrens design by inversion: where Behrens had created solid and accentuated corner sections, to give but one example, Gropius and Meyer designed fully glazed corners without visible supports, although they were, it has to be emphasized, no more structurally true than Behrens solution.** However, where Behrens was seen by critics as putting too much emphasis on weight, mass, pathos, and mon- umentality, the main Fagus building was characterized by a visual lightness that avoided overtly symbolic gestures, making it one of the key buildings of the Inter- national Style.

But it is also the deep seriousness of his very attempt to negotiate between the demands of the time and the people that made Behrens work both an inspiration and challenge for successive generations of architects. Where Mies van der Rohe later credited Behrens with having taught him the great form, he also carried on his quest for a gestaltend engagement with the essence of his time.** The continuity of the idealist tradition in the mod- erm notion of Formgestaltung for the protagonists of the Neues Bauen is further attested in, for example, Walter Curt Behrendt s The Victory of the New Building Style (1927). In the early twentieth century, Formgestaltung assumes the status of a quasi-metaphysical activity, and whether they embrace or reject the idealist notions of art and style, the quest for the right Form and Gestaltung becomes the driving force even for those modernists who criticized the particular formal solutions in Behrens work. And while we have rightly become wary of the Hege- lian teleological conception of history and its notion of Zeitgeist, suspicious of promises or even offers of cultural redemption through art and/or technol- ogy, the legacy of the artistic struggles and achievements of early twentieth- century architecture, of which the AEG Turbine Factory by Peter Behrens is a prime example, continues to inform the debate and serve as a point of departure in the search for an architecture of our time. * Notes Image credit: Tony Bryant, 2014. 1.

We use the term iron here in accordance with Behrens and Bernhard s own use, as well as the general terminology of the time, for as Prokop has pointed out, even though the material Flufeisen is similar in its physical properties to modem steels, in the German-speaking world it was referred to as iron until about 1925, while in the rest of Europe and America the term steel was in use earlier.

The Turbine Factory now belongs to the Siemens Corporation and is used for the pro- duction of gas turbines. 4. Comparing the AEG Turbine Factory with earlier architects work on industrial build- ings, one notes that these often display a Romantic-historicist formal leaning toward, for example, brick-clad medieval fortifications, and that, generally speaking, an artistic dec- oration of the body of the building seems to be aimed at, instead of a derivation of the form from the building s use.

Part of the prestige of the Glass House rests upon the renown of the man who designed it, Bruno Taut (1880-1938), an architect with a particularly ambitious vision for the future of architecture. Yet Taut s reputation derives in no small degree from the Glass House itself an early work of his career and the high place it continues to hold in the history of modern architecture. The most obvious and exceptional fact about the Glass House is implied in its seemingly lapidary name. The Glass House is the first among the many buildings known simply by the material with which it was built, an attribute also given, for example, to houses by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson. This is even more noteworthy as considerable parts of what made Taut s Glass House buildable were not actually made of glass, a fact keenly emphasized by the architect himself, who called it my Glass House, the lightest possible concrete structure. While the building s reinforced concrete construction, particularly its highly complex polyhedral lamellar dome structure, was a technical masterpiece in and of itself, and in respect to its engineering ingenuity more than equal to the application of the various kinds of glass, it is nonetheless the use of glass that led to this building becoming one of the most iconic structures of twentieth-century modernism. Self- aware of its importance, one of the mottoes Taut incised into the concrete of the Glass House was Das Glas bringt uns die neue Zeit - Backsteinkultur tut uns nur leid. He had invited the poet Paul Scheerbart to provide aphorisms to be incor- porated into the building and Scheerbart supplied Taut with 16, of which six were eventually used.* A Strange Building at the Werkbund Exhibition The Glass House was part of the first Deutsche Werkbund-Ausstellung held in Cologne in 1914. The Deutscher Werkbund, a German association of artists, archi- tects, designers, and industrialists, organized the exhibition in Cologne with the initial purpose of establishing a partnership between product manufacturers and design professionals that would improve the competitiveness of German compa- nies on the global market. As Frederic Schwartz explains in his work on the Werk- bund, the organization was formed around 1907 to facilitate cooperation between producers, tradesmen, and art professionals. Schwarz writes: It drew support from groups within and outside of government who saw the artistic reform of German production and trade as a source of national prestige and economic prosperity; and it spoke also to the many groups, so characteristic of Wilhelmine Germany, who furthered cultural reform of all kinds. * Thus, the Werkbund was as much an art and manufacturing collaborative as a state-sponsored program intended to inte- grate traditional crafts and industrial mass-production techniques, in order to put Germany on a competitive footing with Great Britain and the United States. \r",{"entities":[[4,12,"ARCH"],[86,97,"ARCH"],[148,158,"PER"],[258,262,"PER"],[312,323,"ARCH"],[486,497,"ARCH"],[545,556,"ARCH"],[700,724,"PER"],[729,744,"PER"],[816,827,"ARCH"],[939,950,"ARCH"],[1459,1463,"PER"],[1497,1508,"ARCH"],[1687,1697,"PER"],[1707,1711,"PER"],[1807,1818,"ARCH"],[1879,1886,"LOC"],[2026,2033,"LOC"],[2230,2247,"PER"],[2407,2414,"PER"],[2671,2678,"LOC"],[2927,2934,"LOC"],[2965,2978,"LOC"],[2987,3000,"LOC"]]}],["The exhibition was held at the Rheinpark, a large open green area opposite Cologne s city center.

The luxurious sum of five million Goldmarks was spent on the event. Planning began in earnest in 1912, but construction work started only in early 1914. The exhibition was opened to the public on May 15, 1914, with the construction of the Glass House still incomplete.

It was as if the earth had miraculously opened, releasing a building s base made of concrete that arched upward with a soft curvature in a shape not unlike the utopian and enormous mega-structure rising out of the Alps that Taut later drew in Alpine Architecture. Obviously the Cologne site was not Alpine, yet a row of large mirrored glass spheres suggested that these spheres, too, were brought up from the underworld to the light; that an eruption had come to an inadvertent stop where the globes found their ultimate position all of this the result of mighty geological forces at play. Rising immediately from the bulge-like concrete ring was a tambour frame, sup- ported by slim concrete pillars, with partial glass insets in the configuration of a 14- sided prism. A gently curved and slightly pinnacled rhomboid cupola was built on top of the tambour. The glass facets of the cupola, with their mirroring surface, took on a greenish-yellowish coloration in bad weather. Somewhat unhappily, this appearance gave rise to one of the building s nicknames, Spargelkopf, meaning asparagus tip. In clear weather, though, the glass facets mirrored the crystalline transparency of ether, as well as the lively movements of clouds, the play of the wind with the leaves of the adjacent trees, and, sometimes, the fleeting reflection ofan airplane. At night-time, the body of the building illuminated with thousands of watts from the interior was transformed into a sparkling and radiating jewel a designation one assumes Taut would have preferred. The circumstances of how the Glass House became a part of the Werkbund exhibition are unclear. It was not part of the original building program for the exhibition. As a consequence, Taut did not receive an actual building commission from the exhibition s board of directors but was assigned a specific location on the terrain of the exhibition area, not unlike other manufacturer-sponsored pavilions. This meant also that the office of the exhibition organizers did not carry the build- ing cost. Rather, what became the Glass House was given a small financial allow- ance that covered only a fraction of the expenses. Despite the meager support, Taut valued these concessions because they afforded him a venue for his Glass House, a building he had drawn up previously, long before he hoped for \r",{"entities":[[31,40,"LOC"],[75,82,"LOC"],[136,141,"LOC"],[175,191,"ARCH"],[361,376,"PER"],[732,743,"ARCH"],[941,952,"ARCH"],[1230,1234,"LOC"],[1240,1244,"PER"],[1294,1301,"LOC"],[3279,3290,"ARCH"]]}],["participation in the exhibition. While Taut did not yet have the renomm e to be awarded an outright commission for one of the major exhibition buildings, he did receive support from Karl Ernst Osthaus, a vehement but isolated advocate of the most recent artistic avant-garde movements among the board of directors of the exhibition. Taut also received backing from his former professor, Theodor Fischer, the architect of the main hall of the exhibition. Taut s reputation among leading architects had grown on the basis of two noted exhibition pavilions he had built: the Trager-Verkaufskontor in Berlin (1910) and his Monument des Eisens in Leipzig (1913).\" The Glass House was not, however, a typical fit in the ensemble of manufacturer-sponsored pavilions. There was no single company or industrial association for example, the association for glass manufacturers that commissioned the building as its exhibition pavilion. Rather, Taut himself acted as owner, with all the associated risks and obligations that came with ownership. The requisition for in-kind donations for materials and other services, as well as partial financial support for the Glass House, was Taut s responsibility. Because he was only modestly successful on these fronts, Taut faced the painful conse- quences of being the work s main sponsor: 20,000 Goldmarks out of his own pocket. Therefore, the Glass House was partly a Werkbund building, partly an advertisement pavilion for the glass manufacturing industry, and, largely, Taut s very own house in glass.'' Ownership and all that it cost was the price to be paid for the absolute artistic liberty that Taut enjoyed. However, paying for his own building would not be the last insult that Taut had to endure for his archi- tectural vision. In July of 1916, in the middle of World War I, he received a letter from the Cologne City Administration demanding that he, the building s owner, take responsibility for the demolition of the remaining concrete skeleton, now a relic of the former jewel of the exhibition, at an estimated cost of a further 5,000 Reichsmark. Osthaus unconventional proposal to use the Glass House as a training object for test blasting techniques by the engineering battalion that now occupied the former exhibition area was denied by the commanding officer and Taut was stuck with the financial obligations for the demolition of his own masterpiece. While the architectural merit of Taut s building was recognized even before the construction was finished, the ownership status and the subsequent financial diffi- culties caused the Glass House to be incorporated into the planning of the exhibi- tion at a very late date. Approval for the project was secured only four months before the planned opening of the exhibition. Construction began around mid-Feb- ruary. According to Taut s own report, the complex concrete structure was erected in a mere five weeks in March. Despite the swift speed of construction, the Glass House was not on course to be completed for the official exhibition opening. Paul Westheim reported in a preview published in the K lner Tagblatt four weeks before the opening date of the exhibition that one of the artistically very interesting buildings, referring to Taut s Glass House, was unfortunately not completed \r",{"entities":[[39,43,"PER"],[182,200,"PER"],[333,337,"PER"],[387,402,"PER"],[454,458,"PER"],[572,593,"ARCH"],[597,603,"LOC"],[619,638,"ARCH"],[642,649,"LOC"],[663,674,"ARCH"],[1152,1163,"ARCH"],[1376,1387,"ARCH"],[1847,1859,"LOC"],[2094,2101,"PER"],[2137,2148,"ARCH"],[2831,2835,"PER"],[2969,2980,"LOC"],[3112,3120,"PER"],[3251,3262,"LOC"]]}],["beyond the early stages. '* It was only during the first week of July, for the event of the 7 Annual Convention of the Werkbund held in Cologne, that the Glass House was fully realized. As the war began on August 4 and the exhibition closed prematurely the next day, we can surmise that the Glass House was on display for no more than one month. Given the project s late entry into the exhibition planning process, it is no sur- prise that the site on which the building came to stand was also peculiar. The core area of the exhibition, which included the Haupthalle by Theodor Fischer, the Fest- halle by Peter Behrens, the so-called Osterreichisches Haus by Josef Hoffmann, the Werkbund theater by Henry van de Velde, the model factory and office building by Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer, and an exhibition building devoted to paint by Hermann Muthesius, was about 600 meters or more than a third of a mile away from the site of the Glass House. While it stood far away from the main buildings, Taut s pavilion did, however, receive a constant flow of pedestrians and visitors because it was situated imme- diately behind the entrance gate and main ticket stand. The visitors arrived either by the public light rail lines, for which a station was built at the entrance gate of the exhibition, or by other vehicular means. Once there, they would pass the entrance gate and see the Glass House as the exhibition s very first building. It stood at the beginning of a slightly bent, elongated approach of about 300 meters, which led toward the portal building that served as the ceremonial entrance to the core of the exhibition. The result of the building s position was that visitors were able to see, and most likely visit, what became one of the main attractions of the entire exhibition, the Glass House, long before they approached the central build- ings. While the Glass House was one of the earliest impressions of any visitor to the exhibition, it also stood at the margins of the exhibition, which was further emphasized by the fact that the ground on which the visitors would have walked toward and around the Glass House was muddy on rainy days and dusty on sunny days.\" Another ultimately telling peculiarity of the site was the fact that the Glass House stood close to the new amusement park. The Werkbund was forced to accept the presence of an amusement park on the grounds of its exhibition because of the financial benefits it would bring to the entire endeavor. Its proximity to the Glass House is noteworthy, for Taut s pavilion was the only one in the exhibition that seemed to embrace themes of movement and dynamism, topics that were viv- idly on display in the amusement park. These themes had, of course, already pene- trated the discourse of modern architecture, particularly the artistic and architectural circles of the Italian Futurists, for whom movement, and its engine, modern technology, were keys to the modern world. It was not only Filippo Tom- maso Marinetti, however, who pointed to the increasing mechanization of modern life. In fact, the electrification and automation of daily life was well underway by this time. Venues such as the world s fairs in Paris (1900) and St. Louis (1904) had made ample use of these new possibilities. Yet, little of this existed on the Cologne \r",{"entities":[[136,143,"LOC"],[154,165,"ARCH"],[291,302,"ARCH"],[570,585,"PER"],[606,619,"PER"],[660,674,"PER"],[700,718,"PER"],[761,775,"PER"],[780,791,"PER"],[840,857,"PER"],[937,949,"ARCH"],[999,1003,"PER"],[1384,1395,"ARCH"],[1797,1808,"ARCH"],[1873,1884,"ARCH"],[2122,2133,"ARCH"],[2257,2268,"ARCH"],[2503,2514,"ARCH"],[2534,2538,"PER"],[2969,2986,"PER"],[3193,3198,"LOC"],[3210,3219,"LOC"],[3309,3316,"LOC"]]}]]}
