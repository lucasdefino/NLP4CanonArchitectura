I waited a decade for its logical and neces- sary sequel, The Anticlassical Language of Architecture or, rather, The Modern Language of Architecture, but neither Sum- merson nor anyone else wrote it. Why not? One can imagine a host of daunting reasons. Nevertheless the gap needs filling. It is the most urgent task facing architectural history and criticism today. It cannot be postponed, it is already long overdue. Without a language, we cannot speak. What is more, it is lan- ~ guage that speaks us, in the sense that it provides the instru- ments of communication without which it would be impossible even to work out our thoughts. Yet in the course of centuries only one architectural language has been codified, that of classi- cism. None other has been processed and put into the systematic form required of an acknowledged language. All were considered exceptions to the rule, the classical rule, and not alternatives to it, with a life of their own. Even modern architecture, which emerged in reaction against neoclassicism, runs the risk of revert- ing to stale Beaux-Arts archetypes unless it is structured into a language. This is an incredible and absurd situation. We are squandering a colossal heritage of expression because we shirk the responsibil- ity of transcribing it and making it transmissible. It may not be very long before we forget how to speak architecture at all. Indeed, most people who are designing and building today can barely mumble. They utter inarticulate meaningless sounds that carry no message. They do not know how to speak. They say nothing and have nothing to say. There is an even more serious danger facing us. If the modern movement is ever jettisoned, we may - \r",{"entities":[[44,58,"PER"]]}],["no longer be able to read the images of any architects who have spoken a language other than classicism: the images of the Stone Age, late antiquity and the Middle Ages, the works of the Man- nerists, Michelangelo, Borromini, the Arts and Crafts movement and Art Nouveau, Wright, Loos, Le Corbusier, Gropius, Mies, Aalto, Scharoun, and the younger men from Johansen to Safdie. Nobody uses the classical orders today. But classicism is a state of mind that goes beyond the orders and stultifies even those discourses which are uttered using anticlassical nouns and verbs. The Beaux-Arts system actually codified Gothic, then Roman- esque, Baroque, Egyptian, Japanese, and finally modern architec- ture by a very simple expedient: it put them on ice by classicizing their free structure. Surely, if it should prove impossible to formu- late the modern idiom in truly dynamic fashion, it would go the same suicidal way, which is what more than one wretched critic and/or architect wishes would happen. It is therefore essential that we try to codify the modern lan- guage at once, without looking for a priori solutions to all the theoretical problems involved. Abstract theories are often an alibi for further delays. Dozens of books and hundreds of essays have discussed the question of whether or not architecture can be treated as a language, whether nonverbal languages have a double articulation (or dual patterning), and whether the attempt at codi- fying modern architecture might not block its development. Se- miology is certainly essential, but by itself it cannot solve architec- tural problems. For better or worse, architects communicate. And the fact remains that they speak architecture, whether it is a language or not. Thus we must set down precisely what it implies to speak architecture in an anticlassical key. If we can do this, the theoretical apparatus will come by itself as we proceed with our work. There are thousands of architects and students of architecture designing, without knowing the vocabulary, the grammar, and the syntax of the contemporary language, which are, in fact, a kind of antivocabulary, antigrammar, and antisyntax in relation to classicism. Critical judgments are being made on two levels, in the profession and in the schools. But what standards are used? And are they legitimate? This is the challenge that faces us, both as producers and as consumers of architecture. If we are going to understand one another, we must use the same terms and agree on their meaning. The problem seems enormous only be- cause it has been so little investigated until now. Ours is an intentionally provocative goal: to establish a series of invariables in the modern language of architecture, based on the most significant and challenging buildings. A question might arise. Some code is indispensable in verbal communication; otherwise there is a danger of not communicating at all. In archi- tecture, however, anyone can dispense with it at will, without having to give up building for this reason. Of course, he can design even in Babylonian style if he wants to, but all he can communicate are his own neuroses. I have discussed the question of architectural language with scholars, practicing architects, and most often with anxious and confused students, quite bewildered by the fact that nobody teaches them an idiom they can speak. A single conclusion came out of these conversations: although there are excellent excuses for not facing such a difficult and painful problem, the present impasse must be overcome and a beginning made. This book is even shorter than Summerson s. Only seven invari- ables are analyzed. One could add ten more, or twenty, or fifty, so long as they do not contradict the first seven. The validity of this approach must be tested on the drawing board and on real buildings. Everyone can set about checking this basic lan- guage. And it should come as no surprise that, out of a hundred buildings erected nowadays, ninety prove to be altogether anach- ronistic works that belong somewhere between the Renaissance and Beaux-Arts, while eight have some incoherent elements of modern style, and, in the best of circumstances, maybe two are merely ungrammatical, that is to say, they do not speak the old language, but neither do they speak the new one. And that is not all. Even the great masters of the modern movement have sometimes produced regressive classicist works. Thus one cannot help asking, what kind of language is this, if no one or very few people can speak it? Let me answer with another question: how could the modern language of architecture be widely spoken without a code? \r",{"entities":[[201,213,"PER"],[215,224,"PER"],[272,278,"PER"],[280,284,"PER"],[286,298,"PER"],[300,307,"PER"],[309,313,"PER"],[315,320,"PER"],[322,330,"PER"],[357,365,"PER"],[369,376,"PER"],[3603,3612,"PER"]]}],["These pages have the same goal as any other heretical act: to arouse dissent.

Listing marks the ethical and operational dividing line between those who speak in modern terms and those who chew on dead languages. Every error, every involution, every psycho- logical lapse and mental block at the drawing table can be traced back, without exception, to a failure to respect this principle. Therefore it is the basic invariable of the contemporary code. Implicit in listing, or compiling an inventory of functions, is the dismantling and critical rejection of classical rules, orders, a priori assumptions, set phrases, and conventions of every type and kind. The inventory springs from an act of cultural annihila- tion what Roland Barthes calls the zero degree of writing and leads to a rejection of all traditional norms and canons. It demands a new beginning, as if no linguistic system had ever existed before, as if it were the first time in history that we had to build a house or a city. The list is an ethical principle even before it becomes an opera- tional one. Indeed, with tremendous effort and immense joy, we must strip away the cultural taboos we have inherited. We must track them down one by one in our minds and desanctify them. For the modern architect, the paralyzing taboos are dogmas, con- ventions, inertia, all the dead weight accumulated during centuries of classicism. By destroying every institutionalized model, he can break free from idolatry. He can reconstruct and relive the whole process of man s formation and development, realizing that more than once in the course of the millennia, architects have wiped \r",{"entities":[[288,294,"PER"],[651,665,"PER"],[1779,1793,"PER"]]}],["the slate clean and erased every grammatical and syntactical rule. In fact. genuinely creative spirits have always started from scratch. The modern revolution is not unprecedented or apocalyptic. There has been a recurrent struggle against repressive bonds throughout the ages. Listing. going back to the zero degree, makes you rethink archi- tectural semantics. In the beginning, verbs and conjunctions must be eliminated. Words can no longer be used unless their content and meaning have been analyzed in depth. Some examples will get us to the heart of this methodology of design. Windows. In the classical tradition a module is selected for the openings of a Renaissance or pseudo-Renaissance building. Then the sequence of modules is examined, along with the rela- tionship between full and empty surface areas. Finally, the hori- zontal and vertical alignments, that is, the superimposition of the orders. are established. Fortunately the modern architect is tree of these formalistic concerns. He is engaged in a more complex and rewarding task of resemanticization. First of all, no repetitive modules. Every window is a word that stands for itself, what it means and what it does. It is not something to be aligned or proportioned It may be any shape rectangular, square, round, elliptical, triangular, composite, or free profile. Depending on the room it must light, the window may be anything from a long narrow strip at ceiling or floor level to a cut in the wall or a running band at eve level: whatever may be desired or considered suitable after calculating the specific window s function room by room. There is no reason why every window in a building should be just like the next one and not have a character of its own. Onee vou get rid of the tvranny of classicism, windows will be all the more effective if they are different and can convey a host Of Messages. Classicism breaks the facade into vertical and horizontal sec- tions But eliminating the juxtaposition and superimposition of modules will make the facade whole again. What is far more important. the facade will become antoisted. When the openings high or low. straight or crooked are no longer regulated by axial relationships, the facade will cease to be closed and aloof, an end in itself, and begin talking to its surroundings. It will stop 2. The methodology of listing functions, applied to windows. Classicism, whether old classicism (above) or the pseudomodern (center), is concerned with the module, its repetition, the relationship between full and empty spaces, and alignment. It is concerned with everything except windows. Listing gives back to every element its specific meaning /below/ and then assembles the various elements. \r",{"entities":[]}],["being extraneous and hostile and start taking an active part in the citv or landscape. Windows are not an appropriate example in discussing modern architecture because, as we will see later, the principle of func- tional listing precludes the very idea of facade. Nevertheless, when an architect works in urban fabrics conceived according to preordained schemes and volumes, he is forced to design fa- cades But that is no reason to give up the modern language. The minute he differentiates windows by form and position, he has done away with the traditional facade and its classical conno- tations. Indeed, he can inject new life into it by making some windows protrude and others recede, by playing with the thick- ness of the wall to create a frame of shadow around the glass or, an the contrary, to bring the glass forward into the blaze of light. And why not slant the windows to the surface of the facade? One window can tilt down, focusing on a square, a tree, or a dvorway across the street. Another can turn up, framing a piece of sky. A window can be slanted left or right to catch panoramic VIEWS, a section of street, a monument, or the sea. Windows can be conceived with a wealth of angles, so that their surfaces are never parallel to the building front. Even when limited to the detail of windows, the principle of functional listing challenges the classical approach to the fagade, takes away its finished look, and breaks its square frame by fragmenting the corners of the building and maybe the line be- tween top floor and roof. A double aim is achieved: alternate lighting solutions in the interiors and heightened expressive quali- ties on the outside. IT can imagine two objections, one of simple dismay and the other of ideological alibis masking dismay. The first objection is that a frightening amount of work is involved in this procedure: if the outline and position of every window have to be thought out separately, the design of a ten-window taqade is going to take too much time and energy, far out of proportion to the rewards The second objection is that such a method may lead to an academy of misrule, to the triumph of arbitrariness. The answer to the first objection ts that it is largely true. The only correct way to design a window is to study the space it lights, for the perceptual and behavioral value of any space de- pends on how it is lighted. The fact is that spaces and volumes, the whole building, have to be planned before it is decided what shapes of window to choose. Is modern architecture hard? Proba- bly, but it is splendid because every element, every word of it, is related to a social content. If it were easy, most of the buildings put up today would be truly modern. Suffice it to look at their windows to realize that they are quite often the product of aca- demic irresponsibility. As to the second objection, that the modern language of archi- tecture tends to be arbitrary: on the contrary, classicism is totally arbitrary, in so far as it gives mythical value to abstract orders that repress freedom and social behavior. Does functional listing lead to disorder? Yes, to sacrosanct disorder that drives out idola- trous order and the taboos imposed by standardized and alienating mass production. The listing method rejects the products of neo- capitalist industry, just as William Morris rejected paleocapitalist products in the second half of the nineteenth century. Industry too often promotes sameness; it categorizes, standardizes, and classicizes. Recent skyscrapers with their curtain walls are more static, boxy, and monolithic than those built fifty years ago. You can see it from the windows as well. The two objections betray troubled psychological origins. The modern language increases the possibilities of choice, while classi- cal architecture reduces them. Choice creates anguish, a neurotic anxiety for certainty. What is to be done? There are no tranquil- izers for this ailment. But are there in other areas? Does not abstract painting arouse a similar anguish? What about dodeca- phonic and aleatory or accidental music? And conceptual art? Is it not anguishing to look at oneself in the mirror for the first time and recognize oneself in an image outside oneself, or to learn that the earth rotates even though it seems to be standing still? Fear of freedom and horror of irrational impulses are at the bottom of this anguish. Let us suppose for a moment that, in a given building, windows could be alike or different without altering their function in any way. The modern language says, let them be different, let there be more choices. The classical code dictates that they all be alike, they must be orderly like \r",{"entities":[]}],["corpses But the hypothesis that they may be equally functional is absurd, really arbitrary. This merely contirms an established fact, but one that is very hard te instillin the minds of architects: What seems rational and logical, because it is regulated and or- dered, is humanly and socially foolish: it makes sense only in terms of despotic power What is presumed irrational, on the other hand, is generally the result of thinking things through and courageously yranting the imagination its riphts. Classicism is fine fer cemeteries, net tor lite: Only death can resolve the anviety of certainty What has been said about windows should be repeated for every aspect of design on any scale: volumes and spaces, their interrelationships, urban complexes, and regional planning. The mvariable is always the functional list. Why should a room be cubical or prismatic, instead of free form and harmonious with its uses? Why should a group of rooms form a simple box? Why must a building be conceived as the wrapping for a lot of small boxes packed inside a larger box? Why should it be closed in on itself. making a sharp distinetion between the architectural cavities and the urban or natural landscapes Why must all the rooms in anapartment be the same height? And so on. The invari- able of modern language consists in whys and what-fors, in not submitting toa priori laws, in rethinking every conventional state- ment, and in the systematic development and verification of new hypotheses. A will to be tree of idolatrous precepts is the main- spring of modern architecture, beginning with Le Corbusier s fa- mous five principles: the tree plan, the tree facade, the pilotis that leave the ground tree under the building, the roof garden that implies the tree use of the top of the building, and even the strip window, in so far as it offers further evidence that the fagade is tree of structural elements The list appreach continually makes a clean start. It verifies and challenges even the tive principles, as Le Corbusier himself did in his later vears, from Ronchamp on. Indeed, his earlier pur- ism imposed heavy desizn restrictions, because the plan was tree only within the perimeter of a pure geometric figure. Why should we sanctity geometry. or straight lines, or right an- gles? The functional list says ce to these prescriptions as well. It affects content and form, individual ethics and collective life, just as language does. The following chapters examine other applications of this in- variable. There is no modern architecture outside the list process. The rest is fraud, classicist or pseudomodern. It is a crime, when there is a proper language of architecture to speak. 3. The methodology of listing functions, applied to volumes. Old and pseudo- modern classicism boxes man s activities, ignoring their specific differences. Then it sets the boxes above and beside each other to form a larger box (left). Listing gives meaning back to volumes, groups them, but preserving their individuality (right). \r",{"entities":[[1591,1603,"PER"],[2014,2026,"PER"]]}],["4. Where to hang a picture.

When you criticize something for being symmetrically arranged, and you are asked where else to put it, your answer should be: anywhere else. There is only one place that is radically wrong, the place that is selected spontaneously, dredging up all the atavistic conventions of the subconscious. We can take an even simpler example than the window to demonstrate this, a picture. Here is a wall. Where shall we hang the picture? In the center, of course. No, anywhere else. To the right or left, higher up or lower down, anywhere but there. If you hang the picture in the middle, it splits the wall into two equal parts. It reduces the visual dimensions and makes them trivial. The picture seems to be framed and isolated by the wall, when it could open up the room and give it breathing space. Symmetry is one of the invariables of classicism. Therefore asymmetry is an invariable of the modern language. Once you get rid of the fetish of symmetry, you will have taken a giant step on the road to a democratic architecture. Symmetry = economic waste + intellectual cynicism. Any time you see a house consisting of a central core with two symmetrical lateral extensions you can reject it out of hand. What is in the left wing? The living room, perhaps. And in the right one? Bed- rooms and bathrooms. Is there any conceivable reason why the two enveloping volumes should be. identical? The architect wasted space by enlarging the living room to make it the same size as the bedrooms. Or else he restricted essential functions of the sleeping area to keep it the same size as the living room. And look at the height of the ceilings.

On the other hand, if the bedroom ceiling is too high, the space seems visually cramped and suffocating. It is a flagrant waste, both economically and esthetically; a double injury and a double sacrifice. On the altar of what taboo is this sacrifice laid? On the altar of symmetry. Symmetry =a spasmodic need for security, fear of flexibil- ity, indetermination, relativity, and growth in short, fear of living. The schizophrenic cannot bear the temporal aspect of liv- ing. To keep his anguish under control, he requires immobility. Classicism is the architecture of conformist schizophrenia. Symmetry = passivity or, in Freudian terms, homosexuality. This is explained by psychoanalysts. Homologous parts instead of heteronymous parts. It is infantile fear of the father the academy, in this case, is a father figure, protective of the cowardly child who will castrate you if you attack a heteronymous figure, the woman, the mother. As soon as one becomes passive and accepts symmetry, the anguish seems to subside, because the father no longer threatens, he possesses. Perhaps the whole history of architecture could be reread in terms of symmetry neurosis. Certainly that of Western architec- ture could be. It is no accident, for example, that Italy was the first country to revive the worship of this idol during the Renais- sance, while other countries continued to develop the Gothic style. The economy of the Italian peninsula was going through a severe crisis which the dominant classes tried to conceal behind a classi- cist mask. They evoked the Greco-Roman past in a mythical key in order to camouflage the instability of the present. They assumed a courtly, forbidding, or Olympian air to hide the desolation of society. It has always been like that: symmetry is the facade of sham power trying to appear invulnerable. The public buildings of Fascism, Nazism, and Stalinist Russia are all symmetrical. Those of South American dictatorships are symmetrical. Those of theo- cratic institutions are symmetrical; they often have a double sym- metry. Can you imagine an asymmetrical Victor Emmanuel Mon- ument in Rome, out of balance, varied in its parts, with an equestrian statue to the left or right rather than in the center? An Italy capable of building that kind of monument would have been another kind of nation, one committed to the creation of \r",{"entities":[[2,23,"LOC"],[103,115,"PER"],[206,230,"ARCH"],[2411,2437,"ARCH"],[2441,2445,"LOC"]]}],["a democratic state administration, an efficient service sector, a society. balanced between northern and southern regions and based on justice. As a matter of fact, such a country would not have wasted public funds on a marble monstrosity like the Victor Emmanuel Monument. Such a society would not have disfigured the Piazza Venezia with something that made its proportions so trivial, by moving the Palazzetto Venezia and tearing down the Palazzo Torlonia; in short, ruining not only an architectural hub but the whole townscape of Rome. [t would have used the money to build lower-class housing, schools. and libraries and to reform agriculture and public health facilities. The Victor Emmanuel Monument reflects the fragility of a backward nation that pre- tends to be progressive by striking a triumphant, monumental, arrogant, and bombastic attitude. The flame of the Unknown Sol- dier at the foot of the Are de Triomphe in Paris and the Cenotaph in London pale in modesty betore this horror, whose symmetry rises to titanic heights of wickedness. There are symmetrical buildings that are not rhetorical, but all rhetorical buildings symbols of totalitarian power or products of sloth and cynicism are symmetrical. On closer examination, moreover, nonrhetorical symmetrical buildings prove to be only partially symmetrical, generally only on the main front. This leads to another observation: symmetry has been used in the most ob- scene way to deform and falsity the arrangement of historic mon- uments. The most striking example: the Propylaea of the Athenian Acropolis. These have a blasphemously asymmetric plan; but since the Ecole des Beaux-Arts could not admit that such a heret- ical structure stood at the very entrance to the sanctuary of classi- cism, Mnesicles work was displayed as if it were symmetrical. Why? Because in a moment of mental aberration the Greeks had made a mistake, and it had to be corrected. Another example: the Erechtheum, a quite irregular and asymmetrical building, so modern that ina way it is a forerunner of Adolf Loos s multilev- eled Raumplan. What weight did the Erechtheum carry in the Beaua-Arts doctrine? None. It was not symmetrical, so it could serve NO purpose. Take a room, for example. Where should the entrance door be? Anywhere, just so lony as it is not in the middle of a wall. 6. How to light a room.

Where should the light come from? Anywhere, as long as it is not in the center of a wall, dividing the room into three sections, an illuminated one between two areas of dark- ness. Let us give each window new meaning as a specific light carrier in function of the interior space. If there is no view outside, try a strip window at floor level, another one at the ceiling (with a different width to avoid symmetry), and perhaps vertical strips at the corners to light the walls. In the offices of the Rome railway station there are two strips of window per floor, one at desk level and one at the ceiling. This is a satisfactory arrangement, although classicized by too much repetition of the motif. When windows are installed in opposite walls, they must not face each other directly: they will merely light each other and not the room. Take the Room of the Months in the famous Palazzo Schifanoia in Ferrara. Every window faces a full panel on the other side of the room, thus providing magnificent lighting for the marvelous Este frescoes. Symmetry is a single, though macroscopic, symptom of a tumor whose cells have metastasized everywhere in geometry. The his- tory of cities could be interpreted as the clash between geometry (an invariable of dictatorial or bureaucratic power) and free forms (which are congenial to human life). For hundreds of thousands of years the paleolithic community was ignorant of geometry. But as soon as neolithic settlements began and hunter-cultivators were subjected to a tribal chief, the chessboard made its appear- ance. Political absolutism imposes geometry, and absolutist gov- ernments regiment the urban structure by establishing axes and then more axes, either parallel to each other or intersecting at right angles.

Dissonances are logical components of a new organism that has the same vitality as the prototypes of the past. Schoenberg discovered that music freed from a tonic, or a harmonic center, was fully comprehensible and capable of evoking emotions. Tonality stands for symmetry, proportion, consonance, and geometry. Too many architects have not yet learned this lesson. 7. It would be extremely difficult to represent a medieval urban layout (for exam- ple, Siena s Piazza del Campo) using T-squares, compasses, and drafting machines These tools are good only for boxy architecture, which can easily be represented In perspective. Antiperspective Three-Dimensionality The hecatomb took place in the early fifteenth century. It was the triumph of perspective. Architects stopped working concretely on architecture and limited themselves to designing it. The dam- ages were enormous; they have increased through the following centuries; and they continue to proliferate with industrialized building techniques. There is probably nothing comparable in other areas of human activity. An almost unbridgeable chasm has opened up between architects and architecture. It is no wonder that quite a few architects have no idea what architecture is. . Perspective is a drawing technique for representing three-di- mensional objects on a two-dimensional surface. To make the job easier, buildings were broken down into squared parts and reduced to regular prisms. An immense visual heritage of curves, asymmetric forms, swerving lines, modulations, and angles other than 90-degree was obliterated in one fell swoop. The world was turned into boxes, and the architectural orders were used to distinguish superimposed or juxtaposed parts of the box. What perspective should have done was provide a means of acquiring greater awareness of three-dimensionality. Instead it rigidified three-dimensionality to such a degree that drawing it has become something mechanical and almost useless. It is a symptomatic proof of what linguists maintain: it is not we who speak a language; it is language that speaks us. We cannot even think without a code.

In theory, perspective should have provided an instrument to enhance depth. It might have expected to enrich the representation of volumes by the use of dramatic foreshortening. To that end, the corner view of a building should have become the driving force in order to pull it out of isolation and bring it into close relationship with the urban environment. Take, for instance, the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. It is a box, and it could not be anything else with the language of perspective. Yet its walls, if oblique, might have led the eye off in a series of dynamic vistas. Of course the palace s corners would have been totally different. The one facing the square should have been a clarion note, while the others would have been muted to maintain the smooth flow of streets. Obviously, nothing of the sort was done. The Farnese Palace does not communicate any stereometric reality. It is broken up into a main facade, heavy flanks on the small side streets, and an almost independent second facade at the rear. The volume is self-contained, finished, and lacking in any interplay with its surroundings. It looks as if it had been catapulted into the square, and the only way it can be appreciated as a three-dimensional object is from the air. The facades have identical corners, the hara-kiri of perspective. Although perspective was introduced in the name of three- dimensionality, it was usually applied to central framing, that is, two-dimensionally. Look at any Renaissance or classical street: a fissure between building walls and a procession of flat fagades. Where has three-dimensionality gone? Where are the volumes? What sense was there in destroying the glorious heritage of medie- val architecture, which was full of stereometric unboxed mes- sages? Consider political and social history, and you will find an answer. As with geometry, there would seem to be little hope of con- quering the virus of perspective that has infected the body of architecture in its most intimate fiber. In this case, however, the modern code has deep roots that go right back to the fifteenth century. From Mannerism on, art has tended to overmaster per- spective vision, and avant-garde movements from Impressionism 8. The three-dimensional quality of Rome s Palazzo Farnese would have been enhanced if the building had been set at an angle to the square /abgve/. Instead it appears as a two-dimensional wall (cen er/.

Architecture has lag- ged behind painting and sculpture: perspective has been more refractory, and it still corrupts an infinite number of buildings that are otherwise modern. A little knowledge of history is suffi- cient to realize that all true architects have been fighting perspec- tive since the crisis of 1527. It is time to bring the battle to an end. At the close of the fifteenth century there was Biagio Rossetti, the man who laid out Ferrara, the first modern European city, as Jacob Burckhardt called it. Rossetti was not a famous artist, and that is why he understood the fundamental needs of a city, something the yreat architects did not grasp because they were involved with a science of optics that centered almost exclusively on single buildings. What was the discovery made by this modest craftsman who created Ferrara without even making drawings? Simply that if buildings have to belong to a context, they must not be symmetrical, self-sufficient, or finished-looking. The corner views are the keynotes that set the tone of any townscape. The rest comes by itself. In laying out the Addiction Froulea, the expan- sion of the Ferrara city area, Rossetti concentrated on the buildings at street intersections and emphasized their corners. This is the only Renaissance urban complex thought out in terms of con- cretely three-dimensional perspective. Yet three and a half centu- ries later, Baron Haussmenn s Paris was conceived in terms of fagades, not corners. Michelangelo was another extraordinary man who defied cen- tral perspective. In the piazza of the Campidoglio he scorned the prevailing code, yrasped the space and held it firm, violating the canons of elementary geometry. He turned a rectangle into a trapezoid that was the obverse of the perspective trapezoid, and he negated the parallelism of the two palaces flanking the square, even though they are identical, It was an incredible achievement, but its message was ignored. Michelangelo is the most famous genius in the history of art. His works are admired, measured, and copied. In Montreal there is a half-scale copy of St. Peter s. The Campidoglio is an obligatory stop on the itinerary of millions of tourists and of all cultivated architects. But how many of them, reassured by this explosive precedent, have had the courage to arrange two facing structures in nonparallel fashion? Let us make passing reference to another overwhelming work of Michelangelo, the 1529 drawings for the fortifications of Flor- ence. There is an unheard-of thrust of spaces within and without these walls, with embankments and ramparts driving into the surrounding landscape. There are no parallel lines in these struc- tural profiles, twisting and turning in their function of static resist- ance against the double thrust of aggressive spaces. For four centu- ries no one has ever looked at these drawings, no one has discovered them, although they were perfectly well known. In terms of architectural language, of a new and revolutionary code, no use was ever made of them. Why? Michelangelo s idiom was never formalized, so no one could speak it. What was worse, no one could understand what Mi- chelangelo was saying. Thus, his lesson was wasted. Let me repeat, the codification of the modern language of architecture is the sine qua non if one is to speak architecture today or understand the true meaning of works of the past that have been counterfeited by classicist interpretation. This is the crux of the matter. Modern architecture coincides with the modern way of looking at the architecture of the past. One can write in a new key if one can read in a new key, and vice versa. This makes the contemporary language an instrument of formidable power even in terms of historiography. One might object: if the classical language is the only one that has been codified, how is it possible to communicate in an anticlas- sical idiom? Verbal languages do not undergo such sudden and radical revolutions that you find yourself speaking one way today and another tomorrow. Furthermore, how can we establish a new architectural code on the scanty basis of a few works by some artists who, among other things, often accepted symmetry, geo- metrical schemes, consonance, and perspective systems? Is it not simply a pipe dream? No. The modern language of architecture was not born sud- denly in 1859 with William Morris Red House. It does not use incomprehensible codes. Its messages are widely anticipated in Eclecticism, the Baroque, and the Renaissance itself, as we have \r",{"entities":[[452,467,"PER"],[534,550,"PER"],[562,570,"PER"],[875,882,"LOC"],[1191,1203,"LOC"],[1210,1218,"PER"],[1454,1469,"PER"],[1472,1477,"LOC"],[1526,1538,"PER"],[1610,1635,"ARCH"],[2005,2017,"PER"],[2115,2123,"LOC"],[2171,2182,"ARCH"],[2481,2493,"PER"],[2539,2550,"LOC"],[3099,3111,"PER"],[3213,3227,"PER"],[4423,4437,"PER"],[4438,4448,"ARCH"]]}],["seen, as well as the epic works of the Middle Ages, the late Roman period, Greece (the real Hellenic world, not the one defiled by Beaux-Arts hermeneutics), and as far back as the paleolithic age.

The so-called classical civilizations were not classical at all, not by a long shot. The great masters whose works provided the basis for the classical code would be the first to deny itin practice. Was Bramante classical? Was Palladio classical? Was Vignola a true classicist? The fact that Wright, Le Corbusier, Gropius, Mies van der Rohe, Aalto, and other masters of the modern movement have sometimes adopted classical elements (usually removing them from their classical context, however) is not disturbing. The new language of architecture, which developed in dialectical opposi- tion to Beaux-Arts idolatry, had to take the enemy s strategy into account. The relationship between the two is somewhat simi- lar to that between the Italian language and Latin (although mod- ern architecture is not at all derived from classicism). In the first centuries of our era, the vernacular was mixed with Latin words, and Latin was corrupted by vulgar terms. As time went on, Latin became progressively less Latin, and the structure of the code was vulgar. Latin came back into fashion in the fifteenth century, at the same time that perspective appeared and for similar reasons. The code of literary Latin was revived and seemed to prevail. But in that very moment it committed suicide, because the operation was antihistorical, repressive, and absurd. ESN =~ WS > 10. Erich Mendelsohn s sketch for a movie industry (1917).

A distinction must be made. When Gropius, Mies, and Aalto produced them, it was an act of surrender. Lacking a modern code, they weakened and regressed to the familiar womb of classicism. The same thing did not happen to Mendelsohn. His expressionism is so violent that the three-dimensional per- spective block destroys any static solemnity and explodes, electri- fies, and magnetizes the landscape. Where are the symmetrical buildings by Le Corbusier? Does the Villa Savoye look symmetri- cal? Perhaps to someone who has only glanced at it in a photo- graph. And Wright s works are even less symmetrical. Finally, must we really acknowledge that perspective is one of the thousand alternatives possible? Fine, so long as it is chosen out of a thousand possibilities, after the advantages of the other nine hundred and ninety-nine have been examined, and not a priori. The Syntax of Four-dimensional Decomposition De Stijl theory, the only coherent attempt to draw up a code for modern architecture, offered a rigorous procedure that could be applied generally. If the problem is to get rid of the perspective block, the first thing to do is eliminate the third dimension by decomposing the box, breaking it up into panels. No more closed volumes. What happens to a room? It is no longer a cubic void. There are six plans: the ceiling, four walls, and the floor. Separate the joinings, keeping the planes free; then light will penetrate even the darkest corners of the room, and its space will take on new life. A simple operation no one had thought of before, yet it was a decisive step on the way to architectural emancipation. The interior space is still somewhat cubical, but it looks com- pletely different with this sort of lighting. Let us follow this line of inquiry. Once the plans are separate and independent, they can be extended beyond the perimeter of the old box and spread out, go up or down, and reach beyond the limits that used to cut off the interior from the exterior. House and city can be transformed, Mondrian fashion, into a panorama of blue, yellow, red, white, and black panels. Once the box has been dismembered, the planes no longer form closed volumes, containers of finite spaces. Instead the rooms become fluid and join up and flow in a moving continuum. The static quality of classicism is replaced by a dynamic vision, with the element of time added or, if you will, with a fourth dimension. There was enough in De Stijl theory to nourish the language of architecture for decades.

But architects did not understand this neoplastic code, and so they abandoned it without having fully explored its possibilities. Nevertheless, decomposition remains a substantial invariable of the modern idiom. In the Bauhaus complex in Dessau, for example, Gropius broke up the volume into three distinct units: the dormitory, the school, and the workshop. Programmatically dissonant blocks are thus linked together in defiance of perspec- tive. There is no vantage point from which you can grasp the whole. You have to walk around. Hence movement, hence time. It is still, as always, a question of inventorying functions. Once the compact box is destroyed, the functional components can be distinguished, and their messages become more specific and direct. Harmonic connections are rejected. The passages between the three blocks look crude and brutal to emphasize their dissonance. Gropius only half understood what De Stijl was up to, and he did not break up volumes into panels. Other architects only half understood what had been done at the Bauhaus. The practice of breaking up volumes into smaller functional units was widely adopted, especially in school buildings, where it is easy to separate the classroom block from the gymnasium and the offices. But generally there is an attempt to harmonize the three units, to make them reciprocally proportional and to link them up with assonant transitions in short, to classicize the anticlassical. How can one explain that dissonance is as fundamental to modern architecture as it is to modern music? It is what gives forms, words, and sounds their specific meaning and makes expressive\" the inventory of functions. Yet no sooner do architects get the wrapping off than they start putting it back on again. When the classroom block, the gymnasium, and the office body are composed harmoniously, we are back with perspective vision again, with a privileged vantage point. The mania of proportion is another tumor that needs to be cut out. What is proportion? It is.a device to establish a binding relationship between heterogeneous parts of a building. It is a neurotic longing for synthesis, preferably a priori.

Fear of freedom, of growth, and therefore of life. Any time you see a proportioned building, beware! Proportion freezes the vital process and masks falsity and waste. Mies van der Rohe is perhaps the outstanding exponent of De Stijl. His German Pavilion at the Barcelona Exposition of 1929 is a masterpiece of this architectural trend. It consists of panels in travertine and marble, glass sheets, water surfaces, horizontal and vertical planes that shatter the immobility of closed spaces, break through volumes, and give direction to exterior vistas. This pavilion was only a beginning, with all its planes at right angles to each other. The system could have been enriched by getting away from the right angle and moving along inclined planes. But the pavilion was the beginning and the end. Four-dimensional decomposition became a plaything, a mindless exercise suitable for designing balconies, awnings, and some furnishings. For clarity s sake, let us digress for a moment. The modern code is applicable in any situation, on any scale, from a chair to a highway cluster, from a spoon to a city. An architect should not refuse any challenge. If he waits for the ideal commission before speaking correctly, he has already given up his profes- sion. Take a room, for example, even the most traditional and anachronistic one. Let us start by painting its surfaces six different colors: yellow, red, blue, white, black, and another color for the floor. Is it still the same room? Now let us change the color ar- rangement: make the ceiling black, and the walls blue, red, white, and yellow. The dark ceiling pressing down will make the room seem broader. If you want more light, the wall facing the window will be white or yellow. If you want less light, that wall can be painted blue or red, or even black. And let us paint the rectangular areas over windows and doors right up to the ceiling, so that they become sections of the wall instead of holes. And why not use lines? All it takes is a diagonal stroke to dynamize a surface. Nowadays supergraphic design is within everybody s reach. One might object that these are cosmetic operations. Certainly they are, but cosmetics can be a corrective and a protest. The classical code is shot through with cosmetic expedients, from use- less colonnades to fake windows. The modern code uses cosmetics \r",{"entities":[[88,117,"ARCH"],[121,125,"LOC"],[139,155,"PER"],[175,189,"PER"],[190,207,"ARCH"],[216,240,"PER"],[245,254,"LOC"],[607,622,"ARCH"],[630,650,"LOC"]]}],["as a provocation, to point out the burning need for a new treat- ment of space. Moreover, modern cosmetics are neither costly nor wasteful, while the old cosmetics what with symmetry, proportion, and marble facing are prohibitively expensive. Consider the nine- teenth-century Palazzo della Regina Margherita on the Via Veneto in Rome. Conceived in classical terms, it needed a majestic full- ness on top, to make the cornice dominant. So an entire floor was built for this sole purpose, a floor that could not be lived in because there were no windows. Isn t that disgraceful? After World War II, the Americans bought the building for the United States Embassy. They found that there was a top floor and wanted to put it to use, so they cut a series of small windows in the cornice. Double madness: a royal embassy with affectations of efficiency. The modern language of architecture could not build or even design such a building, much less something like the Victor Emmanuel Monument. The modern language was born with social. psychological, and human aims, and it abhors pomp- ous display and superstructures. Classical architecture is very ex- pensive because it is symbolic. It must assert itself and suffocate the citizen. The method of decomposition is an invariable. The seventh invariable, the principle of reintegration, means something only if it is the result of prior decomposition. Otherwise it is not reinte- gration but merely a priori classical integration. The fourth invariable was not a 1917 discovery of the Dutch De Stijl group. Consider the San Filippo Neri Monastery in Rome. Borromini designed this enormous block in the seventeenth cen- tury He broke it up into sections that are functional in terms of both interior spaces and cityscape. It has a concave front that pulls in the outside world. To the left is a supreme corner, perhaps the most highly elaborated angle in the history of architecture, leading seductively into a small side street. Facing onto it is a long opaque wall with almost casual, dissonant windows. But at the end of the street the Piazza dell Orologio seems to urge the building to send up its tower and tease the sky with linear, wrought-iron arabesques. Truly, the modern structures of the past overshadow the classical ones. Lite has always decomposed, articulated, added, or subtracted. Delacroix said that a straight line does not exist. Scientists tell us that symmetry is not a law of nature. Likewise, classicism does not exist in architecture, only in Beaux-Arts manuals and buildings that are copied out of them. \r",{"entities":[[277,308,"ARCH"],[316,335,"LOC"],[962,987,"ARCH"],[1595,1600,"LOC"]]}],["13) Fight sketches to dlustrate a lecture by Frank Lloyd Wright on the involvement ot every architectural element in the structural scheme Ae the Kaufmann House.

Both are new structural elements as they now enter architecture. But ali you see of this radical liberation of space all over the world today, is the corner window.

Space may now go out or come in where life is being lived, space as a component of it (Frank Lloyd Wright, An American Architecture, ed. Edgar Kaufman [New York: Horizon Press, 1955], pp. 76~78). Wright anticipated De Stijl syntax and got to the heart of the problem by way of analyzing structures. It is elementary reasoning to place the supports a certain dis- tance in from the corners. Even a child can understand it. But how many architects can? Look around you. Millions of supports are put up at the corners, cagelike structures hemming in space. And what about engineers? With few exceptions, they are victims of classical prejudices and make things symmetrical and propor- tionate. Indeed, the history of engineering is brimful of compro- mise. A striking example is the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The four large arches at its base look as if they were meant to support the structure, but they are false. The famous French engineer could not face the scandal of building the tower in its true structural form, with four shafts meeting at the top. He had to respect classical static vision, even denying reality. Thus he installed a large heavy beam, serving no purpose, on all four sides and hung the arches on them. The arches are supported, but they look as if they were doing the supporting. Classicists were satisfied with this typically wasteful act. The codification of the modern language of architecture implies that engineers as well as architects must shuck the chains of classi- cism and bring to an end the long conflict between technique and expression, which must be used together in a creative fashion. Take a prestigious international figure like Pier Luigi Nervi. He produced a masterpiece in the Orbetello hangars, with their magnificent enclosed space, arching volumes, and corner elements that project the structure into the landscape. His Turin Exhibition Hall had splendid modules, but they are repeated in the traditional way and could not be carried through to the end walls. To finish 14.

Nervi s Palazzo del Lavoro in Turin is a thankless large box, with reinforced concrete columns complete with fluting and steel capitals. All it would take to turn it into an Egyptian temple are colossal statues of pharaohs. To comment on his papal audi- ence hall in the Vatican would be superfluous. And the most that can be said of that round cake, the Palazzo dello Sport in Rome, is that it is right at home in the Fascist EUR complex designed by Marcello Piacentini, the Italian Albert Speer. The Palazzetto dello Sport in Viale Tiziano is certainly better, but what is that circle of fork-shaped elements that supports the dome? A circular ring of prestressed reinforced concrete, the real structural link of the whole organism, is hidden underground. And what is one to think of this mania for domes? The symbolism of the dome is associated with godhead, idols, absolute monarch- ies, temple shrines, and dictatorial states. Psychologically, the dome involves security or its counterfeit because it is the classic form par excellence, completely closed and symmetrical. Nervi did not draw inspiration from the anticlassical domes of Hagia Sophia in Istanbul or Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, but from the Pantheon, and he executed a series of tours de force to reduce the thickness of the shell. Where the Pantheon piles up matter, Nervi throws open a row of windows. Nevertheless, the space is still blocked, and there is no interplay with the world outside. The security to be found in the shadow of classical idols is simply fear decked out in fancy trappings. What happened to Nervi after the Orbetello hangars? Did his creative streak run dry? Suffice it to look at the Burgo paper plant in Mantua and countless details of the buildings mentioned above to see that it did not. The reason is simpler and much more alarming. When Nervi speaks architecture, he speaks Latin, the classical code that exhausts most structural engineers. How many are immune from it? Riccardo Morandi for one, especially in his underground automobile showroom in Turin; Buckminster Fuller, with his air-transportable geodesic domes and extremely lightweight skyscrapers; Eduardo Torroja, with his Madrid Race- course vaults; F lix Candela with his hyperbolic paraboloids; Frei Otto with his transparent tensilstructures; and quite a few young men who are slowly sloughing off the classical code, particularly in their shell and membrane, or plastic and compressed air, cover- ings. Architecture and engineering come together in these tents, where space forms, and is formed by, the structures. The structural invariable of the modern idiom is less concerned with cantilevers, membranes, and shells than it is with involving all the architectural elements in a symphony of static forces. It is well known that a structure s efficiency depends on its form and the tension of its curves. But how many people take this principle into consideration? In an ordinary balcony, it is only the slab that does the structural work, not the railing or parapet; hence, waste. But look at the astonishing Falling Water house. The cantile- vered terrace seemed so precarious to the workmen that they refused to take down the scaffolding for fear that the whole thing would collapse. Wright pulled down the scaffolding himself. Even in structural engineering he spoke the modern language. He proved his worth in works that sensible people and academi- cians considered mad and suicidal. In the building field, science is still in an antediluvian slumber. Enormous transatlantic liners can float on water, while city build- ings are made inordinately heavy just to stand on the ground. A considerable patrimony of structural experiences is not drawing interest. Sergio Musmeci said: The lack of technological foresight is responsible for the present crisis in architecture and is keeping it from becoming truly modern. History must be brought up to date by making a leap out of the past and into the future. The problem of creating forms for the future can be postponed no longer. 15.

We can check the space of a room, its size, light, heating, and fluency.

Obviously it will not guarantee that architects speak the modern language, but it will offer them the possibility of doing so, a possibility that has hith- erto been limited by the very instruments of design, T-squares and compasses.

The client will be able to follow the develop- ment of his house step by step. He will see it and live it before it is built. He will be able to make choices and change the house. The breach that has separated the architect from archi- tecture, at least since the Renaissance, will finally be closed, as will the breach between space and its structural shell. Space in Time The history of architecture is marked by chances missed, giant steps forward, and long falls backward. Michelangelo took a giant step forward; everyone praised him, but no one followed where he led. Borromini leaped forward; he was ostracized during his lifetime and dismissed after his death. Constructivism marked a major advance after the October Revolution, but Stalin, good classicist that he was, froze the movement. Wright burst forth, but where are the traces of his work in our present panorama? It is easy to understand why so many give up the battle. It is hard to escape from the academic womb. At best, compromise is achieved, and that is even worse. An architect who said, I want to speak ancient Greek would probably be considered mad, but he would actually be less demented than those who uncon- sciously speak an ungrammatical version of ancient Greek, igno- rant of its vocabulary and syntax. Only one architect of our time sought and found architecture in ancient Greece. And he discov- ered it for himself, without the blinders of the Beaux-Arts school. That man was Charles-Edouard Jeanneret, who changed his name to Le Corbusier after his baptism in Greek waters. The only way to speak ancient Greek would be to formulate the invariables of the language: antiperspective, no alignment or parallelism of volumes, ban on symmetry (in the name of the Propylaea), and a veto on classicism (in the name of the Erechtheum). Are these not the invariables of modern architecture? Of course, and the only way to get free of perspective conditioning is to go back to preperspective civilizations, usually to the Middle Ages but in Le Corbusier s case to Greece.

Does it speak the classical language or something diametrically opposite, with its hinged blocks swinging around and reaching out to the landscape? The idea of the classical world is a meaningless abstraction. Paradoxical as it may seem, classical civilization was almost totally anticlassical. Space in time is the summary of the problem in a nutshell. It took man thousands of years to master architectural space. The time element in architecture was experienced for only a short and exceptional period, that of the catacombs. It will take centu- ries, perhaps thousands of years, for man to master the dynamic principle of space in time. The only way to become modern is by reliving the stages of past history inside oneself. Before the Pantheon there were no interior spaces created by man. There were empty, unfilled voids and left-over, negative cavities. Primitive man was afraid of space. His monument was the menhir, an upright long stone, a full- ness in the endless wastes. The ancient East produced a number of solids, like the pyramids and temples with hypostyle halls, where space was driven out by enormous columns. The Greek temple humanized volume, but it continued to ignore space. The idea of using nontactile reality as an architectural instrument was first put into practice in the Pantheon. But its space is timid, hemmed in by gigantic walls and lacking contact with the outside. It is lighted only by a single oculus at the top, which heightens the chiaroscuro of the coffered dome and confirms that this is solid heavy matter. A few centuries went by before man was ready for the interplay of inner spaces and outside landscape. This did not happen until late antiquity, with the so-called Temple of Minerva Medica in Rome. And the idea of continuous flow between inner and outer space was only made concrete a thousand years later, in the Gothic cathedrals. There was a period in which the physical world was considered a place of damnation, and a life after death was hypothesized. Man lived for the hereafter and scorned terrestrial values. Space was repressed. Endless hypogeal tunnels for the dead were dug beneath the static, theatrically monumental architecture of ancient Rome.

They break up the box and bite its corners. How can time be introduced into space? One way was pointed out by Louis Kahn. He distinguished between spaces to move through and spaces created for arrivals at the end of movement. Anyone who conceives of a corridor with parallel walls, that is as a static prism, does not know the first thing about architecture. Even the arrival spaces living room, study, or bedroom should not be totally static. They must foster human communication, intellectual tension, or waking after sleep. Life is always full of happenings. The dynamism of living needs to be mediated but not reduced to zero. A room is entered, crossed, and left, and all this movement should be considered and provided for in de- sign. What is the free plan, the principle of flexibility, moving partitions, and fluidity from space to space? It is another way of expressing space in time and time in space. The volume of Villa Saveye, in Poissy, is slashed from ground to roof garden by a ramp that is visible throughout the house. Le Corbusier called it promenade architecturale, architecture to walk through. Staircases are certainly moved through, but too many of them are caged in vertical tubes. In the Swiss Pavilion of the University of Paris, the staircases emerge from the volume and a free-hand curved wall caresses them. A more advanced example is the stair- cases in Aalto s dormitories at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, which are continuous with the corri- dors in order to form serpentine volumes and spaces. And what about the famous building that is all passageway and ramp? The Guyyenheim Museum in New York is that kind of structure, an extrovert helical prowrernade. Norris Kelly Smith maintains that Wright introduced Biblical thought into the field of architecture for the first time, after two thousand years of domination by Greco-Roman concepts. It was easier for Wright to escape from classicism because he turned down a Beaux-Arts education. He hated big cities, bureaucratic institutions, authority, and power, and kept intact the proud indi- vidualism of the pioneers. At Taliesin, Wisconsin, and Taliesin West, Arizona, he lived close to nature and experienced and stud- ied time How, indeed, could you think of building a house over a waterfall if you did not have a vivid sense of fluid motion? In the Guggenheim Museum a glass strip was wound around the spiral, so that paintings and sculptures could receive a mixture of natural and artificial light. The time element marks the trans- ition from the city to the museum inside and vice versa. The lighting of the interior space was to change tone every hour all year round. Where in architecture can time be introduced? Everywhere. How can it be done? In countless ways. Take floors, for example. Does it make sense to have the same kind of floor surface in the hallway, the living room, the bathroom, the study, and the bedroom? Should movement and kinetic experience be the same in rooms with such different functions? Where could such an inane rule have come from? Classicism, of course. What basis could it have? Certainly not the so-called classical period, which reveals a remarkable sense of movement: the Athenian Acropolis is built on rough rocky terrain, kept that way in order to impose slow, architecturally calculated motion. Every space should have different flooring hard, soft, gravelly, smooth or rough, oblique, any kind as long as it is thought out. Einstein says that an event is localized not only in time but also in space. This revolutionary idea has yet to be assimilated by architecture. What it means is the following invariable: open design that is constantly in process, invested with time consciousness, and unfinished. \r",{"entities":[[972,984,"ARCH"],[989,995,"LOC"],[1083,1095,"PER"],[1259,1273,"ARCH"],[1281,1300,"LOC"],[1430,1435,"PER"],[1457,1507,"LOC"],[1671,1688,"ARCH"],[1692,1700,"LOC"],[1762,1780,"PER"],[1796,1802,"PER"],[2176,2195,"LOC"],[2201,2214,"LOC"],[2216,2223,"LOC"],[2409,2426,"ARCH"],[3527,3535,"PER"]]}],["DO Frank liowd Wrebeotrom distin te reaptesration oo 4or. three dimen New Yorn 1X34) Nouseud drawing ter the farts and BRartor Houses on Buttale single units are functionals articulated Alc.

The five invariables in between could be increased in number by passing from the elementary level to an exhaustive analysis of the lexicon, grammar, and syntax of architecture. Inventorying functions breaks up the box, lists elements with- out classifying them, and gives concrete new meaning to the indi- vidual messages that classicism drowned in orders and se- quences of proportions. The successive invariables reinforce the listing operation by discarding the inviolable taboos of symmetry, assonance, geometry, perspective, compact volumes, structural comers, and space with no time component. Thus they also foster a reintegration of the functions that have been listed. The free plan by itself is a step on the road to reintegration, because it postulates maximum communication and flow between rooms and thereby unifies them. But this is not synthesis in the classic, a priori sense. It is just the opposite, a matter of dynamic unity that creates a movement and shapes space to time. True, you move physically even in a classical building, but man always has the impression of being out of place and incongruous there. Those spaces were designed not for him, but for motionless stat- ues, and they are as formal as tombs. Adolf Loos explored the principle of vertical reintegration in his Raumplan (an interlocking construct of spatial areas of differ- ent heights) and enlarged the surface available for living, thereby economizing and increasing artistic values.

Anu we can use the differences in height to create other usable spaces that are intimate, interesting, and acces- sible in a few steps. For an example of the opposite principle, take a symbol of Fascism, the Palazzo Littorio in Rome, completed after the war as the seat of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The bathroom ceilings are over twenty feet high, the same height as those of the assembly halls. These imperial toilets are fit for fairy- tale giants or Duces on fifteen-foot stilts. Instead, they are used by little men who look sadly out of place there. They are another example of classicist schizophrenia. Our aim is horizontal and vertical reintegration, with passages in any direction, not squared off at right angles but curving, obli- que, and inclined. This principle goes well beyond the single object and integrally links the building to the city. When the volume has been broken up into planes and reassembled in four-dimen- sional fashion, the traditional facade disappears, together with the distinction between interior and exterior spaces and between architecture and town planning. The fusion of city and building leads to urbatecture. No more building blocks alternating with empty blocks for streets and plazas. Once the old weave is unrav- eled, the landscape can be reintegrated. And when the traditional dichotomy of city and countryside is abolished, urbatecture can spread into whole territories, while nature penetrates the metro- politan fabric. Thus continuity will be established between city and region, instead of overcrowded, polluted, chaotic, and homi- cidal urban communities on the one hand and desolate, unculti- vated countryside on the other. Is this utopian? Only in so far as it is still just an aspiration. If it becomes a spoken language in design, in furnishings, in your own room, in buildings of any size, in a city, and in its region, it will acquire an overwhelming force. Architects and people inter- ested in the human habitat will have at their disposal a revolution- ary weapon, one that is actually explosive by virtue of architec- ture. If we really speak the modern architectural language, there are two possibilities facing us.

But our cause will be weakened if, once the use of land has been collectivized, nothing changes in terms of architectural censorship, as was the case in Soviet Russia. Obviously this last invariable has functional consequences too. After having listed and decomposed the functions of buildings, cities, and territories, we must rethink their relationships. Why should a school be a self-contained structure instead of being one with the social center, the local administrative offices, facto- ries, professional studios, and residences? Is it right to separate residential from recreational and commercial areas? Should we not rather promote an interplay of functions? Take the case of universities, which used to consist of several independent facul- ties, each with its own classrooms, auditorium, and library. Inter- disciplinary education has started breaking through this kind of isolationism. Will universities continue to move outside the city, like the traditional English and American campuses, or will they be localized throughout the residential and working areas? Streets must also be reintegrated. On several floors of the Unite d Habitation in Marseilles, Le Corbusier inserted stores, thus reintegrating business and residence. He called these corridors rues, veritable indoor streets. Why cannot streets run at the same height as the tenth or fiftieth floor of the buildings, floating be- tween skyscrapers and structuring the sky? Countless utopian designs offer urban images of this kind, and a number of architec- tural works foreshadow them in concrete fashion. The offices of the Ford Foundation in New York look out onto an inner covered park. A building on the Via Romagna in Rome reintegrates commercial, administrative, and residential functions by having stores, offices, and villas piled on top of each other. The Mummers Theater in Oklahoma City is a construct of hetero- geneous fragments, scrap metal, automobile wrecks, and tubes action architecture, as John Johansen s sketches clearly show. Montreal's Habitat 67 is a cluster of cells that link up architectural and urban spaces with streets on all levels.

Psychoanalysis and an- thropology teach and warn us that man has lost some essential values in his rise to civilization: the sense of the unity of space and time, the freedom of nomadic life, the joy of aimless wander- ing through unlimited horizons. We can and must recover these values. The hippy communes and the revolt of the young against consumer society, polluted cities, and repressive institutions are symptoms of the urgent need to wipe the cultural slate clean. But one makes a new start by moving forward, providing concrete alternatives and using the modern language that can express them. Otherwise one is mired in mere romantic protest, blocked at zero degrees. Again, let us think of some simple cases that can be easily verified. The reader can make his own extrapolations on the urban and territorial scale. What does reintegrating architecture and na- ture mean? Walk into a cave or a natural grotto. It may once have been the refuge for prehistoric man. You can feel the earth beneath your feet, and you like the feeling. This sense of physical pleasure has been lost on our asphalt streets and smooth side- walks. The roof of the cave is not squared off at the sides; it is continuous with the curving rough walls and runs right into the earth floor. When light strikes the rocky masses or glances over the vault of the cave, it creates stunning magical effects that change hour after hour. And think about grottoes by the sea, where the light picks up the color of the depths as it is reflected by the water surface. The light moves with the waves, records the sky, whether cloudy or calm, and communicates the shifting of the winds. All these lost values can be rediscovered through the modern language of architecture. In the Massachusetts Insti- tute of Technology chapel, Eero Saarinen illuminated the space with a tremulous light reverberating off water. Despite controver- sial opinions about its success, this solution is indicative of what can be done. The reintegration of architecture and nature must be carried out in a scientific, not a romantic way, on the basis of anthropological, sociological, and psychoanalytical research.

Hundertwasser says in his Manifesto for the Boycotting of Architecture : Every man has the right to build the way he wants. Architecture today is censored the same way painting is in the Soviet Union. Everybody should be entitled to build his own four walls and be responsible for them. Present-day architec- ture is criminally sterile. The reason is that building stops when the client enters his residence, yet that is precisely when it should begin, and grow like skin on a human organism. Hence, to the stake with architects; their job and privileges should be turned over to the consumers, to the people. Mr. Sammler is much more skeptical about spontaneous creativ- ity: Then: a crazy species? Yes, perhaps. Though madness is also a masquerade, the project of a deeper reason... . . And what to do? In the matter of histrionics, see, for instance, what that furious world-boiler Marx had done, insisting that revolutions were made in historical costume, the Cromwellians as Old Testa- ment prophets, the French in 1789 dressed in Roman outfits. But the proletariat, he said, he declared, he affirmed, would make the first nonimitative revolution. It would not need the drug of historical recollection. From sheer ignorance, knowing no models, it would simply do the thing pure. He was as giddy as the rest about originality. And only the working class was original. Thus history would get away from mere poetry. Then the life of human- kind would clear itself of copying. It would be free from Art. AA Oh, no. No, no, not so, thought Sammler. Instead, Art increased, and a sort of chaos. Stalin s proletarian society copied the archi- tecture of autocracy and despotism, and people who practiced confrontation politics were obviously derivative. And of what of Paiutes, of Fidel Castro? No, of Hollywood extras. Acting mythic. . . . Better, thought Sammler, to accept the inevitability of imitation and then to imitate good things.. . . Greatness with- out models? Inconceivable.. . . Make peace therefore with inter- mediacy and representation. But choose higher representations. Otherwise the individual must be the failure he now sees and knows himself to be. Mr. Sammler, sorry for all, and sore at heart (Mr. Sammler s Planet [New York: Viking, 1970], pp. 148- 49). Mr. Sammler is right, an architectural code is needed. But the liberating force of the modern language of architecture is oriented toward Hundertwasser s objectives. It teaches one to desanctify the canons and precepts of the Enlightenment for the sake of more concrete choices. The seven invariables all refer to specific models, from William Morris Red House to the masterpieces of Wright, Le Corbusier, Gropius, Mies, Aalto, and the more re- cent achievements of Safdie and Johansen. They also refer to the past, to Borromini, Michelangelo, Rossetti, Brunelleschi, to the Middle Ages, late antiquity, Hadrian s Villa, Greek acropo- lises, and even to prehistory to show that the modern language of architecture is not merely the language of modern architecture; it enfolds the heresies and dissonances of history, those countless exceptions to the rule which have finally been emancipated and which can provide the backbone of an alternative language. Participation is the rallying cry of young people, politicians, sociologists, and artists. There is a considerable element of dema- gogy in that cry. What does taking part mean in architecture? Giving the man in the street a T-square and compasses and telling him to design anything he likes? He would only ape the most backward classical models. It does not mean offering him several plans and asking him to take his pick. What criteria would he follow? Interpreted this way, participation is nothing more than a slogan. Instead, it is a substantial corollary of the seven invari- ables of the modern code. \r",{"entities":[[132,155,"PER"],[215,227,"PER"],[228,241,"PER"],[838,849,"PER"],[1768,1776,"PER"],[2007,2019,"PER"],[2444,2455,"PER"],[2466,2474,"LOC"],[2509,2516,"PER"],[2841,2855,"PER"],[2856,2865,"ARCH"],[2889,2895,"PER"],[2897,2909,"PER"],[2911,2918,"PER"],[2920,2924,"PER"],[2926,2931,"PER"],[2971,2977,"PER"],[2982,2991,"PER"],[3024,3033,"PER"],[3035,3047,"PER"],[3049,3057,"PER"],[3059,3071,"PER"],[3109,3124,"ARCH"]]}],["Every one of the invariables, from listing functions to reintegra- tion, demands participation, for they are concerned with the form- ative process (not with form), with the unfinished, with an archi- tecture that can grow and change, an architecture that is not isolated but can communicate with external reality and even soil its hands with kitsch. Nobody wants beautiful consolatory ob- jects any more. Art has stepped down from its pedestal to meet life halfway and assimilate the esthetic valences of the ugly and the cast-off. Alberto Burri paints rags; Claes Oldenburg discovers the message in a soft typewriter ; noise is not antimusic but rather alternative music ; and in architecture, the Mummers Theater looks as if it had been built with junk bought from a scrap dealer. The unfinished in art has a long history, from Mnesicles to Rossetti and Palladio, reaching its high point in Michelangelo. Contemporary art, however, codifies the unfinished by the com- pletion of an interrupted communicative process, requiring action by the user. Thus participation is not a paternalistic sop but an inherent feature of the coming-into-being of an open work of art. Take city planning.

Dense urban concentration, forests of skyscrapers connected at various levels and functionally reintegrated, extensive green areas all around. This sort of organi- zation would also contribute to a more intense community life. society's new demands at any moment. The classicists design Renaissance ideal cities that are abstract, utopian, and perpetu- ally frustrating. The moderns know that they cannot design a real city, they can only design its tentative design; that is to say, they can develop a hypothetical program for the future, but one that will be carried out with different and unexpected forms as needs change. The unfinished approach is the goal of the seven invariables, and it is a fundamental prerequisite if architecture is to be involved in the land- and townscape, assimilate its contradictions, and rummage in squalor and kitsch in search of human values that need saving. Sociologists have found that slums, didonvilles, favelas, and barriadas have an intensely vital sense of community that is unknown in planned lower-class housing developments. Why is that? Because adventure, the pioneering spirit, and neighborli- ness are missing in planned settlements, together with that spon- taneous kitsch which, despite its negative features, can be ex- tremely stimulating. In the modern language of the unfinished, participation is the indispensable structural complement of archi- tecture in action. There it is. The seven invariables provide a guide to design. No architect, certainly not Wright, Le Corbusier, Mies, or Aalto, would subscribe to them in toto, although Johansen and Safdie might. They are seven heresies, seven testimonies against classical idolatry, intolerable if taken all at once. Small matter. With this guide in the pocket, each will apply them as far as he can. Some will not apply them at all. Herbert Marcuse (An Essay on Liberation, 1969) calls people like that the mad ones, the uncommitted, those who take flight into all kinds of mysticism, the fools and the scoundrels, and those who couldn t care less whatever happens. \r",{"entities":[[533,546,"PER"],[560,575,"PER"],[700,715,"ARCH"],[831,840,"PER"],[844,852,"PER"],[857,865,"PER"],[894,907,"PER"],[3067,3073,"PER"],[3303,3318,"PER"]]}],["Afterthougnts } (COMING OF AGE Throughout architectural history. linguistic codification has marked a culture's coming of age What is it that conventionally distinguishes history from prehistory?

This achievement transcends the framework of the discipline and im- plies democratic development, a new social era for architecture based on a consensus that is not paternalistic, populist, or preten- tious (Where real needs are Constantly mixed up with those created by advertising), but authentic and direct Many architects are afraid to grow up. They prefer to remain dependent children under the authority of a father figure. But in the 1950s and 1960s the fathers Wright, Le Corbusier, Gro- pius, Mies van der Rohe, Mendelsohn, and, a few years later, Louis Kahn died. Moreover, some of them stopped nourishing their children lony before they actually died) Mies, for example, when he began working with closed prisms and abandoned the poetics oF fluid spaces channeled by De Stijl tree plans; and Gro- plus, When he turned to teamwork in America and forgot the system of breaking blocks up into functional volumes, which had been the preat achievement of the Bauhaus. Even Le Corbu- ster, When he took his giant step forward at Ronchamp, left teach- ing behind and disinherited children and yrandchildren, who had aR to fall back on the Le Corbusier manner of the Lyons La Tour- ette monastery and Chandigarh. There are no more father figures. It is time to grow up, get free of adult guardianship, and speak an independent codified language that derives naturally from the work of the masters but is not dominated by their individual styles and the weight of their overwhelming personalities. Is there any other alternative? None that does not carry infanti- lism to grotesque extremes. Some orphan architects, without a father to turn to, head back to the maternal womb of the academy, the classicist ideology of power, geometric dogmas, harmony, and proportion. In short, in their anxiety for security, they commit suicide. Others fall into the opposite error. Rather than accept the modern language, they push back zero degree to the limit of chaos and anticulture and reject any system of communication. The stages of development in music are clear: atonality, Expres- sionist destructuring; then, dodecaphonic rationalism; and, finally, postdodecaphonic aserial music, which eschews rationalist rigor, but not in the name of despair and chaos. These stages are less evident in architecture, because Expressionist zeroing (Gaudi and later Mendelsohn) did not precede rationalism but evolved almost contemporaneously with it from the beginning of the century to the early twenties. Thus the postrationalist organic era is full of Expressionist revivals, especially in the serpentine forms of Aalto. Even the Ronchamp chapel is a mixture of Expressionism and Art /nformel with occasional elements of Baroque persuasion in the lighting, sometimes seductive and sometimes overstated. It is worth stressing the point that there are two refuges in the maternal womb: academic classicism and pseudo-Baroque Expres- sionism. The latter may seem more complex and hypnotic, but it is no less naive and regressive than the former. 2. MANNERISM AND LANGUAGE Is it really indispensable that there be a codified language? If its invariables are derived from architectural masterpieces, is it not enough to follow those precedents? In other words, why pass through a code, which is necessarily reductive, instead of going straight to the original sources? \r",{"entities":[[1084,1096,"PER"],[1109,1126,"PER"],[1128,1138,"PER"],[1164,1174,"PER"],[1783,1806,"ARCH"],[2941,2946,"PER"],[2957,2967,"PER"],[3209,3215,"PER"],[3225,3240,"ARCH"]]}],["Certainly, before the constants of the modern language of archi- tecture were formulated, the only historically legitimate path was Mannerism. At a theoretical level, there is nothing wrong with that. On the contrary. Mannerism humanizes the styles of gen- iuses by divesting them of the messianic attitude of a Wright or the doctrinarianism of a Le Corbusier. If Mannerism could make these styles truly popular and available to all, there would, of course, be no need to codify an architectural language. Unfortu- nately this is not the case. Mannerism neither popularizes nor democratizes. It is a highly intellectual operation and almost un- transmittable. Take, for example, Rosso Fiorentino and Pontormo, the occasional followers of Michelangelo and Borromini, the disci- ples of Wright, Le Corbusier, and Mendelsohn; they amount to a few dozen in the whole world. Why is this the case? Because Mannerists work from results, from finished products, and neglect the process that developed the products. What they do might be called speech about speech. Mannerists elaborate on forms, not on structure and formation. They annotate and distort forms in a sagacious but limited and aristocratic way. The works of the masters are derived from the reality of life. The works of the Mannerists are derived simply from those of the masters. The masters continually destructure, they go back to the starting point, and they return to listing functions directly. The Manner- ists, on the other hand, perceive reality only through the filter of selected and exalted images. Thus Mannerists tire quickly and are sucked back into the academy, which is always lying in am- bush (neo-sixteenth-centuryism, neoclassicism, contemporary neohistorical trends). It is important to bear in mind the genetic weakness of Manner- ism: the only way it can destroy classical models either tear them apart in anger or undo them with irony is by preserving those models as emblems of a sanctity to be desanctified. To challenge their authority the Mannerists must first acknowledge it. The infractions and dissonant notes of the Mannerists presup- pose the tyranny of classical harmony. Indeed Mannerism has nothing to work on when it encounters anticlassical methodolo- gies, as in the buildings of Michelangelo, Borromini, or Wright. Without the despotic reign of the academy, the Mannerists have nothing to struggle against, and their invective is hushed to a murmur. A direct unmediated passage from the writing of the masters to the common language of the people does not and cannot exist. It would be absurd to tell people to go back to the sources, to read the Divine Comedy in order to learn Italian. If a language is to be spoken by everybody, some invariables must be distilled from the works of poets so that it becomes possible to communi- cate in everyday prose. 3. THE HISTORIC SEQUENCE OF THE INVARIABLES Can the sequence of the seven invariables be modified at will? For example, can reintegration come before antiperspective three- dimensionality, or space in time precede listing functions? This sort of question ignores the historical genesis and gradual development of language. The invariables are not axioms outside of time, absolute truths, but stages marked by specific experiences. William Morris destructured the classical code, took it back to zero degree; and he championed listing, the inventorying of func- tions, and freedom from canons of symmetry, proportion, orders, axes, alignments, and relations of full and empty spaces. Disso- nance marks a later stage. It is not sufficient merely to register functional requirements; one becomes truly aware of them by noting their contrasts. Clearly, then, the first two invariables can- not be interchanged. Antiperspective three-dimensionality devel- oped alongside Expressionism and especially with Cubism, when the object was no longer observed from a privileged viewing point but dynamically, from innumerable points of view. The result was four-dimensional decomposition, the analytical syntax of the De Stijl group. How could De Stijl precede Cubism, when it is one of Cubism s applications? Perhaps the fifth invariable, that is, the involvement of every architectural element in the structural play, could be moved, since it derives from all of modern engineer- ing. But Wright, in the last of his eight sketches reproduced above, correlates it with the poetics of projecting structures and with the dismembering of the box into dissonant panels. As for infusing space with time, this occupies the sixth place, and it could not be otherwise. In effect, this invariable applies the volumetric tech- \r",{"entities":[[312,318,"PER"],[347,360,"PER"],[679,695,"PER"],[700,708,"PER"],[738,750,"PER"],[755,764,"PER"],[811,821,"PER"],[2277,2289,"PER"],[2291,2300,"PER"],[2305,2312,"PER"],[3284,3298,"PER"],[4085,4093,"PER"]]}],["niques of Cubism to the cavities, the vital hollow spaces, the special places of architecture. Finally, it is superfluous to repeat that one cannot reintegrate what has not been separated. Other- wise it would be a question of a priori integration and a retreat to classicism. The sequence of the seven invariables has been established by a historical process that lasted more than a century, and it cannot be altered without serious consequences. Every architect must follow the single stages of this itinerary, always referring back to the preceding invariables, without omission, that is to functional listing, the annihilation of every convention and set phrase, and the radical destructuring of the traditional architec- tural apparatus. The modern language is a precise and almost ruthless instru- ment of criticism, a kind of litmus paper that scientifically deter- mines whether and to what degree an architect is modern. Take Alvar Aalto, for example. His work incorporates listing, disso- nance, antiperspective three-dimensionality, cantilevers, space in time, and reintegration, six invariables magnificently applied. What is missing, however, is four-dimensional decomposition, so that the reintegration in Aalto s works is uncertain, based as it is on the revival of Expressionist and even Baroque themes. It is not compulsory to apply all the invariables, but their se- quence must be respected. Gropius work has listing, dissonance, antiperspective three-dimensionality, and volumetric decomposi- tion; it ignores space in time and reintegration. Mies s European works are a triumph of decomposition and the spatial dynamics that derives from it. But in America he neglected first functional listing and dissonance and then antiperspective three-dimension- ality; hence he reverted to academicism. What about Le Corbusier? He explored all the invariables, but not simultaneously. In his rationalistic buildings, listing and reintegration are missing, al- though the latter is splendidly present in the town plan for Algiers. He rarely decomposed, and when he did it was in the inhibited purist sense. At Ronchamp he inventoried and reintegrated, he stressed antiperspective three-dimensionality and introduced time into space. He broke things down, but he did not decompose them. The seven invariables can be found all together in some of Wright's buildings and to a maximum degree in Falling Water, the Divine Comedy of the modern language of architecture. 4, MISUNDERSTANDINGS OF THE LANGUE/PAROLE RELATIONSHIP It often happens that semiotic research uses new instruments to old ends and unconsciously fosters recrudescences of the academy. One mistake is to exclude masterpieces and exceptional works, the products of creative geniuses, when codifying a language, and to take into consideration only typical or paradigmatic buildings, which represent the average standard. This is to neglect the fact that, lacking a code to make it generally accessible, the modern language has been unable to influence much of contempo- rary construction, which communicates only questionable and not very meaningful thoughts. Excluding masterpieces castrates the modern language. What remains is mediocrity, and that is always academic. The opposite procedure should be followed. Rules should be derived from exceptions, this is the only way the new language can become flesh. The Italian language, for instance, was formalized on the basis of the most important texts, from the Divine Comedy on. Once structured, the language was assimilated at all levels, even that of everyday speech. The same thing can happen in architecture. The invariables derived from masterpieces can be applied correctly by even the humblest builders. But it is vain to seek for the invariables in typical or paradigmatic works, which are such precisely because they do not incorporate the invariables. People spoke Italian long before a codification was derived from the Divine Comedy. The same sort of thing is true in architecture. There are peasant houses, small factories, and vernacular struc- tures, architecture without architects in short, which have spon- taneously applied the seven invariables. The language of the Divine Comedy arose from the vernacular. That poem legitimized an im- pulse from below and, once codified, resulted in the Italian lan- guage. Likewise Falling Water, the product of protracted travail against academic scaffoldings, provides the basis for a popular architectural language. Some semiologists insist that architecture is made of rules and \r",{"entities":[[935,946,"PER"],[2018,2040,"ARCH"],[4361,4374,"ARCH"]]}],["exceptions, but that only the rules can be codified. What rules? Since modern architecture is composed exclusively of exceptions, the only rules there can be are those of the academy. If we codify those rules, we run the risk of regressing to the Beaux-Arts pre- conception of harmony as the rule and dissonance as the excep- tion. This is the opposite of what modern music showed to be the case when it established dissonance as the rule. Theodor Adorno makes this clear: The most advanced technical proce- dures in music set problems that expose the resources of tradi- tional [read: classical] harmony as a set of useless clich s. There are modern compositions in which occasional tonic harmonies appear, but it is this harmony, and not dissonance, which is ca- cophonous .. . (Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno, Dialektik der Aufkidrung, 1947). In architectural terms: academic rules, not the modern invariables, are arbitrary and incongruous. Adorno goes on to say that the predomination of dissonance seems to destroy the rational logical relationships in tonality [read: symmetry, proportion, geometric schemes, equilibrium of full and empty, balance of masses, axiality, perspective alignment, and so forth], that is, the simple relations of perfect harmony. In this, however, dissonance is more rational than harmony, for it offers to view, in an articulate although complex manner, the relationship of the sounds that go into it, instead of creating a unified homogeneous mix that suppresses the individual compo- nents... . Applying this principle to architecture, conventional set phrases without semantic value are always harmonic, tonal, and classicist, while meaningful messages are dissonant and ex- press the reality of things and behaviors. It would be a serious mistake to think, as Mannerists do, that dissonance is possible only in contrast to harmony, which reduces dissonance to a mere exception to the rule of tonality. This is not the case. To quote Adorno again, the new harmonies are not innocent successors to the old consonance; rather, they are distinct in that their unity is totally self-articulated. The single sounds unite to form a har- mony, but within that harmony they can be distinguished one from another as single sounds. In this way they continue to be dissonant, not in respect of some sort of unachieved harmony but in themselves. How many years, how many decades will it take to convince architects of what music has long since mastered? Freedom fright- ens them, and they demand harmonic consistency at all costs. Since life is packed with dissonance, they prefer to take it in at second hand by way of an a priori order. They practice self- censorship and impoverish the language of architecture. They really ought to hang the following quotation from Adorno on their studio walls: The cult of consistency leads to idolatry. Ma- terial is no longer shaped and articulated to serve an artistic pur- pose. Instead the preordained arrangement becomes the artistic purpose. The palette takes the place of the picture. In architec- ture, the palette is all the fetishistic equipment of symmetry, proportion, perspective, and power-inspired monumentality. Other semiologists say, we are interested not in the differences between classical and anticlassical idioms but in their similarities, the elements they have in common. This thesis only seems plausi- ble, because classicism is not a language, but rather a linguistic ideology with no real basis, not even in the architectural works of the Greco-Roman world or the Renaissance. This is the crux of the matter: to deny the existence of a gap between architectural theories and real buildings, between abstract Beaux-Arts interpre- tations and the concrete languages of Greek, Roman, and Renais- sance architecture is tantamount to enlisting semiotics in the cause of reaction. There is no point in searching for a meeting ground between the classical and the anticlassical, for all valid architects, ancient and modern alike, have been anticlassical. Since classicism is an artificial power-inspired construct, it is perhaps comparable to the formal Latin that was exhumed in the fifteenth century for the use of an elite that wanted to avoid the problems of a living language. Would it not be absurd to look for what fifteenth- century Italian and courtly Latin have in common? Ferdinand de Saussure s dichotomy of /angue and parole has gen- erated innumerable misunderstandings in architectural theories, for two reasons: first, /angue has been interpreted not as the con- crete language of buildings but as the contrary, formal Beaux- Arts ideology; second, as a consequence, the paroles, i.e., the cre- ative acts, have been interpreted as exceptions and anomalies, not to be assimilated by the /angue but to be excluded from it. \r",{"entities":[[440,454,"PER"],[781,795,"PER"],[800,817,"PER"]]}],["In verbal language, paroles start out as exceptions and then filter into the normal /anyue. In architecture, instead, they always remain exceptions, because the J/arnyue of classicism is not a real language, but an abstract ideology refractory to anything new. What paroles of Michelangelo or Borromini have ever found their way into the classical language? Not one, as might be expected from a pseudo-language that is frozen by its very nature. The same thing can be said of Wright, Le Corbusier, Gropius, Mies, Mendelsohn, and Aalto, whose words left the Beaux-Arts system untouched. The difficulties that arise in discussions with Saussure s follow- ers derive from their assumption that the true language of archi- tecture is classical. We know that it is anticlassical and always has been. For us, then, the language of architecture is composed exclusively of parv/es and is dissonant, while for them, paroles cannot exist without a /anyxe, and hence the architectural paroles must be referred to the non-/angue of classicism, with disastrous results. 5. THE SEVEN INVARIABLES IN TOWN PLANNING Town planning is so closely related to architecture that one can legitimately speak of urbatecture. The seven invariables are equally applicable to buildings, cities, and whole regions. Is not inventorying functions the first thing to do in preparing a city plan? Is not dissonance indispensable to keep zoning from being monotonous? Likewise, antiperspective three-dimensionality pro- vides the means to counter the mania for monumental axes, chess- board street systems, and predetermined yeometrical spaces, be they square, rectangular, round, or hexagonal. Breaking up the building box is like breaking up the closed plan of the classical city. And space in time? This is just as applicable on the urban scale as it is on the architectural level. And reintegration seems ever more urgent and fruitful in city planning if life is to be infused into organisms that have been zoned to death. Urbatecture. To reintegrate the city means to reweave its very fabric and yive new drive to the various functions of its coeffi- cients. It has been remarked more than once that schools are low-use structures if the city segregates them in separate areas. A school is unused for several hours of the day, all night, on holidays, and during long vacations. This sort of waste is typical of almost all public buildings (theaters, movie houses, government offices, churches, and so forth) and can be eliminated only by reintegrating educational, social, administrative, productive, com- mercial, and recreational functions in a new organization that is different from the present city. In town planning as in architecture, the modern language abhors economic and cultural waste. One beneficial result of the anticlassical code should be the overcoming of a frustration that has plagued city planning at least since the middle of the fifteenth century, when ideal cities were conceived according to geometric patterns, with their grill or radial schemata. These oppressive, despotic, and totalitarian layouts are fostered by authority to contain social life within an ironclad implacable order. Fortunately these ideal cities were never built, despite some negligible attempts. But for centuries the ideal city has been doing serious damage to town planners psyches. Their megalomaniacally rigid programs have never made headway, and planners have developed neurotic persecution com- plexes. They feel unappreciated because urban development re- mains oblivious to their work. Politicians, administrators, busi- nessmen, rich and poor alike display the greatest indifference to their plans. With a few exceptions, city planners have never understood the reason for their lack of success. With no sensitivity to social dynamics, but endowed with a driving mania for gran- deur, they have always tried to regiment society in static, inhu- man, and suffocating constructs. The proof is that ideal cities have been built chiefly for four emblematic functions: military bases, insane asylums, prisons, and cemeteries. Rectangular, circu- lar, hexagonal, and radial plans have found full expression in military installations from the Roman camp on, and in jails. They are fine for places where men are rigidly disciplined or imprisoned, from the Regina Coeli jail in Rome to Leavenworth. This sort of city is ideal only for the powers that be. Even in the field of military architecture, however, there have been rebellious spir- its who rejected the code of geometry. Suffice it to mention Fran- cesco di Giorgio, Sanmicheli, and Michelangelo s 1529 plans for the Florence fortifications. What is particularly symptomatic is the fact that the great here- tics of architectural history Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, Palladio, \r",{"entities":[[634,642,"PER"],[4328,4340,"PER"],[4349,4353,"LOC"],[4357,4369,"LOC"],[4573,4595,"PER"],[4597,4607,"PER"],[4613,4625,"PER"],[4768,4780,"PER"],[4782,4794,"PER"],[4796,4804,"PER"]]}],["\r",{"entities":[]}],["and Borromini never drew up a city plan. They put their stamp on whole cities, true, but without a priori constraints. Theirs was a ferocious and passionate dialogue with the urban organism. These men took it apart and possessed it, they calculated its devel- opment by focal points and nodes of activity, careful never to block its flexibility. It is no paradox to say that the only people not needed in city planning are city planners. Is it conceivable that a city planner rather than an urbatect like Biagio Rossetti could ever have built the Ferrara of the Estes? Does the modern language of architecture repudiate city plan- ning? Certainly not. It repudiates classical planning, which is not based on inventorying functions, dissonance, antiperspective vi- sion, dismembering of the box, space in time, and organic coordi- nation. How, then, can we draw up plans and direct the develop- ment of cities and regions? We may follow the lead of contemporary painting, which rejects the finished object and requires that the observer mentally complete the picture himself. Like architecture and even more than architecture, city planning must arise from an interplay of open hypotheses that can be accepted, modified, or reoriented by society according to its own complex and varied needs. It is a question of taking part in city life from within not passively but energetically day by day and without the rigid authoritarian a priori principles of geometric order. 6. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT ARCHITECTURAL WRITING Is there not a risk that the codification of the modern language of architecture will lead to a new academicism EVill not the seven invartables tend to become precepts like those of the Beaux-Arts school, albett in the opposite direction? This question is typical of many architects mentality. Imagi- nary specters are invented to avoid the responsibility of trying out something new. Why not try, instead, to design a building or teach a course in design based on these invariables? The doubts will vanish the minute you start listing functions. Language concerns forms of communication, but is not the present problem rather concerned with the content of those forms? And, in the last analysis, does not the architects rele in society depend on that verw content? \r",{"entities":[[4,13,"PER"],[505,520,"PER"],[547,554,"ARCH"]]}],["The first invariable, inventorying, is specifically concerned with functional content, building programs, and social behavior. If this invariable is neglected, the whole construct falls apart or, rather, makes no sense because there is nothing to express in dissonance, nothing to decompose and reintegrate. This proves that the mod- ern language will not tolerate alibis or excuses. If the question of content is evaded, there can be only regression to classicism.

The invariables provide a precision instrument for checking every stage of design, from the preliminary sketch to the final working drawings. This has been verified a hundred times at the drawing board and in the classroom. Of course in a rough plan you cannot, for example, estimate the exact degree of disso- nance or four-dimensional decomposition. But the critical method is still appropriate; one asks, can the design at this stage still accommodate the principle of dissonance and decomposition? If the answer is no, then the design is closed, reactionary, and classi- cist and should be repudiated. In the first stages, functional listing alone may be enough.

The vulgar tongue brought Latin to zero degree in the sense that it destructured its code. True. it retained several elements, but it took them out of the context of the old language and gave them a different context. In the same way, modern architecture takes what is good from the past and reveals its anticlassical essence. It rejects and annihilates not the past but the corruption of it that was carried out by Beaux-Arts norms. But why condemn symmetry, which is so common in anerent archite dare and even raises its head in several works by Wright? Cesare Beccaria, writing about crime and punishment (Der esits: e delle pene, 1764), was interested in prisons, not in free democratic communities. Yet he said, It is a false sense of utility that would try to give a multitude of people that symmetry and order which only inanimate material can absorb. That epigraph ought to be carved on the drawing boards of architects and city planners. It a building is conceived as an inanimate monumental object, only to be looked at and not to be used, then symmetry is fine, because it is a perfect reflection of political and bureaucratic authoritarian- ism. But if a building must perform specific Functions and accom- modate particular contents, it cannot be symmetrical, because symmetry, like harmony in music, binds every element to what has gone before and what comes after and to what is above and below, Symmetry sacrifices the particular and individual on the altar of overall design, which is uniform, hierarchical, and unalter- able. As for Wright, it must be said that you cannot invent a new language in a single day. He had to fight the reigning, classi- cism (architectural Latin ), and there is nothing scandalous in the fact that he sometimes used partially symmetrical schemes. But what is more important in Wright, the rare leftovers of tradi- tion or his revolutionary messages? The academic eye concentrates on whatever is obsolete in a genius, from Brunelleschi to Palladio. What we should look at are their original achievements. Why is there such fear of dissonance and asymmetry? The linguist Giacomo Devoto wrote in / dinguayyto dltaha UW is strange that qualified scholars are 50 reluctant to accept the fertile principle of the contraposition of the marginal and the central, which has marked the great transition from one-dimensional to two dimen. sional linguistics, in preparation for the three dimensional disci pline of mudern socivlogical linguistics.

What Plato called language s creativity or evergei led to the doctrine of anomaly. . . . Devo- to s incisive verdict on the Italian language could also be applied to architecture: A selective, classicist, subjective exigency, and hence an impoverishing one, won out over the functional exigency which enriches the idiom. This is a feature of the Italian language that has been felt throughout its history down to our own times. The fear of change leads to the geometric and to symmetry. Nowadavs no one is interested in problems of architectural language or in architecture generally. The challenge comes trom outside the fleld and concerns the struggle far a new kind of citv and a diferent environment. Why bother ahoul the seven invartables? To make the battle more successful and spirited. This came out clearly in regard to a housing project built in Rome in the Pietralata area. A group of leftist students set up a protest dis- play about the conditions in that area. There were posters with photographs documenting the lack of service facilities, the dem- onstrations that had been staged by the residents, police action, and so on. They made a lot of noise, but there was very little in the way of concrete achievement in this protest. At a certain point, however, the students decided to make an analysis of the neighborhood in terms of the seven invariables. They produced more posters showing that none of the invariables had been ap- plied in the design of the area. The display was no longer dema- gogic, and it was infinitely more persuasive. Finallu. tohy ts it that the modern linguaye of architecture has not been codited before? What caused this inexplicable delav, when the new language could have been used extenstociu in the profession and in the schools during these past decades ct feverish balding? No answer to this anguished and almost obsessive question can provide anything more than mere consolation. One may cite a Variety of reasons: (1) as long as the masters of the modern movement were still alive and active, the illusion persisted that some manner connected with their styles could take the place of a codified language; (2) structuralism, semiotics, and linguistics were not sufficiently developed to shake the world of architecture; (3) it took a total reduction to zero degree, not just in architecture but existentially as well, as in the Paris spring of 1968, to stimulate the codification of a democratic idiom. All these explanations are plausible, and others as well, but they are tautological. The question remains. Schoenberg created and codified the language of modern music. Wright, Le Corbusier, Gropius, and Mendelsohn created the language of modern architecture, but they did not codify it. Why? Why didn t someone else do it, then, and spare architecture decades of waste and destruction, false ideologies, and desperate flights into the past and future? In any case, the time has come to spread the democratic language of architecture. 29.

Introduction: Antclassicism and Le Corbusier In Part One I showed that the present-day architectural code concerns not only the masters of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries but all architects who, over the span of history, fought against dogma, hallowed and entrenched precepts, a priori ideolo- gies and theories of style, formal taboos, and the canons of classicism. The modern language emerged and matured out of a simultane- ously creative and critical commitment which, on the one hand, stands for the right to speak architecture in a way that differs from the classical and, on the other, explores history in the search for new roots in the past. We write architecture in a different language because we read it in a heterodox frame of mind. The impulse to write coincides with that of rereading the ancient texts and thus avoiding false interpretations. Architects have thrown off the strictures of classicism. Similarly, historians spurn academic methods of examining and judging monuments. In fact, the critic, from Baudelaire to van Doesburg, is oftentimes one with the artist. How has the time-space language, from nineteenth-century eclecticism to the present day, become structured? This is the theme of the present study, which will trace the dialogue between architecture and historiography, and record the points of contact between linguistic invention and critical research. The breach be- tween the old and the new architecture can be likened to the distance between, say, Latin and Italian or French, one an extinct tongue, the others living with the difference, however, that clas- sicism is not a real language but rather an ideology aiming to 91 \r",{"entities":[[95,117,"ARCH"],[119,123,"LOC"],[159,178,"ARCH"],[184,188,"LOC"],[293,307,"ARCH"],[309,315,"LOC"],[372,380,"ARCH"],[395,409,"ARCH"],[439,457,"ARCH"],[459,462,"ARCH"],[494,499,"ARCH"],[1532,1542,"PER"],[1546,1558,"PER"]]}],["codify any style by laying down abstract formulas and arbitrary regulations, To begin with, we must repudiate two persistent misunder- standings. One is the romantic myth of the ascetic poet who stands aloof from all dialectic involvements with cultural and linguistic events. It is easy to prove that every authentic architect nurtures his inspiration by delving into the past. His elective attinities, however partial they may be, are more significant, yen- erally, than those of the critics because he must face emergencies of the moment and resolve them) The second fallacy is that one can prasp modern architecture without a deep knowledge of its precedents. A brief survey of the cross purposes that marked the most important linguistic ruptures, from the present back to prehistory, will disprove this misapprehension once and for all Asa point of departure, let us consider the most famous expo- nents of the modern movement, Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Cor- busier. Both were endowed with strongly individualistic visions of architecture, yet they culled their ideas from definite historical contexts. Wright was a devotee of Henri Louis Sullivan, (Lieber Mester who, in turn, was dependent on the neo-Romanesque of Henry Hobson Richardson and, by opposition, on American eclecticism Le Corbusier harked back to the origin of European rationalism, to the puritanism of Adolf Loos, enemy of the Vienna Secession, the Austrian counterpart of the Art Nouveau: move- ment created by the Brussels architect Victor Horta in 1893 and spearheaded by Henry van de Velde, passionate apostle of the Enylish Arts and Crafts school With the Red House, built for William Morris tn 1859, came the birth of modern architecture.

The great archaeological digs of 1750-80 and the studies they sparked fomented the Greek Revival in Great Britain: the Bank of England (1795-1827), designed by John Soane, reinterprets the Corinthian order of the Temple of the Sybil at Tivoli; St. Pancras church (1819-22), by William Inwood, imitates the Erechtheum; while Robert Smirke consecrated the neo-Greek style in the British Museum (1823) in London. In Germany, Karl Gotthard Langhans conceived the Brandenburg Gate (1789) in Berlin in terms of the Propylaea of the Acropolis in Athens, and Leo von Klenze set about hellenizing the city of Munich from 1816, while Karl Schinkel, although a sometime devotee of the Gothic, adopted classic elements in the theater and in the Neue Wache in Berlin, as well as in the church of St. Nikolaus (1843- 49) in Potsdam. The contagious fever for Greek models spread across the Atlantic and, from 1820 to 1860, infected the United States, where Benjamin Latrobe and William Strickland were the most ardent champions of the revival. All this, however, is extraneous to our theme, since it makes no contribution to the development of the modern architectural language, in fact only hinders it. Such classicist structures as, for example, the Church of the Madeleine in Paris and St. George s Hall in Liverpool attest to the unconditional surrender of art to erudition: glacial, emphatic magnifications of museum plaster, which in northern Europe, however, virtually evaporated in the ward 2 to erg fog, and consequently had no real dependence on archaeological ae PW ee ep Heretical, on the other hand, in the anti- Beaux-Arts sense, was Ear ah Oe ., a ee Le Corbusier s love for Greece.
