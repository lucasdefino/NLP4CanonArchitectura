From the perspective of our advanced world today we tend to look back at this and wonder how we could even have survived given all the difficulties. We once labeled these people savages or barbarians, and then we called them primitives. More recently we call them hunter-gatherers, as if all they do is obsess about food acquisition. But the !Kung, who have lived in the Kalahari Desert in Botswana for hundreds of thousands of years, spend only about 40 percent of their time hunting and gathering. The rest of the time, they do what most of us might do: they socialize, dance, cook, and rest. In the Kalahari, rmongongo trees, which produce tasty and nutritious nuts by the thousands, proliferate in mile-long groves. Tubers can be dug from the ground, and animal herds migrate through the territory, easy prey for a canny hunter and his poison- tipped arrows. The !Kung live in camps that are rebuilt every year near seasonal water oles. Women make the huts around a common campfire, usually under the shade of a large tree. The huts are not really to live in, since people tend to live mainly outdoors, ut serve as storage areas for tools and as shade on a hot day. The modern world has ittle respect for its venerable ancestors. Because of forced relocations, mining on their territory, and fences cutting across their land, the 'Kung people s survival into the next decades is much in doubt. It is not the natural world that endangers them, but our civilized world. \r",{"entities":[[432,436,"PER"],[460,475,"LOC"],[479,487,"LOC"],[1423,1428,"PER"]]}],["As populations expanded, groups would bud off to form new communities in the next valley or further along the shores. In this way, the first groups of people left Africa some 1.5 million years ago with a second group, our human ancestors, following around 60,000 BCE to slowly yet persistently colonize the globe, reaching the southern tip of South America around 13,000 BCE. First Society people, however, were not nomads as is so mistakenly assumed. Instead they tended to live within prescribed and familiar territories, moving seasonally between winter camps near rivers and upland summer camps for hunting and fishing. The ancient people of Australia, for example, moved in predictable cycles: in some parts of the year they lived in relative isolation, and in other parts they would get together for large annual ceremonial and social events. During the Ice Age (ca. 25,000 BCE- ca. 15,000 BCE), humans faced a global phenomencn the likes of which we have never seen since. The extreme cold, which sent massive, mile-deep ice sheets far to the south of the polar regions, impacted Europe in particular. But the people there did not leave. This was not because they were trapped. It was because those areas ad become a hunter's paradise, with bears, ions, and, above all, huge herds of horses, reindeer, and mammoth moving across the grassy landscape. The Gravettian Culture was the first to master the cold. They developed leather-making and the needle to create fur- ined clothing, boots, and jackets. In great festivals, they congregated near caves where artists had painted brilliant images of animals on the walls and ceilings. What form of magic these places produced is still unknown, but the quality of the art staggers the imagination even today. The animals were painted not as carcasses but as living creatures moving and breathing, and were made by artists who had practiced their skills over a lifetime. As the weather warmed, the hunters moved to the east, crossed Siberia, and around 13,000 BCE crossed Alaska to enter the open plains of North America. Called the Clovis People, they hunted mammoth and then, when the mammoth were all hunted out, they switched to bison. Their sacred landscapes include Seminole Canyon in Texas, with its ancient rock art depicting shamans and sacred animal spirits. 1.2 Haida settlement, Canada The warming of the weather raised the levels of the oceans, separating Japan from China, and England from mainland Europe. It created vast rivers, swamps, and forests teeming with animals and plants, drawing humans to the river shores. It was, one might say, an age of affluence. At Lepenski Vir along the Danube River, a settlement of triangular huts emerged. The people there caught sturgeon, a fish that averaged some 3 meters long. Why go hunting when catching one fish would feed an entire community? The nearby forests provided a wide assortment of berries, mushrooms, and nuts to complement the diet. Nor was this village a solitary community. Similar villages lined the shores, and their inhabitants traveled by boat to connect with each other for ceremonial events. Half a world away, another affluent society emerged along the northwest coast of Canada. It was a favorable site for many reasons. It was in a pocket of relatively mild weather, the result of cross-Pacific winds; it was also sited along the migration path of whales, and salmon came in the thousands to swim upstream to spawn. Huge cedar trees, sacred to the Haida, provided material for houses and boats. The tree was not just wood. Its red color and sweet smell were indicators of its connection to the world of the spirits. Linear settlements sprang up along the shore, cornposed of large, clan- based community houses facing the water. Each house was a sacred diagram designed in relation to the cosmos, which for the Haida was divided into three shamanistic zones: the sky world, the earth, and the oceanic underworld. The building's frame systern consisted of massive roof beams, often more than half a meter in diameter and spanning the width of the house, which ranged from 7.5 to 15 meters. These beams were supported by posts carved to represent important family ancestors or supernatural beings associated with the family s history. Walls were clad with split-cedar planks tied horizontally between paired upright poles. lt was not just rivers and shores that attracted human habitation to make the first settled communities, but also the emerging great rain forests. The Bambuti in Congo still today pay homage to a forest spirit, Jengi, whose power is thought to ernanate through the world. Jengi is seen as a parental figure and guardian. Society is organized around individual households consisting of a husband, a wife, and their children, forrning settlements that can number up to about fifty residents. The women build the huts that, in the shape of upside-down baskets, are made out of a frame of saplings and clad with leaves. Other rain forest cultures developed in Brazil, Central America, and Southeast Asia. Beginning around 10,000 BCE in some places, the great First Society traditions that had sustained human life for so long began to change. Instead of hunting animals, humans began to herd them, and instead of gathering and tending plants, they began to domesticate a few chosen plants and grow them in organized fields. These changes altered \r",{"entities":[[163,169,"LOC"],[2023,2029,"LOC"],[2223,2238,"LOC"],[2242,2247,"LOC"],[2324,2340,"ARCH"],[2342,2348,"LOC"],[2420,2425,"LOC"],[2431,2436,"LOC"],[2442,2449,"LOC"],[2464,2471,"LOC"],[2632,2644,"ARCH"],[2655,2667,"LOC"],[3205,3212,"LOC"],[4518,4523,"LOC"],[5012,5018,"LOC"],[5020,5035,"LOC"],[5041,5056,"LOC"]]}],["1.3 Village scene the imaginaries of the spirit world. Cattle in particular were seen as living gods, requiring daily attendance and a culture of respect. They were not killed for food but were sacrificed to mark special events in the life of the community. Among the Dinka in the Sudan, a man knows his cattle by special names, sings songs to them, and sleeps next to them for long periods of time. Cattle are sacrificed only on special occasions, such as at weddings or funerals. Although only a few cattle-centric societies remain today, the impact of this worldview can be felt even in modern religions. Just as important was the shift from gathering plants to farming. Rice in southern China and eastern India, millet in Africa and northern China, wheat and barley in the Levant, and corn in Guatemala all rose from being just one of thousands of plants that humans tended to the precious focus of effort and devotion. The combined transformation of our relationship to animals and plants produced a new way of life: agropastoralism. While today we call this period the birth of agriculture, we have to remember that crops like rice and barley were not raised as food. They were gods. We have so secularized food production today that we forget that the birth of what we call agriculture coincided wit! profound transformations that deified certain foods and thus, it might be said, guaranteed the proper and complex work ethic needed for their production. The impact on women was particularly profound; harvesting, grinding, storing, and cooking were all largely women s work, as was pottery making, basket weaving, and, of course, the raising of children. The emergence of pastoral and agropastoral cultures produced village societies organized around chiefs with more or less power depending on circumstances. Villages were well calibrated to meet the needs of the animals, to deal with the calendar of planting and harvesting, and to produce the necessary equipment for life, such as the bowls and containers that stored grain and water and that allowed fermentation and cooking to take place. These activities were all governed by ritual practices and unwritten rules of behavior that shaped the destiny of all. But village society could not spread just anywhere. It needed the right combination of good soil for farms, grasslands for cattle, forests for firewood, and upland areas for hunting and, of course, water and salt. The Mesopotamian highlands were perfect for such agropastoral societies, and beginning around 9000 BCE compact villages began to spread along the slopes above the great rivers 1.4 Pottery making in the plains. A similar expansion took place along the Sahel in Africa, where sorghurn was the main plant, as well as in the foothills of the Baluchistan Mountains (barley), in northern China (millet), and along the Yangtze River (rice). By 5000 BCE these places had also established themselves as profoundly different from the First Society worlds that neighbored them, even if they maintained some aspects of the older traditions. Whereas the agropastoral tradition in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, China, and Egypt remained confined by their ecological niches, a remarkable transformation took place in Europe, where between 9000. and 4000 BCE, agropastoral cultures rnoved slowly along rivers and shores to reach even northern Ireland. There the newcomers thrived and built one of the greatest structures of the time, Newgrange, a vast artificial mound with a sacred chamber in its interior that was designed to mark the first rays of the winter solstice. \r",{"entities":[[268,273,"LOC"],[281,286,"LOC"],[691,696,"LOC"],[709,714,"LOC"],[726,732,"LOC"],[746,751,"LOC"],[797,806,"LOC"]]}],[" China: Hemudu Culture ca. 5000-3500 BCE @ Monte Verde <1 Nabta Playa ca. 9600-6000 BCE <1 G bekli Tepe ca. 9000-7500 BCE <1 Jericho ca. 9000 BCE Vinca Culture ca. 5700-4200 BCE <{ Tell Aswad ca. 9000-7500 BCE Clovis Culture Haida Society nene) @ Eridu settled eainac ca. 5000 BCE Hiiyiik u a0) Qe amara (0) (0) .

Forests jad to be chopped down, clay had to be gathered for pots that then had to be fired in ilns, granaries had to established, animals tended to, wool harvested and made into cloth; plants that were once considered food were now thought of as weeds that had to be culled from gardens and farm plots. Decisions had to be made about priorities; children had to learn their respective roles as adults; and priests had to secure the privilege of the divine. Customs had to be followed about social ranking, finding a mate, and building a house. Herds could die because of disease or predators, and crops could be lost to pests or carelessness. Grains could rot, and neighboring tribes could attack. The marshaling of energies that the village required, the stratification of gender activities along with the creation of a new set of powerful gods in privileged communication with the elites, produced a type of cognitive revolution. The cohesiveness that this required is impressive, and in many parts of the globe the village world is still the glue that holds society together. One of the first sites where we see the transformation is Nabta Playa in what is today southern Egypt, some 80 kilometers west of Abu Simbel. It is now an inhospitable desert, but in 9000 BCE it was next to a large lake with pastured shores. The site featured a circle of slender upright stones, the main stones being four pairs set close together. Compared to Stonehenge, built 6.000 years later, the circle is small, measuring roughly 4 meters in diameter, but its purpose was similar: to organize time according to the seasons. Two of the stone pairs are aligned north-south, the other two pairs northeast- southwest. They aided in the observation of the motion of the sun and probably of the constellation Orion. Priests and their associated clans probably came to live at Nabta Playa permanently, with the population swelling periodically with the seasonal arrival of herder tribes who would have come from far afield with their cattle for large celebratory O events. By 3500 BCE, however, Nabta Playa had become increasingly arid: the lake dried up, and the site was abandoned. The exodus from the Nubian Desert to the Nile River played a large role in the development of social differentiation in the pre-dynastic cultures of the Nile Valley. One important link between Egypt and the ancient cattle cult of Nabta Playa was Hathor, the goddess of fertility. Another ritual site was on top of a hill near the village of Urfa in southeastern Turkey. Here, too, the now arid site was once a lush forest. The oldest layer of the site appears to date back to around 9000 BCE. The structures, called G bekli Tepe, consist of several circular dry-stone walls, each of which contains monolithic pillars of limestone up to 3 meters tall. Since there is no indication of any roof covering, it seems that the circles were open-air ritual chambers. They are now called temples, but it is unlikely that they were temples in the sense of being used by a priesthood with organized devotional practices. What went on in these spaces is not known, but they most certainly had links to ancestor cults and might have been used in conjunction with mortuary rituals. The floors consisted of a concrete-like substance made of burnished lime. A low bench runs around the inside of the circle walls. The pillars show detailed reliefs of foxes, lions, Line of sight 6 p \\ 4 \\ al Lkm en i! \\ 1.6 Plan: Nabta Playa, Egypt cattle, wild boars, herons, ducks, scorpions, ants, and snakes, all executed with great skill, demonstrating that precision work even without metalworking tools was possible even at this early time. f we add to these two sites the Niuheliang Ritual Center (ca. 3500-3000 BCE) in northern China, with its numerous platforms and structures, and, of course, Stonehenge (ca. 3000 BCE}, we have four ritual centers and there are certainly countless more that served as gathering places and eventually as religious centers for newly settled communities. Niuheliang will be discussed in this chapter; Stonehenge, perhaps the last of the great early ritual centers, will be discussed in the next. Around 3500 BCE something quite remarkable happened in four places on the earth: groups of people developed something that we today call cities. This transformation was not as natural as one might assume, even though it was dependent on several thousand years of village life and the necessary cohesion that came with it. In Mesopotamia, the farmers in the hills at first stayed away from the vast, overgrown, flood- prone swamps of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. But an intrepid group must have set out one day to try their luck. Finding a knoll, they dug up the reeds, planted barley, and carved out canals, activities that were hugely \r",{"entities":[]}],["labor-intensive. It was a success, built on the simple premise that by doing one thing well growing barley the inhabitants of an isolated place could trade for everything that they did not have. They created the wheel to speed up travel; they created writing to document trade transactions; they created city-scaled gods to protect them; they laid the foundation for laws and regulations; and they created walls to defend their precious grain surpluses on which the entire operation depended. The first cities of Mesopotamia were thus experiments in an extreme landscape. They were governed by an elite, with most of the work done by slaves from nearby conquered regions. Some cities thrived, some did not, but over time, the power and wealth that they created for themselves pushed their destiny forward. In Egypt, the story is similar, but here the rise of cities more like sprawling villages was the consequence of the rapid influx of refugees from the expanding Sahara Desert. Prior to about 5000 BCE the Nile was an unruly, lightly populated, swampy river, but with the drier climate that created the desert, thousands of people came with their animals and agricultural skills. Over tire they refashioned the Nile into a fertile paradise. The intensity of this foreshadowed the rise of a controlling elite who became first chiefs, then gods. 1.7 Gobekli Tepe, near Urfa, Turkey In India along the Indus River, cities also emerged, spectacular in nature, because unlike in Mesopotamia and Egypt where the building material was largely mud-dried brick, here the inhabitants made kiln-fired bricks that could not only withstand the test of time but also allowed them to build close to the river, and to build pools, drainage systems, and multistory houses. Ships from these cities traded with the Mesopotamians to the north. In China, the development of cities had a slightly different cast. Village communities had formed in the south in the swarnpy regions around Hangzhou Bay and the Yangtze River estuary, where rice could be planted. Villages were also forming in the north where people had long since discovered the value of millet, a hardy plant that grows on hillsides. Here people used a form of architecture well-known in the north since 25,000 BCE, the pit house. Dug partially into the ground with a superstructure of thatch held in place by posts and beams, these communal buildings were dry and warm and the focus of a range of ritual activities. Unlike the Mesopotamian cities, which were import-export centers, these dense villages were more self-sustaining as they attained the scale of cities. There were areas for the manufacturing of pottery and bronze, just as there were areas reserved for the elites. 1.8 Elam, a typical Mesopotamian city with walls and towers, as depicted in this bas-relief commemorating Assyrian king Ashurbanipal s conquest and destruction of the city in 647 BCE. These first cities produced a concentration of wealth and power that was to have significant implications for the destiny of humans and indeed for their definition of thernselves as civilized. But as much magic as they worked on the human imagination, these cities experimental nature should not be forgotten. Cities were made; they were also made to be destroyed. The Chinese, in fact, would continuously destroy their cities; with a new dynasty, the old capital was often burned or leveled and the inhabitants forced to relocate. The Mesopotamians and Egyptians glorified their destruction of enemy cities, and so it went on until even today. Although urban densities were able to pull a large amount of resources into their orbits, around 3500 BCE they constituted only a tiny percentage of the world population, maybe as small as .001 percent. Most people lived in spread-out village societies, and many more lived in a world with no agriculture at all, as humans had for hundreds of thousands of years. \r",{"entities":[]}],["BEGINNINGS OF CHINA S CIVILIZATIONS In China, the shift to an agricultural/village world took place around 9000 BCE. There was, however, no single origin of Chinese civilization. Instead, there was a gradual multinucleated development taking place somewhat independently at first, with the emphasis to the south on rice and to the north on millet and pigs. Rice grew wild and was then domesticated on the swampy shores and in the delta of the Yangtze River. Millet, which prefers a cooler climate, grows wild on hillsides, where it over time was also domesticated. Pigs played a role in village life from early times and, along with sheep, were introduced to northern cultures by 5000 BCE, if not earlier. By 4000 BCE, especially in the north, small but well- organized regional cormmunities emerged. These included the Hongshan Culture 4700-2900 BCE) to the north of Bohai Bay in Inner Mongolia and Hebai Province, and the Yangshao Culture (5000-3000 BCE) in Henan Province. Geographically between the two, and developing later, was the Longshan Culture (3000-2000 BCE) in the central and lower areas of the Yellow River. The emergence of walls around communities is a clear indication that the political landscape was very much in flux. To the north, villages were generally composed of pit houses that, whether large or small, trace their ancestry back to 20,000 BCE and possibly earlier. Pit houses were used throughout Inner Asia by steppe hunters. People to the south developed houses on stilts, a natural response to the swampy soil of the rice paddies. Niuheliang Ritual Center he Hongshan Culture, with its villages focusing on millet and sheep and pig grazing, was located along the Laoha, Yingjin, and Daling Rivers, which empty into Bohai Bay. Though scattered over a large area, the community's ritual life focused on a sacred landscape in which a mountain known locally as Pig Mountain must have played a part, as its silhouette is visible to the south. The ritual center consisted of at least fourteen urial mounds and altars over several hill ridges. It dates from around 3500 BCE, but its importance could well have been established earlier.

The site might even have attracted supplicants from further afield. A key building was a structure that is called a goddess temple, though its purpose is not known. The walls, made of interwoven branches and covered with packed mud, leaned inward to form a tunnel-like space. Its main body was 25 meters from south to north, with secondary spaces projecting from that. On the outside, its surviving footings show that its surface was covered with geometric designs in high relief that were painted yellow, red, and white, all of which certainly suggests that it stood out in the landscape in a colorful way. To its north was a single detached room where excavations have uncovered clay body parts, including a head, a torso, and arms, belonging to an image of a protectress or goddess (from which the site got its name). 1.10 Plan: Cairn with stone tomb, Niuheliang Ritual Center, tomb site II \r",{"entities":[]}],["Another structure of interest to archaeologists is an artificial hill at the entrance to the valley. On the ground level, the mound is encircled by a ring of squared white stones. Another ring of white stones is embedded at the middle height of the mound; a third was placed near the top. Artifacts found near the top of the mound include crude clay crucibles used for smelting copper. Since the top of a hill is a surprising place to melt copper, the structure seems to have been meant for ritual events. Burial grounds on hills seem to mark the north and south extremes of the moonrise in the east. All in all, this center contains the essential elements of Chinese ancestor worship burial cairns, platforms, and a ritual temple as evidenced, for example, by the Ming tombs built five thousand years later. Cross section 1.12 Reconstruction of circular dwelling at Banpo 1.11 Reconstruction of Banpo village, China In the valleys of the Yellow River we see the emergence of several compact villages, such as Banpo (near the modern-day city of Xi'an), which dates to about 4500 BCE and was part of the Yangshao Culture. It was surrounded by a ditch or moat 5 to 6 meters wide, probably for drainage and defense. The homes were circular structures of mud and wood with overhanging thatched roofs, all raised on shallow foundations with fire pits at the center. Entrance ramps sloped down into the dwelling. Such pit houses, with furs lying on the floors and hanging from the inner walls for insulation, were comfortable places to live. If the timber bears could be kept dry and the thatch was properly maintained, a pit house could last twenty years. The dead were buried in the back of nearby sacred caves or in simple pits outside the village in a communal burial area. The remains of children, it seems, were interred in urns just outside their homes. Within the town there were large open plazas and storage holes, and at the center of the village was a large house, presumed a clan or community center, which was built of a heavy timber construction. One area of the village was dedicated to the production of pottery, indicating the emergence of craft specialization. Pottery was used not only in daily life but also in mortuary rituals.

A shaman is an intermediary between the natural and the spiritual worlds who travels between these worlds in a trance. A tomb at Puyang, dating from about 4000 BCE, is likely that of a shaman priest. It was made in the shape of a single, squarish room with a lobed space at the rear. A man was buried in the pounded earth floor, flanked by a dragon on one side and a tiger on the other, both painstakingly and beautifully made of hundreds of shells. Dragons and tigers, still central to Chinese Confucian symbolism, are considered to be prospectors in both life and death. Hill ranges, especially those with prominent peaks, are considered to be dragons. Along the Yangtze River, farrners had developed rice as their prime staple by around 5000 BCE, if not earlier. It was a labor-intensive crop that required level fields and the precise monitoring of water levels. The first culture to master rice farming was the Hemudu. Given the swampy nature of the land, the people at Hernudu built elevated houses that served for both living and storage. The houses were also ritual centers. This house type was introduced by rice growers to other parts of the world, most notably to Japan and the Philippines.

These platforms (known as hang-t'u) were created by pounding layers of 12 to 14 centimeters of earth onto each other with wooden or stone mallets, creating a very hard and long-lasting material. Since what was built on top was made of wood, nothing of this superstructure remains. A Liangzhu Culture ritual altar at Yaoshan, located to the west of Tai Lake, gives some indication of the religious edifices of the time. A ditch defines a sacred precinct extending over 25 meters square, at the center of which is a platform 1.15 Walled city of Shijiahe, China measuring 6 by 7 meters constructed of rammed red earth, red being a particularly sacred color. Archaeologists found twelve graves, presumed to have belonged to priests, arranged in two rows within the platform. It is still unknown how this platform was used, though it most probably involved ancestor worship and ritual feast offerings. The use of jade for religious and devotional objects was by this time common to all of the Chinese cultures; the quality of Liangzhu jade was, however, quite remarkable. Though there were several sources, one was in the mountain deserts of modern-day Xinjiang Province in the northwest of China. \r",{"entities":[]}],["General built-up area N &, : Mehrgarh | A Ye S / 7000-5000 sce ft Zp Harappa | ae 6 3300-1900 sce bon a . ; Mehrgarh * Raluchisian & 6500-2800 sce 1.16 Location of the Indus civilizations bo lountains Sy N : & of Mehrgarh and Harappa A Mehrgarh'| & This period is characterized by the | 5000-3200, ece N i , Arabian Sea MEHRGARH AND EARLY INDUS SETTLEMENTS Though evidence of the Neolithic occupation of India dates back to 10,000 BCE, settled cultures began to emerge around 7000 BCE, in the eastern hills of the Baluchistan Mountains in today s Pakistan.

Around 6500 BCE, one community seemed to rise in importance and became the first in a long line of proto-urban environments that were soon to grow here. Known as Mehrgarh, it was strategically located overlooking the Kachi Plain southeast of modern Quetta near the Bolan Pass, an important gateway connecting South Asia to the rest of the continent. Its five-thousand-year history can be traced from a village to a regional trading center that covered, at the peak of its development, an area of 200 hectares. By 3500 BCE, its occupants had mastered extensive grain cultivation.

Outside one such granary, along its western wall, a large hearth has been found, complete with several hundred charred grains. Along the southern wall, archaeologists found the remains of the stone tools and drills of a steatite- or soapstone- cutter s workshop. On the eastern side, there were heaps of animal bones mixed with ashes, indicating the presence of intense butchering activity. Life, in other words, was organized around the sacred granaries. The granaries were also associated with mortuary practices: human bones, presumably those of priests, were found buried in its corridors and intermediary spaces. Archaeologists excavated about 360 such tombs, in which the dead, sometimes buried with tarred baskets, had funerary effects including skillfully crafted ornarnents.

O , 8 THE VILLAGE NETWORKS OF MESOPOTAMIA AND THE BALKANS The shift to village-world farming took place in the Levant around 9000 BCE. During a few centuries of cold weather, two plants in particular seemed to thrive, wheat and barley. The locals figured out how to tend these grasses into larger and larger patches. This, combined with the domestication of sheep and goats and the herding of cattle, produced a culture far different from that of their ancestors. Ritual practices changed, as did gender roles. Clan lineages became important, and with clans there emerge chieftains, who along with ritual specialists managed the complex sequence of activities. By 8000 BCE, a network of agropastoral villages had forrned in the highlands of the Levant and from there spread eastward into the upland reaches above the Euphrates River and even northward into the Balkans. Catal Hilyiik As village communities developed in the hills of the Levant and overlooking the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, one commodity was sought after in particular: obsidian. This black volcanic rock with its sharp edges could be fashioned into small blades that were attached to sickles. The result was a much faster harvesting time. The problem was that obsidian was a rare commodity that came from the mountains in Anatolia. 6000 sce Tell Halaf Tell Maghzaliyah Tell Hasuna Mesopotamia comes from the Greek words mesos and potamas, meaning middle river, and refers to the fertile plain between the Tigris and Euphrates _-The Fertile Crescent is an agricultural region that runs along the foot of the Taurus and Zagros Mountains in a broad arc from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean to present-day lraq.

Known as Catal HUyuk, the city (near the modern city of Konya, Turkey) dates back as far as 7400 BCE; by the third millennium BCE it had a population of about eight thousand. The city was located in the center of a large, well- watered valley and next to a river that fed into a nearby lake. The lake and river have long since dried up. What has been recovered archaeologically is but a small part of the city that followed the slopes of the hill. The city consisted of rectangular flat- roofed houses packed together into a single architectural mass with no streets or 1.20 Typical Iranian mountain village passageways. Astonishingly, walls made of mud bricks reinforced by massive oak posts were not shared, meaning that where we see a wall, we are really seeing two walls, one for each house. Why this developed has not been clearly answered. Inhabitants moved across rooftops and descended into their homes through the roofs via ladders. Light came through small windows high in the walls. If a family died out, its house was abandoned for a period of time, leaving gaps in the urban fabric, until eventually the space was reclaimed. The typical residence contained one large room connected to smaller storage rooms. The main room was \r",{"entities":[]}],["Probable extent of city .

Figurine representations of her, made of a variety of materials, have been found throughout the village. One statue, remarkable for its bold three-dimensional design, is of a voluminous seated wornan giving birth. The chair on which she sits has armrests in the shape of lions. The figurine represented fecundity and regeneration, and was part of the widespread mother- goddess worship typical of European and Mediterranean late Stone Age and early Bronze Age societies. Catal HUyUk was at the northern end of a zone of developing urbanization that reached from Jericho (in Israel) to Tell Aswad (in Syria) and Susa (in Iran). Jericho was a major city probably the largest in the whole area. Like Catal Hiiyik, it had the benefit of local mines. Susa had the benefit of a well- established network of nearby villages in the Zagros Mountains, which constituted a close supply of metals. The Karun River, a river no less important than the Tigris and Euphrates, connected the city to the world at large; grains, figs, and lemons were raised in the river's broad valley. Tell es-Sawwan The climate in Mesopotamia back then was cooler than it is today, meaning that the verdant valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers were far different from the deserts found in the region today; in the highlands, forests were interspersed with steppes and savannas rich in flora and abounding with goats, boars, deer, and foxes. Farmers worked in the valley, but the community lived in the more easily fortifiable hills. Shepherds lived in the steppe regions between the farms and the deserts. In the areas around the Black Sea, one would have found a similar fabric of habitation, except there the locals discovered that their hills contained obsidian, copper, and salt, which became important commodities for trade. Around 5000 BCE the two worlds cohered into recognizable cultural formations: the Vinca in Romania and the Samarra in Iraq. A few places stood out, like Jericho (in Israel) and Tell Aswad (in Syria, 30 kilometers east-southeast of Damascus), which were larger than the rest. Also important was Catal HUytk in Turkey, which was a key source of obsidian, a volcanic glass that was needed for sickle blades. One of the most important groupings of villages dating from this period (6000- 3500 BCE) was located just to the east of a rain-fed agricultural zone that arches northeastward from the northern tip of the Persian Gulf along the flanks of the Zagros Mountains. Among these settlements was Tell es-Sawwan, on the left bank of the Tigris near Samarra. It started as a small village that became fortified, growing over time into a substantial community. The plan shows a clear hierarchy, with the important buildings in the southern half. The central building is symmetrical and has a hall or corridor down the center; it was built at a later stage in the development of the village. Its purpose is unknown, but it was possibly a granary. There are about seven or eight houses that have nearby areas for sheep and goats. The basic building material was mud and timber; the mud was mixed with reeds and dried in a mold to create bricks, an innovation that remains a characteristic of the region even today. Rooms were rectilinear, measuring, on average, about 1.5 by 2 meters. The horizontal roofs were made of beams of oak on which were placed a layer of branches and reeds sealed with mud, bitumen, and gypsum. The interior wall surfaces were decorated with gypsum plaster, which had been developed as early as 7000 BCE and which was to remain a central part of building construction in the entire area. From the extensive outcrops of rock gypsum in northern Iraq and Syria, stone blocks were mined, stacked, and burnt to form an easily transportable white powder. This building material was not only used locally but also exported as a trade commodity. The development of trade in craft goods, pottery, building materials, and metal objects stimulated the economies of the region and played a central part in its drift toward craft specialization and urbanization. The Samarra Culture produced abundant grain, which was then exported to surrounding regions. Though we often think of the Tigris and Euphrates region as the birthplace of urban civilization, the truth is that civilization if that complex and awkward word can be used, at least in this area was the product of a combined culture in which some people raised grain while others built mines. The oft repeated image of Mesopotamia as a Fertile Crescent is flawed if one does not add the Metal Crescent that embraced it. In Mesopotamia, grain and metal were mutually reinforcing commodities. The principal copper-producing areas stretched from the Caspian Sea through Anatolia and around the Black Sea. An important early Copper Age society, known as the Vinca Culture, flourished from 5500 to 4000 BCE in an area that stretches from present-day Bosnia to Romania. Whereas the Mesopotamians developed mud- brick walls covered with plaster to protect the walls against moisture, the Vinca lived in freestanding rectangular houses with walls made of wattle and daub. The roofs were pitched and made of thatch. Their ritual world was intense. The Vinca had house shrines with an assortment of strangely carved deities that governed fertility and that spoke to the ancestors or gave omens. \r",{"entities":[]}],["1.27 Vinca statuette The Taurus Mountains in eastern Anatolia, known for their tin mines, played an equally important part in the West Asian economy, since tin was needed, along with copper, to make bronze. Though there were many copper-producing areas, tin was more rare. An ancient tin mine was discovered at a site named G ltepe, which was a large village from around 3290 to 1840 BCE. The miners, using narrow shafts, brought cassiterite ore to the surface, where it was crushed, washed, and smelted with charcoal in small crucibles rather than in the large furnaces characteristic of copper-smelting sites. By measuring the enormous deposits of slag (600,000 tons in one pile), researchers have ascertained that this was a major site during much of the early and middle Bronze Age. Metal began to play an important part in international relations in the third millennium BCE. Around 2350 BCE, Sargon of Akkad invaded Anatolia from his lowland base to secure trade routes. In records that have been found, he boasts that a single caravan carried about 12 tons of tin, which can make 125 tons of bronze enough to equip a large army. Today it is widely accepted that mining was responsible for vast deforestation and played an important part in the desertification of western Asia. 1.29 Iraqi marsh 3 EA & S ca %, > marsh area Susa Uruk@ Eridu 1.28 Location of Eridu and Uruk Eridu and Uruk With this in mind we can now better understand the rise of the first cities in the marshes of the Tigris and Euphrates areas. Though villages spanned the area from the Levant into northern Syrian and Iraq, few people ventured into these marshes, overgrown with tall reeds, useful for boats and thatching but little more. It was an extreme landscape that had no lumber for roof beams, and no metal or even stone. But around 5000 BCE we see the first atternpts to transform this landscape. Societies gave up their partial dependency on an integrated farming-hunting lifestyle and concentrated on farming alone, the aim being to produce huge grain surpluses that would be traded for other things. These cities were not secular adventures. They were built at the command of the deities who in a sense sponsored these Older agricultural area ee coastline 3% a a % og Sip surplus-making enterprises. In Mesopotamian mythology it was never the humans who created cities, but the gods themselves. But back in the realm of the humans, the making of these places did go hand in hand with technical advances. The Tigris and Euphrates, unlike the Nile, flooded before the harvest, in April and May; this had made lower-lying reaches unusable for agriculture. But sedimentation brought by the rivers tended to build up natural levees that farmers could reinforce, allowing the canal bed to become somewhat higher than the surrounding countryside. Farmers could then make openings in the levees to feed water into the irrigation channels, as they still do today. Aerial photography has recently proven the extensive nature of these ancient canals and dikes, some of them more than 100 kilometers in length. \r",{"entities":[]}],["1.30 Temple atop the stone-faced platform at Eridu, near Abu Shahrain, Iran The relationship with the rivers was a delicate and dangerous one. The systern was vulnerable to flood, war, and neglect. Records from Ur deal repeatedly with repair work. But the investment was worth the effort. In a few centuries the area became an economic engine unparalleled anywhere in the world except in Egypt. Though these cities are discussed in relationship to advances in agriculture, what we really see are cities serving by necessity as export and import centers. Eridu and Uruk were, in a sense, modern cities dependent on a single economy of grain, requiring the control and movement of goods. It thus stands to reason that it was here that the wheel came into its full use to haul loads over long distances, and that standardized weights were invented at this time. Another innovation was one of the great civilizational achievernents: writing, which was put to practical use to record trade transactions and keep up with inventory. Concomitant with this was the development of a legal and archival system. Evidence of the impact this made can be found in vestigial remnants of words deeply embedded in our present-day language. In Ur, the ancient title designating king is /uga/, which is probably the origin of the Latin word fex ( law ) and the English word /ega/. And another ancient Mesopotamian word, pala, referring to the garment of kingship, constitutes the root of our word palace. We see the emergence of a cormplex religious world in tune with the equally complex life of urban civilization. The mother goddess, who had ruled in many places throughout Eurasia, now had to compete with an expanding list of divine presences including powerful male gods who tied society firmly into a network of obligations. Significantly, the mother goddess Apsu, who controlled the oceans, was killed by her son Ea, earth, who divided her unruly waters into chambers. Concurrent with the shift was the emergence of a priestly class responsible for all aspects of society, from religion to administration to technology. The priestly class was responsible not only for the proper communication with the deities through food sacrifices and ritual events, but were also the architects of increasingly larger buildings to stage their power. The culture that first began to master the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers as early as 5000 BCE was known as the Ubaid. Around 3000 BCE, they were superseded by the Sumerians, who were to no small degree the first modernizers, replacing old and well- established traditions with new and better- organized ones. Eridu was located on the banks of the Euphrates in the delta, which has since silted up so that the ancient site is now located 90 kilometers inland. Originally, however, Eridu had easy access to boats coming up from the south. 1.32 Temple XVI-XVIII at Eridu The temple at Eridu was rebuilt seventeen times (4500-3800 BCE), with each effort built directly over the earlier one, and with each one being bigger and taller, resulting in a massive building, a veritable mountain of bricks. The earliest temple was a sirnple box with an altar at the back and an oven outside in the front, where sacred bread offerings were prepared. The last ternple, positioned on an enormous plinth of clay bricks, was painted in vibrant colors and was visible for miles. It had a form defined by rhythmically spaced buttresses, and though roughly rectangular in shape, it had an irregular perimeter. A flight of steps at the center of the broader side led up to the entrance, where a shallow vestibule gave access to a large central room oriented lengthwise. Ancillary spaces, probably used as reliquaries, were located at the corners. \r",{"entities":[]}],["a : 1 } 1.33 Statue of King Gudea at Eridu, with a temple plan carved on a lap tablet The chief deity was Ea, son of the mother goddess Apsu; he was not only an earth god but also manifest in sweet waters. He was seen as crafty, for he avoids rather than surmounts obstacles, goes round and yet gets to his goal. Ea, who in some accounts made human beings by mixing his own essence with that of his brother, Enlil (the earth and storm god), was also worshipped as the god of wisdom and as a friend to humankind. Images of Ea show hirn wearing a cloak of fish scales, and fish bones have been discovered near the offering table at Eridu. A text written somewhat later states that When Ea rose, the fishes rose and adored him, He stood, a marvel unto the deep...

The Temple at Eridu served as a prototype for later efforts: a statue made about a thousand years later, in 2150 BCE, shows the plan of a temple with similar attributes. It is no sketch, but a precise plan with door and pilasters drawn in, all to scale. It is placed on the lap of King Gudea of Lagash and, in its accuracy and precision, leaves no doubt as to the planning that went into these early temple designs. Its position on the king's lap also proves that the plan was more than just a convenience of the builders: it was an expression of the claim to legitimacy of the monarch and his sacrosanct function. 1.34 A size comparison of Eridu, Susa, and Uruk Uruk developed into a significant, large city with a possible population of fifty thousand. It was dedicated to the god Anu, a sky god, an important and newly emerging deity linked to the number one, and thus to mathematics and trade. His temple, the so-called White Temple, begun around 4000 BCE and expanded over the next centuries, rested on a broad terrace on top of a tall artificial hill, irregular in outline and rising 13 meters above the plain, with its vast expanse of fields and marshes.

In the White Temple, however, there was in one corner a platform or altar with a flight of narrow steps leading up to it. Toward the middle of the space was an offering table with a low semicircular hearth built up against it. To the west of the building there was another temple built out of stone that had been imported from the mountains to the west. Its purpose and the reason for its peculiar plan are not known. 1.36 Plan: White Temple at Uruk During this time, Mesopotamian builders discovered how to use the kiln to harden bricks, roof tiles, and drainage tubes. The Mesopotamians may have acquired this skill on their own but more likely learned it from the Indus Valley civilization, with which they most certainly were in contact and which had developed brick very early on. As wood for kilns was scarce in the Mesopotamian marshes, bricks were a luxury iter and were mainly used for palaces, temples, and gates; the Gate of Ishtar at Babylon is the most famous. The kilns devoured enormous amounts of wood, depleting wood resources and contributing, it is now thought, to the growth of the desert that is today pervasive in these parts. The use of brick in building foundations in Uruk indicated a building's status. The brick city wall was seen even by Mesopotamians as one of Uruk s wondrous aspects. Near the beginning of the epic of Gilgamesh, composed in the later third millennium BCE, we read: Look at its wall which gleams like copper, inspect its inner wall, the likes of which no one can equal! Take hold of the threshold stone it dates from ancient times! Go close to the Eanna Temple, the residence of Ishtar, such as no later king or man ever equaled!

It was here, as we have seen at Nabta Playa, that cattle were first domesticated. But in the sixth millennium BCE, a dramatic warming affecting the whole globe changed North Africa bit by bit into the endless stretches of sand that we now call the Sahara Desert. The populations moved either westward to Morocco, Spain, and beyond, or eastward to the banks of the Nile. The density of the Nile River population was unlike anything one would have seen anywhere else in the world at that time; that it did not overwhelm the social systern was predicated on several conditions, one being that the local elites quickly learned to define themselves as divine, assuring the mechanism by which to protect and isolate their power. This meant that Egyptian religion never went through a chthonic phase based on the mother goddesses and caves that were common in many places in Eurasia and the Mediterranean and that would thrive in places like Crete and Malta for a long time.

This explains why a complex pantheon of gods, stretching from the bovine Hathor to the more abstract Ptah and Amun, could develop so quickly. It was only during the New Kingdom (1540-1069 BCE) that the features of this religion began to have a broader role in society. Another factor that stabilized Egypt's existing social order was that the Nile flooded after the harvest in the middle of October; more people working the fields therefore resulted in the production of more food. But in contrast to the celebration of water and food, there was, for the Egyptians, the fearsome entombing power of the earth. Life and death, the river, and the mountains of sand became intimately and naturally connected to each other around the all- encompassing mythology of divine rulership. The tombs of the First Dynasty (3100- 2890 BCE) are located at Abydos, an important early city about 100 kilometers downstream from Thebes. The tombs are outside of town under the face of an imposing cliff. A gorge opens out dramatically through the cliff at that spot and, according to some scholars, this opening was regarded as the entrance to the netherworld. The site was accessed by a processional route from a valley temple. The oldest tombs, of Narmer and Aha, are rather simple brick-lined rooms placed in the ground and covered with a wooden roof at ground level. Aha s tomb consisted of three chambers stockpiled with provisions for a lavish life in eternity. There were most likely large cuts of ox meat, as well as freshly killed waterbirds, loaves of bread, dried figs, and jars of beer or wine, each bearing Aha s official seal. Beside his tomb more than thirty ancillary graves for servants and animals were laid out in three neat rows. he tomb of Queen Merneith (ca. 2900 BCE), is, like its predecessors, largely sunken underground, except that now the storage rooms are part of the main structure, in the form of long, thin rooms. The ancillary tornbs are also integrated into the design as a type of frame set at a respectful distance from the tomb chambers. his framing is open on its southwestern side, presumably so that the spirit of the dead can exit through the gap toward the gorge. he tomb of the next ruler, Den, makes this connection to the cliff even more explicit. hough the main entrance is from the east, there is a special chamber next to the tomb with a separate staircase leading back up to the surface and to the west. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Be WSS Merneith 1.39 Royal tombs at Umm el-Qaab The design and the decoration of these tombs clearly anticipates the development of the mastaba (from the Arabic word for bank ). The grandest was the tomb of King Djed at Saqqara (ca. 3100 BCE), just outside of Memphis. Some argue that the complex niche pattern in the walls represented wooden or reed construction; others have suggested an influence from Mesopotamia or the Near East. Only the five central chambers, dug into the earth, constitute the tomb. The whole was roofed over and plastered to appear as a solid but colorful plateau set against the sand. There was a low bench surrounding the superstructure at the base of the main exterior wall; on this platform were laid about three hundred clay-modeled bull's heads provided with real horns. The facade was was painted white, whereas the innermost panels of the large niches were painted red. In this early stage of Egyptian culture, there was no temple architecture such as one might find in the Mesopotamian cities, where religious practices, highly visible around the ziggurat temples, unified broad swaths of society. Instead, architecture, defining the interface between life and death, was reserved for the elite. Its place 1.40 Tomb of King Djed at Saqqara in society was thus more limited, but its purpose could not have been more drarnatic. Death for the Chinese involved the handing down of family memories and could be articulated spatially with house shrines and fragile wooden temples on earthen mounds. In Egypt, death in religious terms was a dramatic event only for the ruler, with his (or sometimes her) spirit rising majestically over the trivialities of domesticity and family in a specially constructed, simulated house with all the accoutrements of a comfortable life. What went on in that house, and how the spirit moved about, ate, and drank, was a matter of great concern, since it was thought to determine the flow of history in the present time and beyond. But the house was only half of the equation. Death in Egypt had an inside and an outside shape. Entombing the house at the scale of the landscape was the structure s outside shape. Eighty percent of King Djed's mastaba was nothing more than a mass of walls and spaces linking these two scales. The architect s job, in essence, was to bring the inner and outer manifestations of the ruler s death into unity. 1.41 Bull horns at the base of Tomb 3504, Saqqara, Egypt \r",{"entities":[]}],["@newgrange 1.42 Megalithic cultures, 4800-1200 BCE EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENTS Europe's complex geography of shorelines, rivers, and mountain ranges made it unlikely that it would arrange itself into a single civilizational unit like those in Egypt, China, and India. Furthermore, because of the difficulties of transplanting grain northward into different climatic regions, Europe was only fully settled around 3500 BCE. Because European cultures developed without the history of agricultural domestication, their focus was not on family matriarchal histories through which such knowledge was, by necessity, handed down, but on the clans that could pull communities together for defense, war, and trade.

But unlike in Mesopotamia, where death was still a relatively informal affair, or in Egypt, where death-as-eternal-life was in essence reserved for the elites, the Europeans magnified death around clan lineages, building a variety of stone and mound structures in places that preserved clan memories and that served as places for ceremony, gathering, and trade. Barrow tombs or passage graves, for example, consisted of a passageway made of large stones, sometimes ornamented with carvings and paint and mounded over by tons of dirt and clay. Examples can be found throughout Europe in Portugal, Sardinia, France, and England, and as far north as Norway as well as in Morocco, and span the period from 5000 BCE to 2500 BCE.

Generally speaking, when things went well, this was attributed to the gods; when things went badly, this was seen as a sign of divine displeasure. Mesopotamian cities were the most unusual since they were created in the context of an extreme landscape of marshes that were converted into agricultural land. The first Mesopotamian cities can be considered risk societies, based on the gamble that producing huge surpluses of grain would allow them to trade for commodities that were not readily available. The cities thus became ritual centers in their own right, where the relationship to the sacred was organized and mastered with calendric precision. The elites who governed the city were devotees of a complex pantheon of gods who in turn governed all aspects of nature, even human. The elites operated in close alliance with a priestly class for whom huge temples were built in the form of artificial mountains rising in colorful terraces. The ziggurats at Eridu and Ur were by far the most extensive buildings of the age, Arabian Sea testament to the wealth flowing to the cities. They were prestige buildings, made just as much by deities as by human labor. The cities that were built around them consisted of a dense fabric of houses. Most buildings were made of mud brick with wooden roofs. Outside the walls, along the canals, one would have found a vast network of small villages that were controlled by the temple. But these cities had limits on how far their authority could reach, and so they existed in tense alliances with similar cities up and down the river. Egypt, less prone to invasion, developed a clear dynastic power structure and a consistent set of religious traditions from an early age. Furthermore, due to the seasonality of local agriculture, farm workers could be summoned by the pharaohs to perform forced labor on building projects. Zoser's mortuary temple, built on an unprecedented scale, was one of the first monumental stone buildings in the world. The mastery of stone masonry is one of Egypt's great contributions to architecture. The expansive mortuary complex answered to the intricate cosmology used by its Egyptian elites. The building was made for a dead pharaoh who was deemed to be still alive and thus in need of the illusion of rulership in perpetuity. His spirit was embodied in a statue, called the Ka statue, which was ritually fed and housed in a special chamber so that he could see the western sunset through a small hole. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Meanwhile, around 2500 BCE, people moved down from the Baluchistan Hills and settled in the river valleys that define the eastern edge of the South Asian subcontinent those of the Indus and the now dried-up Ghaggar- Hakra Rivers. The Indus/Ghaggar-Hakra region was the first urban civilization in the true sense of the word. The reason for its success is obvious. The 900-kilometer- long valley is hemmed in to the north and south by vast stretches of dry and rainless mountains and deserts. One can imagine it as a linear oasis. Irrigation here was easier than in Mesopotamia, and the plentiful supply of trees allowed for the early development of fired bricks that withstood the ravages of water better than mud brick. More than a thousand cities and towns have been discovered spread over 650,000 square kilometers, an area roughly equivalent to that of modern-day France. Though these cities were distant frorn each other, they shared a common language and a standardized system of weights and measures. Thousands of terra-cotta seals depicting a wide range of human, animal, and mythical forms have been found, each with distinctive markings that are presumably letters of an alphabet. The inhabitants, about whom we still know very little, seemed to have called themselves something akin to Meluhha. That, at least, is what the contemporaneous Mesopotamians called therm. Ships carried bricks, beads, lumber, metals, and lapis lazuli up the Persian Gulf to the cities of Mesopotamia, where such items were scarce. The nature of the return freight is uncertain, since few Mesopotamian objects have been found at the Indus. The area between Mesopotamia and the Indus was also urbanized with cities such as Tepe Yaha and Jiroft, in the once fertile and expansive Soghun Valley. Tepe Yaha specialized in mining a highly desired stone used to make ritual bowls. Not far away was Jiroft, an even larger city, which specialized in the production of highly prized, golden-flecked lapis lazuli. This Zone of Interconnection was linked to a fourth civilizational area that had been developing around the Oxus River and was known as the Adronovo Culture. It was based at first around small villages, but two large cities were eventually built (in today's Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) that were not only of great size but were designed with great geometrical precision. The area, drawing on the steppe landscape of inner Asia, was a center of extensive pastoral communities. In China the first recorded dynasty, the Xia dynasty, emerged around 2100 BCE. We find there a horizontal civilization of villages and towns unified around palace centers. One of these was Erlitou (1900-1500 BCE). Lying on the Yi River, a tributary of the Luo River, Erlitou was located at the foothills of the mountains and served as an interface zone between the mountain area rich in ore and the plains rich in grain. The palace complex was surrounded by a 2-meter-thick rammed earth wall that set it apart as an ancestral ceremonial center for the elites. The elites made extensive rituals that required vessels and other instruments. This meant that craftspeople lived near the palaces. In this way, cities emerged not as temple economies as in Mesopotamia, but as a consequence of palace economies. In both cases, small elites ruled over large swaths of population because of their association with the gods and ancestral deities. But whereas in Mesopotamia important ritual events were something on the order of public spectacles, in China such rituals garnered esteem because they were highly private. Meanwhile, Europe, between about 5000, and 3500 BCE, had slowly transformed into an agropastoral world of interconnected villages. Large polities never developed, meaning that there was no centralization of power and nothing that could be called cities. It was a world still governed by sacred landscapes and ancestor rituals. The most famous sites are Carnac in France, Stonehenge in England, and Newgrange in Ireland. But there were hundreds of lesser sites, from Scotland south to Portugal. Around 2800 BCE commenced the spread of the Beaker People, whose origins are still debated but who most likely came from the Balkans. They are named after their culture's distinctive pottery drinking vessels. Known for their advanced metalworking skill, the Beaker People left their traces in various locations. They arrived in England, where they encountered such sites as Stonehenge, which they took over and redesigned, orienting it to the sun rather than to the moon. While physically this was largely a matter of fine-tuning, the cultural implications this reorientation presupposes are imponderable. Stonehenge, since 3000 BCE, when the first stone circle was built, becarne a huge ceremonial zone attracting people from far afield. There they awaited the sacred moment of winter solstice, when contact with ancestors was most propitious. Far to the south, on the island of Malta in the Mediterranean, emerged an astonishing culture that built large caves mounded over with tons of earth. The small island eventually had a dozen or so of these structures, probably used as places where supplicants, under the spell of singing and hallucinogenic drugs, would experience dream visions. Since there were many more of these temples than the local population could possibly need, it is quite likely that this was a sacred landscape that also served people from surrounding Mediterranean communities, who would arrive by boat. Stonehenge and Malta represent the last such sacred landscapes. In other places, the ritual world was being pulled increasingly toward the city. In fact, the great accomplishment of the Mesopotamian cultures was precisely to equate city with ritual center. Apart from an agropastoral zone that stretched west to east just below the Sahara Desert, the rest of Africa was still First Society, as was all of the Americas. But the Americas should not be written off as a hunter-gatherer world. Many communities had developed into affluent societies. The Northwest Coast peoples in Canada, for example, thrived from about 3000 BCE until the arrival of the Europeans in the 19t! century, one of the most enduring First Society cultures in the Americas. Another site of importance was in the area to the north of the Mississippi River delta. The yearly flooding of the river allowed large annual ceremonies to take place on a bluff overlooking the river, called Poverty Point, where a massive artificial mound, seemingly in the shape of a bird, was built. It seers that \r",{"entities":[]}],["different tribes helped build the mound with clay brought to the site in basketfuls from their home areas. To the east of the great mound there was a 300-meter-wide dance area surrounded by raised ridges on which temporary huts were erected. Communal construction of such large ceremonial sites became an important aspect of what is now called the Mississippi Culture, which lasted into the 16th century. In Peru, we see a remarkable transformation. Intrepid farmers left their hillside terraces on the Andean mountain slopes for the arid valleys along the Pacific Coast. The intent was purposeful. The newly arriving farmers channeled the river waters to grow cotton for the making of fishing nets, and gourds to be used as floats. But they were not fishermen. The fishermen lived on the coast, and they traded with the newly arriving agriculturalists in a way that was mutually beneficial. It was a novel and extraordinary arrangement that first took place at what is now called Caral, about 200 kilometers north of Lima. 2.3 Mnajdra Temple, Malta he Zoser Mortuary Complex and the temples of Malta bring to the fore a way of understanding the originating power of architecture as models. Today we tend to think of models simply as practical devices used in the preparation of a design. Yet the history of architecture is filled with structures that serve as built models. The Zoser Mortuary Complex is entered through a portal that leads past a corridor of colurnns painted to look like gigantic reeds. The visitor literally passed through a scaled-up model of the swampy shores of the Nile, symbolizing not just the transition between life and renewal but also the difference between the human and divine scales. Egyptians continued to build such scaled-up models; their colurmns are all large models of flower bundles, richly painted and even emitting, in principle at 2.2 Zoser Pyramid, Saqqara, Egypt least, a divine fragrance. Architecture as model is even more obvious in Malta, where the temples are models of caves, purposely dark and mysterious. The Maltese also made some of the earliest known representations of buildings in history. The purpose of these small models, no more than a few centimeters across, is unknown, but it has been suggested that they served as tokens given to devotees after a visit. They were more than trinkets; they were living pieces of the temple, which in turn was itself a living entity; thus, a model was a sure way to link its owner to the life force of the temple. The use of architecture as model remained a key element of its core purpose. Even the stepped structures of Caral are models of sacred mountains, created to charge up or enhance the potency of the landscape. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Caral Galgada Stonehenge @) wata@ ciza/Sanuara Gonur Mohenjo-Daro ow Indus Valley: Early Harappan Period 5000-2600 BCE A Newgrange ca. 4000 BCE Human settlement of Malta ca. 5000 BCE \r",{"entities":[]}],["Mohenjo- ca. 2600 Mesopotamia: Early Dynastic Period ca. 2900-2350 BCE A Temple at Uruk ca. 3400 BCE 3500 BCE Egypt: Pre-Dynastic Period ca. 4500-3100 BCE Ghaggar-Hakra Civilization 7000-1800 BCE Daro A A Dholavira BCE ca. 2650-2100 BCE A Lothal ca. 2400-1900 BcE Margiana and Andronovo Culture ca. 2500-1400 BCE A Arkaim ca. 1700 BCE A Gonur ca. 2500-1700 BCE Akkadian Dynasty ca. 2350-2150 BCE A Akkad A Ziggurat at Ur ca. 2300 BCE ca. 2100 BCE Palace of Naram-Sin A A Mari ca. 2170 BCE ca. 2200-1800 BCE 2500 BCE 1500 BCE Early Bronze Age ca. 3000-2000 BCE Old Kingdom ca. 2649-2150 BCE Middle Kingdom ca. 2030-1640 BCE A Step Pyramid of Zoser ca. 2650 BCE A Bent Pyramid ca. 2600 BCE A Great Pyramid of Khufu Brittany and British Isles: Megalithic building cultures ca. 4200-2000 BCE A Stonehenge Begun ca. 3000 BCE Building of megalithic temp! ca. 3600-2500 BCE A Tarxien Temple ca. 3100 BCE A Ggantija Temple ca. 3600 BCE ca. 2580 BCE Beaker Culture ca. 2800-1800 BCE @ Sarsen Ring added at Stonehenge ca. 2500 BCE @ Bluestone circle added at Stonehenge ca. 2300 BCE les North and Central Andes: Early Ceramic Cultures ca. 4000-1800 BCE Ala Galgada ca. 3000-1500 BCE @ 3100 BCE A Caral (Supe Valley) AEI Paraiso ca. 2600-2200 BCE ca. 1800 BCE Mythic base date of the Maya long-count calendar Mississippi Culture ca. 3500 BCE-1500 CE \r",{"entities":[]}],["THE INDUS GHAGGAR-HAKRA CIVILIZATION The Indus Ghaggar-Hakra civilization went through roughly four phases of development: 1. The urbanization of the Ghaggar-Hakra River valley, ca. 2800 BCE 2. The rising dominance of four cities Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro, Rakhigarhi, and Ganweriwala ca. 2500 BCE 3. The new urbanization of areas south and east, ca. 2200 BCE 4. The post-decline reurbanization of the Ghaggar-Hakra River, ca. 1700 BCE The period around 2500 BCE was generally one of expansion and prosperity throughout West Asia and the Indus. Certainly the cities along the Ghaggar-Hakra River were being enlarged, and their builders became world masters of hydrology. Burnt bricks were used to construct huge platforms that served as the bases for the cities and for defensive walls, but also to control floodwaters. And most important, elaborate interconnected drainage systerns were designed to disperse storm waters. A central drain under the main gate of Harappa still stands in place. lonetheless, the Indus flooded many times, each flood burying the city under a thick ayer of silt. Harappa was rebuilt at the same spot at least eight times. It is thought to have ad a population of about fifty thousand. There were also specialized cities, such as a port and mining towns. Dholavira had to solve a hydroengineering problem opposite of Harappa's: Because the city sits in a very dry area, the issue was not keeping floodwater out, but ensuring that enough water could e harvested for the dry season. The solution was a Series of strategically located dams that controlled water during a flood and also directed some of the water to huge, rectangular, shallow man-made lakes that surrounded the city and that could be tapped in summer. In Lothal, a port city, water was let through a sluice into a vast rectangular tank that some speculate functioned as a dry dock for seafaring vessels. India Arabian Sea Arabian Sea 2.4 Neolithic sites and the Indus Civilization The largest cities were divided into an upper town, which was on the highest ground and had large palaces and ceremonial spaces, and a lower town, which had most of the housing. The upper town usually had its own wall within the general wall that surrounded the whole city. At Dholavira the boundary wall was over 9 meters thick. Burials were often under mounds just outside the city. Though these cities clearly had a social hierarchy with a strong ruling class (confirmed by the fact that they were divided into sections with larger and smaller houses), there is 2.5 Site plan: Dholavira, Blachau, India (0) Mohenjo-Daro .

There is also the depiction of a proto-Shiva-like divinity sometimes shown sitting in the lotus position. He wears bull horns on his head and seems to be worshipped by animals of all sorts. There is also a proliferation of sculptural figures dedicated to fertility and procreation. \r",{"entities":[]}],["2.6 Reconstruction view of Dholavira Early in the second millennium BCE, the Ghaggar-Hakra begun to dry up. The reasons are debated, but it seems an earthquake in the Himalayas caused one of its major tributaries to change course and drain into the Indus, depleting the Ghaggar-Hakra. Its waters collected in an inland lake that spawned a successful maritime community around its shores. Subsequently, the lake, too, dried up, bringing about the final phase: the abandonment of the entire Indus Ghaggar-Hakra region. Where the people went is still debated, but the majority probably dispersed eastward to the plains of the Ganges River. Some, however, may have gone westward and relocated as far away as Assyria, causing a ripple effect of disruptions that were felt all the way to Egypt. 2.8 Urban fabric of Mohenjo-Daro, in Sindh Province, Pakistan 2.7 An entrance gate to Harappa, near Sahiwal, Pakistan Mohenjo-Daro Mohenjo-Daro was the dominant city of the southern Indus. The Indus, which originates in the high Himalayas, is frequently subject to ice floes and landslides that can hold back its waters for a while but that eventually give way, resulting in huge flash floods. To guard against these, the two largest building areas of Mohenjo-Daro were raised high on a platform of bricks designed to disperse the floodwaters through a series of culverts. (The site of Mohenjo-Daro itself receives very little rain.) Under the main streets were drains running to settling tanks, which could be accessed and cleaned. Mohenjo-Daro s neighborhoods were inward looking. The main streets were lined with the largely blank walls of houses, and even the secondary streets usually did not have any major houses opening directly onto them. Accessible by alleys only, the houses faced into open courtyards, with the larger ones often having two stories, the upper level built of wood. The number of rooms in houses varied from two to more than twenty. A good number of the rooms contained wells, and the larger ones had bathrooms and toilets. \r",{"entities":[]}],[" 2.9 Plan: The upper town of Mohenjo-Daro Located at the intersection of the major north- south and east-west streets, the Great Bath of Mohenjo-Daro, as it is called, was very likely the social and ritual center of the city. Its 12-by-7-meter pool, which was 3 meters deep, was accessed by means of symmetrical stairs on the north and south. The bath is surrounded by a narrow deep-water channel, and an outlet from one corner of the bath leads to a high-corbelled drain that eventually empties out into the surrounding lowlands. Burnt bricks lined the pool, while a layer of biturnen waterproofed it. Whereas the urnt bricks were certainly locally made, the itumen must have come from Mesopotamia. tt was, obviously, a highly valued commodity, and its use in the Great Bath is another indication of the importance of the building. he water tank was surrounded by a brick colonnade, behind which was a series of rooms of various sizes (one had a well). The whole structure had a wooden second story, although the central pool was probably open to the sky. Access was carefully controlled, with only one opening from the south. Ritual urns with ashes presumably of important people were found close to the entrance. One can only guess at the social practices that led to such an institution, but the very presence of the Great Bath indicates the dominance of water and ritual bathing in the inhabitants ideology, themes that seem to carry through into modern-day Hinduism. To the west of the bath is a building with doorless rooms crisscrossed by narrow ventilation channels. Archaeologists originally assumed this was a granary, but more recent evidence suggests that it may have been a general-purpose warehouse. Its proximity to the bath is not to be overlooked. \r",{"entities":[]}],["MARGIANA Today, the northern foothills of the Turkrnen- Khorasan Mountain Range near the Caspian Sea are a desolate and relatively depopulated area, but thousands of years ago they would have been steppe, providing a perfect area for grazing, combined with farming along the river.

Sargon, an Akkadian king who reigned from around 2334 to 2279 BCE, reshaped the Mesopotamian political landscape; his was the first known successful centralization of power in the region. The idea of village- based civic loyalty, so important to early Sumerians, was replaced by the concept of loyalty to a ruler, with Sargon taking 2.14 Statue of the head of an Akkadian ruler 2.13 Early Lower Mesopotamia Eridu, Uruk, Ur, Lagash, and, farther to the east, Susa, which lay on the Karun River, formed a larger economic environment, with trade developing toward India to the south; toward Sialk, a metal-producing city on the other side of the Zagros Mountains; as well as toward points northward. In Lagash, archaeologists discovered the remains of a storehouse that contained not only supplies of grain and figs but also vessels, weapons, sculptures, and numerous other objects connected with the use and administration of palace and temple. Though these cities seem small by today s standards, at the time they would have been the largest in the world, along with Memphis in Egypt. The economy of the Sumerians was thus twofold: a northward-looking Mesopotamian-based one, and a southward-looking trade economy with the measures that deliberately diminished the power of local chieftains. This new concept of kingship is expressed in the statue of a head representing an Akkadian ruler, found in the city of Nineveh. It is notable for its bold features, artfully braided beard, and majesty of bearing. The mouth, from which the pronouncements of law and rule issued forth, is as expressive as the eyes, which were once inlaid with stone, resulting in an active image in marked contrast to the quiet and contemplative stare of the Sumerian figures. Sargon s capital city, Akkad, was located on the Euphrates about 30 kilorneters south of modern Baghdad. Around 2150 BCE, the Akkadian dynasty was overthrown by tribes fromm the mountainous northeast that descended to the plains, contributing nothing to the civilization they ransacked. The survival of Mesopotamia was now suddenly dependent on kingdoms in the old Sumerian south. The Sumerians took up the challenge, drove the mountain people back, and reunited the realm under the kings of Ur. These kings, part of the Third Dynasty (2112-2004 BCE), accepted many of the innovations that had been created under Sargon. These Sumerian cities were not only in communication with cities along the Persian Gulf, such as those of the Elamites, but also perhaps with the hundreds of cities in the upper Euphrates proto-Persians and Indus River cities. region. The rulers of Ur defined kingship as a privilege that descended from heaven and was bestowed upon one city at a time, but only for a limited period. There was no notion of a single political entity comprising a nation in the modern sense. Rulers were, in essence, stewards of the gods who gave them protection and guidance. The temples, however, were the principal landowners, which, to all practical effects, reant that the priests controlled and organized the labor needed to build and maintain the irrigation canals and ditches. Priests were, in effect, the managers of the city s economy and infrastructure. eS ie} 50m bt 2.15 Plan: The Palace of Naram-Sin \r",{"entities":[]}],["2.16 Group of statues from the Abu Temple, Tell Asmar, Iraq The political structure was thus a type of theocratic socialism in which all the people worked in their various capacities from slave to priest in the service of the city- state. The chief god was Anu. Below him was Enlil, the earth or storm god, and Ea, the water god whom we encountered in Eridu. Nanna, the moon god who ruled in Ur, was among a group of gods at a slightly lower level. He measured tirne and provided fertility. Senior members of the pantheon served as patron deities of individual cities, while deities of lesser rank were associated with smaller urban centers. There were over three thousand other gods and demons that governed even inanimate objects like pickaxes and brick molds. The flexibility with which the minor gods and goddesses came and went and syncretically changed their names makes it difficult to be specific about a Mesopotamian pantheon. Some of these deities were shared across various regions; some were part of local cults. This divine population was thought to meet regularly in an assembly and to arrive at agreements that bound all deities to the more senior deities. The ternple was the actual domicile of the god rather than merely a place that permitted contact between the ruled and the divine powers, although one of the priests principal jobs was the interpretation of omens, which had a powerful influence on every sphere of activity in Sumerian society. Mesopotamian religion was heavy in superstitions and subscriptive behavior. Life after death was portrayed as a sad and pitiable state, and the dead as potentially hostile toward the living. Apart from rituals to appease the dead, burial architecture was thus rare. A person's association with the gods was based very much on the fulfillment of his or her duties in the here and now and on the principle of constant vigilance. For the manufacture of cult statues, for example, a text, slightly modified here, reads: When you make the statues of cornel wood in the morning at sunrise you shall go to the wood. You shall take a golden axe and a silver saw, and with censor, torch and holy water you shall consecrate the tree.... You shall sweep the ground, sprinkle clear water, set up a folding table, sacrifice a sheep and offer the shoulder and fatty tissue and the roast, scatter dates and fine meal, set out a cake made with syrup and butter, pour out beer, kneel down, and stand up in front of the cornel tree and recite the incantation: Evil is the broad steppe. With golden axe and the silver saw you shall touch the cornel tree and cut it down with a hatchet; you shall damp it with water, then remove the set-out material, kneel down and break the cornel tree into pieces.* *Frans A. M. Wiggermann, Mesopotamian Protective Spirits: The Ritual Texts (Groningen, Netherlands: Styx, 1992}, condensed from pp. 7 9. The person then carves the statues as if clad in their own garment, holding in their right hand a cornel-stick charred at both ends and with their left clasping their breasts. After writing his narne on the statues, the person was asked to bring the statues he had made to his house for the purification ritual, placing them on a pedestal in a walking pose so as to repel the evil ones. He was then asked to touch various parts of the house while reciting incantations and performing other prescribed rituals. Statues such as these were set up in temples, creating a charged ocular and oracular environment, with the eyes of the supplicant seeking to establish an unblinking connection between the profane and the sacred. Coming back from the other direction were the silent commands of the gods, translated into words by the priests. This exchange played itself out most grandly in the ziggurats. \r",{"entities":[]}],["2.17 Plan of Ur, near Nasiriyah, Iraq Ziggurat at Ur The Ziggurat at Ur was one of the most impressive structures of the time, and remains of it are still extant at Tall al Mugayyar in lrag, about 42 kilometers south of Babylon. Some reconstruction drawings show it as a freestanding object similar to an Egyptian pyramid; it was in actuality surrounded by precinct walls to the east within which was a large square-shaped sanctuary dedicated to Nanna s divine wife, Ningal. A law court was close by. The whole was eventually enclosed by its own set of defensive walls. The ziggurat measured 65 meters by 100 meters at its base, was 21 meters high, and consisted of three terraces, with the sacred shrine on the highest one. Though the ornamentation of the ziggurat cannot be confirmed, the building was not the volumetric heap of bricks that we see today in the 20th-century reconstruction. 300m Three monumental staircases rose up the northeast flank of the ziggurat, converging at a canopied vestibule at the top of the first platform, 20 meters up from the ground. From there, the central stair continued on to the next stage and then to the third. Though highly axial, the axis did not carry through to the surrounding architecture. Access to the court was not from the front but diagonally from a gate at one of its corners. The plain brick of the modern-day reconstruction can give a misleading impression of the structure. The sides would have been plastered smooth and painted to serve as a visual key to a cosmological narrative, the principal character of which was Apsu, the god of the primeval waters who fathered heaven and earth. Despite his importance, he was defeated and killed by Ea, who transforrned Apsu into still or stagnant subterranean waters. The lowest terrace of the ziggurat, representing Apsu, was painted white. The next terrace, probably black, represented Ea floating on and dominating the water. The Mausoleum 2.18 The Ziggurat at Ur within the temple complex of Nanna top level would have been red, representing the sun-kindled air. The blue tiles that were found on the site are thought to have come from the temple at the top, which would have represented the blue heaven above the earth. What made this structure so innovative is that the elements the stairs, the platforms, and the temple itsel were no longer arranged as a geographical mass, as at Uruk, but were brought into the embrace of a unified and dramatic color-coded design. Geographical simulation had been replaced by an architectural abstraction. The start of a construction of such a scale was initiated by elaborate rituals in which the king fashioned the first brick and carried up the first basket of earth. This act of dedication was commemorated by the burial of peg- shaped copper figurines in the foundation. The hard work was done by slaves taken from conquered lands, a common practice of the time. The structure was made of square flat bricks mortared with bitumen. Reed \r",{"entities":[]}],["matting soaked with bitumen was inserted horizontally at various layers to add cohesion and protect against vertical shear forces. The bricks were stamped with an inscription reading Ur-Nammu, king of Ur, who built the temple of Nanna. That ziggurats served as symbolic conjugal sites is proven at Ur, where the ziggurat was linked by a watercourse to a small temple 6 kilometers west of the city dedicated to the mother goddess Ninkhursag. She was represented by the cow, whereas Janna, the moon god who ruled over Ur, was sometimes referred to as a bull. Once a year, Ninkhursag, the Lady of the Mountain, whether embodied in statues or y a priestess, would have been brought to the city in a procession and led up to the shrine on top of the ziggurat to consummate er marriage while sacrifices and chants proceeded outside. Similar notions exist in Hinduism and in ancient Greece, with the celebration of the mystic marriage, the hieros gamos (from hiero, sacred, and gamos, marriage ). Ninkhursag thus represented the older goddess tradition that had been preserved and incorporated into the more complex mythologies needed after the move into the Mesopotamian marshes. The city of Ur was almost oval in shape, with the Euphrates River coursing around its sides. There were harbors on its north and west sides, with the temple complex clamped between them. The surrounding walls, as is the case in all Mesopotamian cities, were intended just as much to impress as to protect. From their ramparts one would have seen the vast stretches of cultivated fields in all directions, as well as the villages of farm laborers tending them. The presence of gardens and orchards near the walls was also common. Much effort was made in the design and outfitting of the gates, which were flanked by towers whose tops were decorated with bands of shields. The visitor, upon entering through the gates, would immediately confront the densely built-up jumble of the city. There was, however, little evidence of organized city 2.19 Massing of the Ziggurat at Ur planning. Royal roads would be designed only later. Streets varied from narrow lanes to routes 2 to 3 meters wide and served not only as passageways but also as a convenient place in which to dump garbage, a practice that was still encountered even in medieval Europe. Because windows were rare, the narrow lanes forrned curving chutes punctuated only by doors or enlivened by lean-tos where food or goods were sold. 2.20 Pictorial view from the northwest: Ziggurat at Ur \r",{"entities":[]}],["Mediterranean Sea Lower Egypt GizaA Memphis (Mennof-Ra) sagasraL A Meidum A yan aliN Upper Egypt Thebes 2.21 Egypt, ca. 3rd century BCE EGYPT: THE OLD KINGDOM Though later Egyptians described their early history as emerging after the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, archaeological evidence suggests that unification was a protracted process that took place over several centuries. Out of this unification emerged what later Egyptians would themselves call the Old Kingdom, with its capital at Memphis. This new political unity, combined with the rapid development of a powerful bureaucracy, was the final stage of Egypt's transformation into a complex and vertically structured society with a population of several million farmers and slaves. It has been estimated that by the third millennium BCE, the Nile Valley produced three times its own domestic requirements. From very early on, plenty of labor was available above and beyond the stage of self-sufficiency. Soon, huge workforces of slaves, laborers, technicians, bureaucrats, and cooks were employed solely for royal projects. And there was no shortage of building material. Stone was abundant up and down the Nile: the colorful red granite of Aswan, the white marble of Gebel Rokham, and the black basalt of Faiyurn not to mention the various types of soft sandstone brought downriver from Nubia. One tremendous obelisk of red granite 41 meters long still lies on its side in the quarry near Aswan.

The Mortuary Complex of Zoser, located on a slight hill west of Memphis and just to the north of Saqqara, was enclosed by a 277-by-544-meter wall laid out in precise orientation to the four cardinal points. The walls were of white stone and rose to an impressive 10.5 meters. They served the symbolic purpose of defending the mortuary complex from the chaos of the unordered world outside. There were fifteen gateways, three at the north and south walls, four on the east wall, and oddly five on the west wall, yet only a single one was a functioning entrance. The building is something of a mystery. Clearly the dead pharaoh was still considered to be alive, but since his perceptions were limited, his new divine world could be simulated in strategic pieces. One entered the complex from the southern end of the eastern wall. The visitor passed through a 1-meter-wide hallway into a narrow corridor defined by two rows of columns attached to wall fins that projected into the space and supported a massive stone ceiling.

They are fluted and simulate a reed bundle, thus imposing on the visitor the difference of scale that separates the divine from the mortal world. The shadowy entranceway led to the south court in front of the step pyramid. This was the Sed festival court, where ceremonial races were enacted. In the centuries before the Old Kingdom, the king had to prove that he was strong and capable of ruling by running a course for each of the provinces he governed. If he failed, he would be sacrificed in a religious ritual. From this derives the name Sed, or slaughter festival. By the time of the Old Kingdom this practice had died out, but it remained an important element in the symbolic attributes of kingship. Zoser conceived the complex as a review stand for this event, which lasted five days, ending with a final ceremonial sprint. Originally it was to be held for every king in the thirtieth year of his reign, but that was not always the case. Ramesses || celebrated his Sed in grand style by inviting foreign dignitaries. PBR SS Since Zoser did not live long enough to perform this ritual, the court was designed so that he could perform it in death. his is confirmed by the complex s two mastabas: one on the south side, next to the wall a type of fake mastaba and the other, belonging to Zoser, to the north. The two structures have almost identical tomb lesigns, a room at the bottom of a 28-meter- leep shaft sealed by a 3-ton granite plug. In the southern mastaba, archaeologists found the wall decorated with small blue tiles with a glaze just as brilliant today as it was four thousand years ago. The tiles represent a reed matting set in stone posts designed to imitate the appearance of wood, the whole thing creating the illusion of an outdoor canopied room. Between the tile sections is a large stone relief of Zoser running the ceremonial race. The northern mastaba was covered with a stone superstructure with four gently sloping steps. No sooner was that built than it was decided that the structure should be expanded yet again. It was transformed into a 60-meter-high, six-tiered structure by adding material in the northerly direction. The first mortuary temple behind this step pyramid was also rebuilt and expanded. To the east was another court, lined on both sides with chapels, one for each of the Egyptian provinces. Behind them rose the facades of ten tall dummy buildings, replicating a Be io for a 2.25 Entrance hall to the Mortuary Complex of Zoser government buildings or, more likely, granaries. Slender colurnns, drawing on the imagery of reed bundles, ornamented their surfaces. On their other side are engaged columns with smooth-angled shafts holding bell-shaped capitals modeled on the shape of the papyrus flower. Like the reed-shaped columns, the papyrus also had symbolic value. The north part of the cornplex was dominated by a monumental altar to which offerings were brought each day, a metaphor for the offering place of the northern heaven. In a small chapel positioned against the north side of the pyramid was a life-size statue of Zoser, showing him wearing a priest s Sed festival cloak, a ceremonial beard, and a ritual headdress. Sitting in the dark chamber, he gazes through two small holes in the wall placed at the statue's eye level, through which he could watch the ceremonies taking place in the court. This is the Ka statue, and the structure was nothing without it, as it embodied the still-living spirit of the king. The statue had to be tended to and provided with food and drink. Though a Ka statue might have been placed near the altar, others were placed in the mortuary temple. If anything were to happen to the Ka statue, the spirit of the deceased would never gain entrance to the heavenly realm. The principle of living ancestors is an ancient one and is common to most cultures across Africa and Eurasia. Here, however, it is the pharaoh s Ka that reigns supreme in the ancestor world. \r",{"entities":[]}],["po 1 i Original mastaba an) Final enlargement 2.26 Section through step pyramid and tomb of Zoser This building represents a shift in the idea of death and its associated religious practices. The low-lying mastabas of the pharaohs were no longer considered worthy of rulers, who now ranked among the gods. In classical Egyptian, the word for tomb actually meant a house of eternity or, more precisely, a house for eternity. The pyramids were certainly built for eternity, but they were now defined differently, as the place where one ascends. And this might explain the steps, since that was a literal form of the Egyptian glyph, namely a set of giant steps. After Zoser, the pharaonic institution began to assert its cosmological narrative with ever-greater force and precision. One of the places where this manifests is a cult center for the falcon-god Menthu not far from Medamud, a provincial town 5 kilometers northeast of Karnak at Thebes. The sanctuary, which dates frorn about 2500 BCE, consisted of a roughly lozenge-shaped enclosure 83 meters at its widest, surrounded by a high wall with a gate to the east. The interior contains a grove of trees and two burial mounds that could be interpreted as the primeval mounds appearing above the waters of chaos. Burial chamber a 1 1 t 4 L ue With Snefru (2613-2589 BCE), who ruled during the Fourth Dynasty, one sees the maturity of the Medamud prototype. But it took Snefru several tries. His first project was the step-faced pyramid at Meidum. The location of the two tomb chambers was innovative. Separated horizontally in the Zoser temple complex, here they are placed one on top of the other, the lower one representing the chthonic aspect of the Egyptian religion. Snefru abandoned the building after fifteen years of work and started another, larger pyramid complex 50 kilorneters north, near Dahshur. Originally planned to be a towering 150 meters high, it was too bold, and the ground gave way under part of it. In an effort to save the building, the designers added a kink or bend to reduce the weight and angle of the slope, which is why it is today called the Bent Pyramid. 30m The failure forced Snefru to ask his builders to return to the Step Pyramid at Meidum. They added a layer that transformed it into a true pyramid, but this time only after careful preparation of the ground. (In Roman times, the stone facing was removed to be made into stucco. Hence it is possible to see the original form.) Still, it was not enough for Snefru. He constructed a third pyramid two miles north of the Bent Pyramid. Not as steep as the earlier ones, it is called the Red Pyramid because of the reddish cast of the stone. This is where Snefru is actually buried. Construction was so well thought out that despite the weight of the 2 million tons of stones on the roofs of the chambers, cracks have yet to appear. The harmonious proportions of the form and the perfection of the system of tomb chambers made it the model for subsequent tombs. 2.27 Ka statue of Zoser \r",{"entities":[]}],["Pyramid at Meidum Step Pyramid of Zoser, 150 m_ Red Pyramid 2.28 A scalar comparison of Egyptian pyramids Pyramids at Giza Pyramids are only the massive residue of an extensive ritual architecture that included temples, causeways, ports, shrines, and even special tombs for the sacred boats that carried the sarcophagus and other objects.

Six million tons of solid masonry, consisting of 2,300,000 individual stones, rested on that foundation. The core was mostly of yellow limestone quarried from the immediate area, while the stones of the casing are of a white limestone from quarries at Tura and Masara, on the east bank of the Nile on the outskirts of modern Cairo.

This means that the height of the triangle along the surface to the top is phi (the golden section or ratio, 1.61803399) and that the vertical height of the pyramid at its center is the square root of phi. The angles of the internal passages, as well as the location of the various chambers, are also thought to have been defined mathematically.

This is important because there is a tendency to overstate the primitivism of Stonehenge, when in actuality it was an advanced Bronze Age structure. Furthermore, Stonehenge must be contextualized as the last in a line of such artificially enhanced sacred landscapes, a history that stretched back at least two thousand years. Newgrange was a similar site in that it was an important regional ceremonial attractor, but it dates to a thousand years before Stonehenge. Today, because Stonehenge is isolated in the landscape, it is difficult to visualize the area as a sacred landscape. In the immediate area, hundreds of burial mounds would have been visible, sorne dating back to the fourth millennium BCE. 2.38 Plan: Stonehenge, ca. 2500 BCE aHeel stone The first version of Stonehenge, dating to about 3000 BCE, was consistent with the circular henges of that age, except that this one was an impressive 100 meters across, with two or perhaps three spaces left open for access to the inside of the circle. Two alignments were built into it: one astronomical, at the northeast entrance toward the northernmost rising of the moon, and the other to the cardinal point to the south at the other causeway. Around 2500 BCE, the Beaker People transformed Stonehenge from a local temple to a focal point for a larger civilizational entity. They filled the area for miles around with their circular burial mounds and founded a new city to the northeast of Stonehenge, now called Durrington Walls, which was defended by circular defensive walls 480 meters across. Their wealth shows up in their graves. In one grave, archaeologists found gold ornaments as well as bronze pins from Bohemia, blue faience beads from Egypt, and amber beads frorn northern Europe. At the center of the Beaker People s cosmology was a connection between the smelting of ore and the sun. For this reason they had to redesign Stonehenge, transforming its orientation from the moon to the sun. To do this they rotated the axis an almost imperceptible 3 degrees eastward to coincide with the rising midsummer 2.39 Reorientation of Stonehenge by the Beaker People sun, according to the research of Gerald S. Hawkins in collaboration with John B. White. The Beaker People also imposed four large stones that point to summer and winter risings and settings. Though the precise nature of how the stones worked is in dispute, Stonehenge's latitude, as it turns out, is the only one in Europe where this combination is even possible. The most significant change attributed to the Beaker People was the addition of a ring of sixty large bluestones to the interior. The stones are not actually blue; they are a dark, eavy, medium-grained rock, harder than granite. The Beaker People also constructed, about 1 kilometer north of Stonehenge, what archaeologists call a cursus a 3-kilorneter- long, 100-meter-wide rectangular form, slightly beveled at the ends. Created by incising a ditch into the landscape, it lies in an east-west orientation. Though simply uilt, it is laid out with great precision. Its purpose is unknown, even though there are other cursi scattered across the region, some predating the arrival of the Beaker People. t certainly was not a running track, as the name unfortunately implies.

The new designers were working at the behest of a culture represented by chieftains whose numerous cemeteries were added to the landscape around Stonehenge. Their origin is even more mysterious than that of the Beaker People. The new overlords removed the bluestones and added the now famous Sarsen Ring of trilithons, sarsen being the name of the local sandstone boulders. The ring, 33 meters across, was composed of thirty enormous stones with an average weight of 26 tons. The transportation of the blocks from a site 30 kilometers away would have been a feat in itself.

They were surmounted by thirty 6- to 7-ton intels that formed a continuous circle around the top. wt 2.40 Plan: Stonehenge, ca. 2200 BCE The precision was remarkable. The tops of the lintels, once they were in place, never varied more than 10 centimeters from the horizontal. Such carefully worked stone is not typical of other English henges, where stones were usually left natural, perhaps because they were seen as possessing a magical, chthonic presence. The Sarsen Ring was architecture of a particular type, for it was in reality something akin to carpentry in stone. Possibly the designers were replicating in stone a wooden prototype, or perhaps they were seeking to enhance the power of the stone structure by embodying in it the more familiar techniques of woodworking. In the final phase of Stonehenge s transformation, some of the bluestones that had been removed were brought back to the site, with some being erected within the Sarsen Ring and others placed in a horseshoe configuration. Such a horseshoe was uncommon in England, but occurred more frequently across the channel in Brittany.

There they set up farms and traded with Sicily and Sardinia for flint, obsidian, and other nonnative materials, tools, and foods. Today, without modern technology, the island would be relatively inhospitable, given that there are few trees and no natural water sources. But in ancient times there must have been natural springs and an environment suitable for agriculture, for the Maltese flourished for a thousand years, between 3500 and 2500 BCE, more or less contemporaneously with the Old Kingdom in Egypt. In Egypt, there had been a rapid shift to a complex cosmology controlled by the elite. But in Malta, religion revolved around the ancient mother-goddess cult. Malta should not, however, be seen as more primitive, but rather as a place where the goddess cult not only survived but thrived. It is also unlikely that Malta was completely isolated. In fact, the large number of temples, far exceeding the needs of the local population, implies that the island was a type of religious destination.

Archaeologists have found parallel ruts along which the stones might have been pulled, possibly on round stones used as rollers, but these ruts do not lead to the temple in efficient lines (they zigzag through the landscape), nor are they always parallel. The interior spaces of the ternples were defined by their own stones, meticulously dressed and set up to create lobed chambers, the surfaces of which were sometimes finished with plaster and then painted. The spaces between the outer and inner walls were filled with dirt and rubble, and the whole was mounded over to form artificial hills with interior caves. How the spaces were roofed is still debated. Corbelled Neolithic tombs can be found in Spain and Portugal, but given the absence of such stonework, it seers likely that the roofs were supported by timber beams.

The later temples ave a type of plaza in front of them that were equipped with stone benches, indicating that the temples were used for communal gatherings where people waited for priestly announcements or perhaps for their turn to enter. The earliest temple on the Maltese archipelago is Ggantija, part of a cluster of temples situated on the island of Gozo. Used continuously for hundreds of years, it dates to around 3500 BCE. It was a double temple, nearly 30 meters long. The temple had a floor of crushed limestone slurry that formed a hard, concrete-like surface. The portals from chamber to chamber were huge post-and- lintel configurations of megalithic stones. The exterior was monumental and simple. The core cloverleaf configuration to the west was built first. Two more lobed chambers were then added along its entry passage. Later, a second temple was built adjacent to the first and enclosed within the original mound. The reasons are unclear. Perhaps the local population expanded and exceeded the original temple's capacity. Perhaps a plentiful harvest year prompted the farmers to renew their thanks to the earth goddess. Whatever the reason, generations of Maltese continued to regularize and expand the design, testing, refining, and reproducing the archetypal shape at different scales, with different orientations, and with varying numbers of chambers. The temple at Tarxien, built around 2500 BCE, is the most complex of the surviving temples. The imposing concave facade of the main temple was composed of finely coursed stone, with larger blocks at the base and smaller blocks at the roof, which corbelled outward to form a small cornice. Within, pairs of symmetrical chambers were built successively deeper over the centuries, one connected to the next by dual trilithon portals and connecting passageways.

(Recently, it has also been proposed that another strearn of people may have come westward from Europe, following the edge of the Atlantic ice shelf. This is based on the similarities of arrowheads in both locations.) Throughout the Americas, the social structure of the native Americans remained that of hunter- gatherers until sometime between 5000 and 3400 BCE when, in Central America, the first attempts were made to create permanent settlements and cultivate crops such as corn, avocados, chili peppers, amaranth, squash, and beans.

The oldest cultures were on the vast steppes of North America, but whether they had by this time developed the tipi as their distinctive habitation is not known. Affluent shore cultures had developed along the Pacific coast of Canada, along the southern stretches of the Atlantic coast of North America (from Georgia to Florida), in the great flood marshes of the lower Mississippi River, and finally in the great rain forests of Mesoamerica and the Amazon. By 3500 BCE, the Mississippi River delta people began constructing large mounds as part of their ceremonial culture. They were the first to construct such mounds in the Americas. Mound making was an attempt to construct ceremonial landscapes that brought in people from far away for ritual exchanges. It remained a tradition in the southeast areas of North America until the arrival of the European colonizers. Around 3500 BCE important transformations were also taking place in the western uplands of the Amazon, and it is to this area that our story turns, since it holds the key to the transformations that were to take place first in Peru and then in Mesoamerica. The rain forests were home to an astonishing variety of plants and animals, making them an important incubator of human social networks. People formed tribes, and developed a slash-and-burn gardening technique to better harness cashew, cocoa, and Brazil nuts, as well as the all-important manioc, used to make bread, soups, and fermented drinks. The process began slowly around 10,000 BCE as the rain forests began to expand. Groups pushed higher and higher into the mountains, where they encountered the potato, maybe around 5000 BCE. These people are not considered agriculturalists, however, because as far as we know they did not develop irrigation, one of the elements associated with agriculture. That changed around 3000 BCE, when a group of intrepid farmers settled in a high Andean valley that still today seems impossibly arid and remote, and began a farming community there based on irrigation. Using the slope of the valley to their advantage, they tapped the stream and fed the water horizontally to garden plots. Their method worked, and soon the dusty valley was turned into a gardener s paradise. Such activities were never just farming but were part of a sacred landscape; and it is now known how that landscape was defined.

The clan leaders, who were also probably shamans, met in something akin to a sweat lodge, a flat- topped chamber that could hold about fifteen people. The idea of sweat lodges, a widespread phenomenon, developed in Siberia and was brought to the Americas by its ancient settlers. At Galgada, when the chief died, he was ritually wrapped in a fetus position and buried in the lodge, which was then mounded over and a new one built on top. Over the centuries, the mound grew higher and higher in the shape of a stepped mound. Its surface was plastered and probably painted red. Though the history of agriculture is often told as a story of Peru, it is really a story of the Amazonians, who, with their thousands of years of experience, took the step to what we call agriculture by moving into the mountains and developing irrigation and controlled farming. Caral The experiment at Galgada was such that soon other groups were setting out to transform mountains into farmscapes. The most ambitious group tackled what might seem an almost impossible task to transform the uninhabitable coastal Peruvian desert into a fertile plain. The shores had supported fishing communities for thousands of years. The fishing here is among the best in the world, but these fishing communities were isolated, and could only trade north and south. Enter the highlanders who arrived at the Supe River floodplain, and in a few decades made it into Peru's first great agricultural center. Known as Caral, it was first settled around 2600 BCE. The farmers brought with them two plants in particular, plants that they knew the fishermen would need cotton and the gourd. Cotton was needed for fishing nets, and the gourds served as floats. In essence, the farmers supplied the fishermen with advanced equipment, and in return got fish. It was a brilliant arrangement, but it required a strict regime on the part of the Supe Valley farmers.

Some events probably involved the larger community in multiday festivals of dance, music, and feasting. Archaeologists have found flutes made of condor and pelican bones, as well as horns made of llama and deer bones. The site had formally arranged residential complexes for the elite.

The impact of the camel was felt first. Traditionally, the great economic centers had all relied on boats or oxcarts as the primary means of transport. With the camel, traders could now cross the deserts and mountains that stretch thousands of miles east and west and cut Asia into separate north and south regions. By the middle of the second millennium BCE, caravans with as many as six hundred animals were plying trade routes across the desert plains. The first place to monetize this trade was a city called Mari. Located in modern- day Syria on the western bank of the Euphrates, it flourished as a trade center and city-state from 2900 BCE until 1759 BCE. It was located halfway between the Persian Gulf and the upland reaches of the river. In other words, it was designed as a short cut to the Mediterranean and thus was perfectly sited to collect and distribute goods. But this was not a city in the conventional old- Mesopotamian sense. It did not really produce anything but instead was an entrep t city, a transshipment hub of the third millennium. That the city was a perfect circle makes sense. The palace, thought to have been built by King Zimri-Lim (r. 1779-1757 BCE), had at its core a vast rectangular throne room, at the entrance of which was a statue of a maiden holding a jug of water from which water actually poured. It was meant to impress the visitor that here in the desert, water could be poured away. Behind the throne room, protected by a guardroom, were special storage areas where the king kept his most precious items. Nearby was an area for the bureaucrats who recorded what went in and out of the city. Contrast Eridu with Mari: the first was a ritual center designed for the agricultural production of surplus and dependent on an exchange economy primarily through boats (canals and seaports) and oxcarts, whereas the latter was dependent on the rapid turnover of goods. More than 25,000 tablets in the Mari archives have survived, including economic reports and juridical texts. The records describe an astonishing abundance of material and food going through the city, including prized spices such as coriander, cumin, saffron, and cloves; and even ice, a luxury item imported from the far- off mountains. The records also show that things did not always go smoothly. Letters describe the difficulties of moving a massive shipment of some 360,000 liters of barley. Another record tells how flour that had been shipped to feed an army had been destroyed by ants. \r",{"entities":[[35,47,"LOC"],[110,130,"ARCH"],[132,137,"LOC"],[519,523,"LOC"],[760,765,"LOC"],[789,794,"LOC"],[1905,1909,"LOC"]]}],["aN ; General area of . ~ forse diffusion 3.4 Statue of a water goddess found in the palace at Mari General area of Camel diffusion 3.3 Inner Asia camel and horse diffusion areas to around 1300 BCE The camel at this stage of history was still a relatively local Mesopotamian phenomenon, but its use expanded eastward until it finally reached China, where its impact would be felt around 800 BCE during the Zhou dynasty. The new transcontinental network would become the economic engine of Eurasia until the arrival of colonialism in the 16th century. In the second millennium BCE another quadruped entered the scene: the horse. Domesticated around 3000 BCE on the vast Eurasian steppe, the horse played a dynamic role in history well into the modern age. And this was not just because the horse was fast; it also conferred a significant military advantage in that riders with bows and arrows could now rule supreme. Indeed, in the middle of the second millennium BCE, Central Asia from the Bactrian- Margiana Archaeological Complex society in Turkmenistan to the Indus Ghaggar-Hakra region in the south went into a period of turmoil and decline. An ecological disaster the drying up of the Ghaggar-Hakra River certainly played a part in creating a political vacuum. But just as important during this period were large groups of horse-centric people that called themselves Aryas and are now known as Aryans, who moved into northern India. Since their structures were built of wood rather than brick, very little tangible evidence of this period has survived. The newcomers brought with them not only horses, but also a sacred oral tradition of mythologies and legends. Around 1500 BCE these were assembled and written down. This was the beginning of the so-called Vedic period, named after a Sanskrit Indo-European word that means knowledge. West Asia also experienced a state of flux and instability. Assyria, Babylon, and other Mesopotamian cities were overrun by horse-mounted invaders of unknown provenance, the Mitanni and Kassite people, who had moved in from the north or east. A similar situation existed with the so-called Sea People, who conquered the Nile Delta (ca. 1300-1200 BCE) and from whom the Egyptians learned how to make chariots and better bows. Also arnong the newcomers to West Asia were the Hittites, who settled in Anatolia around 1600 BCE. There, in the north-central region, they founded Hattusas, a capital with numerous temples.

The Minoans stitched together the economies of West Asia and Egypt with the emerging markets of Greece and other parts of Europe. Their palace architecture (Knossos, Phaestos, Mallia, and Zakros) was conceived according to very different principles than that of Mesopotamia. The Minoans appeared not to have been overly concerned with defensive installations, which indicates that their trading practices were peaceful in nature. The Minoans also never came under the type of political stresses that necessitated complex cosmologies. Theirs was not an extrerne landscape of deserts and floods. They thus emerged still clothed in ancient chthonic religious practices, which were more intimate and less formal than the rigid systems prevalent in Egypt and Mesopotamia; their holy places were connected to landscape features. Over time, however, Cretan religion began to become more complex, and strong male gods emerged, in particular the Cretan Zeus, a fertility god who died annually and was reborn in a sacred festival. He took the CRETE 3.13 Minoan sites on Crete form of a bull, which was central to a festival known as the Thiodaisia, during which the cities renewed their oaths of alliance to each other. These rites included large-scale drinking and feasting, and were staged in the open landscape or in front of the major palaces in special theater-like settings. There was a joyful, life-enhancing quality to these festivals as well as to their artwork, as can be seen in the murals in their palaces. Three caves were particularly important in their cult: the Dictaean Cave on Mt. Dicte near the village Psychro, the Idaean Cave on Mt.

Men and women are both portrayed performing the jurnp, a man in one case in midair, waiting to be caught in the open arms of a woman. Given that the entire landscape was sacred, the Minoans did not build temples but rather palaces, the largest of which was at Knossos, built around 2000 BCE on top of a prior Neolithic settlement. It was rebuilt and enlarged in 700 BCE after a large earthquake. The palace contained residences, kitchens, storage rooms, bathrooms, ceremonial rooms, workshops, and sanctuaries. here were sophisticated infrastructural installations, ventilation systems, and groundwater conduits. In storage basements, archaeologists have found elephant tusks rom Syria and copper ingots from Cyprus. Though we do not know what role the priest-king who ruled there assumed, it is clear that the palace, with its many different inds and sizes of interior spaces, terraces, courtyards, and platforms, represented a mosaic of interwoven activities. It was part palace, part warehouse, part factory, part religious center. It was laid out around a large rectangular courtyard with several entrances converging onto it. The courtyard was surrounded by verandas at the upper levels, allowing views into its space. Because of the verandas, windows, porches, steps, and doors that folded open into the sides of the walls, the visual interrelationship between inner and outer space is particularly intricate more so than in any other palace architecture of this period. Flanking the courtyard was the throne room, which had built-in gypsum benches on the north and south walls with a place for the insertion of a wooden throne, which was replaced with a gypsum one later. The red stucco walls are covered with images of griffins, legendary animals with the head and wings of an eagle and the body of a lion that are thought to have symbolized strength and vigilance.

A statue was placed against the back wall, with the walls themselves richly decorated with scenes of boxing and bull- grappling, and more griffins. It is possible to imagine the central court as a plateau, positioned at the intersection of the sunken throne room on one side and the elevated cult space, with its skylight, on the other. In the middle of the courtyard was a small altar for burnt offerings and, off to one corner, a large circular stone with concavities in it, probably also for offerings. It was perhaps in this space that the bull ceremony was performed, with the spectators viewing it from the numerous balconies and verandas. Other palaces have been uncovered on the island, as have several peak sanctuaries, such as the one on Mt. Juktas, which was clearly linked to the cult practices at Knossos. It was the focus of pilgrimage ceremonies and was also probably associated with ceremonies legitimating the rule of the kings of Knossos.

The origin of the Hyksos, and even their name, remains the subject of scholarly debate. n 1550 BcE, Ahmose |, founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty (called the New Kingdom, a rule of dynasties lasting until 1070 BCE), was able to throw off the Hyksos and regain control over the country. The Hyksos, despite eing enemies of Egypt, brought to Egyptians some previously unknown things: not only the chariot, but also new techniques of bronze working and pottery, new breeds of animals, new crops, and a particularly powerful composite bow. The return of stability in Egypt meant the vigorous trade in goods on which so many Near Eastern societies depended could recommence. Furthermore, with the continuing troubles in Mesopotamia, Egypt began to dominate the region. Seeking to wy er guarantee the borders against the all-too- volatile political environment, the Egyptians marched into Syria and besieged Nineveh and Babylon. No longer isolationists, as they had been in the Old Kingdom, they now became colonizers. Their turquoise mines in the Sinai were reopened, and Ekron and other cities controlled by the Philistines traded with Egypt in pottery and metals. An important change that came with the reestablishment of unity involved religion: no longer only the purview of the elite, it now comprised larger sections of society. Festivals, processions, and celebrations that could draw thousands of participants were introduced. The New Kingdom saw the rise of large temple institutions that played an important part in hosting these mass celebrations. As a consequence the temple priests rose in power and played an increasingly large role in Egyptian politics. 3.23 Egypt, ca. 1500 BCE Waset (Thebes) During the period of the New Kingdom, the capital of Egypt was Thebes, where the family that had thrown out the Hyksos came from. The Egyptian name for Thebes was Waset, the city of the scepter. It was located on a small rise of the middle of the Nile floodplain that became, during the inundation of the Nile, a quasi-island. Thebes was the Greek name for the city that eventually stuck. The prime deity of Thebes was the ram- god Amun-Re, the god of the sun and the heaven and the omnipresent father of the kings who guaranteed world order. The ascendency of Thebes mean that Amun-Re was elevated to the status of a national deity. At least a dozen temples were built over a five-hundred-year period, from about 1500 to 1000 BCE.

The first temple at the site was erected around 1970 BCE and was a rather modest structure. Thutmosis | began enlarging the Karnak temple complex at Thebes around 1530 BCE. Queen Hatshepsut added her temple on the west bank (ca. 1470 BCE), and Amenhotep III started work on Temple of Luxor around 1350 BCE; the temple-building activity culminated in the efforts of Seti | and Ramesses I|, who made significant additions to Karnak and Luxor around 1280 BCE. From then on the complex went through periodic expansions and transformations until the 5th century BCE. At the ritual core of all of this construction was a simple, small chamber in the Karnak temple essentially a sacred dry-dock, which held a barque through most of the year. The barque chamber Queen Hatshepsut built, which was dismantled by her successors, has been uncovered and reconstructed at Karnak, but not on the original site. The 3.24 Barque chamber at Karnak chamber was made of special red quartzite stone (thus its name, the Red Chapel) on a base of black diorite. The current barque chapel, built by Philip III of Macedonia around 340 BCE, follows the idea of the original and contains only two rooms: one where the offerings were presented, and one with a stone base on which the barque rested. On special occasions the barque was carried out of the temple in the context of a great popular celebration and taken to various sites depending on calendric requirements. Though a boat, this barque never got wet but instead was transported by priests on their shoulders. When it crossed the Nile, it was placed on a special boat. 3.25 Relief carving showing the barque being ceremoniously carried at Karnak \r",{"entities":[[1094,1103,"LOC"]]}],["Some sixty festivals were celebrated in Thebes annually. Some took place within the temple confines; others involved moving cult images from temple to temple. The three most important of these traveling festivals involved Amun; his wife, Mut, the Egyptian mother goddess; and Mut's son, Khonsu, the lunar deity. 1. Preeminent was the Opet ( secret chamber ) festival during which the statues of Amun, Khonsu, and Mut were escorted from Karnak to the Temple of Luxor. At a particular moment during the events, the deity spoke to confirm the legitirnacy of the king. The god's legitimization of the king was reciprocated by gifts to the temple from the royal family. The festival took place during Akhet (roughly our September), the season when the Nile flooded, and lasted for eleven days, but as time progressed, the number of festival days grew. The journey from Karnak to Luxor was made over land along a processional street; the return journey was made along the Nile by boat. 2. The Beautiful Feast of the Valley coincided with a celebration of the dead in which Amun, Mut, and Khonsu would travel to the western shore to visit the gods of the West and the deified dead kings. The festival came to be associated with renewal and regeneration. It occurred during the second month of Shemu, the harvest season (roughly our April), and lasted for over twenty days. 3. Amun s cult image traveled every ten days from the Temple of Luxor on the east bank to the shrine of Medinet Habu (ca. 1460-1420 BCE) on the west bank. The original name was Djanet, and according to popular belief, it was the place where Amun first appeared. The Karnak culture of processions was at the time unique in the world and would have a huge impact on subsequent religious world views. The processional rituals arnong Catholics, for example, is rooted in these ancient prototypes. Floodplain 3.26 The principal temples and processional routes of Karnak Karnak has two entrances: one for those arriving from the direction of the Nile, to accommodate the barque procession, and the other frorn Luxor. The Nile entrance had its own harbor. Both entrances are defined by a series of majestic pylons. To the north of the enclosure is a small sanctuary dedicated to Ptah, who was sometimes seen as an abstract form of the Self-Created One. He was intimately connected with the plastic arts and especially with the mysteries of architecture and stone masonry. A pylon (from the Greek word for gate ) is a high, inclined, and slightly trapezoid- shaped wall with a large central entrance guarding a sacred precinct. It was often accented by tall flagpoles and obelisks whose tops were sheathed in gold plating. The two flanks of the pylon, formal and imposing, symbolized the mountain ranges that hem in the Nile. Their form was a purely symbolical expression of Egyptian power. Though all architectural forms of the period such as the ziggurat in Mesopotamia, the megaron in Greece, and the processional paths in Egypt had symbolical value, the pylon gates were among the earliest architectural forms that condensed wall, gate, and cosmology into a single declaration of power. he Egyptian word for pylon was bekhnet, which implies vigilance. Thus it relates to the watchtower-like nature, if not the actual unction, of these structures. Flagpoles were placed along the front of the pylons, the poles and flags representing, for the Egyptians, the presence of a sacred precinct at the most asic level. \r",{"entities":[[450,466,"ARCH"],[747,751,"LOC"],[864,870,"LOC"],[874,879,"LOC"],[966,970,"LOC"],[1420,1435,"ARCH"],[1924,1930,"LOC"],[1931,1937,"LOC"],[2006,2010,"LOC"],[2070,2076,"LOC"],[2081,2085,"LOC"],[2946,2952,"LOC"],[2984,2989,"LOC"]]}],["Like huge billboards, the pylons also proclaimed, in image and text, important events in the role of the donor-king.

Reeds and flower stalks bundled around poles were used to demarcate sacred spaces. Mostly, the columns were covered with stucco and painted in vibrant colors. Because we tend to see colurnns as purely structural devices, we can easily forget that for the Egyptians, the column was a denotative form. The most common plant themes were the palm, the lotus, and the papyrus. For lotus capitals, there was the so-called bud form, which was usually used in outer courts, and the open form, found in a temple's central area. At the Hatshepsut mortuary temple, one finds fluted cylindrical columns, representing bundled reeds, with plain square capitals that were to have a profound impact on the columns developed by the Greeks. The preferred structural support for columns was bedrock, but where that was not possible, they rested on a broad base that in turn rested on a cone-shaped stone below the surface of the floor to further distribute the weight. Foundations were often made of compacted sand several meters deep, the sand creating an even distribution of the forces. 3.41 Papyrus column, bundled shaft The Djed pillar was the archetype of the Egyptian column.

Architectural plans drawn on stones, some of which have survived, and most certainly on papyrus, though none of these have survived indicate a high level of coordination between planning a building and its construction. Beside the titles of royal architect, builder, and overseer of works, there were also priest-architects who had access to secret books that had plans and specifications for buildings and statues. There was even a goddess of architecture and reckoning, Seshat, who begins to appear in Egyptian records in about 2500 BCE. She is depicted as bearing a seven-pointed star or rosette on her head, sometimes above a wand. She was also the goddess of the art of writing. The king himself played an important part in the planning and the symbolic execution of a structure. In one mural, Thutmosis II is shown performing the ceremony of staking out the ground plan of a temple using a special plan net, a netlike webbing of rope with knots that marked off locations. The procedure consisted of stretching a net along the axis and then spreading it out to determine the basic points of the construction. To form a right angle, for 3.46 Design of a column capital based on a geometric series, each example, the Egyptians used a cord with twelve intervals that was wound around three stakes at units of 3, 4, and 5.

For example, to a column 9 cubits high, the architect would add 1/4 + Ya + 1/16, each fraction symbolizing a different part of the Eye of Horus. Unlike later Greek and Hellenistic assurnptions that positioned mathematics in relationship to cosmological spheres, Egyptian mathematics was connected to the physiology of the body. The eye was seen as one unit, with each of the parts measuring a fraction. This unit was named after Hequat, who was a goddess represented by a frog: she was also the sign of fertility. The name is fitting, since Egyptian mathematics involves a system of leapfrogging over various fractions to achieve the desired answer. The carving of a column and capital was thus a shortcut for these operations. Though we do not know for certain the geometry of the pyramids, it has been ascertained with a fair amount of probability that height-to-width was determined through the ratio of 4:1 pi or sometimes 3:1 pi.

To further stimulate trade, the Hittites permitted Assyrians to set up posts for their donkey and camel caravans in eastern Anatolia, such as the one at Kanesh, 20 kilometers northeast of Kayseri and only 100 kilometers southwest of Hattusas. At its height, the Hittite Empire stretched into the Levant, leading to conflict with the Egyptians and to the famous battle for Kadesh (1275 BCE) in northern Syria. After the battle, which was a draw, the two parties wrote up a treaty that guaranteed peace and security throughout the area, allowing the cities along the Syrian coast to grow in importance and also creating a power shift away from Mesopotamia toward the eastern Mediterranean. A cuneiform version of this treaty, found at Hattusas, hangs today in an enlarged copy at the United Nations Building to demonstrate the age-old importance of international treaties. Though the Hittite economy was basically agricultural, the Hittites conducted a lively export in copper, bronze, and later, most prized of all, iron.

The main military strength of the Hittites lay in the intensive development of new weapons, such as the light horse- drawn chariot with its six-spoked wheels. It contributed greatly to speed and mobility in battle. The Sumerians had already had chariots pulled by wild asses, but their wheels were made of solid wood. Egyptian chariots held only two men, while those of the Hittites held three the driver and two soldiers, one each for attack and defense. The Hittites, similar to the Mesopotamians, had a vast pantheon of intermarried gods and goddesses, in the center of which was the male weather god, symbolized by a bull. His 3.47 Hittite Empire consort controlled the rivers and the sea but was also sometimes known as a sun goddess. Even though ternples were important for the Hittites, they also had outdoor sanctuaries. In this they were much more like the Minoans than either the Egyptians or the Mesopotamians. One such sanctuary is Yazilikaya, a little over a kilorneter to the northeast of Hattusas, to which it was connected by a processional way. It had a pantheon of gods chiseled into the face of the cliff, perhaps showing them arriving at the house of the weather god for the spring festival. id og AN 3.48 Relief depicting twelve gods of the Hittite underworld, Yazilikaya, Turkey \r",{"entities":[[95,103,"LOC"],[157,165,"LOC"],[563,571,"LOC"],[672,681,"LOC"],[841,847,"LOC"],[1172,1180,"LOC"],[1221,1244,"ARCH"],[1597,1605,"LOC"],[2753,2761,"LOC"],[3032,3050,"LOC"]]}],["& Z y y a AS 0 1200 m Hattusas Hattusas (modern Bogazk y), situated at the juncture of two ancient trade routes in north-central Turkey, lies on the northern slope of a ridge where a high plateau begins to descend toward a valley. Of the many temples in the city, the most notable was the so-called Temple |, squarish in plan with an annex in the back. It took up an irregularly shaped city block and was composed principally of storage cells for sanctuary treasure and food. Archaeologists have found jars of Cretan and Mycenaean provenance there. The storage room walls were very thick, suggesting that the building was two or three stories high. The entire complex, including the vast number of storercoms, measures 160 by 135 meters. The temple was built of limestone, whereas the annex that contained the sacred statues was built of granite, indicating its special status as well as, most likely, the presence of Egyptian masons, since it is unlikely that the Hittites would have developed the skill of carving granite so rapidly on their own. The courtyard was entered through a symmetrically laid out gate, square in plan and divided into nine spaces. In the rest of the plan there was an 3.49 Area plan: Hattusas (Bogazk y), Turkey attempt to balance the right and left sides of the courtyard. In the northeast corner was a washhouse, while a portico at the far end gave access to the sacred spaces in the annex. The cult statues were in the larger of the two rooms to the northwest and were dedicated to the sun goddess, while the other room was dedicated to the weather god. All in all, the building is an aggregation of different elements: the gate, the court, and the annex. The most important event at the temple was a springtime festival at which the combat of the weather god and a dragon was acted out or recited. During the festival, the king and queen, accompanied by jesters and musicians, would enter through the ceremonial gate on the eastern wall and proceed to a stone basin, where the king would perform a ritual hand washing using water poured from a jar made of gold. From there he would enter the ternple courtyard through the monumental gate. A master of ceremonies then prepared the king and the assembled dignitaries for a feast, perhaps in the colonnade of the courtyard or in the throne room itself. The Hittites, like the Mesopotamians, employed no columns or capitals in their architecture. Instead, they - Sanctuary 50m 3.50 Plan: Temple |, Hattusas grouped rooms around paved courts. In contrast to Sumerian temples, which had dark and mysterious interiors because the rooms received daylight frorn windows high up in the walls, Hittite temples had tall windows starting close to floor level. Such windows were placed on both sides of the cult statue and would have bathed it in light. The Hittites also employed colonnades in a type of wall-and-pier system that enriched their spatial vocabulary considerably. And finally, Hittite architects strove for a deliberate tension between symmetry and asymmetry that has parallels with Minoan architecture. There are other differences from Mesopotamian temples. The cella of a Mesopotamian temple communicated with the courtyard through an intervening antechamber or antechapel, so that the congregation in the court would have a clear view of the god s statue in its niche. In Hittite temples, the cult room was approached indirectly, through side rooms; the statue would therefore not have been visible from the court. This has led archaeologists to conclude that the cel/a was reserved for priests or a corresponding elite who alone were admitted to the sanctum. \r",{"entities":[[22,30,"LOC"],[129,135,"LOC"],[1212,1220,"LOC"],[1233,1239,"LOC"],[2476,2484,"LOC"],[3358,3373,"LOC"]]}],["MACEDONIA Oiry Aegean Sea PELOPONNESE @rhebes Mycenae@) oyioe Tiryns lonian Sea Sea of Crete @knossos CRETE 3.51 Mycenaean Greece MYCENAEAN CIVILIZATION The Mycenaeans, from parts unknown, settled in Greece around 2000 BCE. There, ike the Hittites, they quickly coalesced into a unified Bronze Age social order. The numerous harbors and islands of the Peloponnese lent themselves to a system of regional chieftains or kings operating under the umbrella of the lord of Mycenae, to whom they were connected by ties of lood, tribal loyalties, language, and old memories of origins as reflected in their myths. Commanding a powerful fleet, the lord of Mycenae could ensure his city-state s foremost position. After the decline of Minoan dominance over the Mediterranean, the reach of Mycenae extended to all the Aegean islands, including Rhodes and Cyprus. The Mycenaeans traded with Sicily, southern Italy, Egypt, Sardinia, and the countries bordering the Black Sea, leaving trading outposts along the way. Their form of power was a novelty in world history. They were not centralized and had no land-based army. But it was precisely this that propelled them into world events. Tribal affiliations created small but fiercely loyal fighters. They developed their own export commodities. Their carpenters, Rhodes NS ce aor\" YS yw . Storeroams ANATOLIA 3.52 Plan: Palace complex at Pylos, Greece for example, used ivory from Syria with great skill to adorn furniture. Their metallurgical skill was legendary; Mycenaean bronze swords have been found in Romania. There were obviously interactions with the Minoans, from whose long culture the Mycenaeans borrowed elements of wall decorations and building techniques. Mycenaean architectural sensibilities were their own, however, and centered on the megaron, or great hall. Nestor's palace complex at Pylos, of which we hear much in Homer s Odyssey, was built between 1300 and 1200 BCE. Predominant is the megaron, a square room with four fluted columns in the center of which is an elevated hearth 4 meters in diameter; the room was vented by a clerestory ceiling. The floor was plastered and decorated with a grid, the fields of which were painted with nonfigural patterns. The walls were covered with an elaborate series of frescoes showing animals, musicians, and individuals carrying offerings and a bull sacrifice. On the wall near the throne (to-no in Mycenaean Greek, whence comes the word throne ), was a drawing of an octopus with special symbolical meaning. Did the slippery, multi-armed organism resemble the adept, multi-zoned Mycenaean social structure? The throne was made of wood, plated in gold and ebony. Behind the great hall were two storage rooms for valuables and containing large pots for storing oil. The residential quarters were in a discrete block at the eastern corner. There was even a room with a bath made of terra- cotta. Access to the megaron was more direct than the labyrinthine approach at Knossos. From the outside, one entered through an H-shaped propyfon (the word literally means before the gate ) with a single colurnn dividing the path into two, much as one would have found in Crete. It did not lead to a hall or corridor but into a courtyard, where a porch of columns and a set of doorways formed the entrance into the megaron. To the right of the entrance was the guard room, and to the left, the palace archives and records of trade transactions. Before entering the megaron, a visitor would first have been led to a room on the left side of the courtyard, which was a place for ritual preparation. The palace was located on a ridge with a protected port about 5 kilometers from the sea, right on the trade route that worked its way through the Peloponnese. \r",{"entities":[[26,37,"LOC"],[80,92,"LOC"],[102,107,"LOC"],[200,206,"LOC"],[834,840,"LOC"],[845,852,"LOC"],[880,886,"LOC"],[897,902,"LOC"],[904,909,"LOC"],[911,919,"LOC"],[1338,1346,"LOC"],[1358,1381,"ARCH"],[1419,1424,"LOC"],[1546,1554,"LOC"],[1816,1848,"LOC"],[3162,3168,"LOC"],[3733,3744,"LOC"]]}],["3.53 Overview of Mycenae, Greece ~ Mycenaean palaces were much more than residences; as at Knossos, they were administrative centers and the locus of the region's industrial production. The Palace of Pylos, for example, employed around 550 textile workers and 400 workers in the metallurgical industry. There were also other types of artisans, such as goldsmiths, ivory carvers, stone carvers, and potters. These people lived in nearby hamlets. The most dominant city of the time was Mycenae itself. Though today the city seems remote, this was not the case in 400 BCE. It straddled a shortcut through the Peloponnese between the broad and protected Argos harbor and a port on the Bay of Corinth, and thus connected Crete and the eastern Mediterranean with the markets in Italy and beyond. Situated on the side of a mountain, it was easily protected. Mycenae was defended by thick ring walls that were built around 1450 BCE. Part of this formidable defense work consisted of a cyclopean wall named for the seemingly superhuman strength it must have taken to move these immense boulders. In other parts one finds regular rows of blocks of stone fitted without mortar. One enters the citadel through the famed Lion Gate, which might imply a connection to, or at least familiarity with, Hattusas. Palace compound Lower town Burial tholos Just to the right after entering the citadel is a large circular burial fhofos placed on the flat top of a purpose-built conical hill, about 6 meters high. It has six chambered tombs containing gold, silver, and bronze burial treasures. Entrance to this circle was certainly restricted to the elite, who accessed it from a bridge that connected it to a set of ritual buildings, also placed on a high stone podium. There were no temples in the Mesopotamian sense. Sacred rituals were performed in buildings that were similar to houses, except that they were better ornamented and made with more refined material. The lower town and the burial circle were originally outside the citadel walls, but were later encased by a more expansive perimeter wall. The palace, placed at the top of hill, was protected by its own set of walls. Unlike the Egyptian pharaohs, who were placed in pyramids, and later in secret caves, the Mycenaean dead were displayed within the city at a place where memory and narrative were most likely to converge. Later Greeks would call the gathering of people in commemorating places a choros. Indeed, Homer would emerge, long after the Mycenaean age had waned, recounting the tales of Mycenaean heroes, arnong them Agamemnon. 3.54 Megaron at Palace of Pylos, Mycenae \r",{"entities":[[26,32,"LOC"],[190,205,"ARCH"],[606,617,"LOC"],[716,721,"LOC"],[1208,1217,"ARCH"],[1284,1293,"LOC"],[2599,2614,"LOC"]]}],["Treasury of Atreus Beginning in the late Bronze Age, the kings were buried outside the city in great beehive or tholas tombs, monumental symbols of wealth and power.

It was only in the 1950s, when the site was viewed from the air, that archaeologists realized they were artificial constructions. Located in the lower Mississippi Valley of West Carroll Parish, Louisiana, near both the Gulf Coast and the confluence of six major rivers, Poverty Point is not a unique construction. Similar earth mounds had been built along the Mississippi River dating as far back as 4000 BCE. Humans probably moved into this area around 6000 BCE, and the reason is obvious: it was one of the richest areas in plants and wildlife in North America. There were seasonal migrating ducks, fish of various kinds, and deer in the forests, not to mention a wide variety of edible plants and nuts, including hickory nuts, pecans, acorns, and walnuts. All this made for an affluent world. The massive spring floods allowed people to communicate with each other via canoes. Trade was extensive and included chipped- stone projectile points and tools, ground- stone plummets, and beads made from shells and stones. There is clear evidence that trade reached as far north as what is now Michigan. The mounds served as places for ritual gatherings that lasted for weeks and were an important part of First Society life. These gatherings entailed ceremonial gift giving, socializing, singing, and dancing. In that Motley Mound sense, this was not a village but a sacred landscape that served as a magnet for people from near and far, although the local tribe might have lived there the year round. The site consists of six concentric semi- elliptical rings that enclose a vast open plaza covering an area of about 14 hectares. Aisle- like openings run between the rings, dividing them into six sections, which are thought to have stood over 2 meters high. It is thought that visiting tribes built their huts on these mounds for the festivals. In and around the complex were six to eight constructed earthen mounds. The main plaza faced east and overlooked the Mississippi River. This was the site of elaborate dance ceremonies. Someone looking along the aisles from the center outward would have looked toward the sun at the winter solstice in one direction, and toward the sun at the summer solstice in the other. To the west of the site was a huge mound, built on a patch of black soil that was ritualistically covered with a layer of white sand, probably symbolizing the forces of life and death. The mound was made by the different tribes, each carrying clay in baskets from far away to the site. When finished, it had the shape of a west-flying bird, which most likely was meant as a communication device for the ancestor spirits. How the shamanistic rituals worked, whether on its summit or on its slopes, is unknown. Today the mound is overgrown with grass and trees, but originally its clay surface would have been bare.

Arnmong these numerous city-states, Xia came to control the territory on the Yellow River, paving the way for the rise of the Shang dynasty (ca. 1600-1050 BCE), whose irst capital was Ao, known as Zhengzhou. he Shang, who continually moved their capital due to frequent natural disasters, left Ao around the 13th century BCE. Despite the capital's importance, centralization of state power had not yet been developed. Nonetheless, it was during the Shang dynasty that the royal person came to be viewed as a symbol of cosmic powers. While feasts for the dead were commonplace, during the Shang it seems that ordinary people were no longer believed to become spirit ancestors. In other words, the ancestors of the elite became the spiritual ancestors of all. And, since the royal ancestors were credited with supernatural powers, divining their wishes was a preeminent task placed in the hands of a priestly class. The theocratic order thereby established was to remain foundational to the Chinese definition of rulership.

Apart from the living ancestors, there were an assortment of nature deities with various legrees of abstraction. It was during the Shang period that there is the first clear evidence of the rise of cities in China. They dominated the great northern plain that was enclosed on the north, west, and south by mountains or deserts and open to the sea on its eastern rim. The Huang River and its tributaries flowed through the plain from the mountains in the west. In those days, the eastern parts consisted of extensive marshes, and the coastline was farther west than it is today. But the middle zone, well watered and with fertile soil, was an excellent place for agricultural exploitation. It comprises a territory known as the Middle Plain. In this, Chinese urbanism began in a way that was fundamentally different from in Mesopotamia, where cities began as risky endeavors in the marshes. They were dependent on extensive irrigation techniques, and their power could rise and fall with the next flood. The first Chinese cities were built in much less stressful situations, and the Chinese did not yet have extensive irrigation. These cities were at their core ceremonial centers for the elite, and for the construction of buildings enormous sacrifices were made. So much power did the elites have that for the dedication of just one palace, 852 humans, 15 horses, 10 oxen, 18 sheep, 35 dogs, and 5 fully equipped chariots with horses and their charioteers were all entombed. The centers had earthen walls, usually of a roughly rectangular form. Though they were not purely rectangular, they were still governed by sacred principles. An important difference between these early Chinese cities and their Mesopotamian counterparts is that as ceremonial centers they contained, either inside the walls or nearby, workshop districts where the artisans lived who made the bronze, jade, and pottery objects that were necessary for the ritual practices of the elites. In some sense the city emerged as a production zone around the ritual center. \r",{"entities":[[0,11,"LOC"],[58,63,"LOC"],[79,84,"LOC"],[503,513,"LOC"],[1487,1496,"LOC"],[1510,1520,"LOC"],[2040,2046,"LOC"],[2203,2214,"LOC"],[2655,2666,"LOC"]]}],["Zhengzhou was immense, with its east wall measuring 1.7 kilometers long.

Arnong these were the potato, peanuts, cacao, beans, manioc, squash, and avocado. Nowhere else in the world did such a wide variety of plants appear in such close geographical proximity. Milling stones appeared along the southwest coast in Belize and in northeast Mexico. By 3000 BCE, hoes start to appear in Gulf Coast sites, and in Oaxaca and Puebla the first indications of settlements and village life emerge. The agricultural revolution had begun. If the people of the contemporaneous Mississippi culture had seemed affluent compared to their neighbors of the open plains, even they would have been amazed had they traveled to Mexico and seen the tended garden fields. It might seem counterintuitive that in a land where so many different foods were so easily available that these same people would master the production of corn. Unlike wheat, barley, and rice, which in their edible forms are relatively similar to their wild forms, corn was the product of hundreds of years of genetic development. It seems that this took place in the area that straddles the El Salvador Guatemala border, where a wild grass known as teosinte grows. What attracted people to the plant is not known, since it is inedible. Perhaps it was discovered that the seeds could be popped when roasted. This might have had some ritualistic significance that focused growers on perfecting the plant until it finally yielded corn in the modern sense. At any rate, it is clear that that corn was not merely a plant it was a god, which mean that planting corn was not only an agricultural process but a theological one. Soon, certainly before 1000 BCE, it was discovered that soaking the corn in lime or ash softened the kernels and allowed the pods to be made into cornmeal. The process created significant nutritional advantages over untreated maize. 4.3 Trade in the Americas, ca. 800 BCE Corn came in different types and sizes and was used in a variety of cuisines. One type was used for cornmeal; another for roasting; another for hominy, a type of grits; and yet another for bread. For corn bread, the corn was grated from the cob and made into a milky mush which could also be combined with bean meal and was slowly baked until it became a type of cake. Some types of corn were best when preserved, which was done in the sun or over a fire. Corn could also be used to make a fermented drink. 4.4 A fired-clay Toltec votive vessel with an image of corn priest, dedicated to Xilonen, the Aztec goddess of maize, from around 1500 ce \r",{"entities":[[0,20,"LOC"],[21,69,"LOC"],[706,716,"LOC"],[731,737,"LOC"],[742,748,"LOC"],[887,898,"LOC"],[1463,1484,"LOC"]]}],["It was the Olmecs who set in play the corn- centric worldview that would become the marker of civilization in the Americas. They did so by making a risky move, leaving the wet forests for uninhabited marshes on the east coast of Mexico. The only wildlife of any size in these swampy areas were turtles and birds. The Olmecs decision to build in stone was even more extraordinary, since the massive stones that they used had to be dragged for many kilometers from the mountains to the north. Two elements were, however, in their favor: One was salt from the shore, which they processed and used to trade for many things they needed. They also had bitumen from various oil seeps, which was useful to make watertight baskets and boats. It might be a stretch to compare the situation to the modern-day difference between a family farrn and a corporate one, but holding this difference in mind, even in general terms, helps illurninate the drarna set in play by the Olmecs. This was no gradual expansion of plant-tending lifestyles; it was a purposeful industrialization of the landscape. This means that the Olmecs settled in the region specifically to transform it from swamp to a corn-producing center, controlled by a cult of powerful personalities who were probably part shaman, part deity, and part ruler. 4.5 A characteristic motif of Olmec art was the were-jaguar, a human face with the mouth of a jaguar The religious life of the Olmecs centered on sacred caves, springs, and volcanoes. The volcano, a symbol frequently used in Olmec imagery, was associated with the world being born from below but was also viewed as the home of the storm clouds, lightning, and rain. It was depicted as a dragon with a gaping mouth representing the portal to the underworld. The sky was ruled by a bird monster or sun god whose energy powered the cosmos and made the plants grow. Underneath the dragon, the Olmecs visualized a watery void out of which the world was formed. The main deity in their mythology was the rain god, depicted as a jaguar, a shamanistic symbol of transformation. This jaguar could assume other forms even human ones. The sexual union of a woman and a jaguar gave birth to a special class of gods that were represented in sculpture as having toothless gums, fangs, a snarling mouth, and a cleft head. The Olmecs learned to drag and float stones and columns of up to 40 tons over a distance of 160 kilometers. Most were chiseled into jaguars or human heads by Olmec sculptors. Unlike the angular and sharp features of the sculpture of later civilizations, the Olmec heads were round, soft, and very lifelike. They were also quite large some of them over 3 meters high. 4.6 Colossal monolithic head uncovered at San Lorenzo, Mexico Ball playing was an important element of Olmec ritual, as evidenced by clay figures showing players wearing heavy leather belts and possibly headgear. It seems that the ball players also wore mirrors, giving us some indication of the magical nature of the games. Balls ranged from 10 to 22 cm and were heavy, 3 or 4 kilograms. In a modern-day game known as u/ama that is played in some Mesoamerican villages, the play resembles a net-less volleyball, with each team confined to one half of the court. The ball is hit back and forth using only the hips until one tearn fails to return it or the ball leaves the court. But why the games were held and what they signified is not known. Were they to defuse or resolve conflicts, struggles to the death by captives, or symbolic activities associated with calendric events and shamanistic practices? \r",{"entities":[[229,236,"LOC"],[2736,2742,"LOC"]]}],["North court Central court. South court San Lorenzo and La Venta The site of San Lorenzo (founded around 1300 BCE), named after a nearby modern village, is located in the lower reaches of the Coatzacoalcos River. It was on a hill overlooking a large agricultural floodplain. The highest point of the hill was landscaped to create a plateau covering an area of about 7 square kilometers and resembling in plan the shape of a bird. Though the wooden and thatch architecture has long since disappeared, the use of basaltic stones, brought from the distant Tuxtla Mountains, for steps, columns, and aqueducts gives a vivid picture of the scale and grandeur of Olmec skills. The main ceremonial complex consisted of a series of earth platform mounds arranged north-south in a series of courts. Though the mounds are not aligned according to a single design, huge monolithic heads stood in the middle of the courts. The central court also had a series of cut- stone cisterns that, given their location and drainage system, must have had had ritual purpose.

San Lorenzo was a ritual site, but what made it so special compared to other locations on the plateau? According to one argument, it was the only place along the river where the sunset aligned with the volcano Cerro Zempoaltepec at the winter solstice. For unknown reasons, San Lorenzo went into decline. Many of the great colossal heads that had been so laboriously brought to the site were rolled down into the ravines that divide the edges of the terrace and were carefully covered up; within a generation or two, the jungle had totally reclaimed the site. It is unknown whether this was done to ritualistically deactivate the site or for other reasons. A new center had by then already been built and prepared, and perhaps the priests of that center were eager to be the solitary overlords of the region. It is known as La Venta and is 80 kilometers northeast of San Lorenzo and closer to the shore of the Gulf of Mexico. La Venta was perhaps the first use of symmetry in the overall design in Mesoamerican architecture, with the site appearing to be oriented to the summer solstice sunset over the volcano San Martin to the northwest. Its pyramid, about 30 meters high and 150 meters in diameter the largest of the Olmec pyramids was constructed from 3,700 cubic meters of beaten earth and clay, with a rectangular base from which rose an unusual fluted, conical shape (although this could have been caused by subsequent erosion).

The rise and decline of these civilizations within a relatively short time, along with the militarization of society, must have had a powerful impact on the psyche of the times and seems to have led to a shift in ideological focus. Power shifted to centers away from the coast to the rugged highlands, the most important of which was Chavin de Huantar, founded around 900 BCE. It is located halfway between the Supe Valley to the south and the Casma Valley to the north, at a place where the Mosna River narrows dramatically into a precipitous gorge. There, at the convergence point of two major passes crossing the snowcapped Cordillera Blanca, the Mosna meets the Wachesqua River at a triangular space wedged between descending mountain slopes that is the only flat area for miles around. Though seemingly remote, Chavin de Huantar was only about a six-day trek to the Pacific Ocean to the west and to the tropical forests to the east. The tight valley could never have supported the population density of Casma; agriculture here was thus pursued by the more traditional means of small terraced plots. The temple of Chavin de Huantar was, therefore, of a new type of institution deriving its economy almost entirely from the draw of its cerernonies and rituals. Unlike ritual centers in the Supe and Casma valleys, with their open plazas and relaxed and generously scaled monuments, here the temple was in fact less a temple than a type of machine lesigned to enhance and produce certain effects. The measure of divinity was not istance but psychological intimacy, and perhaps even fear. The first structure that was built was a U-shaped platform called the Old Temple. Facing east, it consisted of a large circular sunken plaza, with stairs on axis and a centralized main staircase leading to the roof of the building, which acted as a raised terrace. The platform, built of dressed stone, rose 12 to 16 meters above the plaza. Its walls were adorned with numerous gigantic grotesque heads, carved in the round and inserted in the massive masonry. The carvings also show jaguars, strornbus shells, and clawed hands as well as San Pedro cactus, an Andean hallucinogenic.

Unlike the earlier centers, which had rooms on the top of the mounds but no interiors, here the main attraction was inside the temple, which, though built as a solid mass of stone, was honeycombed with labyrinthine passages. Roofed with large slabs of stone, these passages are no more than a meter wide and vary in height, but are large enough for a person to walk through. One passage oriented directly on axis with the round plaza contained a mysterious and imposing 3-meter-high slender granite stone known today as the Lanz n. It was not a natural stone, but a sculpture that is half cat and half human, the design of which is wrapped around the stone so that it is never entirely visible from one standpoint.

The ducts leading to the outside were perhaps not for air, but to emit the sound.

The amplification of the rushing water to a roar played a part, as did hallucinogenic drugs. It is generally thought that an initiate would have been led down the corridor, which would have reverberated with echoes from the rushing water below, to witness the divinity and perhaps to hear its oracular declarations. This suggests that the religious leaders were not the proverbial chiefs over the land, but served an institution that was nothing less than a living deity. The priests fed it, monitored it, cared for it, and ritualistically activated it. Though Chavin eventually went into decline, its sanctity was never forgotten, even until the arrival of the Spaniards.

Its development had taken thousands of years of familiarity with kilns, metals, and extraction methods, until high-temperature smelting could be mastered. But after the downfall of the Hittites in 1200 BCE, the art of iron forging spread, reaching China around 600 BCE. Apart from China, there were five newly emerging metal-oriented societies: the Urartians in Armenia, the Nubians in the Sudan, the Etruscans in Italy, the Dorians and lonians in Greece, and, somewhat later, the Mauryans in India. As these cultures were all marginal to the Mesopotamian/ Egyptian civilizations, the consequences were enormous. Iron, in other words, completely changed the political and civilizational landscape; areas once peripheral to the urbanized agro-centric, Mesopotamian/ Egyptian heartlands became important, if not dominant, players in the world economy. lron was used to make weapons, of course, but was also superior for crafting agricultural implements like plows and wheels. With iron plows, the plains of Sicily, the north coast of Africa, and even the high plains of eastern Anatolia became major grain-producing regions, significantly lessening the need for grain from Mesopotamia and Egypt. Iron farm implements also had a profound impact on the development of agriculture in sub- Saharan Africa, where for the first time, large- scale agriculture and land clearing could be undertaken. The African connection which was centered around Nubia and later Aksum exhausted itself around 600 BCE largely because deforestation had led to serious environmental degradation, which made both mining and agriculture difficult and had permanent negative consequences for the economy. The Urartians were conquered by the Assyrians in order to secure a steady supply of metal for their army. There is little left of Urartian architecture, apart from remnants, most of it having been destroyed by centuries of warfare. The Nubians, who produced extensive architectural works, continued Egyptian traditions. The Etruscans and the Dorians were, however, newcomers, having moved into the Mediterranean from the north. Their views on the world were different from that of the Egyptians and Mesopotamians, leading them to create a highly refined civic- legal description of the divine that was to impact European architecture for centuries.

Their language, which has only been partially deciphered, does not belong to the Indo- European language family. They settled predominantly in the north part of the Italian peninsula, between the Arno and Tiber Rivers and on the west side of the Apennine Mountains. This territory provided plenty of metal ore, such as copper, iron, lead, and silver, but the Etruscans appear to have acquired the skill to exploit these metals prior to settling in Italy; indeed, the presence of these ores might have attracted these settlers in the first place. For example, Volterra, one of their main cities, twelve of which formed the Etruscan League (Dodecapoli), was close to Colline Metallifere (Metalliferous Hills). The Etruscan city of Vulci, also part of the league, was especially noted for its bronze work. It was not just the Etruscans economic acumen that differentiated them from the surrounding tribes but also their fantastic belief structure, which relied heavily on omens. The Etruscan aesthetic, as displayed in the decoration of their graves, was spontaneous, vivacious, and open to the appreciation of other cultures especially that of the Greeks, whose goods and vases they freely imported and copied. As a group, the Dorians, lonians, and Etruscans all played an important part in restoring the Mediterranean Tyrrhenian Sea 4.20 Tumulus mound, Etruscan necropolis of Banditaccia at Cerveteri, Italy, 7th to 5th centuries BCE to economic and cultural viability after the isruptions of the preceding centuries. Despite the settlements of the Greeks in the south and center of Italy, the Etruscans were able to maintain their hold over the northern half of the Italian peninsula. There they had a vibrant interaction with Rome, the ascendant power, until they were finally absorbed into the Roman Empire, to which they contributed substantively. Many Etruscan cities, like Veii, north of Rome, were, in their heyday, as big as Athens, with a population estimated as high as one hundred thousand. hough the physical fabric of Etruscan 4.21 Example of an Etruscan arch cities has largely been lost, much can be discerned from the multitude of tombs that dot the hillsides veritable cities of the dead, all executed in skillful masonry and richly decorated interiors. Most of the tombs are in the shape of mounds, some 40 meters across, that contain decorated chambers. Many Etruscan walls and gateways in Rome, Perugia, Cortona, and other places still exist today. At Velhatri (today s Volterra), sections of the formerly 7.3-kilometer-long enclosure, built during the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, as well as the Porta all Arco and the Porta di Diana, still bear witness to Etruscan skills. The city gate of Perugia in particular exhibited a bold use of the arch, a building element that, along with the vault, was introduced by the Etruscans and became one of their main contributions to Roman architecture. In Rome itself, several famous structures, including the Circus Maximus and the Cloaca Maxima, the Roman sewage system still in use today, were built by Etruscan masons. The deft and unfailingly secure use of arches that emerged in Etruria was to have a tremendous impact on Roman architecture, as is evidenced by the Roman aqueducts.

This vibrancy did come at the expense of stylistic unity something that ent their art an unmistakable, and in some sense unusual, receptivity toward outside influences. Elements of the Corinthian, jonian, and Attic are all in evidence in Etruscan art and painting. This is also true of their religion so much so that their own deities came to be fused with, and coalesced around, Greek ones, paving the way for the ater Roman assimilation of Greek culture. Unlike the Greek pantheon, however, that of the Etruscans included supernatural and chthonic beings whose number and nature ave not yet been determined. The Etruscans also had a complex system of augury (such as the study of the entrails especially the iver) and of sacrificial animals. They studied and interpreted natural phenomena, such as comets or the flight paths of birds (a practice known as auspicium, or divination). A 3rd-century BCE bronze model of a liver recovered near Piacenza, Italy, was perhaps used to train Etruscan priests (haruspices) in the art of interpretation. The upper surface is divided into forty sections, corresponding to the celestial zones of the Etruscan pantheon; these have the names of gods, including many with whom we are unfamiliar, engraved on it. The particularities of the animal's liver told the priest which deity to invoke. It was probably meant to be aligned north-south. One of the words used to describe this liver was templum, which could refer to the sky, to a consecrated area on earth, or toa much smaller surface, such as the liver of an animal used in divination, as long as the orientation and partition of the area followed the celestial model. A fermpfum could thus be a physical space (in which case it would be marked or enclosed), but it could also be an area of the sky, in which the birds would be observed. A tempium, in other words, was a space where humans, represented by priests (augurs), could interact with the gods. In all ancient Mediterranean and Mesopotamian cultures, nature was associated with divine presences, but for the Etruscans, the gods spoke through signs. This was not the case in Mesopotamian religions, where gods spoke more directly, through priests. For the Minoans, religion centered on nature's life cycles, with the gods representing the stories associated with those cycles. But for the Etruscans, religion was a practice of translation. Unlike the more fearsome and arbitrary gods of the Mesopotamians, Etruscan gods readily communicated their intentions. Disaster could come about just as much from the actions of the gods as from a misunderstanding of their messages. ) Cardo Decumanus pars dexira pars sinistra ) 4.23 Diagram of carde and decumanus The orientation of Etruscan temples was of critical importance and was determined by the intersection of two axes, one north-south, called cardo, and the other east-west, called decumanus. The idea was employed later by the Romans in setting up military camps according to strictly standardized rules and subsequently became fundamental to Roman town planning. Apparently these orthogonal lines were closely connected to Etrusco-ltalic religious iconography. The observer's place was at the point where the two lines crossed; he stood with his back to the north.

This process was called auspicium, a word that was a combination of avis ( bird\") and specio ( to see ). The priest and soothsayer watched the flight and feeding of birds, listened to their cries, and even examined their entrails. From this came words like contemplatio, meaning literally with a template. There was also the distinction between whether the message was an order or a friendly reminder. All in all, the femplum (as a type of three-dirnensional template) stood between the ephemeral and the real, linking the invisible absolute realities of the divine with the real needs of the supplicants. The consecrated ground on which this took place was expressed in Etruscan language by the word sacni (becoming the Latin sancti).

Though similar to Greek temples in that respect, Etruscan temples were meant to be viewed mainly from the front rather than stand as objects in the landscape; they therefore ave no rear facade. The pitch of the roof was relatively low, and they had overhanging eaves. The pediment was originally open so that the roof timbers could be seen. Also distinctive was the roomy colonnaded porch, known as the pronaos (meaning in front of the naos ) that stood in front of the cella. Etruscans often organized gods into a trivium, erecting temples with three ceffae; their overall shape was rectangular, tending toward square. Etruscan temples introduced the principal of an axial connection between temple and altar, which the Greeks eschewed until very late, and probably then incorporated only under Italian influence.

But over time, the Dorians in Greece and the lonians along the Turkish coast came to develop common cultural practices that fused elements unique to them with residues of the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures. This explains some of the differences in their development from that of the Etruscans. The Minoans and Mycenaeans, having had no temples in the technical sense, held caves and mountains sacred, with worship augmented by shrines. Homer represents the gods as highly mobile creatures constantly visiting each other in their palaces. The early Dorian religious practices took place in natural settings, which made it easy to incorporate some of the features and even locations of Minoan religion into their own. These rites, as described by George Hersey, also often involved trees, or groves of trees, that were fenced off and decorated with materials used in sacrifices bones, horns, urns, lamps, weapons, fruits, and vegetables. Trees held a special place in Greek culture, and almost every god was associated with one. Athena was, for example, associated with the olive tree. The altar dedicated to a god was set out in front of his or her particular tree or grove. Participants in the rites would bathe and dress in special clothes and, accompanied by flutists, sing while processing to the place of sacrifice. They were led by a girl carrying a basket of grain on her head. Under the Lindos Rhodes 4.30 Geometric period Greek vase, typically serving as a monumental grave marker grain, and concealed from view, was the slaughtering knife. The sacrificial animal, decorated with wreaths on his horns, was then led up to the altar with a fire already burning on it. Gathering in a circle, the participants would wash their hands by pouring water from a jug, which they would also sprinkle on the animal. The barley grains from the girl s basket would be flung over the animal, altar, and earth. Once the knife was revealed, the priest would step forward, take it, and prepare for the sacrifice. The beast, which had to be a prime specimen from the domestic herd, rather than a wild animal, had to be willing to submit to the sacrifice, so the priest placed a bowl of milk at the base of the altar. As the animal stepped forward, it would bow its head to drink, which was interpreted as a sign of submission. Another indication of its assent was its shivering in the sight of the god, a process helped along by the liberal use of cold water. As the blood was held to be precious, it was drained into conduits and pits beneath the altar. The animal was then carved up; special meaning was given to various parts, with the liver being, of course, particularly important for the augur. Some parts were chopped up and wrapped in fat to form a type of reconstituted body. Sometimes the skull was placed on a stake near the altar and draped in an animal skin. Representations of this type of sacrifice extended to trophies and spoils taken frorn the conquered in battle, to assuage the spirits of the dead. 4.31 Statue of a calf-bearer After the animal was carved, the flesh was roasted and eaten. The communality of the meal bound together social units, from the family to the city. The gods received the act as devotional; as the smoke, immaterial, rose up from the altar, it was, so the Greeks thought, a sign of reverence. In exchange for this act of devotion, the humans could then read the message of the gods embedded in the physical shape of the liver. As mentioned earlier, the animals sacrificed to the gods had to be prime specimens from the domestic herd rather than wild animals. \r",{"entities":[[0,9,"LOC"],[85,91,"LOC"],[192,204,"LOC"],[205,210,"LOC"],[216,222,"LOC"],[245,251,"LOC"],[289,295,"LOC"],[378,384,"LOC"],[1092,1105,"PER"]]}],["ie) 20m wey ELE erig | MSR K UAE 4.32 Plans: The Temple at Samos, Greece (above left). The Altar of Zeus at Pergamon (upper right) drawn at the same scale and orientation The meaning of this sacrificial process is explained in the myth of Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods and brought it to mankind. In so doing, he made it possible for humankind to civilize itself. The gods did not take the fire back but punished Prometheus by chaining him to a cliff and having an eagle eat his liver. His liver would grow back every day, only to be eaten again. The sacrifice was thus part of a ritual remembrance of humankind s emergence into civilization and of their dependence on the gods for the regulation of their lives. But the sacrifice also marked the difference tween humankind and gods, for unlike the gods, who existed in an ethereal form, umankind had to work and show sincerity to keep the communication alive. Only by making a sacrifice in sorne ways a labor of jove could men demonstrate that they were thankful to the deities. That is why a skinny ull or decrepit goat would not do: the animal jad to be the best of the lot. Nevertheless, Dorians, Minoans, and even Etruscans had somewhat differing notions about sacrifice. Etruscan sacrifice was more formulaic and Minoan sacrifice more intimate than that of the Greeks. Unlike the Egyptians, Greek sacrifice was connected to the principles of farming and herding, rather than to the palace garden. Bread and meat were at the center of Greek sacrifice. Even in the Christian Eucharist, which developed later, the importance of bread and wine is encountered in veiled form, a comparison that raises important questions about the influence of Greek practices on early Christianity. The importance of the Greeks attitudes toward sacrifice might easily be overlooked because so many of their altars were removed when Christianity tried to destroy any evidence of heathen practices. In fact, in the early days of Greek religion, there were no temples, only altars built out in the open. One of the earliest and most sacred of the Greek altars, on the top of Mt. Lykaion in the Greek Peloponnese, dates back to 3000 BCE Mycenaean times. It eventually became associated with Zeus, the king of the Greek gods, but whether that was true in the earlier period is unknown. Below the summit there was a stadium, indicating the site s association with an athletic festival, a combination that was to become another important element of many Greek sanctuaries. The Mt. Lykaion altar, like the Temple of Hera at Samos (8th century BCE) consisted of no more than a low enclosure of flat stones forming a rectangle of about 2 by 3.5 meters. Altars became larger as time progressed; the one on the Acropolis at Athens, for exarnple, from the 5th or 4th century BCE, could hold a dozen bulls at one time. The Altar of Zeus at Pergarnon, now in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, was the most spectacular of all. Built from 197 to 159 BCE, it featured a flight of steps on its west side and flanking lonic colonnades. It stands on a five-stepped, almost square plinth. The altar proper was inside the court. The altars were not necessarily aligned symmetrically on axis with the ternple, especially during the Archaic period. At Samos, the altar, with its sacred tree, stood at irst at an oblique angle, referring perhaps to a different celestial moment than that of the temple. The emergence of the altar-plus-temple form coincided with the personification of gods in statues and, once again, seems to ave been part of the assimilation process the Dorians underwent when they came into contact with older Mediterranean practices. Early Greek representations of their gods show influences from both the Mesopotamian and Egyptian cultures. But Greek representations were rarely as diminutive as the Mesopotamian and Minoan statues could be, nor as large as the Egyptians often were. And perhaps therein lies the origin of the Greek advancement of the depiction of the human figure. The earliest three-dimensional representations of divinities, known as korai (draped female statues standing with feet together) were carved from wooden columns or planks at a roughly life-size scale. The Greeks called such statues kofossos, which had nothing to do with their size but denoted an image that was shaped like a pillar or column. The statues gradually came to represent gods in a more relaxed stance, one foot forward with the weight of the body balanced naturalistically on the rear leg. \r",{"entities":[[49,64,"ARCH"],[66,72,"LOC"],[91,116,"ARCH"],[2854,2867,"ARCH"],[2871,2880,"LOC"],[2893,2908,"ARCH"],[3269,3285,"ARCH"]]}],["4.33 First Temple of Apollo at Thermos, Greece 4.35 Scene depicting early Greek sacrificial rites New Temple 4.34 Plan: Later Temple of Apollo at Thermos Emergence of the Greek Temple Form The earliest temples, built of mud bricks and thatched roofs, were presumably modeled on chieftains houses and consisted of a single elongated, windowless room a naos or cella (from which the word cellar cormes} that was eventually divided into a pronaos and naos. An example is the Ternple of Apollo at Thermos (ca. 950 BCE) in the area of Aetolia in western Greece, where a low stone wall supported a high, steeply pitched thatched roof. There were no side chambers, ancillary spaces, or storage rooms. Soon a continuous porch was added around the body of the building to form an oblong shape, which over time became regularized and systemized. Later (ca. 630 BCE) we see, in the successive rebuilding of the temple, the developrnent of the temple form over time, ending in the regularized form of later temples. The last temple had an elongated form, with proportions of almost 5 to 1 and a row of columns down the center. Though Greek ternples can be found facing the various directions of the compass, more than 80 percent were laid out to face the sunrise, and most, more specifically, faced toward the sunrise on the actual day of their founding, which in turn coincided with the festival day of the divinity to which the temple was dedicated. From this custom arises the term orientation, primarily applied to the direction of the axis of a temple. Temples, jowever, were also sometimes oriented to elements in the landscape, to a solitary peak that suggested the presence of Zeus, or to double peaks, which, reminiscent of a bull's jorns, were equated with Zeus. The Greek sanctuary was far from being a detached and spiritual sphere. Symbolically, it was representative of political, economic, and military life as well as the well-being of the city and the region. Many temples served as war museums, holding the spoils of conquest as well as serving as armories. \r",{"entities":[[5,27,"ARCH"],[31,38,"LOC"],[126,142,"ARCH"],[146,153,"LOC"],[472,489,"ARCH"],[493,500,"LOC"],[530,537,"LOC"],[541,555,"LOC"]]}],["4.36 Slightly bigger than life-size female figure, mid-6th century BCE The word fernple is widely used to describe Greek and often non-Greek religious structures, though that word, which is derived from the Etruscan, came to be used only later by the Romans. For the Greeks, the structures were considered a type of house (oikos) for the deity, who was represented inside the temple by his cult statue, originally made out of wood. But unlike Mesopotamian and Egyptian temples, the Greek temple had no storage rooms, preparation rooms, courtyards, or ancillary spaces. The temple was an integrated architectural unit, the main purpose of which was to house the divine statue. The ce/la was used primarily to store gifts to the temple and even war booty. Unlike in Egypt, the statue was not mobile: it was not paraded from site to site. Furthermore, the main religious events took place outside the temple, in front of the altar, and not within. Of particular sacred importance was the idea of the femenos, the boundary around the temple precinct. It could only be crossed at one point, marked by a gate, or propylon. The temenos did not necessarily have to be a wall, and could be nothing more than a row of stones on the ground. Its sanctity was inviolate, as it was a piece of land cut off from secular reality and reassigned to the divine.

Its podium measures 14 by 40 meters, with a central row of five columns within the cella and two in the pronaos. The cella was of stone, but the columns and entablature were of oak; the roof was low pitched and covered in fired terra-cotta tiles a Greek invention. his temple represents an important break in the development of temple design. Whereas the stones for Egyptian temples were of irregular size, the ashlar blocks of this temple were laid in regular courses all the way to the roofline a standardization of masonry elements. Furthermore, in Egypt, a wall was typically composed of two separate walls, the gap between them filled with rubble. Here the wall is a single vertical element. As with Egyptian temples, however, the wall was covered with a thin coat of plaster that would present to the viewer a smooth, continuous surface broken only, in this case, by a series of pilasters that responded to the rhythm of the colonnade along the outside of the cella. The site was fortified in about 1200 BCE, and ritual festivities were performed from the middle of the 11th century BCE onward. The Temple of Poseidon eventually attracted the Panhellenic Games, called the Isthmia, which took place every two years in honor of Melicertes-Palaemon, or Poseidon. The altar was a 30-meter-long structure in front of the temple, with the sports field and stadium just to the south. 4.38 Pictorial view: Temple of Poseidon at Isthmia \r",{"entities":[[764,769,"LOC"],[1395,1413,"ARCH"],[1426,1451,"ARCH"],[1456,1474,"ARCH"],[1478,1485,"LOC"],[2671,2689,"ARCH"],[2971,2989,"ARCH"],[2993,3000,"LOC"]]}]]}
