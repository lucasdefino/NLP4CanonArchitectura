While the level of professional talent and skill in the field is higher today, worldwide, than at any other moment in history, at the same time the world enters ever more deeply into a confused state of total political paralysis, so much so that one is reluctantly drawn to conclude that the human species no longer has the capacity to act in its own best interests. At the micro-level, the techno-scientific division of labour is such that we are able to penetrate ever more deeply into the mysteries of nature, but simultaneously we are the perennial victims of a triumphant globalized capitalism through which, at the macro-level, we are locked in a titanic struggle with a rebarbative nature, which is now already beyond our control. The impasse of escalating climate change, which was already a fact when the fourth edition of this history was published in 2007, is ever more apparent today as we encounter the worldwide crisis of democracy and the \r",{"entities":[]}],["accompanying hysteria of populist political reaction. Given that this was already essentially the state of things at the millennium, | have elected to the eliminate the penultimate chapter of the fourth edition and to expand its content into a new Part IV, under virtually the same title, World Architecture and the Modern Movement . Accordingly, the last chapter of the fourth edition, entitled Architecture in the Age of Globalization , has been kept in place as a coda to the fifth edition, carrying essentially the same content save for certain material that has been absorbed into Part IV. | began work on this history in 1970, when the idea of the Modern Movement was still current on the London architectural scene despite the fact that, unknown at the time, the term Modern Movement (Moderne Bewegung) had first appeared in Otto Wagner s book Moderne Architektur (1896). While the term appears throughout the various editions of his book, the title of the last edition, of 1914, was discreetly changed to Die Baukunst unserer Zeit (The Architecture of our Time). Throughout the numerous accounts of the evolution of the Modern Movement in architecture, there is a divide between authors who prefer to allude to a specific time period and others, like myself, who, possibly because they have had an architectural formation, prefer to allude to the Modern Movement in the same way as the Italian architect-historian Leonardo Benevolo, whose two-volume Storia dell architettura moderna of 1960, which was first published in English a decade later, specifically alluded to the Modern Movement in the subtitle of his second volume. Nevertheless, as we pass from Gustav Adolf Platz s pioneering Die Baukunst der neuesten Zeit (Building in our Time) of 1927 to Sigfried Giedion s Space, Time and Architecture of 1941, to Arnold Whittick s European Architecture in the 20th Century of 1950 and finally to Reyner Banham s Theory and Design in the First Machine Age of 1960, we notice that the \r",{"entities":[]}],["association of architecture with modernity is discreetly avoided, and likewise there is no reference to the Modern Movement in an avant-gardist sense of that term. In this fifth edition, however, | have frequently had to return to the idea of the Modern Movement by alluding to the beginnings of a discernibly modern architecture in various parts of the world, under the decidedly open-ended title of World Architecture . The term World Architecture was first coined by the China Architecture and Building Press in 2000, when it published its ambitious project of 1,000 significant buildings worldwide for the entire 20th century, which had been critically selected by ten regional committees. The work was published in ten volumes, one for each region, with the subtitle A Critical Mosaic 1900-2000. Something similar was attempted for the period of the millennium alone through Luis Fernandez-Galiano s four-volume publication Atlas: Global Architecture circa 2000, issued in 2007 by the BBVA Foundation in Spain. In the new Part IV of my unduly ambitious account, | have attempted to assemble, under the rubric of World Architecture , a synthesis between these two editorial operations. | have adopted Fernandez-Galiano s approach of audaciously dividing the world into four transcontinental regions - Europe, the Americas, Africa and the Middle East, and Asia and the Pacific - while at the same time moving across the entire span of the 20th century to touch, however provisionally, not only on the beginnings of the Modern Movement in various parts of the world, but also on relatively recent developments where these appear to merit inclusion. | feel it is necessary to add that, however dated this may seem, the Modern Movement was once inseparable from the liberative modern project in the sense in which this was defined by the German philosopher and sociologist Jurgen Habermas, implying an ultimately socialist welfare \r",{"entities":[]}],["state irrespective of the political ideology at a given instant in time and at a specific place. Here an effort has been made to widen the scope of the book in order to redress the Eurocentric and transatlantic bias of previous editions of this history. However, it has not proved possible to be as comprehensive as the title of the new Part IV would suggest. One explanation is that there is a physical limit, beyond which the book becomes so thick and cumbersome that it no longer fulfils its fundamental role as a convenient reference work or textbook. The other limit is the embarrassing fact that, despite the best intentions of the author, no single person can possibly hope to cover the vast breadth and complexity of contemporary architecture as it exists today, irrespective of whether the focus is on the largely forgotten pioneering essays of the Modern Movement of the 1920s and 1930s, or the various socio-political and cultural developments that have taken place throughout the world over the last half-century. While the material covered in Parts | and Il of Modern Architecture: A Critical History remain largely unaltered, separate chapters dealing with developments in France and Czechoslovakia between the two world wars have been inserted. At the same time, new lacunae have arisen in as much as modern architecture in Russia after 1932 has been wilfully excluded from this account, as has Eastern European architecture in general. My sole justification for this draconian omission is partly owing to the fact that, as Akos Moravansky has argued, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the inherently destructive power of free-market capitalism led to the general adoption of the so-called Moscow Style. This judiciously combined international Post-Modernism with a certain nostalgia for the Russian Art Nouveau in order to produce an appropriate setting for the banks and shopping malls built during the presidency of Boris Yeltsin (1991-99). Thus, despite talented forays here and there on the part of \r",{"entities":[]}],["Eastern European architects, it has proved difficult until now to discern any indications of an emerging regional culture of consequence. Despite the fact that the fifth edition makes a concerted effort to address large parts of the non-Eurocentric world, or, let us say, the post-colonial world, Europe nonetheless still appears in Part IV as a continental sector because | feel that in following Fernandez-Galiano s taxonomy it is necessary to pick up certain canonical works by prominent architects, particularly some Scandinavians, who had previously been inexplicably overlooked in earlier editions. Nevertheless, there remain many omissions that are categorically difficult to justify, above all in Southeast Asia: Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. All of this begs the question as to what do we mean by a culture of architecture and how do we begin to perceive it in the first place? We surely have to concede that the Modern Movement in architecture has had, and continues to have, a decidedly wave-like character: it comes into being, somewhat unannounced, rises to its maturity and then eventually declines, possibly arising again in virtually the same place but at an entirely different time and ina different form, to begin the cycle all over again. Throughout this history | have made an effort to reveal this cyclical character not only with regard to the movement s Eurocentric beginnings, but also its manifestation in contemporary architecture in the world at large. To this end | have indicated from time to time the way in which certain political and socio-economic transformations have had an impact not only on the lifecycle of a given cultural momentum, but also on the programme and the character of an emerging environmental form. All of this has now shaped my approach to documenting the dissemination of the Modern Movement across time. In dealing with each vast continental sector and the national subsets of which it is necessarily comprised, | have \r",{"entities":[]}],["attempted to adopt the same procedure throughout: beginning with a brief documentation of the Modern Movement and then passing abruptly to more recent manifestations of a similar impulse. This constant double- take across large lapses of time has meant that | have had to rely on illustrations to a much greater extent than in earlier editions of this history, because it is difficult to convey the often highly inflected nature of recent architecture, which, while not in any way Post-Modern, nonetheless incorporates a tactile, microcosmic character that is difficult to convey in words. One of the challenges of writing an account over such a broad front is the quandary of the criteria by which one decides to include or exclude a particular work. Despite a constant attempt to maintain a certain level of objectivity, there is an inescapable subjectivity determining one s choices. Perhaps this is the ultimate meaning of the term a critical history inasmuch as the historical account fuses with both criticism and theory, serving to justify expansion on a particular work or subject matter that one values, at the expense of the others that, because of time, space and polemical prejudices, one elects to ignore. Of course, there is no absolute history, for, as E.H. Carr made clear in his book What is History?, each age writes its own history and in this sense creates a purview with which we may hopefully proceed in a culturally significant way. It is ironic that the first edition of this history, written by an architect, committed to the unfinished modern project , to coin Jurgen Habermas s memorable phrase, should have been published in the same year as the first architectural biennale, staged in Venice in 1980. This exhibition, curated by Paolo Portoghesi, was dedicated to celebrating the historicizing pastiche of Post-Modern architecture, under the slogan, The End of Prohibition and the Presence of the Past . Since this time, subsequent editions of this history, of which this is the greatly expanded fifth edition, have been \r",{"entities":[]}],["dedicated, in one way or another, to the continuation of the modern project in terms of a liberative architecture. However, it has become increasingly clear that under the aegis of an anti-ecological, neo-liberal consumerism, continually exacerbating the the maldistribution of wealth, the prospects for any kind of rational land settlement, let alone urbanism, are extremely limited, if not totally unavailable. At best what is left for the critical practice of architecture at a large scale are predominantly horizontal megaforms designed as artificial landscapes in order to encapsulate some vestige of the civic and to stand against the universal placelessness of the environment as a whole. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Part | Cultural Developments and Predisposing Techniques 1750- 1939 \r",{"entities":[]}],["Chapter 1 Cultural Transformations: Neo-Classical Architecture 1750-1900 The Baroque system had operated as a kind of double intersection. It had often contrasted with rationalized gardens, building facades decorated with plant motifs. The reign of man and the reign of nature had certainly remained distinct but they had exchanged their characteristics, merging into each other for the sake of ornamentation and prestige. On the other hand the English style park, in which man s intervention was supposed to remain invisible, was intended to offer the purposefulness of nature; while within, but separate from the actual park, the houses constructed by Morris or Adam manifested the will of man, isolating Clearly the presence of human reason in the midst of the irrational domains of freely growing vegetation. The Baroque interpenetration of man and nature was now replaced by a separation, thus establishing the distance between man and nature which was a prerequisite for nostalgic contemplation. Now ... this contemplative separation arose as a compensatory or expiatory reaction against the growing attitude of practical men towards nature. While technical exploitation tended to wage war on nature, houses and parks attempted a reconciliation, a local armistice, introducing the dream of an impossible peace: and to this end man had continued to retain the image of untouched natural surroundings. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Jean Starobinski L Invention de la libert , 19641 The architecture of Neo-Classicism seems to have emerged out of two different but related developments which radically transformed the relationship between man and nature. The first was a sudden increase in man s capacity to exercise control over nature, which by the mid-17th century had begun to advance beyond the technical frontiers of the Renaissance. The second was a fundamental shift in the nature of human consciousness, in response to major changes taking place in society, which gave birth to a new cultural formation that was equally appropriate to the lifestyles of the declining aristocracy and the rising bourgeoisie. Whereas technological changes led to a new infrastructure and to the exploitation of an increased productive capacity, the change in human consciousness yielded new categories of knowledge and a historicist mode of thought that was so reflexive as to question its own identity. Where the one, grounded in science, took immediate form in the extensive road and canal works of the 17th and 18th centuries and gave rise to new technical institutions, such as the Ecole des Ponts et Chauss es, founded in 1747, the other led to the emergence of the humanist disciplines of the Enlightenment, including the pioneer works of modern sociology, aesthetics, history and archaeology - Montesquieu s De / esprit des lois (1748), Baumgarten s Aesthetica (1750), Voltaire s Le Si cle de Louis XIV(1751) and J. J. Winckelmann s Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums of 1764. The over-elaboration of architectural language in the Rococo interiors of the Ancien R gime and the secularization of Enlightenment thought compelled the architects of the 18th century, by now aware of the emergent and unstable nature of their age, to search for a true style through a precise reappraisal of antiquity. Their motivation was not \r",{"entities":[]}],["simply to copy the ancients but to obey the principles on which their work had been based. The archaeological research that arose from this impulse soon led to a major controversy: to which, of four Mediterranean cultures - the Egyptians, the Etruscans, the Greeks and the Romans - should they look for a true style? One of the first consequences of reassessing the antique world was to extend the itinerary of the traditional Grand Tour beyond the frontiers of Rome, so as to study at its periphery those cultures on which, according to Vitruvius, Roman architecture had been based. The discovery and excavation of Roman cities at Herculaneum and Pompeii, during the first half of the 18th century, encouraged expeditions further afield and visits were soon being made to ancient Greek sites in both Sicily and Greece. The received Vitruvian dictum of the Renaissance - the catechism of Classicism - was now to be checked against the actual ruins. The measured drawings that were published in the 1750s and 1760s, Julien-David Le Roy s Ruines des plus beaux monuments de la Gr ce (1758), James Stuart and Nicholas Revett s Antiquities of Athens (1762), and Robert Adam and Charles-Louis Cl risseau s documentation of Diocletian s palace at Split (1764), testify to the intensity with which these studies were pursued. It was Le Roy s promotion of Greek architecture as the origin of the true style that raised the chauvinist ire of the Italian architect-engraver Giovanni Battista Piranesi. Piranesi s Della Magnificenza ed Architettura de Romani of 1761 was a direct attack on Le Roy s polemic: he asserted not only that the Etruscans had antedated the Greeks but that, together with their successors the Romans, they had raised architecture to a higher level of refinement. The only evidence that he could cite in support of his claim was the few Etruscan structures that had survived the ravages of Rome - tombs and engineering works - and these seem to have orientated the remainder of his career in a remarkable \r",{"entities":[]}],["way. In one set of etchings after another he represented the dark side of that sensation already classified by Edmund Burke in 1757 as the Sublime, that tranquil terror induced by the contemplation of great size, extreme antiquity and decay. These qualities acquired their full force in Piranesi s work through the infinite grandeur of the images that he portrayed. Such nostalgic Classical images were, however, as Manfredo Tafuri has observed, treated as a myth to be contested ... as mere fragments, as deformed symbols, as hallucinating organisms of an order in a state of decay . Between his Parere su i Architettura of 1765 and his Paestum etchings, published only after his death in 1778, Piranesi abandoned architectural verisimilitude and gave his imagination full rein. In one publication after another, culminating in his extravagantly eclectic work on interior ornamentation of 1769, he indulged in hallucinatory manipulations of historicist form. Indifferent to Winckelmann s pro-Hellenic distinction between innate beauty and gratuitous ornament, his delirious inventions exercised an irresistible attraction on his contemporaries, and the Adam brothers Graeco-Roman interiors were greatly indebted to his flights of imagination. In England, where the Rococo had never been fully accepted, the impulse to redeem the excess of the Baroque found its first expression in the Palladianism initiated by the Earl of Burlington, though something of a similar purgative spirit may be detected in the last works of Nicholas Hawksmoor at Castle Howard. By the end of the 1750s, however, the British were already assiduously pursuing instruction in Rome itself where, between 1750 and 1765, the major Neo-Classical proponents could be found in residence, from the pro-Roman and pro-Etruscan Piranesi to the pro-Greek Winckelmann and Le Roy, whose influence had yet to take effect. Among the British contingent were James Stuart, who was to employ the Greek Doric order as early as 1758, and the younger George Dance, who soon \r",{"entities":[]}],["after his return to London in 1765 designed Newgate Gaol, a superficially Piranesian structure whose rigorous organization may well have owed something to the Neo- Palladian proportional theories of Robert Morris. The final development of British Neo-Classicism came first in the work of Dance s pupil John Soane, who synthesized to a remarkable degree various influences drawn from Piranesi, Adam, Dance and even from the English Baroque. The Greek Revival cause was then popularized by Thomas Hope, whose Household Furniture and Interior Decoration (1807) made available a British version of the Napoleonic Style Empire , then in the process of being created by Charles Percier and Pierre-Francois-L onard Fontaine. Nothing could have been further from the British experience than the theoretical development that attended the emergence of Neo-Classicism in France. An early awareness of cultural relativity in the late 17th century prompted Claude Perrault to question the validity of the Vitruvian proportions as these had been received and refined through Classical theory. Instead, he elaborated his thesis of positive beauty and arbitrary beauty, giving to the former the normative role of standardization and perfection and to the latter such expressive function as may be required by a particular circumstance or character. This challenge to Vitruvian orthodoxy was codified by the Abb de Cordemoy in his Nouveau Trait de toute l architecture (1706), where he replaced the Vitruvian attributes of architecture, namely utilitas, firmitas and venustas (utility, solidity and beauty) by his own trinity of ordonnance, distribution and biens ance. While the first two of his categories concerned the correct proportioning of the Classical orders and their appropriate disposition, the third introduced the notion of fitness, with which Cordemoy warned against the inappropriate application of Classical or honorific elements to utilitarian or commercial structures. Thus, in addition to being critical of the Baroque, which was \r",{"entities":[]}],["the last rhetorical, public manner of the Ancien R gime, Cordemoy s Trait anticipated Jacques-Frangois Blondel s preoccupation with appropriate formal expression and with a differentiated physiognomy to accord with the varying social character of different building types. The age was already having to confront the articulation of a much more complex society. Apart from insisting on the judicious application of Classical elements, Cordemoy was concerned with their geometrical purity, in reaction against such Baroque devices as irregular columniation, broken pediments and twisted columns. Ornamentation too had to be subject to propriety, and Cordemoy, anticipating Adolf Loos s Ornament und Verbrechen (Ornament and Crime) by two hundred years, argued that many buildings required no ornament at all. His preference was for astylar masonry and orthogonal structures. For him, the free-standing column was the essence of a pure architecture such as had been made manifest in the Gothic cathedral and the Greek temple. The Abb Laugier in his Essai sur l architecture (1753) reinterpreted Cordemoy, to posit a universal natural architecture, the primordial primitive hut consisting of four tree trunks supporting a rustic pitched roof. After Cordemoy, he asserted this primal form as the basis for a sort of classicized Gothic structure in which there would be neither arches nor pilasters nor pedestals nor any other kind of formal articulation, and where the interstices between the columns would be as fully glazed as possible. Such a translucent structure was realized in Jacques- Germain Soufflot s church of Ste-Genevi ve in Paris [2], begun in 1755. Soufflot, who in 1750 had been one of the first architects to visit the Doric temples at Paestum, was determined to recreate the lightness, the spaciousness and the proportion of Gothic architecture in Classical (not to say Roman) terms. To this end he adopted a Greek cross plan, the nave and aisles being formed by a system of flat domes \r",{"entities":[]}],["and semicircular arches supported on a continuous internal peristyle. The task of integrating the theory of Cordemoy and the magnum opus of Soufflot into the French academic tradition fell to Blondel, who, after opening his architectural school in Rue de la Harpe in 1743, became the master of that so- called visionary generation of architects that included Etienne-Louis Boull e, Jacques Gondoin, Pierre Patte, Marie- Joseph Peyre, Jean-Baptiste Rondelet and, probably the most visionary of all, Claude-Nicolas Ledoux. Blondel set out his main precepts, concerning composition, type and character, in his Cours d architecture, published from 1750 to 1770. His ideal church design, published in the second volume of his Cours, was related to Ste-Genevi ve and prominently displayed a representational front, while articulating each internal element as part of a continuous spatial system whose infinite vistas evoked a sense of the Sublime. This church project hints at the simplicity and grandeur that were to inform the work of many of his pupils, most notably Boull e, who after 1772 devoted his life to the projection of buildings so vast as to preclude their realization. In addition to representing the social character of his creations in accordance with the teachings of Blondel, Boull e evoked the sublime emotions of terror and tranquillity through the grandeur of his conceptions. Influenced by Le Camus de M zi res G nie de l'architecture, ou l analogie de cet art avec nos sensations (1780), he began to develop his genre terrible, in which the immensity of the vista and the unadorned geometrical purity of monumental form are combined in such a way as to promote exhilaration and anxiety. More than any other Enlightenment architect, Boull e was obsessed with the capacity of light to evoke the presence of the divine. This intention is evident in the sunlit diaphanous haze that illuminates the interior of his M tropole , modelled partly on Ste-Genevi ve. A similar light is portrayed in the vast \r",{"entities":[]}],["masonry sphere of his projected cenotaph for Isaac Newton [3], where by night a fire was suspended to represent the sun, while by day it was extinguished to reveal the illusion of the firmament produced by the daylight shining through the sphere s perforated walls. 3 Boull e, project for a cenotaph for Isaac Newton, c. 1785. Section by night . While Boull e s political sentiments were solidly republican, he remained obsessed with imagining the monuments of some omnipotent state dedicated to the worship of the Supreme Being. Unlike Ledoux, he was unimpressed by the rural decentralized utopias of Morelly or Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Despite this, his influence in post- Revolutionary Europe was considerable, primarily through the activity of his pupil Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand, who reduced his extravagant ideas to a normative and economic building typology, set out in the Pr cis des lecons donn es a l Ecole Polytechnique (1802-09) [4]. \r",{"entities":[]}],["4 Durand, possible combinations and permutations of plan forms, from his Pr cis, 1802-09. After fifteen years of millennial disarray the Napoleonic era required useful structures of appropriate grandeur and authority, on the condition that they be achieved as cheaply as possible. Durand, the first tutor in architecture at the Ecole Polytechnique, sought to establish a universal building methodology, an architectural counterpart to the Napoleonic Code, by which economic and appropriate structures could be created through the modular permutation of fixed plan types and alternative elevations. Thus Boull e s obsession with vast Platonic volumes was exploited as a means to achieve an appropriate character at a reasonable cost. Durand s criticism of Ste-Genevi ve, for example, with its 206 columns and 612 metres (2,008 feet) of wall, involved him in making a counter-proposal for a circular temple of comparable area that would require only 112 columns and 248 metres (814 feet) of wall - a considerable economy, with which, according to him, one would have achieved a far more impressive aura. Ledoux, after his career had been terminated by the Revolution, returned during his imprisonment to develop the \r",{"entities":[]}],["scheme of the salt works that he had built for Louis XVI at Arc-et-Senans in 1773-79. He expanded the semicircular form of this complex into the representational core of his ideal city of Chaux [5], published in 1804 under the title L Architecture consid r e sous le rapport de I art, des moeurs et de la l gislation. The semicircular salt works itself (which he developed into the oval centre of his city) may be seen as one of the first essays in industrial architecture, inasmuch as it consciously integrated productive units with workers housing. Each element in this physiocratic complex was rendered according to its character. Thus the salt evaporation sheds on the axis were high-roofed like agricultural buildings and finished in smooth ashlar, with rusticated dressings, while the director s house in the centre was low-roofed and pedimented, rusticated throughout and embellished with Classical porticos. Here and there the walls of the salt sheds and the workers houses were relieved by grotesque spouts of petrified water, which not only symbolized the saline solution on which the enterprise was based but also suggested that the productive system and the labour force had an equally processal status. \r",{"entities":[]}],["5 Ledoux, ideal city of Chaux, 1804. In fictitiously developing this limited typology to include all the institutions of his ideal city, Ledoux extended the idea of an architectural physiognomy to symbolize the social intention of his otherwise abstract forms. The meanings are established either by conventional symbols, such as the fasces evoking justice and unity on the courthouse, the so-called Pacif re, or by isomorphism, as in the case of the Oikema, planned in the shape of a penis. This last structure was dedicated to libertinage, whose curious social purpose was to induce virtue through sexual satiety. A whole world separates Durand s rational permutation of received Classical elements from Ledoux s arbitrary but purgative reconstitution of fragmented Classical parts demonstrated in the toll-gates that he designed for Paris between 1785 and 1789. These barri res were just as disconnected from the culture of their time as the idealized institutions of Chaux. With their gradual demolition after \r",{"entities":[]}],["1789 they suffered the same fate as the abstract and unpopular customs boundary that they were intended to administer, the Enceinte des Fermiers G n raux, of which it was said, Le mur murant Paris rend Paris murmurant. After the Revolution, the evolution of Neo-Classicism was largely inseparable from the need to accommodate the new institutions of bourgeois society and to represent the emergence of the new republican state. That these forces were initially resolved in the compromise of constitutional monarchy hardly detracted from the role that Neo- Classicism played in the formation of the bourgeois imperialist style. The creation of Napoleon s Style Empire in Paris and Frederick Il s Francophile Kulturnation in Berlin are but separate manifestations of the same cultural tendency. The former made an eclectic use of antique motifs, be they Roman, Greek or Egyptian, to create the instant heritage of a republican dynasty - a style that revealed itself significantly in the theatrical tented interiors of the Napoleonic campaigns and in the solid Roman embellishments of the capital city, such as Percier and Fontaine s Rue de Rivoli and Arc du Carrousel and Gondoin s Place Vend me column dedicated to the Grande Arm e. In Germany the tendency was first manifested in Carl Gotthard Langhans s Brandenburg Gate, built as the western entry to Berlin in 1793, and in Friedrich Gilly s design for a monument to Frederick the Great, of 1797. Ledoux s primary forms inspired Gilly to emulate the severity of the Doric, thereby echoing the archaic power of the Sturm und Drang movement in German literature. Like his contemporary Friedrich Weinbrenner, he projected a spartan Ur-civilization of high moral value, with which to celebrate the myth of the ideal Prussian state. His remarkable monument would have taken the form of an artificial acropolis on the Leipzigerplatz. This temenos would have been entered from Potsdam through a squat triumphal arch capped by a quadriga. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Gilly s colleague and successor, the Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel, acquired his early enthusiasm for Gothic not from Berlin or Paris, but from his own first-hand experience of Italian cathedrals. Yet after the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, this Romantic taste was largely eclipsed by the need to find an appropriate expression for the triumph of Prussian nationalism. The combination of political idealism and military prowess seems to have demanded a return to the Classic. In any event this was the style that linked Schinkel not only to Gilly but also to Durand, in the creation of his masterpieces in Berlin: his Neue Wache of 1816, his Schauspielhaus of 1821 and his Altes Museum of 1830 [6]. While both the guard-house and the theatre show characteristic features of Schinkel s mature style, the massive corners of the one and the mullioned wings of the other, the influence of Durand is most clearly revealed in the museum, which is a prototypical museum plan taken from the Pr cis and split in half - a transformation in which the central rotunda, peristyle and courtyards are retained and the side wings eliminated (see p. 269). While the wide entry steps, the peristyle and the eagles and Dioscuri on the roof symbolized the cultural aspirations of the Prussian state, Schinkel departed from the typological and representational methods of Durand to create a spatial articulation of extraordinary delicacy and power, as the wide peristyle gives way to a narrow portico containing a symmetrical entry stair and its mezzanine (an arrangement which would be remembered by Mies van der Rohe). \r",{"entities":[]}],["6 Schinkel, Altes Museum, Berlin, 1828-30. The main line of Blondel s Neo-Classicism was continued in the mid-19th century in the career of Henri Labrouste, who had studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts (the institution that succeeded the Acad mie Royale d Architecture after the Revolution) with Antoine-Laurent-Thomas Vaudoyer, who had been a pupil of Peyre. After winning the Prix de Rome in 1824 Labrouste spent the next five years at the French Academy, devoting much of his time in Italy to a study of the Greek temples at Paestum. Inspired by the work of Jakob-Ignaz Hittorff, Labrouste was among the first to argue that such structures had originally been brightly coloured. This, and his insistence on the primacy of structure and on the derivation of all ornament from construction, brought him into conflict with the authorities after the opening of his own atelier in 1830. In 1840 Labrouste was named architect of the Bibliotheque Ste-Genevi ve in Paris which had been created \r",{"entities":[]}],["to house part of the library impounded by the French state in 1789. Based apparently on Boull e s project for a library in the Palais Mazarin, of 1785, Labrouste s design consists of a perimeter wall of books enclosing a rectilinear space and supporting an iron-framed, barrel-vaulted roof which is divided into two halves and further supported in the centre of the space by a line of iron columns. Such Structural Rationalism was further refined in the main reading room and book stack that Labrouste built for the Bibliotheque Nationale in 1860-68 [7]. This complex, inserted into the courtyard of the Palais Mazarin, consists of a reading room covered by an iron and glass roof carried on sixteen cast-iron columns and a multi-storey wrought- and cast-iron book stack. Dispensing with the last trace of historicism, Labrouste designed the latter as a top-lit cage, in which light filters down through iron landings from the roof to the lowest floor. Although this solution was derived from Sydney Smirke s cast-iron reading room and stack built in the courtyard of Robert Smirke s Neo-Classical British Museum in 1854, the precise form of its execution implied a new aesthetic whose potential was not to be realized until the Constructivist work of the 20th century. \r",{"entities":[]}],["oS 7 Labrouste, book stack of the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, 1860-68. The middle of the 19th century saw the Neo-Classical heritage divided between two closely related lines of development: the Structural Classicism of Labrouste and the Romantic Classicism of Schinkel. Both schools were confronted by the same 19th-century proliferation of new institutions and had to respond equally to the task of creating new building types. They differed largely in the manner in which they achieved these representative qualities: the Structural Classicists tended to emphasize structure - the line of Cordemoy, Laugier and Soufflot; while the Romantic Classicists tended to stress the physiognomic character of the form itself - the line of Ledoux, Boull e and Gilly. Where one school seems to have concentrated on such types as prisons, hospitals and railway stations, in the work of men like Emile-Jacques Gilbert and Francois- Alexandre Duquesney (designer of the Gare de I Est, Paris, in 1852), the other addressed itself more to representational structures, such as the university museum and library of Charles Robert Cockerell in England or the more grandiose \r",{"entities":[]}],["monuments erected by Leo von Klenze in Germany - above all the latter s highly Romantic Walhalla, completed at Regensburg in 1842. In terms of theory, Structural Classicism began with Rondelet s Trait de / art de batir (1802) and culminated at the end of the century in the writing of the engineer Auguste Choisy, particularly his Histoire de I architecture (1899). For Choisy the essence of architecture is construction, and all stylistic transformations are merely the logical consequence of technical development: To parade your Art Nouveau is to ignore the whole teaching of history. Not so did the great styles of the past come into being. It was in the suggestion of construction that the architect of the great artistic ages found his truest inspiration. Choisy illustrated the structural determination of his Histoire with axonometric projections [8] which revealed the essence of a type of form in a single graphic image, comprising plan, section and elevation. As Reyner Banham has observed, these objective illustrations reduce the architecture that they represent to pure abstraction, and it was this, plus the amount of the information they synthesized, that endeared them to the pioneers of the Modern Movement after the turn of the century. \r",{"entities":[]}],["8 Choisy, axonometric projection of part of the Panth on, Paris (fig. 2), from his Histoire de l architecture, 1899. The emphasis that Choisy s history placed on Greek and Gothic architecture was a late 19th-century rationalization of that Graeco-Gothic ideal which had first been formulated over a century before by Cordemoy. This 18th-century projection of Gothic structure into Classical syntax found its parallel in Choisy s characterization of the Doric as wooden structure transposed into masonry. Just such a transposition was to be practised by Choisy s disciple, Auguste Perret, who insisted on detailing his reinforced-concrete structures after the manner of traditional wood framing. A Structural Rationalist to the core, Choisy was nonetheless capable of responding to the Romantic sensibility when he wrote of the Acropolis: The Greeks never visualized a building without the site that framed it \r",{"entities":[]}],["and the other buildings that surrounded it... each architectural motif, on its own, is symmetrical, but every group is treated like a landscape where the masses alone balance out.

Certainly it would have had a limited appeal for Julien Guadet, who sought, in his lecture course E/ ments et th orie de I architecture (1902), to establish a normative approach to the composition of structures from technically up-to-date elements, arranged as far as possible according to the tradition of axial composition. It was through Guadet s teaching at the Beaux-Arts, and his influence on his pupils Auguste Perret and Tony Garnier, that the principles of Classical Elementarist composition were handed down to the pioneer architects of the 20th century. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Chapter 2 Territorial Transformations: Urban Developments 1800-1909 [With] the development of increasingly abstract means of communication the continuity of rooted communication is replaced by new systems which continue to perfect themselves throughout the 19th century, allowing the population greater mobility and providing information that is more precisely synchronized with the accelerating rhythm of history.

Francoise Choay The Modern City: Planning in the 19th Century, 19691 The finite city, as it had come into being in Europe over the previous 500 years, was totally transformed in the space of a century by the interaction of a number of unprecedented technical and socio-economic forces, many of which first emerged in England during the second half of the 18th century. Prominent among them from a technical point of view must be counted such innovations as Abraham Darby s mass production of cast-iron rails, from 1767, and Jethro Tull s seed-drill cultivation of crops in rows, generally adopted after 1731. Where Darby s invention led to Henry Cort s development of the puddling process for the \r",{"entities":[]}],["simplified conversion of cast to wrought iron in 1784, Tull s drill was essential to the perfection of Charles Townshend s four-crop rotational system - the principle of high farming that became general towards the end of the century. Such productive innovations had multiple repercussions. In the case of metallurgy, English iron production increased forty-fold between 1750 and 1850 (rising to two million tons a year by 1850); in the case of agriculture, after the Enclosures Act of 1771 inefficient husbandry was replaced by the four-crop system. Where the one was boosted by the Napoleonic Wars, the other was motivated by the need to feed a rapidly growing industrial population. At the same time the cottage-weaving industry, which had helped to sustain the agrarian economy of the first half of the 18th century, was rapidly changed, first by James Hargreaves s spinning jenny of 1764, which greatly increased the individual s spinning capacity, and then by Edmund Cartwright s steam-powered loom, first used for factory production in 1784. This last event not only established textile production as a large-scale industry, but also led immediately to the invention of the multistorey fireproof mill. Thus traditional textile manufacturing was forced to abandon its predominantly rural base and to concentrate both labour and plant, first next to watercourses and then, with the advent of steam power, close to coal deposits. With 24,000 power looms in production by 1820, the English mill town was already an established fact. This process of uprooting - enracinement, as Simone Weil has called it - was further accelerated by the use of steam traction for transport. Richard Trevithick first demonstrated the locomotive on cast-iron rails in 1804. The opening of the first public rail service between Stockton and Darlington in 1825 was followed by the rapid development of a completely new infrastructure, Britain having some 10,000 miles of track in place by 1860. The advent of long-distance \r",{"entities":[]}],["steam navigation after 1865 greatly increased European migration to the Americas, Africa and Australia. While this migration brought the populations needed to expand the economy of colonial terrirories and to fill the growing grid- plan cities of the New World, the military, political and economic obsolescence of the traditional European walled city led, after the liberal-national revolutions of 1848, to the wholesale demolition of ramparts and to the extension of the formerly finite city into its already burgeoning suburbs. These general developments, accompanied by a sudden drop in mortality due to improved standards in nutrition and medical techniques, gave rise to unprecedented urban concentrations, first in England and then, at differing rates of growth, throughout the developing world. Manchester s population grew eight-fold in the course of the century, from 75,000 in 1801 to 600,000 by 1901, as compared to London's six-fold increase over the same period, from around one million in 1801 to six and a half million by the turn of the century. Paris grew at a comparable rate but had a more modest beginning, expanding from 500,000 in 1801 to 3 million by 1901. Even these six- to eight-fold increases are modest compared with New York s growth over the same period. New York was first laid out as a gridded city in 1811, in accordance with the Commissioners Plan of that year, and grew from its 1801 population of 33,000 to 500,000 by 1850 and 3% million by 1901. Chicago grew at an even more astronomical rate, rising from 300 people at the time of Thompson s grid of 1833 to around 30,000 (of whom something under half had been born in the States) by 1850, and going on to become a city of two million by the turn of the century. The accommodation of such volatile growth led to the transformation of old neighbourhoods into slums, and also to jerry-built new houses and tenements whose main purpose, given the general lack of municipal transport, was to provide as cheaply as possible the maximum amount of \r",{"entities":[]}],["rudimentary shelter within walking distance of the centres of production. Naturally such congested developments had inadequate standards of light, ventilation and open space and poor sanitary facilities, such as communal outside lavatories, wash-houses and refuse storage. With primitive drainage and inadequate maintenance, this pattern could lead to the piling up of excrement and garbage and to flooding, and these conditions naturally provoked a high incidence of disease - first tuberculosis and then, more alarmingly for the authorities, a number of outbreaks of cholera in both England and Continental Europe in the 1830s and 1840s. These epidemics had the effect of precipitating health reform and of bringing about some of the earliest legislation governing the construction and maintenance of dense conurbations. In 1833 the London authorities instructed the Poor Law Commission, headed by Edwin Chadwick, to make enquiries about the origins of a cholera outbreak in Whitechapel. This led to Chadwick s report, An Inquiry into the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population in Great Britain (1842), to the Royal Commission on the State of Large Towns and Populous Districts of 1844 and, eventually, to the Public Health Act of 1848. This Act, in addition to others, made local authorities legally responsible for sewerage, refuse collection, water supply, roads, the inspection of slaughter-houses and the burial of the dead. Similar provisions were to occupy Haussmann during the rebuilding of Paris between 1853 and 1870. The result of this legislation in England was to make society vaguely aware of the need to upgrade working-class housing; but as to the models and means by which this should be achieved there was little initial agreement. Nonetheless, the Chadwick-inspired Society for Improving the Conditions of the Labouring Classes sponsored the erection of the first working-class flats in London in 1844 to the design of the architect Henry Roberts, and followed this \r",{"entities":[]}],["resolute beginning with its Streatham Street flats of 1848- 50 and a prototypical two-storey worker's cottage containing four flats, again to the design of Roberts, for the Great Exhibition of 1851. This generic model for the stacking of apartments in pairs around a common staircase was to influence the planning of working-class housing for the rest of the century. The American-backed philanthropic Peabody Trust and various English benevolent societies and local authorities attempted, after 1864, to upgrade the quality of working- class housing, but little of significance was achieved until the slum clearance Acts of 1868 and 1875 and the Housing of the Working Classes Act of 1890, under which local authorities were required to provide public housing. In 1893, when the London County Council (established in 1890) began to build workers flats under the auspices of this Act, its Architects Department made a remarkable effort to deinstitutionalize the image of such housing by adapting the Arts and Crafts domestic style (see p. 53) to the realization of six-storey blocks of flats. Typical of this development is the Millbank Estate, begun in 1897. Throughout the 19th century the effort of industry to take care of its own assumed many forms, from the model mill, railway and factory towns to projected utopian communities intended as prototypes for some future enlightened state. Among those who manifested an early concern for integrated industrial settlements one must acknowledge Robert Owen, whose New Lanark in Scotland (1815) was designed as a pioneering institution of the co-operative movement, and Sir Titus Salt, whose Saltaire, near Bradford in Yorkshire (founded in 1850), was a paternalistic mill town, complete with traditional urban institutions such as a church, an infirmary, a secondary school, public baths, almshouses and a park. Neither of these realizations could match in scope and liberating potential the radical vision of Charles Fourier s \r",{"entities":[]}],[" new industrial world , as formulated in his essay of that title (Le Nouveau Monde industriel) published in 1829. Fourier s non-repressive society was to depend on the establishment of ideal communities or phalanxes , housed in pha/anst res, where people were to be related in accordance with Fourier s psychological principle of passional attraction . Since the phalanstery was projected as being in open country, its economy was to be predominantly agricultural, supplemented by light manufacturing. In his earliest writings Fourier outlined the physical attributes of his communal settlement; it was modelled on the layout of Versailles, its central wing being given over to public functions (dining hall, library, winter-garden, etc.), while its side wings were devoted to the workshops and the caravanseray. In his Trait de l'association domestique agricole (1822) Fourier wrote of the phalanstery as being a miniature town whose streets would have the advantage of not being exposed to the weather. He saw it as a structure whose grandeur, if generally adopted, would replace the petit-bourgeois squalor of the small individual free-standing houses that were, by then, already filling the outer interstices of towns. Fourier s disciple Victor Consid rant, writing in 1838, mixed the metaphor of Versailles with that of the steamship and questioned whether it was easier to house 1,800 men right in the middle of the ocean, six hundred leagues from every shore, ... than to house in a unitary construction some 1,800 good peasants in the heart of Champagne or firmly on the soil of Beauce? This particular conflation of commune and ship was to be returned to by Le Corbusier, over a century later, in his self-contained commune or Unit d Habitation, realized with Fourierist overtones at Marseilles in 1952 (see p. 259). The enduring importance of Fourier lies in his radical criticism of industrialized production and social organization, for, despite numerous attempts to create phalansteries in \r",{"entities":[]}],["both Europe and America, his new industrial world was fated to remain a dream. Its closest realization was the Familist re [9], built by the industrialist Jean-Baptiste Andr Godin next to his factory at Guise in 1859-70. This complex comprised three residential blocks, a cr che, a kindergarten, a theatre, schools, public baths and a laundry. Each residential block enclosed a top-lit central courtyard which took the place of the elevated corridor streets of the phalanstery. In his book Solutions sociales (1870) Godin absorbed the more radical aspects of Fourierism by showing how the system could be adapted to co-operative family living without resorting to the eccentric theories of passional attraction . 9 Godin, Familist re, Guise, 1859-70. Aside from accommodating the labouring masses, London s 18th-century matrix of streets and squares was extended throughout the 19th century to meet the \r",{"entities":[]}],["residential requirements of a growing urban middle class. No longer satisfied, however, with the scale and texture of the occasional green square - delimited on all sides by streets and continuous terraces - the English Park Movement, founded by the gardener Humphry Repton, attempted to project the landscaped country estate into the city. Repton himself succeeded in demonstrating this, in collaboration with the architect John Nash, in their layout of Regent s Park in London (1812-27). After the victory over Napoleon in 1815, the proposed development enclosing the park was augmented, under royal patronage, by a continuous display facade, penetrating into the existing urban fabric and extending as a more or less uninterrupted ribbon of terraced accommodation from the aristocratic vistas of Regent s Park in the north to the palatial urbanity of St James s Park and Carlton House Terrace in the south. The squirearchical concept of the Neo-Classical country house set in an irregular landscape (an image derived from the Picturesque work of Capability Brown and Uvedale Price) was thus translated by Nash to the provision of terraced housing on the perimeter of an urban park. This model was first systematically adapted to general use by Sir Joseph Paxton, at Birkenhead Park, built outside Liverpool in 1844. Frederick Law Olmsted s Central Park in New York, inaugurated in 1857, was directly influenced by Paxton s example, even down to its separation of carriage traffic from pedestrians. The concept received its final elaboration in the Parisian parks created by Jean Charles Adolphe Alphand, where the circulation system totally dictated the manner in which the park was to be used. With Alphand, the park becomes a civilizing influence for the newly urbanized masses. The irregular lake that Nash created in St James s Park in 1828 out of the rectangular basin that the Mollet brothers had made in 1662 may be taken to symbolize the victory of the English Picturesque over the French Cartesian \r",{"entities":[]}],["conception of landscape dating from the 17th century. The French, who had hitherto regarded greenery as another order of architecture and had rendered their avenues as colonnades of trees, were to find the romantic appeal of Repton s irregular landscape irresistible. After the Revolution they remodelled their aristocratic parks into Picturesque sequences. Yet, for all the power of the Picturesque, the French impulse towards rationality remained, first in the percements (wholesale demolition in a straight line to create an entirely new street) of the Artists Plan for Paris, drawn up in 1793 by a committee of revolutionary artists under the leadership of the painter Jacques-Louis David; and then in Napoleon s arcaded Rue de Rivoli, built after 1806 to the designs of Percier and Fontaine. Where the Rue de Rivoli was to serve as the architectural model not only for Nash s Regent Street but also for the scenographic facade of Second Empire Paris, the Artists Plan demonstrated the instrumental strategy of the a// e, which was to become the prime tool for the rebuilding of Paris under Napoleon Ill. Napoleon Ill and Baron Georges Haussmann left their indelible mark not only on Paris [10] but also on a number of major cities in France and Central Europe which underwent Haussmann-like regularizations throughout the second half of the century. Their influence is even present in Daniel Burnham's 1909 plan for the gridded city of Chicago, of which Burnham wrote: The task which Haussmann accomplished for Paris corresponds with the work which must be done for Chicago in order to overcome the intolerable conditions which invariably arise from a rapid growth in population. \r",{"entities":[]}],["10 The regularization of Paris: streets cut by Haussmann are shown in black. In 1853 Haussmann, as the newly appointed Prefect for the Seine, saw these conditions in Paris as being polluted water supply, lack of an adequate sewer system, insufficient open space for both cemeteries and parks, large areas of squalid housing and last, but by no means least, congested circulation. Of these, the first two were undoubtedly the most critical for the everyday welfare of the population. As a consequence of drawing the bulk of its water from the Seine, which also served as the main collector sewer, Paris had suffered two serious outbreaks of cholera in the first half of the century. At the same time, the existing street system was no longer adequate for the administrative centre of an expanding capitalist economy. Under the brief autocracy of Napoleon IIl Haussmann s radical solution to the physical aspect of this complex problem was percement. His broad purpose was, as Francoise Choay has written, to give unity and transform into an operative whole the huge consumer market, the immense workshop of the Parisian agglomerate . Although the Artists Plan of 1793 and before \r",{"entities":[]}],["that Pierre Patte s plan of 1765 had clearly anticipated the axial and focal structure of Haussmann s Paris, there is, as Choay points out, a discernible shift in the actual location of the axes, from a city organized around traditional quartiers, as in the plan made under David, to a metropolis united by the fever of capitalism . Saint-Simonian economists and technocrats, mostly from the Ecole Polytechnique, influenced Napoleon Ill s views as to the economic means and the systematic ends to be adopted in the rebuilding of Paris, emphasizing the importance of rapid and efficient systems of communication. Haussmann converted Paris into a regional metropolis, cutting through its existing fabric with streets whose purpose was to link opposing cardinal points and districts, across the traditional barrier of the Seine. He gave top priority to the creation of more substantial north-south and east-west axes, to the building of the Boulevard de S bastopol and the easterly extension of the Rue de Rivoli. This basic cross, which served the main railway termini to the north and south, was encircled by a ring boulevard which in turn was tied into Haussmann s major traffic distributor, his Etoile complex built around Chalgrin s Arc de Triomphe. During Haussmann s tenure the city of Paris built some 137 kilometres (85 miles) of new boulevards, which were considerably wider, more thickly lined with trees and better lit than the 536 kilometres (333 miles) of old thoroughfare they replaced. With all this came standard residential plan types and regularized facades, and equally standard systems of street furniture - the pisso/rs, benches, shelters, kiosks, clocks, lamp-posts, signs, etc., designed by Haussmann s engineers Eug ne Belgrand and Alphand. This entire system was ventilated whenever possible by large areas of public open space, such as the Bois de Boulogne and the Bois de Vincennes. In addition, new cemeteries and many small parks, such as the Parc des Buttes Chaumont \r",{"entities":[]}],["and the Parc Monceau, were either created or upgraded within the extended boundaries of the city. Above all, there was an adequate sewer system and fresh water piped into the city from the Dhuis valley. In achieving such a comprehensive plan, Haussmann, the apolitical administrator par excellence, refused to accept the political logic of the r gime he served. He was finally broken by an ambivalent bourgeoisie, who throughout his tenure supported his profitable improvements while at the same time defending their proprietorial rights against his intervention. Prior to the collapse of the Second Empire, the principle of regularization was already being practised outside Paris, particularly in Vienna, where the replacement of demolished fortifications by a display boulevard was taken to its logical extreme in the ostentatious Ringstrasse, built around the old centre between 1858 and 1914. The free-standing monuments of this open city expansion, structured around a cranked thoroughfare of enormous width, provoked the critical reaction of the architect Camillo Sitte, who in his influential Der Stadtebau nach seinen kdnsterlerischen Grundsatzen (City Planning According to Artistic Principles) of 1889 argued for the enclosure of the major Ringstrasse monuments by buildings and arcades. Sitte s remedial concern cannot be better characterized than in his critical comparison of the traffic-ridden open city of the late 19th century with the tranquillity of the medieval or Renaissance urban core: During the Middle Ages and Renaissance public squares were often used for practical purposes ... they formed an entirety with the buildings which enclosed them. Today they serve at best as places for parking vehicles, and they have no relation to the buildings which dominate them .... In brief, activity is lacking precisely in those places where, in ancient times, it was most intense, near public structures.2 \r",{"entities":[]}],["Meanwhile, in Barcelona, the regional implications of urban regularization were being developed by the Spanish engineer Ildefonso Cerda, the inventor of the term urbanizacion. |n 1859 Cerda projected the expansion of Barcelona as a gridded city [11], some twenty-two blocks deep, bordered by the sea and intersected by two diagonal avenues. Driven by industry and overseas trade, Barcelona filled out this American-scale grid plan by the end of the century. In his Teoria general de la urbanizacion ( General Theory of Urbanization ) of 1867 Cerda gave priority to a system of circulation and, in particular, to steam traction. For him transit was, in more ways than one, the point of departure for all scientifically based urban structures. L on Jaussely s plan for Barcelona of 1902, derived from Cerda s, incorporated this emphasis on movement into the form of a protolinear city where the separate zones of accommodation and transportation are organized into bands. His design anticipated in certain respects the Russian linear city proposals of the 1920s. \r",{"entities":[]}],["11 Cerda, project for the expansion of Barcelona, 1858. The old city appears in black. By 1891 intensive exploitation of the city centre was possible, due to two developments essential to the erection of high-rise buildings: the invention in 1853 of the passenger lift, and the perfection in 1890 of the steel frame. With the introduction of the underground railway (1863), the electric tram (1884) and commuter rail transit (1890), the garden suburb emerged as the natural unit for future urban expansion. The complementary relationship of these two American forms of urban development - the high-rise downtown and the low-rise garden suburb - was demonstrated in the building boom that followed the great Chicago fire of 1871. The process of suburbanization had already started around Chicago with the layout in 1869 of the suburb of Riverside, to the Picturesque designs of Olmsted [12]. Based in part on the mid-19th-century garden cemetery and \r",{"entities":[]}],["in part on the early East Coast suburb, it was linked to downtown Chicago by both a railway and a bridle path. ENER, 1 GENFRAL by 4 12 Olmsted, plan of Riverside, Chicago, 1869. With the entry into Chicago in 1882 of the steam- powered cable car, the way became open to further expansion. The immediate beneficiary was Chicago s South Side. Yet suburban growth did not really prosper until the 1890s, when, with the introduction of the electric streetcar, suburban transit greatly extended its range, speed and frequency. This led at the turn of the century to the opening up of Chicago s Oak Park suburb, which was to be the proving ground for the early houses of Frank Lloyd Wright. Between 1893 and 1897 an extensive elevated railway was superimposed on the city, encircling its downtown area. All these forms of transit were essential to Chicago s growth. Most important of all for the city s prosperity was the railway, for it brought the first piece of modern agricultural \r",{"entities":[]}],["equipment to the prairie - the essential McCormick mechanical reaper invented in 1831 - and collected in return both grain and cattle from the great plains, trans- shipping them to the lakeside silos and stockyards which had begun to be built on Chicago s South Side in 1865. It was the railway that redistributed this abundance from the 1880s on, in Gustavus Swift s refrigerated packing cars, and the corresponding growth in trade greatly augmented the extensive passenger traffic centring on Chicago. Thus the last decade of the century saw radical changes in both the methods of town building and the means of urban access - changes which, in conjunction with the grid plan, were soon to transform the traditional city into an ever-expanding metropolitan region where dispersed homestead and concentrated core are linked by continual commuting. The puritanical entrepreneur George Pullman, who helped to rebuild Chicago after the fire, had been one of the first to appreciate the expanding market in long-distance passenger travel, bringing out his first Pullman sleeping car in 1865. After the achievement of the transcontinental rail link in 1869, Pullman s Palace Car Company prospered, and in the early 1880s he established his ideal industrial town of Pullman [13], south of Chicago, a settlement that combined workers residences with a full range of communal facilities, including a theatre and a library as well as schools, parks and playgrounds, all in close proximity to the Pullman factory. This well-ordered complex went far beyond the facilities provided by Godin at Guise some twenty years earlier. It also far exceeds, in its comprehensiveness and clarity, the Picturesque model towns founded in England by the confectioner George Cadbury at Bournville, Birmingham, in 1879 and by the soap manufacturer W.H. Lever at Port Sunlight, near Liverpool, in 1888.

Rail transit on a much smaller scale, by tram or by train, was to be the main determinant of the two alternative models of the European garden city. One was the axial structure of the Spanish linear garden city, first described by its inventor Arturo Soria y Mata in the early 1880s, and the other was the English concentric garden city, shown as circumnavigated by rail in Ebenezer Howard s Tomorrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform of 1898.

Apart from being an antithesis to the radially planned city, the linear city was a means for building along a triangulated network of pre-existing routes connecting a set of traditional regional centres. While the diagrammatic projection of Howard s city as a satellite town in open country was equally regional, the form of the city itself was less dynamic. On the model of Ruskin s ill-fated St George s Guild of 1871, Howard conceived of his city as an economically self-sufficient mutual aid community, producing little beyond its own needs. The difference between these city models lay finally in the fundamentally different attitudes they adopted to rail transit. Whereas Howard's Rurisville was intended to eliminate the journey to work - the railway being reserved for objects rather than men - the ciudad lineal was expressly designed to facilitate communication. \r",{"entities":[]}],["It was, however, the English garden city in its modified form that came to be widely adopted, rather than the linear model sponsored by Soria y Mata s Compafiia Madrilefia de Urbanizaci n, which only built some 22 kilometres (14 miles) of the 55-kilometre (34-mile) long necklace originally projected for the encirclement of Madrid. The failure of this sole example condemned the linear city to a theoretical rather than practical future, and at this level it persisted from the Russian linear cities of the late 1920s to Le Corbusier s ASCORAL planning thesis, first published as Les Trois Etablissements humains in 1945. The radical reinterpretation of Howard s original diagrams, reflected in the layout of the first garden city, Letchworth in Hertfordshire (started in 1903), inaugurated the neo-Sittesque phase in the English garden city movement. That the engineer-planner Raymond Unwin was impressed by Sitte is evident from his highly influential book Town Planning in Practice, published in 1909. The preoccupation of Unwin and his colleague Barry Parker with imaginary irregular towns - of a kind exemplified for them by such medieval German towns as Nuremberg and Rothenburg-ob-der-Tauber - clearly lies behind their picturesque layout for Hampstead Garden Suburb, designed in 1907. Yet for all his contempt for bye-law architecture, Unwin remained as conditioned as any other planner by the constraints imposed by modern standards of hygiene and circulation. Thus, despite the renowned empirical success of these pioneering garden cities, the debilitating environment produced subsequently by the English school of town planning stems, at least in part, from Unwin s failure to resolve this implacable dichotomy, that is to reconcile medieval nostalgia with bureaucratic control. The train- accident block layouts of the 20th century are among the enduring formal legacies of this failure. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Chapter 3 Technical Transformations: Structural Engineering 1775-1939 With iron, an artificial building material appeared for the first time in the history of architecture.

The rail was the first unit of construction, the forerunner of the girder. lron was avoided for dwelling-houses, and made use of for arcades, exhibition halls, railway stations, buildings which served transitory purposes.

The Coalbrookdale achievement aroused considerable interest, and in 1786 the Anglo- American revolutionary, Tom Paine, designed a monument to the American Revolution in the form of a cast-iron bridge spanning the Schuylkill River. Paine had the parts for this bridge made in England, where they were exhibited in 1791, just a year before he was charged with treason and forced into exile in France. In 1796 a 71-metre (236-foot) cast-iron bridge was built across the Wear at Sunderland to the designs of Thomas Wilson, who adopted Paine s voussoir method of assembly. About the same time Thomas Telford made his d but as a bridge builder with his 39.5-metre (130-foot) Buildwas Bridge erected over the Severn, a design which employed only 176 tonnes (173 tons) of iron, as opposed to the 384 tonnes (378 tons) used at Coalbrookdale. Over the next thirty years Telford went on to prove his unparalleled stature as a road and bridge builder and as the last great canal engineer of the waning waterway era. His pioneer career was brought to a close with his brick- encased, iron-framed warehouses at St Katharine Dock in London, designed with the architect Philip Hardwick and erected in 1829. They were based on the system of fireproof multi-storey mill construction developed in the Midlands during the last decade of the 18th century. The main structural antecedents for St Katharine s were William Strutt s six-storey calico mill, built at Derby in 1792, and Charles Bage s flax-spinning mill erected at Shrewsbury in 1796. While both of these structures employed cast-iron \r",{"entities":[]}],["columns, the pressing need to perfect a fireproof system for mill buildings led, in the space of four years, to the replacement of the timber beams used at Derby by T- section iron beams. In each instance the beams carried shallow brick vaults, the whole assembly being stiffened by an outer shell and by wrought-iron tie rods restraining the structure in a lateral direction. This use of vaulting seems to have derived directly from the 18th-century development of the Roussillon or Catalonian vault in France, which was first adopted there as a means of achieving a fireproof structure in Chateau Bizy, built at Vernon by Pierre Contant d Ivry in 1741. Aside from its use in 13th-century cathedrals, wrought- iron masonry reinforcement in France had its origins in Paris, in Perrault s east facade of the Louvre (1667) and Soufflot s portico of Ste-Genevi ve (1772). Both works anticipate the development of reinforced concrete. In 1776 Soufflot proposed a wrought-iron trussed roof for part of the Louvre that prepared the way for the pioneering work of Victor Louis, that is for Louis s wrought-iron roof for the Th atre Francais of 1786 and his theatre in the Palais-Royal of 1790. This last combined an iron roof with a hollow-pot, fireproof floor structure, a system that once again was derived from the Roussillon vault. That fire was a growing urban hazard can be seen from the Halle au Bl , Paris, whose burnt-out roof was replaced in 1808 by an iron-ribbed cupola, designed by the architect Francois-Joseph B langer and the engineer Francois Brunet - incidentally, one of the first instances of a clear division of labour between architect and constructor. In the meantime the earliest French application of iron to bridge construction had occurred with the building of the elegant Pont des Arts over the Seine, erected to the designs of Louis-Alexandre de Cessart in 1803. With the foundation of the Ecole Polytechnique in 1795, the French strove towards establishing a technocracy appropriate to the achievement of the Napoleonic Empire. \r",{"entities":[]}],["While this emphasis on applied technique only served to reinforce the growing specialization of architecture and engineering (a division already institutionalized through Perronet s Ecole des Ponts et Chauss es), architects such as Jean-Baptiste Rondelet, who had supervised the completion of Ste-Genevi ve after Soufflot s death, began to record the pioneering work of Soufflot, Louis, Brunet, de Cessart and others. And while Rondelet documented the means in his Trait de I art de b&atir (1802), Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand, lecturer in architecture at the Ecole Polytechnique, catalogued the ends in his Pr cis des lecons donn es a l Ecole Polytechnique (1802-09). Durand s book disseminated a system whereby Classical forms, conceived as modular elements, could be arranged at will for the accommodation of unprecedented building programmes, i.e. the market halls, libraries and barracks of the Napoleonic Empire. First Rondelet and then Durand codified a technique and a design method whereby a rationalized Classicism could be brought to accommodate not only new social demands but also new techniques. This comprehensive programme influenced Schinkel who, at the beginning of his architectural career in 1816, began to incorporate elaborate iron elements into his Neo-Classical embellishments for the city of Berlin. Around this time the technique of iron suspension construction underwent an independent evolution, beginning with the American James Finley s invention of the stiffened, flat-deck suspension bridge in 1801, an achievement that was disseminated by Thomas Pope s Treatise on Bridge Architecture published in 1811. The climax of Finley s brief but critical career was his 74.5-metre (244-foot) span iron-chain suspension bridge across the Merrimack River at Newburyport, Massachusetts, in 1810. Finley s work, as documented by Pope, had an immediate influence on the application of chain suspension technique in Britain, where Samuel Brown and Telford became involved \r",{"entities":[]}],["in its development. Brown s wrought-iron flat bar links were patented in 1817 and applied with lasting success to his 115-metre (378-foot) span Union Bridge, built over the Tweed in 1820. Telford and Brown collaborated briefly on a chain bridge for Runcorn, and this collaboration no doubt informed Telford s design for his 177-metre (580-foot) span Menai Straits bridge, which after eight years of arduous work was finally opened in 1825. British wrought-iron suspension construction culminated in Isambard Kingdom Brunel s 214-metre (702-foot) span Clifton Bridge, Bristol, designed in 1829 but not completed until 1864, five years after Brunel s death. Since the manufacture of wrought-iron links capable of withstanding tension was always an expensive and hazardous affair, the idea of using cables of drawn wire instead of chains seems to have suggested itself, first in 1816 to White and Hazard, in their footbridge over the Schuylkill Falls in Pennsylvania, and then to the S guin brothers, who constructed a wire bridge over the Rh ne at Tain-Tournon in 1825. The S guins work formed the subject for an exhaustive analytical study carried out for the Ecole des Ponts et Chauss es by Louis-Joseph Vicat, and the publication of this work in 1831 inaugurated the golden age of the suspension bridge in France, where some hundred such structures were built in the next decade. Vicat recommended that all future suspension members should be fabricated out of wire rather than bar iron, and to this end he invented a method for spinning wire cable in place. A similar device was eventually used by the American engineer John Augustus Roebling, whose own patent for the manufacture of wire cable was taken out in 1842, just two years before he used this material for the suspension of an aqueduct over the Allegheny River at Pittsburgh. Roebling s cables were spirally wrapped like those of Vicat, and he used this basic suspension material for the rest of his heroic career, from his 243.5-metre (800-foot) span Niagara Falls railway viaduct of 1855 to his 487-metre (1600-foot) span \r",{"entities":[]}],["Brooklyn Bridge, New York [15], completed, after his death, by his son Washington Roebling in 1883.

With the virtual completion of the British railway infrastructure by 1860, British structural engineering entered a fallow period that lasted for the rest of the century. Few works of outstanding brilliance and ingenuity remained to be built after the middle of the century: these included the Stephenson and Fairbairn Britannia Tubular Bridge of 1852 over the Menai Straits [16] and Brunel's Saltash Viaduct of 1859. Both made use of plated wrought iron, that is to say of riveted rolled sheet, a technique which had been greatly advanced by the studies of Eton Hodgkinson and the experimental work of William Fairbairn. Robert Stephenson had already utilized the findings of Hodgkinson and Fairbairn in his development of the plate girder in 1846, a system that was to be fully demonstrated in the Britannia Bridge. This structure comprised two independent, single-track, iron-plated box tunnels which \r",{"entities":[]}],["bridged the straits in two spans of 70 metres (230 feet) each and one main span of 140 metres (460 feet). Stephenson's stone towers had been intended for the anchorage of supplementary suspension members, but the plated tubes acting alone proved more than adequate for the span. Comparable spans were achieved in the Saltash Viaduct, where a single track is carried over the Tamar River on two bowstring trusses each spanning 138.5 metres (455 feet). Rolled, riveted plates were again used to form the hollow elliptical chords, measuring 4.9 by 3.7 metres (16 by 12 feet) across their respective axes. These chords interacted with underslung iron chain catenaries to carry vertical standards from which the road-bed was finally suspended. In its imaginative stature Brunel s last work equalled the great viaducts which Gustave Eiffel was to build in the Massif Central over the next thirty years, and its use of hollow plated sections anticipated the gigantic tubular steel framing to be employed by John Fowler and Benjamin Baker in the 213-metre (700-foot) cantilevers of their Forth Bridge, completed in 1890. 16 Stephenson and Fairbairn, Britannia Tubular Bridge over the Menai Straits, 1852. The railway development that had begun with George Stephenson s trial run from Stockton to Darlington in 1825 \r",{"entities":[]}],["expanded over the second quarter of the century ata formidable rate. In England there were over 3,200 kilometres (2,000 miles) of track after less than twenty years, while in North America 4,600 kilometres (3,000 miles) had been laid by 1842. In the interim, the materials of the railway, cast and wrought iron, gradually became integrated into the general building vocabulary, where they constituted the only available fireproof elements for the multi-storey warehouse space required by industrial production. From the time of Boulton and Watt s 33-centimetre (13- inch) cast-iron beam, used in their Salford Mill, Manchester, of 1801, a continual effort was made to improve the spanning capacity of both cast- and wrought-iron beams and rails. The typical section of the railway evolved during the first decades of the century, and from this section the standard structural I-beam eventually emerged. Jessop s cast-iron rail of 1789 gave way to Birkenshaw s wrought-iron T-rail of 1820, and this led in turn to the first American rail, rolled in Wales in 1831, with a section in the form of an | broader at the base than at the top. This form became gradually adopted for the permanent way, but did not come into general structural use until after 1854, when heavier versions with greater spanning capacity were successfully rolled. Meanwhile, engineers tried various ways to increase the spanning capacity of the material by building up deep members from the standard wrought-iron angles and plates that were then being used in ship building. Fairbairn reputedly made and tested such composite I-beams as early as 1839. These ingenious attempts to produce wide-span elements through reinforcing or assembling iron components were more or less eclipsed at mid-century by the successful rolling of a wrought-iron beam 17.8 centimetres (7 inches) deep. Fairbairn s book On the Application of Cast and Wrought Iron to Building Purposes (1854) presented an improved system of mill construction, \r",{"entities":[]}],["consisting of rolled iron beams 40.6 centimetres (16 inches) deep that supported shallow vaults made of sheet iron, the whole topped out with concrete. Since the wrought-iron tie rods, still used to stabilize the structure, were cast into the concrete floor, this proposal brought Fairbairn fortuitously close to the principles of reinforced concrete. In a similar vein, a remarkable four-storey cast- and wrought-iron framed building was erected in the Naval Dockyard at Sheerness. This boat store, clad in corrugated iron, was designed by Colonel Greene and erected in 1860, some twelve years before the pioneering all-iron, skeleton- framed Menier chocolate factory was built by Jules Saulnier at Noisiel-sur-Marne. In its systematic use of iron I-sections throughout (cast in the case of the columns and wrought in the case of the beams) the Sheerness boat store anticipated both the standard section and the assembly method of modern steel-frame construction. By mid-century, cast-iron columns and wrought-iron rails, used in conjunction with modular glazing, had become the standard technique for the rapid prefabrication and erection of urban distribution centres - market halls, exchanges and arcades. This last type was developed in Paris. Fontaine s Galerie d'Orl ans, built in the Palais-Royal in 1829, was the earliest arcade to have a glass barrel vault. The prefabricated nature of these cast-iron systems guaranteed not only a certain speed of assembly but also the possibility of transporting building kits over large distances: from mid- century onwards the industrialized countries began to export prefabricated cast-iron structures all over the world. The sudden expansion in urban growth and trade on the eastern American seaboard in the 1840s encouraged men such as James Bogardus and Daniel Badger to open casting shops in New York for the manufacture of multistorey architectural fronts in iron. Up to the late 1850s, however, their packaged structures relied on the use of large timber beams to span the internal space, iron being reserved for \r",{"entities":[]}],["the internal columns and the facades. One of the finest works of Badger s extensive career is his Haughwout Building, New York, of 1859, built to the designs of the architect John P. Gaynor. This was the first building to be served by a passenger elevator, just five years after Elisha Graves Otis had made his historic demonstration of the device in 1854. The fully glazed structure, whose environmental attributes were exhaustively discussed by J.C. Loudon in his Remarks on Hot Houses (1817), had little chance of having a more general application, at least in England, until the repeal of the excise duty on glass in 1845. Richard Turner and Decimus Burton s Palm House at Kew Gardens, built in 1845-48, was one of the first structures to take advantage of the sudden availability of sheet glass. The first large permanent enclosures to be significantly glazed thereafter were the railway termini that were built during the second half of the 19th century, a development that began with Turner and Joseph Locke s Lime Street Station, Liverpool, of 1849-50. The railway terminus presented a peculiar challenge to the received canons of architecture, since there was no type available to express and articulate adequately the junction between the head building and the train shed. This problem, which saw its earliest architectural resolution in Duquesney s Gare de | Est, Paris, of 1852, was of some concern since these termini were effectively the new gateways into the capital city. The engineer L once Reynaud, designer of the first Gare du Nord in Paris (1847), was aware of this issue of representation when he wrote in his Trait d architecture (1850): Art does not have the rapid progress and sudden developments of industry, with the result that the majority of buildings today for the service of railroads leave more or less to be desired, be it in relation to form or arrangement. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Some stations appear to be appropriately arranged but having the character of industrial or temporary construction rather than that of a building for public use.? Nothing could be more exemplary of this predicament than St Pancras Station in London, where the vast shed, 74 metres (243 feet) in span, built in 1863-65 to the designs of William Henry Barlow and Rowland Mason Ordish, was totally divorced from the Gothic Revival hotel-cum-head building completed in 1874 to the designs of George Gilbert Scott. And what was true for St Pancras also applied to Brunel's designs for Paddington in London (1852), where once again, despite the conscientious efforts of the architect Matthew Digby Wyatt, the rather rudimentary station building was left inadequately related to the vaulted profiles of the shed. The free-standing exhibition structure presented none of the problems of the terminus, for where the issues of cultural context could scarcely arise the engineer reigned supreme. This was never more so than in the case of the Crystal Palace in London, built for the Great Exhibition of 1851, where the gardener Joseph Paxton was given a free hand to design in accordance with a method for the fabrication of glasshouses that he had developed through a rigorous application of Loudon s hothouse principles. Paxton had developed his method in a series of glasshouses built for the Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth. When commissioned at the eleventh hour to design the Crystal Palace, Paxton was able to produce, in just eight days, an enormous orthogonal three-tiered glasshouse, whose components were virtually identical to those of the giant lily house that he had built at Chatsworth in the previous year. Except for three entrance porches, symmetrically disposed, its glazed perimeter was uninterrupted. During its development, however, a revised scheme had to be prepared in order to retain a group of mature trees. Since \r",{"entities":[]}],["the remaining public opposition to the Great Exhibition of 1851 turned on this question of tree preservation, Paxton was quick to realize that these troublesome items could easily be accommodated by a central transept with a high curved roof, and thus the double symmetry of the final form emerged. The Crystal Palace was not so much a particular form as it was a building process made manifest as a total system, from its initial conception, fabrication and trans-shipment, to its final erection and dismantling. Like the railway buildings, to which it was related, it was a highly flexible kit of parts [17]. Its overall form was structured around a basic 2.44- metre (8-foot) cladding module, assembled into a hierarchy of structural spans varying from 7.31 to 21.95 metres (24 to 72 feet). Its realization, which took barely four months, was a simple matter of mass production and systematic assembly. As Konrad Wachsmann has remarked in his book Wendepunkt im Bauen (The Turning Point of Building) of 1961, Its production requirements included studies which indicated that for easy handling no part should weigh more than one ton and that the greatest economies could be obtained by using glass panels of the largest possible size. \r",{"entities":[]}],["17 Paxton, Crystal Palace, London, 1851. Component parts. While the Crystal Palace engendered through its open lattice work spectacular parallel and oblique perspectives whose lines diminished into a diaphanous haze of light, its total envelope, comprising nearly 93,000 square metres (a million square feet) of glass, presented a climatic problem of unprecedented scale. The desirable environmental conditions, however, remained the same as they had been in Loudon s curvilinear hothouses - to maintain comfortable air movement and to moderate the heat of the sun. While the elevation of the building off the ground and the provision of a slatted floor, together with adjustable louvres in the walls, provided satisfactory ventilation, the accumulation of solar heat constituted a problem to which the railway engineer Charles Fox, who was responsible for the detailing of the structure, could find no adequate solution. The eventual ad hoc use of canvas awnings to shade the roof could hardly be regarded as an integral part \r",{"entities":[]}],["of the system, and many of the international exhibitors chose to shield themselves from the greenhouse effect by canopies of festooned draperies, which were no doubt hung as much against the unacceptable objectivity of the structure as they were against the sun. The British abandonment of the international exhibition field, after the triumph of 1851 and a further exhibition in 1862, was at once exploited by the French, who mounted five major international exhibitions between 1855 and 1900. The degree to which these displays were regarded as national platforms from which to challenge the British command over industrial production and trade may be judged from the emphasis placed each time on the structure and content of the Galerie des Machines . The young Gustave Eiffel worked with the engineer Jean-Baptiste Krantz on the most significant exhibition building to be erected after 1851, that for the Paris World Exhibition of 1867. This collaboration revealed not only Eiffel s expressive sensibility but also his capacity as an engineer, since in detailing the Galerie des Machines, with its 35-metre (114- foot) span, he was able to verify the validity of Thomas Young s modulus of elasticity of 1807, a hitherto solely theoretical formula for determining the elastic behaviour of material under stress. The whole oval complex, of which the Galerie des Machines was merely the outer ring, was itself a testament to the conceptual genius of Pierre Guillaume Fr d ric Le Play, who had suggested that the building be arranged as concentric galleries exhibiting machinery, clothing, furniture, liberal arts, fine arts and the history of labour. After 1867 the sheer size and diversity of the objects produced, and the independence demanded by international competition, seem to have demanded multiple exhibition structures. By the time of the International Exhibition of 1889 no pretence was made of housing the exhibits in one self-contained building. This penultimate exhibition of the \r",{"entities":[]}],["century was dominated by two of the most remarkable structures that French engineering was ever to achieve - Victor Contamin s vast Galerie des Machines [18], 107 metres (350 feet) in span, designed with the architect Charles Louis Ferdinand Dutert, and Eiffel s tower, 300 metres (984 feet) high, designed in collaboration with the engineers Nouguier and Koechlin and the architect Stephen Sauvestre. Contamin s structure, based on statical methods perfected by Eiffel in his hinged viaducts of the 1880s, was one of the first to use the three-hinged arch form in the achievement of a large span. Contamin s shed not only exhibited machines: it was itself an exhibiting machine , in which mobile viewing platforms, running on elevated tracks, passed over the exhibition space on either side of the central axis, affording the visitor a fast and comprehensive view of the entire show. at tM Fg ip i, en) yi 18 Dutert and Contamin, Galerie des Machines at the Paris Exhibition, 1889, showing the mobile viewing platform. \r",{"entities":[]}],["In the last half of the 19th century the Massif Central had been found to be sufficiently rich in minerals to justify the considerable expense of equipping it with a railway network. The railway viaducts that Eiffel designed there between 1869 and 1884 exemplify a method and an aesthetic that found their ultimate celebration in the design of the Eiffel Tower. The boat-shaped base and the parabolic vertical section of the tubular iron pylon that Eiffel evolved for these viaducts is formally indicative of his constant attempt to resolve the dynamic interaction of water and wind. The need to make wider river crossings led Eiffel and his associates to devise an ingenious system of viaduct support. The spur to such a solution came in 1875, with the commission to construct a railway viaduct over the river Douro in Portugal. The availability of cheap steel after 1870 afforded a material in which a wide-span solution might be readily achieved. A decision was therefore made to cross the ravine in five spans, two short spans supported on pylons on either side and a central longer span of 160 metres (524 feet) carried on a two-pinned arch. The procedure of erection, to be repeated a few years later at Garabit, was to construct the flanking spans with their supporting pylons and then to erect the central section from these continuous structures on either side. Truss extensions were cantilevered out at track level, and the hinged arch was simultaneously constructed, in two halves, from the water below. The initial hinged sections were floated and jacked into position and then maintained at a correct incline during their final assembly by cables suspended from the caps of the adjacent pylons. The outstanding success of the Douro Viaduct, completed in 1878, immediately brought Eiffel a commission to build the Garabit Viaduct over the River Truy re in the Massif Central. Just as the Douro Viaduct provided the necessary experience to build Garabit, so the achievement of Garabit was essential to the design and conception of the Eiffel \r",{"entities":[]}],["Tower. Like the Crystal Palace, the tower was designed and erected under considerable pressure, but at a slower rate. First exhibited as a design in the spring of 1885, it was in the ground by the summer of 1887 and well over 200 metres (654 feet) high by the winter of 1888. As in Contamin s Galerie des Machines, the structure had to be provided with an access system for the rapid movement of visitors. Speed was essential, since there was no way of gaining access to the tower except via lifts that ran on inclined tracks within its hyperbolic legs and rose vertically from first platform to pinnacle. The guide rails for these lifts were exploited during erection as tracks for climbing cranes, an economy in working method reminiscent of the mounting technique used in the case of the hinged viaducts. As much a by-product of the railway as the Crystal Palace, the tower was, in effect, a 300-metre (974-foot) high viaduct pylon, whose type-form had originally been evolved out of the interaction of wind, gravity, water and material resistance. It was a hitherto unimaginable structure that could not be experienced except by traversing the aerial matrix of the space itself. Given the futuristic affinity of the tower to aviation - celebrated by the aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont, when he circled the structure with his dirigible in 1901 - it is hardly surprising that thirty years after its erection it should have been appropriated and reinterpreted as the prime symbol of a new social and technical order, in Vladimir Tatlin s monument to the Third International, projected in 1919-20. As iron technology developed through the exploitation of the earth s mineral wealth, so concrete technology, or at least the development of hydraulic cement, seems to have arisen out of traffic on sea. In 1774, John Smeaton established the base of his Eddystone Lighthouse using a concrete compound of quicklime, clay, sand and crushed iron slag, and similar concrete mixes were used in England in bridge, \r",{"entities":[]}],["canal and harbour works throughout the last quarter of the 18th century. Despite Joseph Aspdin s pioneering development of Portland cement for use as imitation stone in 1824, and various other English proposals for metal- reinforced concrete construction, such as that made by the ever-inventive Loudon in 1792, the initial English lead in the pioneering of concrete gradually passed to France. In France the economic restrictions that followed the Revolution of 1789, the synthesis of hydraulic cement by Vicat around 1800 and the tradition of building in pis (rammed earth) combined to create the optimum circumstances for the invention of reinforced concrete. The first consequential use of the new material was made by Francois Coignet, who was already familiar with the pis building method of the Lyons district. In 1861 he developed a technique for strengthening concrete with metal mesh, and on the basis of this established the first limited company to specialize in ferroconcrete construction. Coignet worked in Paris under Haussmann s direction, building sewers and other public structures in ferroconcrete - including, in 1867, a remarkable series of six-storey apartment blocks. Despite these commissions, Coignet failed to uphold his patent and by the end of the Second Empire his company was dissolved. Another French pioneer of concrete was the gardener Joseph Monier, who, following his successful production of concrete flower pots in 1850, took out, after 1867, a series of patents for metal-reinforced applications, the partial rights of which he ill-advisedly sold in 1880 to the engineers Schuster and Wayss. Further rights were obtained from Monier in 1884 by the firm of Freytag, and soon afterwards the large German civil engineering concern of Wayss and Freytag came into being. Their monopoly over the Monier system was consolidated by Gustav Adolf Wayss s standard work on the Monier method (Monierbau), published in 1887. The publication of important theoretical studies on \r",{"entities":[]}],["differential stress in reinforced concrete by the German theorists Neumann and Koenen served to consolidate the German lead in this type of construction. The period of most intense development in reinforced concrete occurred between 1870 and 1900, with pioneering work being carried on simultaneously in Germany, America, England and France. In building his reinforced-concrete Hudson River home in 1873, the American William E. Ward became the first constructor to take full advantage of the tensile strength of steel by situating bars below the neutral axis of the beam. The inherent structural advantage of this was almost immediately confirmed by the concrete beam experiments conducted in England by Thaddeus Hyatt and Thomas Rickets, whose joint results were published in 1877. Despite these international developments, the systematic exploitation of modern reinforced-concrete technique was to wait upon the inventive genius of Francois Hennebique. Hennebique, a self-educated French builder, first used concrete in 1879. He then conducted an extensive programme of private research before patenting his own uniquely comprehensive system in 1892. Before Hennebique the great problem in ferroconcrete had been the provision of a monolithic joint. The compound concrete and steel systems that had been patented by Fairbairn in 1845 were far from being monolithic, and the same restrictions applied to the work of Hyatt and Rickets. Hennebique overcame this difficulty through the use of bars of cylindrical section which could be bent round and hooked together. Integral to his system alone was the cranking up of reinforcement bars and the binding of joints with stirrup hoops in order to resist local stress. With the perfection of the monolithic joint [19], the monolithic frame could be realized, leading promptly to the first large-scale application of such a system to three spinning mills that Hennebique built in the region of Tourcoing and Lille in 1896. The results were at once acclaimed as a success, and Hennebique s \r",{"entities":[]}],["firm immediately prospered. His partner, Louis Gustave Mouchel, took the system to England in 1897, building the first concrete road bridge there in 1901 and exhibiting a spectacular free-standing, helical, reinforced-concrete stair at the Franco-British exhibition of 1908. 19 Hennebique, monolithic reinforced-concrete joint, patented in 1892. The wide success of the Hennebique firm dates from around 1898, with the regular publication of its house magazine Le B ton arm ( Reinforced Concrete ) and the extensive use of its system in the eclectic structures of the Paris Exhibition of 1900. Despite the false facades of the Chateau d Eau, constructed out of ferroconcrete by Francois Coignet s son, the Paris Exhibition of 1900 gave an enormous boost to concrete construction, and by 1902, a decade after its foundation, the Hennebique firm had grown into a large international concern. By then innumerable works were being constructed in concrete throughout Europe, with Hennebique acting as the main contractor. In 1904 he built his own reinforced-concrete villa at Bourg-la- Reine, complete with roof garden and minaret. Its solid walls were formed out of ferroconcrete poured in place between permanent pre-cast concrete shuttering, and its almost \r",{"entities":[]}],["totally glazed facade was dramatically cantilevered out from the main plane of the building. By the turn of the century, Hennebique s monopoly over his system began to wane, although his patents still had a number of years to run. In 1902 his chief assistant, Paul Christophe, popularized the system by publishing Le B ton arm et ses applications. Four years later Armand-Gabriel Consid r , who had already carried out concrete research for the department of Ponts et Chauss es, headed the national committee that established the French code for reinforced-concrete practice. In 1890 the engineer Paul Cottancin patented his own system of ciment arm , which depended on the combined reinforcement of concrete and brick, the bricks being bonded into the concrete with wire reinforcement. In this hybrid system the main function of the ferroconcrete element was to maintain structural continuity in areas of high tension. In areas of compression brick naturally predominated. The system had a strong appeal for the rationalist architect Anatole de Baudot who, as a pupil of the great French structural theorist Eug ne Viollet-le-Duc, was preoccupied with revealed structure as the only valid basis for expression in architecture. On these grounds, de Baudot consigned monolithic b ton arm to the field of engineering, while reserving for the architect the statically more explicit and articulate technique of ciment arm , a technology whose expressive qualities were most fully demonstrated in his church of St-Jean-de-Montmartre in Paris (begun in 1894). The intricate vaulting there was closely related to a whole sequence of grande salle projects which de Baudot designed between 1910 and 1914. After Viollet-le-Duc, he was concerned with the problem of the great space as the necessary proving ground for any architectural culture. In this context his grande salle series, which commenced with a vast project for the 1900 Exhibition, may be seen as anticipating the reticulated flat slabs and prefabricated \r",{"entities":[]}],["folded shells that were to be achieved half a century later by the Italian engineer Pier Luigi Nervi, most typically in the Turin Exhibition Hall of 1948 and the Gatti Wool Factory, built outside Rome in 1953. In opposition to de Baudot s principle of reticulated form, the challenge of the great space was answered by Max Berg through the use of reinforced-concrete elements of enormous size, in his Jahrhunderthalle [20] built by Konwiarz and Trauer for the Breslau Exhibition of 1913. Inside this vast, centralized hall, 65 metres (213 feet) in diameter, the concrete ribs of the cupola sprang from a perimeter ring beam which was in its turn supported by massive pendentive arches. This awkward Herculean structure was concealed on the outside by concentric tiers of glazing, the organic plan and dynamic structure being suppressed by the superimposition of Neo-Classical elements. 20 Berg, Jahrhunderthalle, Breslau (Wroctaw), 1913. Up to 1895, ferroconcrete work in North America was inhibited by its dependence on the importation of cement from Europe. Soon after, however, the epoch of the grain silo and the flatted factory commenced, first in Canada, with the reinforced-concrete silo structures of Max Toltz, and then, from 1900 onwards, in the United States, in the work of Ernest L. Ransome, who was the inventor of twisted \r",{"entities":[]}],["reinforcement. With the building in 1902 of his 91-metre (300-foot) machine shop at Greensburg, Pennsylvania, Ransome became the pioneer of the monolithic concrete frame in the United States. Here he applied for the first time the principle of spiral column reinforcement in accordance with the theories of Consid r . It says something for the technical precociousness of Frank Lloyd Wright that he began to design reinforced-concrete structures at around the same time: his unrealized Village Bank project of 1901, and the E-Z Polish factory and Unity Temple, completed in Chicago in 1905 and 1906 respectively. Meanwhile, in Paris, Perret Freres had begun to design and build their first all-concrete structures, beginning with Auguste Perret s seminal Rue Franklin apartment block of 1903 and his Th atre des Champs-Elys es of 1913. At about the same time, Henri Sauvage explored the expressive plastic potential of this new monolithic material in his set- back apartments in the Rue Vavin, completed in 1912. By this date the reinforced-concrete frame had become a normative technique, and from now on most of the development was to lie in the scale of its application and in its assimilation as an expressive element. While its first use on a megastructural scale was in Matt Trucco s 40-hectare (100-acre) Fiat Works, begun in Turin in 1915 [21], its appropriation as the primary expressive element of an architectural language came with Le Corbusier s Maison Dom-Lno proposal of around the same date. Where the one clearly demonstrated that flat concrete roofs could sustain the vibration of dynamic moving loads - the Fiat factory has a test track on its roof - the other postulated the Hennebique system as a patent primal structure to which, after the manner of Laugier s primitive hut, the development of the new architecture would have to refer. \r",{"entities":[]}],["21 Trucco, Fiat Works, Turin, 1915-21. From an engineering standpoint, this period was to reach its most sublime expression in the early work of the engineers Robert Maillart and Eug ne Freyssinet. By 1905 in his Rhine Bridge at Tavanasa, the great Swiss engineer Maillart had already arrived at his characteristic bridge form - a three-hinged arch of hollow box section, with triangular openings cut into its sides to reduce unnecessary weight and to impart a light and expressive character to the overall form. By 1912, Maillart had achieved the first beamless floor slab in Europe, in a five-storey warehouse that he built in Altdorf. His beamless system seems to have been an advance over the mushroom slab construction developed slightly earlier by the American engineer Claude Allen Porter Turner. In Turner s four-way reinforcement, as opposed to Maillart s two-way system, the bars were required to pass over all column heads, with the consequence that the steel could not be accommodated within an economic depth if the tendency of the column to punch through the slab was to be resisted. The floor structure in the Turner system was, in effect, a network of heavily reinforced flat beams with large column heads to resist the resulting shear. The beamless \r",{"entities":[]}],[" two-way Maillart system was lighter and generated far less shear, with a corresponding reduction in the dimensions of both the slab and the column heads. In his Aare Bridge at Aarburg (1911) Maillart succeeded in articulating the bridge platform from its supporting arch while stiffening the platform through transverse frames set into the haunch of the arch. He had still to articulate the abutments of the bridge in relation to its overall form. In almost all his bridges, even where supported by ribbed arches, Maillart designed the platform as a box section so that as far as possible the road bed was made to support itself. He reached the height of his powers as a bridge builder with his 90-metre (295-foot) span Salginatobel Bridge, erected in the Alps in 1930, but the formula that he had first worked out at Aarburg received its finest expression in the Arve Bridge [22], built at Vessey near Geneva in 1936. \r",{"entities":[]}],["#8 eo 2816 22 Maillart, Arve Bridge, Vessey, 1936.

These pioneer prefabricated folded slab constructions influenced a remarkable series of aircraft hangars designed by Nervi in the latter half of the 1930s.

This extremely economical system for large spans - reducing the beam depth by about half for the same concrete section - was first patented by Freyssinet in 1939. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Part Il A Critical History 1836- 1967 \r",{"entities":[]}],["24 Terragni, Casa del Fascio, Como, 1932-36, during a demonstration (see p. 234). \r",{"entities":[]}],["Chapter 1 News from Nowhere: England 1836-1924 The enthusiasm of the Gothic revivalists died out when they were confronted by the fact that they form part of a society which will not and cannot have a living style, because it is an economical necessity for its existence that the ordinary everyday work of its population shall be mechanical drudgery, and because it is the harmony of the ordinary everyday work of the population which produces Gothic, that is living architectural art, and mechanical drudgery cannot be harmonized into art.

Pugin separately called forth the spiritual and cultural discontents of the second half of the \r",{"entities":[]}],["19th century. The former was atheistic and consciously aligned to the radical Chartist movement of the late 1830s; the latter was a Catholic convert who advocated a direct return to the spiritual values and architectural forms of the Middle Ages. After the publication, in 1836, of his Contrasts; or a parallel between the noble edifices of the 14th and 15th centuries and similar buildings of the present day, Pugin s influence was immediate and extensive. To him we owe largely the homogeneity of the Gothic Revival, which profoundly affected English building in the 19th century. Carlyle, on the other hand, was in many respects in opposition to Pugin. His Past and Present of 1843 was an implicit critique of Catholicism in its decadence, presenting the case for a brand of paternalistic socialism on the model of Saint-Simon s New Christianity, of 1825. Whereas Carlyle s radicalism was politically and socially progressive, even if ultimately authoritarian, Pugin s reformism was essentially conservative and related to the right-wing, High Church Oxford Movement, whose foundation preceded by two years his conversion to Catholicism in 1835. What Carlyle and Pugin had in common was distaste for their materialistic age: through this shared antagonism they were to influence that mid-19th-century prophet of cultural doom and redemption, John Ruskin, who in his prime in 1868 became the first Slade Professor of Fine Art at the University of Oxford. Ruskin, who acquired his intellectual following in 1846 with the appearance of the second volume of his Modern Painters, did not begin to declare himself unequivocally and extensively on socio-cultural and economic matters until 1853, when he published The Stones of Venice. There, ina whole chapter devoted to the place of the craftsman in relation to the work of art, Ruskin first spoke out against the industrialist division of labour and the degradation of the operative into a machine - a text that was to be reissued as a pamphlet by the first Working Men s College, at which \r",{"entities":[]}],["Ruskin subsequently taught. In it, after Adam Smith, Ruskin compared traditional craftsmanship with the mechanical labour of mass production. He wrote, It is not, truly speaking, the labour that is divided; but the men ... so that all the little piece of intelligence that is left in a man is not enough to make a pin or a nail, but exhausts itself in making the point of a pin or the head of a nail. This was an extension of his attitude to ornament, already outlined in The Seven Lamps of Architecture (1849), where he wrote that the right question to ask, respecting all ornament, is simply this: was it done with enjoyment? With this brand of radicalism, Ruskin began to move away from his earlier High Anglican sympathies to a position much closer to that of Carlyle. On the publication in 1860 of his essays in political economy, Unto this Last, Ruskin finally revealed himself as an uncompromising socialist. Through their influence on the English cultural climate via Pugin, Friedrich Overbeck - whom Pugin described as that prince of Christian painters - and the German Nazarenes became the moral and artistic model for the short-lived, Chartist-inspired, Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, formed at the instigation of the brothers Dante Gabriel and William Michael Rossetti, and Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais in 1848. In 1851 Ruskin became spiritually affiliated to this movement, which had as its aim the foundation of a school of painting which would be expressive of profound ideas and emotions. The ideal was to create an art form derived directly from nature and not from artistic conventions of Renaissance origin. This eminently anti-Classical, Romantic attitude was propagated in 1850 in the Pre-Raphaelite magazine, The Germ. Yet the brotherhood lacked the monastic strictness and conviction of the Nazarenes. Both it and its magazine were too individualistic to last for long, and by 1853 Pre-Raphaelitism as a collective movement was defunct. \r",{"entities":[]}],["The second, craft-orientated, phase of Pre-Raphaelite activity turns upon the meeting of William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones when undergraduates at Oxford, in 1853. Oxford exposed them to the lectures of Ruskin and to the all-pervasive influence of Pugin. After their graduation, in 1856, they became closely involved with the poet and painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti, eventually collaborating with him in 1857 on murals for the Union Society building at Oxford, an enterprise that deliberately echoed the Nazarene frescoes in Rome. Although Burne-Jones had already determined to become a painter, it was some months before Rossetti could lure Morris to London, away from his articled position in the Oxford office of the Gothic Revivalist architect G.E. Street. Somewhat paradoxically, Morris s career as a designer dates from his decision, late in 1856, to abandon architecture for painting; but that had to wait upon the furnishing of his rooms in London, for which he designed his first intensely medieval furniture ... as firm and as heavy as a rock . These unpretentious pieces, no doubt inspired by the craft ideals of Ruskin, were designed under the guidance of Philip Webb, with whom Morris had previously worked in Street s office. In 1858 Pre-Raphaelite domestic culture was crystallized, as it were, in Morris s only known easel work, a portrait of his wife, Jane Burden, as Queen Guinevere or La Belle Iseu/t, wearing ornate clothes in an ideal Pre-Raphaelite interior. Morris then gave up painting entirely and addressed himself to the task of furnishing his new home, the Red House [25, 26], which Philip Webb built for him in 1859 at Bexleyheath, Kent, in a style which except for minor details was close to the work of Street and more particularly to William Butterfield s Gothic Revival vicarages dating from the 1840s and 1850s. 25, 26 Webb, Red House, Bexleyheath, Kent, 1859. View, and plans of ground and first floors. \r",{"entities":[]}],["In the Red House (so called on account of its brickwork) Webb established the principles which were soon to inform the work of his brilliant contemporaries William Eden Nesfield and Richard Norman Shaw, and for which he was to be known throughout his career - his concern for structural integrity and his desire to integrate buildings into their site and into the local culture. These aims he achieved through practical design, sensitive site layout and the use of local materials, coupled with a profound respect for traditional building methods. Like Morris, his first client and lifelong colleague, Webb had an almost mystical respect for the sacredness of craftsmanship and for the earth in which both life and architecture were ultimately founded. Even more than Morris, he was against any excessive use of ornament. According to his biographer, W.R. Lethaby, Webb once complained that an overelegant grate was hardly fit for the holy fire . Such a sentiment could hardly be further removed from the mannered interpretation that his approach was to be given at the hands of Nesfield and Shaw, for instance in the latter s picturesque Old English country house, Leyswood, Sussex, designed in 1866 [27]. 27 Shaw, Leyswood, Sussex, 1866-69. The whole exuberant unfolding of the English Free Architecture movement, from the eccentricities of A.H. Mackmurdo and C.R. Ashbee to the refined professionalism of Shaw, Lethaby and C.F.A. Voysey, may be said to have had its origin in the creation of the Red House. At all events, this work was Catalytic in launching Morris on his destined career, and two years later he organized an association of Pre-Raphaelite artists, including Webb, Rossetti, Burne-Jones and Ford Madox Brown, into an atelier which would design and execute on commission anything from murals to stained glass and furniture, from embroidery to metalwork and \r",{"entities":[]}],["carved wood. The aim, as in Pugin s extensive furnishings designed for the Houses of Parliament in the 1830s and 1840s, was the creation of a total work of art. This much, with all modesty, the prospectus of the firm made clear: It is anticipated that by such co-operation ... the work must necessarily be of a much more complete order than if any single artist were incidentally employed in the usual manner. Apart from the precedent established by Pugin, the foundation of this atelier may well have been influenced by the Art Manufactures organization, started by Henry Cole under the pseudonym of Felix Summerly in 1845. In any event, the Pre-Raphaelite craft work that had hitherto occurred spontaneously now took on a public character. It is fitting that the first work to be sold at the London premises of the firm was glass tableware designed by Webb. With the prospering of the atelier, Morris was paradoxically compelled to leave the idyllic Red House in 1864 and to move permanently to London. A year later he gave over the management of the firm to Warrington Taylor, in order to devote himself exclusively to two-dimensional design and to literature, the two activities which were to consume the rest of his life. The first Morris wallpapers date from this period, as do the earliest works in stained glass by himself and Burne-Jones. Morris s models varied from Persian d cor, illustrated in Owen Jones s Grammar of Ornament of 1856, to the medieval style which he naturally adopted for his stained-glass work - a product for which there was a steady, if limited, demand throughout his life. Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. achieved public recognition in 1867 with the Green Dining Room or tea room that Webb designed for the South Kensington (now the Victoria and Albert) Museum in London. The room was entirely furnished and decorated by Morris and the artist-craftsmen of his firm. After this date, Webb started to design and execute large domestic commissions on his own, culminating in his last great house, Standen, built near East Grinstead, Sussex \r",{"entities":[]}],["(1891-94), with furnishings provided - as was usually the case - by Morris s firm. Morris became increasingly involved with literature, from which he attempted fanatically to expunge all words of Latin origin, producing by the mid- 1870s extensive translations of Icelandic sagas, in addition to numerous volumes of his own Romantic poetry. At that time it would seem as if medieval Iceland was the final Nowhere that his idealistic spirit pined for, while it remained sequestered within the industrial reality of the 19th century. The year 1875 was a watershed in Morris s life. The firm was dissolved and reorganized as Morris & Co. under his sole control, and he began to increase the number of crafts in which he and hence the firm could work. He taught himself dyeing and carpet weaving and, in 1877, established a London showroom as a prime commercial outlet. From then on, aside from the management of the firm and the design and production of a whole range of wallpapers, hangings and carpets, Morris s concerns gradually became increasingly public and less poetic and craft-orientated. He seems to have felt it his duty to take up publicly the socialist and preservationist causes of Ruskin, who was by now mentally ill. Thus, in 1877 he wrote his first political pamphlet and founded the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, in a successful attempt to foil Sir George Gilbert Scott s intentions to restore, or rather partly to rebuild, Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire. In the decade following his reorganization of the firm, Morris divided his life equally between politics and design, producing during this period, according to his first biographer, Mackail, over 600 designs for various fabrics. In 1883, however, Morris began to read the works of Karl Marx and joined the Social Democratic Federation, headed by Engels, in the company of such committed socialists as Eleanor Marx and Edward Aveling. Two years later he left the Federation and founded the Socialist League, shifting \r",{"entities":[]}],["virtually all of his energies from design to politics. At frequent intervals, until his death in 1896, he wrote and published essays on the related themes of socialism, culture and society, beginning with his Fourierist essay of 1885 entitled How We Live and How We Might Live, and culminating in his famous utopian romance, News from Nowhere, of 1891. To the coming generations, to Morris s associate Walter Crane, to Ruskin s prot g Mackmurdo and to the principal pupils of Shaw, namely Lethaby, E.S. Prior and Ernest Newton, even to Shaw himself, and to relative outsiders such as Ashbee and Voysey, Morris s somewhat contradictory position was patently clear. Above all there was his utopian vision of Nowhere , a land where the state had withered away according to Marxist prophecy and where all distinction between town and country had disappeared. The city no longer existed as a dense physical entity and the great engineering achievements of the 19th century had been dismantled: wind and water were once more the sole sources of power, and the waterway and the road were the sole means of transport. A society without money or property, without crime or punishment, without prison or parliament, where social order depended solely upon the free association of family groups within the structure of the commune. Finally, a society where work was based on the banded workshop, the guild or Werkbund, and where education was free and like labour itself unforced. This single-minded socialist vision stood out in strong contrast to the context of Morris s own life and to the latent inconsistency of his thought. There was his prosperous firm itself, a laissez-faire phenomenon par excellence, whose diverse luxury goods were consumed by the upper middle class; then there was his highly radical socialism, largely unintegrated with his innate anarchic leanings - a revolutionary socialism totally unacceptable to the more liberal of his followers, such as Ashbee; and finally, for \r",{"entities":[]}],["Fabian Socialists and architects alike, there was within Morris s theory and practice the ameliorative suggestion of the garden city as a form of settlement to be based on the craft guild or cooperative, as a means for achieving not only work, but also evolutionary social reform and re-education, and so, by degrees, some public recognition for both. In contrast to this progressive (if somewhat disturbing) breadth of concern, there was the latent phobic quality of Morris s own design and - more critical still - there was his stubborn refusal to come to terms with industrial method and his ambiguous, not to say hostile, attitude to all architecture after the 15th century. Not only was the Classical past condemned but even sympathetic contemporary work was indifferently received: Webb s fine designs singularly failed to draw from Morris any public recognition. Could it be that Webb's eclecticism was finally too much for Morris; that the Classical and Elizabethan elements that were incorporated into his houses between 1879 and 1891 were sufficient cause for disaffection? In the event, the historicism of the period was hardly capable of sustaining Morris s anti-Classical line. By the early 1870s worldly architects like Shaw were already manipulating and classicizing, in an urban context, the Queen Anne style that he, Webb and Nesfield had developed out of the English and Dutch domestic traditions. Before his wholesale conversion to Neo-Georgian in the early 1890s, Shaw established a respectable precedent for adopting a classic, if mannered, format in town, such as Swan House, Chelsea, of 1875-77, and a free, Picturesque, convenient one in the country, such as Pierrepoint, at Frensham in Surrey, of 1876-78. Despite his sophistry, Shaw was influenced by Ruskinian sociocultural concerns. In 1877 he began to design, for the artistic property speculator Jonathan T. Carr, houses for the first garden suburb, located on the western outskirts of London. The red brick and tile-hung style of this upper- \r",{"entities":[]}],["middle-class garden village , known as Bedford Park [28], was celebrated in the flippant Ballad of Bedford Park , published in the St j/ames s Gazette in 1881: 28 Voysey, house in Bedford Park, London, 1890. Here trees are green and bricks are red And clean the face of man. We'll build our gardens here he said In the style of good Queen Anne. Tis here a village I'll erect With Norman Shaw s assistance Where man will lead a chaste Correct, aesthetical existence. This brick style extended even into the church, rendered significantly secular by the absence of any vertical feature: a structure which, although executed in a vague Gothic Revival manner, audaciously displayed a Wren-like lantern on its roof. The earliest houses of Bedford Park were built in 1876 to the designs of the japoniste architect E.W. Godwin. Shaw took over in 1877 and a number of different architects worked there under his influence over the next decade, including at the tail end Voysey, who built a remarkable house in The Parade in 1890. In 1878, Shaw published his Sketches for Cottages and Other Buildings. This highly influential book illustrated numerous designs for workers houses of various sizes. It also included the essential public building typology for a self-contained ideal village community, such as a school, a village hall, an almshouse and a cottage hospital. In the following year the first of the paternalistic garden cities appeared: Bournville, Birmingham, founded by George Cadbury and designed by Ralph Heaton and others. It was largely the Bedford Park model that W.H. Lever followed \r",{"entities":[]}],["when, less than ten years later in 1888, he founded Port Sunlight. The evolution of the garden city movement in the last decade of the century was intimately linked to the development of the Arts and Crafts movement. As presented by Ebenezer Howard in 1898, its social policy combined urban dispersal with rural colonization and decentralized government. As a complement to the co- operative movement, it advocated that such a city should derive its revenue from a balanced combination of industry and agriculture. Howard postulated trade union backing for the financing of housing, co-operative ownership of land, comprehensive planning and temperance reform. He fixed the optimum size of the garden city at 32,000, to be restricted from further growth by an isolating green belt. Each city was to be regionally located as a satellite settlement and linked to a major centre by means of a railway. In this form the garden city complemented continuing attempts to improve, by social reform, the living and working conditions of the industrial proletariat. On his return from America in 1876, Howard had become involved in those socialist circles frequented by Bernard Shaw and Sidney and Beatrice Webb, a group which later, as Fabian Socialists, initially rejected the garden city idea. Howard s position, in accordance with the spirit if not with the letter of Fabianism, was at once practical and ameliorative. The very title of his book of 1898, Tomorrow: a Peaceful Path to Real Reform, announced his position as a man of compromise. Howard was committed to free enterprise within the limits of social control and favoured a piecemeal approach to reform rather than revolutionary action. Apart from Ruskin s St George s Guild of 1871, Howard was to depend for the socio-political model of his city on thinkers as diverse as the anarchist Peter Kropotkin and the American economist Henry George, who in his Progress and Poverty of 1879 had advocated a single tax on all ground rent. Howard was \r",{"entities":[]}],["equally eclectic in deriving the diagrammatic form of his city from sources as varied as James Silk Buckingham s ideal town, Victoria, of 1849 and Paxton s Great Victorian Way proposal of 1855. It is hard to imagine anything further removed from Howard s initial diagram than the realization of Letchworth Garden City, begun in 1904. The railway bisects the city, the shopping area is exposed to the weather, and industry is mixed with residential areas in a totally expedient way. Its architects, Raymond Unwin and Barry Parker, had, it seems, little to offer Howard save enfeebled essays in the style of Shaw and Webb. Hampstead Garden Suburb, designed by Unwin in 1907, would have been equally insipid had it not been for his collaboration with Lutyens. Following in the Arts and Crafts tradition of Cole and Morris, Mackmurdo founded the Century Guild in 1882. Once again this comprised a group of artists who were to engage in the design and production of domestic objects. From the outset Mackmurdo worked with equal facility as a graphic artist and as a wallpaper and furniture designer. He publicized his views in collaboration with Selwyn Image, founding the Century Guild design group in 1882 and its magazine, The Hobby Horse, in 1884. In his applied art of the early 1880s Mackmurdo developed a unique style, anticipatory of the Art Nouveau: a style which, deriving directly from William Blake, was spiritually at variance with the elegant but severe forms of his architecture. This found its most strict expression in the highly original flat-roofed house that he built at Enfield about 1883, and in his more gratifying Century Guild Exhibition Stand of 1886. In 1887, Ashbee followed the well-established guild model with his foundation in the East End of London of the Guild of Handicraft, which incorporated into its programme the goal of direct social reform. His guild was established for the express purpose of usefully employing and training London journeymen and their apprentices, who would \r",{"entities":[]}],["otherwise have remained unemployed. Ashbee, as we may judge from the house that he built for himself in Chelsea in 1904, was a more delicate and correct designer than Mackmurdo. With his postgraduate Toynbee Hall tutoring experience, he was also more committed to direct social action as a means of reform. However, although profoundly influenced by Morris and Ruskin, he took issue with both for their dogmatic antipathy to the machine and for their revolutionary socialism. In opposition to his more radical predecessors Ashbee styled himself a Constructive Socialist. After his meeting with Frank Lloyd Wright, around the turn of the century, he was confirmed in his belief that the resolution of the cultural dilemma posed by modern industry depended on a proper use of the machine. Like Howard, Ashbee was a man committed to compromise. He advocated the decentralization of existing urban concentrations and their institutions, thereby lending further support to a link between the Arts and Crafts movement and the garden city idea. Again following Howard, Ashbee remained opposed to the nationalization of land. Convinced that the cultural function of craftwork was to be that of human individuation , Ashbee feared the reductionist aspects of radical socialism. Thus later in life he welcomed the foundering of the Socialist International on the rock of race . In its place, he favoured a somewhat dated Disraeli style of social reform and in consequence was unduly sanguine about the virtues of British imperialism. A strong sense of economic reality was not part of Ashbee s make- up, and his precious Guild of Handicraft, established as a craft-based agrarian community at Chipping Campden in Gloucestershire in 1906, collapsed after only two years. Such ambitious social ends were not the concern of Mackmurdo s individualistic disciple Voysey, who in 1885 arrived at a strength and simplicity of style that was to elude most of his contemporaries. Voysey derived his style from Webb's principles of respect for traditional methods \r",{"entities":[]}],["and local materials, rather than from Shaw s inventiveness and spatial virtuosity. In an unrealized house project of 1885, intended for his own occupation, Voysey formulated (despite Shavian half-timbering) the essential components of his style: a slate roof with overhanging eaves, wrought- iron gutter brackets, and rendered rough-cast walls pierced by horizontal windows and marked at intervals by battered buttresses and chimneys. These features were to characterize his work for the next thirty years. Stylistically, Voysey s manner was a direct attempt to recover the basic merits of English yeoman building. However, his early association with Mackmurdo introduced a flowing and highly sophisticated element into his work which became manifest in his wallpaper and metalwork designs of about 1890. These details provided accents in Voysey s otherwise austere interiors. Unlike Morris, Voysey was possessed by a sense of restraint, almost to a fault. Thus he stipulated that either the fabrics or wallpapers should be patterned, but never both. His own house, The Orchard, built at Chorley Wood, Hertfordshire, in 1899, exemplifies the lively restraint of his interior style: gridded balusters flooded with light, low picture rails, tiled fireplace surrounds, plain oak furniture and thick carpets. While these elements were repeated with little variation throughout his career, his designs became less figurative as the years advanced, and where his early furniture tended towards the organic, his later pieces are based on Classical themes. Between 1889 and 1910 Voysey designed some forty houses, a number of which transcended the latent historicism of his style. Among these are the artist s residence for J.W. Forster built in Bedford Park in 1890, the Sturgis House in Guildford of 1896, and Broadleys [29] on Lake Windermere, his finest house, realized in 1898. Nowhere else did he equal the clarity of its plan, the generosity of its layout and landscaping, and the boldness of its massing and fenestration. In all this, Voysey s \r",{"entities":[]}],["influence was as extensive as his career, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, C.H. Townsend, and the Viennese architects Joseph Maria Olbrich and Josef Hoffmann being among the architects influenced by his work. 29 Voysey, Broadleys, Cumbria, 1898. During the first phase of Voysey s career the English Arts and Crafts movement became firmly institutionalized: initially with the foundation in 1884 of the Art Workers Guild, at the instigation of Lethaby and other members of Shaw's office, then in 1887 with the establishment of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, presided over by Morris s prot g , Walter Crane. The last twenty-five years of the movement prior to the outbreak of the First World War are inseparable from the career of Lethaby. After serving for twelve years as Shaw's chief assistant, he set up on his own in 1895 with the design of Avon Tyrrell, a large mansion in the New Forest in southern England. Five years later he was installed, jointly with George Frampton, as the first principal of the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. Thus, apart from his very brief career as a designer, Lethaby s role within the Arts and Crafts movement turned upon his marked abilities as a teacher. In 1892 he published his first book, Architecture, Mysticism and Myth, in which he demonstrated how architecture in the past had always been universally informed by cosmic and religious paradigms. He attempted to incorporate such symbolism into his own work, while his general argument seems to have had an impact on the work of his close colleague, E.S. Prior, whose famous butterfly plan house, The Barn, built at Exmouth, Devon, in 1897, exhibited certain features that were decidedly symbolic. (Similar butterfly-plan forms were proposed by M.H. Baillie Scott, for Yellowsands in 1902 and for Hampstead Garden Suburb in 1908.) \r",{"entities":[]}],["With his entry into teaching, Lethaby shifted his attention from poetic content to the problem of developing the correct method for the evolution of form. Thus, by 1910, he argued against his 1892 thesis that one cannot instil magic into architecture when it is totally absent in the society. For Lethaby, the tradition of which he had been a part appeared quite suddenly to be played out. The last in a long line of Gothic Revival socialists, he was by the turn of the century arguing for pure functionalism. In 1915, while helping to organize the foundation of the Design and Industries Association, he was urging his colleagues to look to Germany and the Deutsche Werkbund for the way to the future. As the first waves of the 1914 war broke across Europe, that golden age of dreamlike English country houses, ushered in by Webb, Shaw and Nesfield and rendered at its most exotic in the elaborate Country Life creations of Edwin Landseer Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll, came definitely to a close. Yet this era had effectively ended even earlier, in a spate of large Neo-Georgian houses, built, as Robert Furneaux Jordan has remarked, for those aesthetic rich who after the Boer War had beaten their swords into gold shares . Irrespective of this triumph of Neo-Palladianism in Edwardian taste - Lutyens s passion after the turn of the century for what he called the Wrenaissance - it is unlikely that the forms and ideals of the English Arts and Crafts movement would have survived the socio-cultural trauma of the first large-scale industrialized war. Something of this can be sensed from the fate of Liberty & Co. after the war, for the holocaust of 1914-18 effectively divided the craft output of the firm like a guillotine. In the space of some five years, the inventive rigour and brilliance of its Art Nouveau silverware gave way to a d cor of banal blue china, Tudor furniture and the pastiche production of pseudo-Pre- Raphaelite stained glass. Liberty & Co. were to opt for this degenerated style even in their new premises built in 1924 \r",{"entities":[]}],["to the designs of E.T. Hall and E.S. Hall. This half-timbered department store epitomized the so-called Stockbroker s Tudor that in various debased domestic versions was to line the newly built bypasses linking London to the suburban commuter regions that were to become its life s blood. In the interim, Lutyens, now elevated to the position of being the unofficial architect laureate to the state, found himself suspended in an aftermath that could not even afford the relatively modest luxury of his early country houses, with their small but complex gardens designed by Jekyll (e.g. his Prioresque Tigbourne Court of 1899). As the century advanced, Lutyens s taste for Palladianism, first wittily expressed in his house, Nashdom, of 1905, was to find its estranged fulfilment in the solemnity of his Somme memorial to the British dead [30], at Thiepval (1924), and in the superannuated monumentality of his masterly Viceroy s House, New Delhi, of 1923-31 (see p. 242). In these two brilliant Neo-Classical monuments, Lutyens ruthlessly renounced his Arts and Crafts heritage. It would be hard to imagine anything more removed from Morris s utopian vision than these austere monuments isolated in the midst of flat and alien landscapes. Nowhere was now to be embodied not in Morris s homely revival of the medieval guild, but rather in an arch raised to the memory of a martyred generation, and in a Baroque vista opening onto an empire that was already on the edge of being lost. 30 Lutyens, Thiepval Arch, Picardy, 1924. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Chapter 2 Adler and Sullivan: the Auditorium and the High Rise 1886-95 | should say that it would be greatly for our aesthetic good if we should refrain entirely from the use of ornament for a period of years, in order that our thought might concentrate acutely upon the production of buildings well formed and comely in the nude.

We shall have learned, however, that ornament is mentally a luxury, not a necessity, for we shall have discerned the limitations as well as the great value of unadorned masses. We have in us romanticism, and feel a craving to express it. We feel intuitively that our strong, athletic, and simple forms will carry with natural ease the raiment of which we dream, and that our buildings thus clad in a garment of poetic imagery, half hid as it were in choice products of loom and mine, will appeal with redoubled power, like a sonorous melody overlaid with harmonious voices. Louis Sullivan Ornament in Architecture, 18921 H.H. Richardson s Neo-Romanesque Marshall Field Wholesale Store, begun in 1885 and completed a year after his death in 1887, was the point of departure for the \r",{"entities":[]}],["important achievements of the Chicago architectural partnership of Adler and Sullivan. Before joining Dankmar Adler as an assistant in 1879 (he was to become designing partner in 1881), Louis Sullivan had received a somewhat varied education: formally at two prestigious academies, where on each occasion he stayed for something under a year - at MIT in 1872 and then at J.-A.-E. Vaudremer s atelier in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, in 1874. Between these academic forays, Sullivan worked for a year in Frank Furness s office in Philadelphia, a year which was to prove critical to his career, not only because of his experience of Furness s Orientalized Gothic manner - an episode which had an enduring effect on his own approach to ornament - but also because he met the young intellectual architect John Edelman, who introduced him, after 1875, to the Chicago architectural establishment - first to William Le Baron Jenney, later to become the pioneer of steel-frame construction in his Fair Store [32] of 1892, and then to Dankmar Adler. Edelman s unusual cultivation, including his anarcho-socialist views, derived from Morris and Kropotkin, exercised an influence over Sullivan s theoretical development, evidenced in the latter s Kindergarten Chats of 1901. During their early careers, Adler and Sullivan were preoccupied with meeting the urgent demands of a booming Chicago, then being rebuilt as the Midwestern capital after its destruction by fire in 1871. In the later 1870s, while Adler was still establishing his practice, Sullivan worked for Jenney, thereby becoming familiar with the technical aspects of Chicago construction. In his 1926 essay, The Autobiography of an Idea, Sullivan wrote of the powerful forces that led to this method of building. The tall commercial building arose from the pressure of land prices, the land prices from pressure of population, the pressure of population from external pressure ... But an \r",{"entities":[]}],["office building could not rise above stairway height without a means of vertical transportation. Thus pressure was brought on the brain of the mechanical engineer, whose creative imagination and industry brought forth the passenger elevator ... But it was inherent in the nature of masonry construction to fix a new limit of height; as its ever- thickening walls ate up ground and floor space of ever- increasing price, as the pressure of population rapidly increased. ... [This] Chicago activity in erecting high buildings finally attracted the attention of the local sales managers of Eastern rolling mills; and their engineers were set to work. The mills for some time past had been rolling those structural shapes that had long been in use in bridge work. Their own ground work was thus prepared. It was a matter of vision in salesmanship based upon engineering imagination and technique. Thus, the idea of a steel frame which should carry all the load was tentatively presented to Chicago architects ... the trick was turned; and there swiftly came into being something new under the sun... The architects of Chicago welcomed the steel frame and did something with it. The architects of the East were appalled by it and could make no contribution to it.? As Sullivan indicated, the Chicago architects of the 1880s had no choice but to master advanced modes of construction if they wanted to remain in practice; and while the great fire had demonstrated the vulnerability of cast iron, the subsequent development of the fireproof steel frame - with its ability to provide multistorey rentable space - enabled speculators to develop downtown sites to the absolute optimum. The contemporary critic Montgomery Schuyler remarked in 1899, the elevator doubled the height of the office building and the steel frame doubled it again . Before 1886, Adler and Sullivan were occupied primarily with small office structures, warehouses and department stores, a commercial practice that was varied from time to \r",{"entities":[]}],["time by residential commissions. These early buildings, limited to about six floors, afforded little scope, except for the expression of the frame, be it in iron, masonry ora mixture of the two, and one could do little save manipulate the Classical division of the facade into base, middle and top. All this was changed in 1886 by the commission to design the Auditorium Building [31, 33], a structure whose overall contribution to Chicago culture was to be as much technological as conceptual. The basic arrangement of this multi-use complex was exemplary. The architects had been asked to install, within a half-block of the Chicago grid, a large modern opera house flanked on two sides by eleven storeys of accommodation, to be given over in part to offices and in part to a hotel. Their unique organization of this brief incorporated such innovations as locating the hotel kitchen and dining facilities on the roof so that the fumes would not disturb the residents. At the same time the auditorium itself offered plenty of scope for Adler s technological imagination. He met the demands for a variable capacity by using folding ceiling panels and vertical screens which could vary the auditorium from a concert size of 2,500 to a convention capacity of 7,000. The client s faith in Adler s technical ability finds some reflection in Adler s own description of the hall: 31 Chicago, 1898: view from Michigan Boulevard westwards. In the centre (no. 2) is the Auditorium Building (see fig. 33, p. 60). 32 Jenney, Fair Store, Chicago, 1890-91. Detail of fireproof steel-frame construction. 33 Adler and Sullivan, Auditorium Building, Chicago, 1887-89. Longitudinal section through the stage and auditorium. \r",{"entities":[]}],["The architectural and decorative forms found in the auditorium are unconventional in the extreme and are determined to a great extent by the acoustic effects to be attained. ... A series of concentric elliptical arches effect the lateral and vertical expansion of sound from the proscenium opening to the body of the house. The soffits and faces of these elliptical surfaces are ornamented in relief, the incandescent electric lamps and... inlet openings of the ventilating system forming an essential effective part of the decoration ... Much attention has been paid to the heating, cooling and ventilating apparatus. Fresh air, taken from the top of the building, is forced into the house by a fan... 10 feet [3 metres] in diameter. ... This washes from the air much dust and soot. ... Asystem of ducts carries the air into different parts of the auditorium ... stage ... corridor foyers and dressing-rooms. The general movement of air is from the stage outward and from the ceiling downward ... Ducts are carried to ... exhaust fans from openings in the risers of all the steppings for the seats.> Adler was possibly one of the last architect-engineers to prove his competence over a wide technical range. He mastered a multitude of difficulties: from the air conditioning of the auditorium to the trussed steel girder supporting its acoustical interior; from the accommodation of a complex revolving stage to the provision of extensive foyers to both the opera house and the hotel. The whole complex was housed in a massive masonry and iron structure, ingeniously ballasted during construction so as to compensate for the differential loading of its foundations. The aesthetic of this eleven-storey complex was based on an attenuation of the syntax of Richardson s Marshall Field Store. Where Richardson had used rusticated stone blocks throughout, Sullivan varied the facing material of the Auditorium Building to modulate its greater height and mass, changing from rusticated blocks to smooth ashlar \r",{"entities":[]}],["above the third floor. However, the bleakness and austerity of the final result dismayed Adler, who wrote in 1892: It is to be regretted that the severe simplicity ... rendered necessary by the financial policy of the earlier days of the enterprise, the deep impression made by Richardson's Marshall Field Building upon the Directors of the Auditorium Association, and a reaction from a course of indulgence in... highly decorative effects on the part of its architects, should have happened to coincide ... and thereby deprive the exterior of the building of those graces ... so characteristic of its internal treatment.4 Nevertheless, there is something forceful, taut and rhythmic about its overall character, while the colonnade of the hotel veranda on the lake front is echoed by similar delicate motifs in the tower. The slight hint of orientalism in this veranda anticipates the decidedly Turkish feeling of the Charnley House in Chicago that Sullivan was to design in 1892, in close collaboration with his assistant Frank Lloyd Wright. Richardson was to remain the ultimate determinant of Sullivan s early style. In Sullivan s hands Richardson's finely modulated use of the Romanesque became brutally simplified into an almost Neo-Classical manner, which was first developed in his Walker Warehouse of 1888 and in his Dooly Block of 1890. These were surely those buildings, well formed and comely in the nude , to which he referred in Ornament in Architecture of 1892. From now on Sullivan s delimitation of mass depended on pronounced string- courses and projecting cornices. Fenestration is grouped in elongated arcades, while smooth, flush facades are articulated by taut decorative episodes. The Getty [34] and Wainwright tombs, designed in 1890 and 1892, epitomize the consolidation and refinement of this approach, which was rendered on a large scale in the Wainwright Building, \r",{"entities":[]}],["completed in St Louis, Missouri, in 1891. As in the work of the Viennese architect Otto Wagner, the basic austerity of Sullivan s stereometric structures was in opposition to the ornamentation by which they were enriched and articulated. Yet, in contrast to Wagner s flowing ornament, there is always something decidedly Islamic about Sullivan s disposition of decoration. Even where his ornament is not intrinsically geometric it is almost always contained by geometric form. In this recourse to the aesthetic and even the symbolic content of the East, Sullivan sought to reconcile that schism in Western culture between the intellectual and the emotional, poles which he was to associate later with the Greek and the Gothic. Between the Auditorium and the Wainwright Building, the character of Sullivan s ornament alternates from being organically free to conforming to the outline of a precise geometry. In the Transportation Building for the Chicago World s Columbian Exposition of 1893, it becomes predominantly geometric, or, where free, strictly contained within a geometric grid. As Frank Lloyd Wright wrote in his book, Genius and the Mobocracy (1949), this crystallization finally arrived at its definitive form in Sullivan s Guaranty Building at Buffalo, New York, of 1895. 34 Sullivan, Getty tomb, Graceland cemetery, Chicago, 1890. Neither Sullivan nor Jenney can be credited with the invention of the skyscraper, if by that term one simply means a multistorey structure of great height, since such heights had already been achieved in load-bearing brick just prior to Sullivan s Wainwright structure, most notably in Burnham and Root s sixteen-storey Monadnock Block, Chicago (1889-92). Sullivan, however, may be credited with the evolution of an architectural language appropriate to the high-rise frame. The Wainwright Building is the first \r",{"entities":[]}],["statement of this syntax, in which the suppression of the transom already evident in Richardson s Marshall Field Warehouse is taken to its logical conclusion. The facade, no longer arcaded, is articulated by gridded piers, clad in brick, while transoms are recessed and faced in terracotta so as to fuse with the fenestration. The piers rise out of a taut two- storey stone base and terminate abruptly at a massive and ornate terracotta cornice. Four years later Sullivan refined this expressive formula in his second masterwork, the Guaranty Building [35]. 35 Adler and Sullivan, Guaranty Building, Buffalo, 1895. The Guaranty Building is Sullivan at the height of his powers: it is without doubt the fullest realization of the principles that he outlined in his essay of 1896, The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered. |n this thirteen-storey office building Sullivan created a decorative structure in which, in his own words, The ornament is applied in the sense of being cut in or cut on... yet it should appear when completed, as though by the outworking of some beneficient agency, it had come forth from the very substance of the material. Ornamental terracotta envelops the exterior in an opaque filigree, whose motifs penetrate even into the ornate metalwork of the lobby. Only the ground-floor plate-glass windows and marble walls were exempt from this intense, not to say delirious, treatment. Sullivan, like his pupil Frank Lloyd Wright, saw himself as the lone creator of the culture of the New World. Nurtured on Whitman, Darwin and Spencer and inspired by Nietzsche, he regarded his buildings as emanations of some eternal life force. For Sullivan nature manifested herself in art through structure and ornamentation. His famous slogan, form follows function , found its ultimate expression in the concave cornice of the Guaranty Building, where the \r",{"entities":[]}],["ornamental life force on the surface of the mullions expands in swirls around the circular attic windows, metaphorically reflecting the mechanical system of the building which, to quote Sullivan, completes itself and makes its grand turn, ascending and descending. This organic metaphor was established in a more fundamental form in the significance which Sullivan attached to the winged seed of the sycamore, the germ featured on the first page of his discourse on architectural ornament, A System of Architectural Ornament According with a Philosophy of Man's Powers, published in 1924, the year of his death. Under this image Sullivan placed a Nietzschean caption: The Germ is the real thing; the seat of identity. Within its delicate mechanism lies the will to power, the function of which is to seek and eventually to find its full expression in form. For Sullivan, as for Wright, this form could only evolve in a millennialistic, democratic America, where it would emerge as an art that will live because it will be of the people, for the people, and by the people . As a self- appointed cultural prophet of democracy Sullivan was largely ignored. His overidealized egalitarian culture was rejected by the people themselves. His morbid insistence on the creation of a new civilization comparable to that of the Assyrians, particularly as expressed in the coexistent delirium and restraint of his orientalized architecture, left them both confused and alienated. Uprooted in their very essence and living through an economic depression on the edge of a frontier, they preferred the gratifying distractions of an imported Baroque, the White-City , East Coast emblems of imperialistic fulfilment that were so seductively presented to them in Daniel Burnham s World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago of 1893. This rejection destroyed Sullivan s morale, and despite a residual brilliance his powers began to decline. Separated from his urbane partner, Adler, he lost control over his professional destiny \r",{"entities":[]}],["so that after the turn of the century he received few commissions. Among these must be acknowledged his inventive, eccentric and highly ornate Midwestern bank buildings of the period 1907-19, and last but not least the proportional magnificence and ornamental vitality of his prophetic Schlesinger and Mayer department store (now Carson, Pirie, Scott), built in Chicago between 1899 and 1904. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Chapter 3 Frank Lloyd Wright and the Myth of the Prairie 1890-1916 When in early years | looked south from the massive stone tower in the Auditorium Building, a pencil in the hand of a master - the red glare of the Bessemer steel converters to the south of Chicago thrilled me as pages of the Arabian Nights used to with a sense of terror and romance. Frank Lloyd Wright The Nature of Materials , Architectural Record, October 19281 These words written by Wright of the formative period that he spent with Adler and Sullivan in the early 1890s hint at the exotic vision that inspired his early career: the transformation of industrial technique through art. Yet what form this transformation should take was for Wright, at the turn of the century, far from clear. Like his masters, Sullivan and Richardson, he oscillated between the authority of Classical order and the vitality of asymmetrical form. Richardson, after the manorial and urban manner of Norman Shaw, had adopted an asymmetrical style for domestic settings while reserving the symmetrical mode for most of his public institutions. Yet Richardson s houses always display a unifying density, and wherever possible he tried to adapt the Romanesque gravity of Vaudremer s Second \r",{"entities":[]}],["Empire manner and turn it into an appropriate style for the New World. Even in his early timber houses a certain feeling of weight pervades the shingled facades, while in his later domestic work, such as the Glessner House in Chicago of 1885, where shingle gave way to stone, the asymmetrical composition was imbued with an irrefutable monumentality. This issue of monumentality seems to have been equally problematic for both Sullivan and Wright. Sullivan had already used monumental forms in his Getty and Wainwright tombs of the 1890s, but were they equally suitable to house the living? The initial solution seems to have turned on the doubly articulated formula of Classical and stone if urban, and Gothic and shingle if rural. Wright, who was virtually in charge of Sullivan s domestic work after 1890, demonstrated this dual principle first in his own house, erected in 1889 in what was still the prairie of American mythology - the nascent Chicago suburb of Oak Park - and then in the orientalizing, Italianate Charnley House that he designed with Sullivan for downtown Chicago in 1892. Wright s own house was derived in both profile and plan, as Vincent Scully has shown, from the cruciform and T-plan Richardsonian pyramid-shaped houses that Bruce Price was then building in Tuxedo Park, New York. For Sullivan and Wright, the young, egalitarian culture of the New World could not be based on something so ponderous and conventionally Catholic as Richardson s Romanesque. In consequence they turned to the work of a fellow Celt, Owen Jones, whose Grammar of Ornament had first been published in 1856. Over sixty per cent of Jones s ornamental examples were exotic, that is of Indian, Chinese, Egyptian, Assyrian or Celtic origin, and it was to such sources, all removed from the West, that Sullivan and Wright resorted in their search for an appropriate style in which to embody the New World. This not only accounts for the Islamic motifs to be found in Sullivan s work but also for the science-fiction semicircular d cor over the playroom in \r",{"entities":[]}],["Wright s Oak Park studio of 1895, a mural featuring a recumbent Arab, who is transfixed before the celestial muse of an emergent civilization. In Wright s Winslow House [36], built at River Forest, Illinois, in 1893, the problem of evolving an egalitarian but appropriate format was provisionally resolved by providing two distinctly different aspects to the building: the street or urban facade, being symmetrical and entered on axis, and the garden or rural facade, being asymmetrical and entered to one side. This anticipates the planning strategy of Wright s Prairie Style, in which irregular distortions to the rear of a formal facade conveniently accommodate awkward ingredients such as service elements. 36 Wright, Winslow House, River Forest, Illinois, 1893. View and site plan. That the Winslow House was a transitional work is clearly confirmed by the mixed fenestration, part sash and part casement. Here, as Grant Carpenter Manson has written (in Frank Lloyd Wright to 1910, of 1958), Wright began to discard the sash window in favour of the casement, to prepare his work for the final change from fenestration in spots to fenestration in strips : while the characteristic Wrightian low-hipped Prairie roof appears here for the first time, the animation of surfaces with Sullivanesque bands of ornament and string courses testifies to the continued influence of Wright s master. The ornamented entrance elevation clearly derives from Sullivan s tombs of the early 1890s, while the arcaded fireplace screen of the entry hall is an introverted version of the facade of Sullivan s Schiller Theater. This early emphasis on the fireplace testifies to another more critical influence, that of Japanese architecture, to which Wright on his own admission had been subject since 1890, and certainly since the Chicago World s Columbian \r",{"entities":[]}],["Exposition of 1893, when the Japanese Government housed their national exhibit in a reconstruction of the Ho-o-den Temple. The role that this structure may have played in Wright s evolution has been best characterized by Manson: If we assume that actual confrontation with a Japanese building was the necessary mechanism at a certain juncture in his career to give those concepts reality and direction, then many of the steps in the evolution of his architecture can be rationally explained. As examples: the translation of the tokonoma, the permanent element of a Japanese interior and the focus of domestic contemplation and ceremony, into its Western counterpart, the fireplace, but a fireplace expanded to unprecedented, animistic importance; the frank revelation of the masonry of fireplace and chimney as the one desired solid substance in an architecture of ever- increasing movement; the opening out of interior spaces away from the chimneybreast toward shifting planes of glass at their further limits; the extension of the great eaves beyond these planes to modify and control the intensity of light which they admit and to protect them from weather; the subdivision of interior space by suggesting rather than partition, acknowledging and accommodating the fluctuating human uses to which it is put; the elimination of all sculptured and varnished trim in favor of flat surfaces and natural wood - all these and more could have been adduced from the lesson of the Ho-o-den.? Irrespective of the final provenance of the tokonama motif, by the time of the Winslow House, the fireplace, despite the provision of central heating, had become even more of a ceremonial core to the home than it had been in Wright s own Oak Park house of four years before. Yet in 1893 Wright remained uncommitted, for he could still design a thoroughly Classical facade for the Milwaukee Library. Two years later he extended his own home with a \r",{"entities":[]}],["studio in that quasi Pre-Columbian manner which we have come to regard, after Manson, as his Froebel style: a geometric proclivity supposedly influenced by the impact of Froebel toys on his education. About 1895 he also produced two surprisingly radical designs, his Luxfer Prism offices, faced entirely in glass, and the McAfee House, which was an ingenious reinterpretation of Richardson's parti for the Winn Memorial Library of 1878. Wright appears almost desperate at this point to break through to a new style: his public work is still part Italianate, part Richardsonian, while his domestic work is now consistently characterized by low-pitched roofs, poised at various heights over elongated asymmetrical plans. Typical of these two modes are his Francisco Terrace apartments and his Heller and Husser Houses, all built in Chicago between 1895 and 1899. It was to take Wright two more years to resolve all these various influences into that integrated domestic style with which he was to express his myth of the Prairie, and of which he was to write in 1908: The Prairie has a beauty of its own and we should recognize and accentuate this natural beauty, its quiet level. Hence ... sheltering overhangs, low terraces and out reaching walls, sequestering private gardens. The final emergence of the Prairie Style coincided with Wright s theoretical maturity, as manifest in his famous lecture of 1901, The Art and Craft of the Machine , which was first delivered, appropriately enough, at Jane Addams s Hull House Settlement in Chicago. Taking as his point of departure his youthful despair on reading Victor Hugo s Notre Dame de Paris (1832), in which the author had concluded that printing would eventually eliminate architecture, Wright countered that the machine could be intelligently used, in accordance with its own laws, as an agent for abstraction and purification - processes by which architecture may be redeemed from the ravages of \r",{"entities":[]}],["industrialization. He led his audience to contemplate the awe-inspiring panorama of Chicago as a giant machine, and concluded with the exhortation that this was the thing into which the forces of Art are to breathe the thrill of ideality! A SOUL! From the early 1890s on, the sculptor Richard Bock served as the iconographer of this soul , that is to say as the image-maker of Wright s Prairie Style. Bock s early work, in its nature symbolism, was close to the European Secession Style and complemented the residual Sullivanesque aspects in Wright s work. After 1900, however, under Wright s influence, Bock s sculpture became increasingly abstract, as is evident from the Muse that he created for Wright s Dana House of 1902 [37]. This figure, situated in the entrance hall, was depicted as assembling the abstract elements of an exotic machine culture, piece by piece. 37 Bock, Muse for Wright s Dana House, Springfield, Illinois, 1902. Wright s Prairie Style crystallized finally in the house plans designed for the Ladies Home Journal in 1900 and 1901. Its elements were now established: an open ground plan contained within a horizontal format comprising low- pitched roofs and low bounding walls - the low profile being integrated deliberately into the site, in strong contrast to the vertical chimneys and internal double-height volumes. Yet Wright is still hesitant about the profile at this point, oscillating between the Richardsonian density of his Heurtley House of 1902 and the lightweight Japanese framing of his Hickox House, completed at Kankakee, Illinois, two years before. This split between a monolithic versus an articulate expression resolved itself when Wright started to work for the entrepreneurial Martin family in Buffalo. The Larkin \r",{"entities":[]}],["Building and the Martin House [38], both built in 1904 for Darwin D. Martin, owner of the Larkin Mail Order Co., represent the emergence of Wright s mature style. They were followed at once by Wright s first visit to Japan in 1905 and by the realization of his first concrete building, the Unity Temple at Oak Park, Illinois, in 1906. By now the Classical base, overlaid with the exotic, had been transformed into a style that was Wright s own, a unique manner soon to be made available in Europe through the portfolios of his work issued by Wasmuth in Berlin in 1910 and 1911. 38 Wright, Martin House, Buffalo, 1904. The masterpieces of 1904-06, a house, a church and an office building, all display essentially the same architectural system. The Martin House is the first work by Wright to be consistently based on a modulated tartan plan form. Similar gridded articulations of support and void occur in the main volumes of the Unity Temple and the Larkin Building, although where the church is centralized about two axes the office building is structured around one. Both these public buildings comprise a single internal space, top-lit and surrounded by galleries on all four sides served by stairways at each of the four corners [39, 40]. The elevations of the church are effectively the same on all sides, symbolizing unity , whereas those of the Larkin Building differ on the longer and shorter sides. Apart from being monumental variations of the same architectural parti, both buildings pioneered ingenious systems of environmental control. The Unity Temple was equipped with built-in ducted hot-air heating, while the Larkin Building was one of the first air- conditioned office structures, inasmuch as its air was cooled as well as heated. \r",{"entities":[]}],["39 Wright, Unity Temple, Oak Park, Illinois, 1904-06. 40 Wright, Larkin Building, Buffalo, 1904. Glazed central space. In these works Wright, the Unitarian, appeared to imbue his vision of a new life with a universal sense for the sacred, running from the sacrament of the family hearth through to the sacrament of work and to the house of religious assembly. His goal, like that of many of his European contemporaries, was the achievement of a total environment, embracing and affecting the whole of society. This would explain his obsessive exaltation of the hearth as the moral and spiritual centre to be projected, with the aid of well-placed inscriptions, into the more public realms of worship and work. It would also in part account for Wright s disappointment when, having designed the Larkin office furniture, he was not permitted to restyle the telephones. It is this same intent that embellished the main entrance to the building, where employees entered dutifully past a cascade of water falling from a symbolic relief by Bock bearing the paternalistic inscription: Honest labour needs no master, simple justice needs no slaves. The same idealistic spirit is manifest in Wright s disgust at changes made to the Larkin structure during the course of its daily use. They , he wrote bitterly of the management, never hesitated to make sense-less changes ... it was just one of their factory buildings. Despite his artistic patronage, Martin was obviously unable to place restrictions on the organization and management of his offices, and where the home could be preserved in all its purity, the workplace remained vulnerable to the dictates of production. In these fertile years Wright carefully assembled an atelier of technicians and artist-craftsmen to design and realize his vision of a Gesamtkunstwerk, a total work of art . \r",{"entities":[]}],["This team included the engineer Paul Mueller, the landscape architect Wilhelm Miller, the cabinet-maker George Niedecken, the mosaic designer Catherine Ostertag, the sculptors Richard Bock and Alfonso lanelli, and the talented Orlando Giannini, who served as Wright's fabricator of glass and textiles from 1892. By 1905 the syntax of the Prairie Style was firmly established. Its expression, however, constantly oscillated between two poles, the one rambling, asymmetric and picturesque, as exemplified in the Avery Coonley House of 1908, and the other compact, gridded, symmetrical and architectonic, as displayed in the masterly Robie House of 1908-09 [41]. The Hardy House, built in 1905 in Racine, Wisconsin, is the purest formulation that Wright was ever to make of a symmetrical, frontalized house. 41 Wright, Robie House, Chicago, 1908-09. Midway Gardens, built in 1914, was the last concerted work of Wright s design team in Chicago. With the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, it constituted the last attempt by the early Wright to establish his vision as a universal expression. Built in the short time of ninety days by the ever-ingenious Mueller, Midway Gardens was, as Wright put it, a social response to the dance craze . Based on the German beer garden, it was the embodiment of a new social institution, and took the form of a sequence of stepped terraces, focused axially on an orchestra shell at one end and linked by flanking arcades to a galleried restaurant and winter garden complex at the other [42, 43]. It was in many respects Wright s most cogent attempt at a popular culture. As such it afforded full scope to the rhetoric of his Prairie Style, with Bock and lanelli designing figures, finials and reliefs and Giannini providing the glass. Inside there were large reliefs and abstract murals comprising concentric \r",{"entities":[]}],["circular elements, which were reminiscent of Wright s fanciful idea of decorating the gardens with gas-filled coloured balloons moored to the roof. 42, 43 Wright, Midway Gardens, Chicago, 1914. Above, longitudinal section, showing the restaurant and bandshell; befow, general view of the beer gardens in their heyday. Wright's Prairie subculture played itself out as a hermetic style in the building of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo during the years 1916-22. This structure derived in both plan and section from Midway Gardens. The restaurant/winter garden of the Chicago complex reappeared as the auditorium and lobby of the hotel, while the flanking arcades of the gardens were transformed into its residential wings. The internal murals and reliefs also extended Midway themes, while the galleried accessways of the hotel recalled the caf terraces of the Midway layout. Removed from an American context, Wright sought affinities with the local masonry tradition by employing a battered and castellated profile, executed in brick and dressed in Oya stone. Internally this lava stone was modelled so as to allude to Pre-Columbian profiles, as had been done with the blockwork of Midway Gardens. Such exotic references were to become a theatrical formula in Wright s Hollywood houses of the 1920s. In the Imperial Hotel they amounted to a petrification of his New World culture. As it happened, the Imperial Hotel was to be valued as much for its structural ingenuity as for its architecture, much of the credit for its miraculous survival amid the ruins of the 1922 Tokyo earthquake disaster going to the engineer, Mueller. Nevertheless, it was fitting that this final work in the first phase of Wright s brilliant career should be praised by Sullivan, who just before his death in 1924 wrote \r",{"entities":[]}],["in mystical terms of its survival: it stands today, uninjured, because it was thought-built so to stand. It was not an imposition upon the Japanese, but a free will contribution to the finest elements in their culture. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Chapter 4 Structural Rationalism and the Influence of Viollet-le- Duc: Gaudi, Horta, Guimard and Berlage 1880-1910 In architecture, there are two necessary ways of being true. lt must be true according to the programme and true according to the methods of construction. To be true according to the programme is to fulfil exactly and simply the conditions imposed by need; to be true according to the methods of construction, is to employ the materials according to their qualities and properties ... purely artistic questions of symmetry and apparent form are only secondary conditions in the presence of our dominant principles. Eug ne Viollet-le-Duc Entretiens sur I architecture, 1863-721 For the great French architectural theorist Eug ne Viollet-le- Duc these principles, first outlined in his lectures at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in 1853, clearly precluded the architectural tradition of French Classical Rationalism. In place of an abstract international style, Viollet-le-Duc advocated a return to regional building. His illustrations to \r",{"entities":[]}],["the Entretiens, which in certain aspects anticipated Art Nouveau, ostensibly indicated the kind of architecture that would evolve from his principles of Structural Rationalism. To the envy of Ruskin, Viollet-le-Duc provided more than a moral argument. He proffered not only models but also a method which would theoretically free architecture from the eclectic irrelevancies of historicism. In this way, his Entretiens came to serve as an inspiration to the avant garde of the last quarter of the 19th century, his method penetrating to those European countries where French cultural influence was strong but the tradition of Classicism was weak. Eventually his ideas spread even to England, where they influenced men such as Sir George Gilbert Scott, Alfred Waterhouse and even Norman Shaw. Outside France his thesis, in particular its implicit cultural nationalism, had its most pronounced impact on the works of the Catalan Antoni Gaudi, the Belgian Victor Horta and the Dutch architect Hendrik Petrus Berlage. The writings of Viollet-le-Duc, Ruskin and Richard Wagner were all part of Gaudi s adopted cultural background. Aside from these extra-Mediterranean influences, his achievement seems to have sprung from two rather antithetical impulses, the desire to revive indigenous architecture and the compulsion to create totally new forms of expression. In this, of course, save for his unusual powers of fantasy, Gaudi was hardly unique. This antithesis, latent in the whole of the Arts and Crafts movement, was reflected in the Irish Celtic literary revival which exercised such a strong influence on the Glasgow School in the 1890s. A comparable Catalan revival had arisen in Barcelona as early as the 1860s, when Madrid asserted its sovereignty over Catalonia by prohibiting the use of the Catalan language. First confined to sociopolitical reform, the revival soon sued for Catalan independence and, although such a status was never granted, the claim to autonomy re-emerged as a powerful factor in the Spanish Civil War and is alive again \r",{"entities":[]}],["today. In the second half of the 19th century the Church supported Catalan claims to sovereignty and social reform, so that Gaudi was free from any conflict between his faith and his political allegiances. Both Gaudi and his patron, the textile manufacturer and shipping magnate Eusebio GUell Bacigalupi, grew to their maturity under the influence of the Catalan separatist movement. Although this movement had its conservative aspects, it nonetheless supported various programmes for social reform, which were largely the work of the Catalan intelligentsia. Gaudi had in fact been subject to socialist ideas before his meeting with GUell in 1882. Immediately after his graduation he had been involved with the Matar Workers Co-operative, who commissioned him to design a workers settlement comprising houses, a community structure and a workshop, of which only the last was built, in 1878. Soon after this, Gaudi began to work for the bourgeoisie, building the exotic Casa Vicens in a quasi-Moorish style in 1878. This house, like most of Gaudi s work, testified to the influence of Viollet-le-Duc, in particular the latter s L Art russe (1870), where the constituent elements of a national style were seen as being contingent on the principles of Structural Rationalism. In the Casa Vicens, Gaudi first formulated the essence of his style, which while Gothic in structural principle was Mediterranean, not to say Islamic, in much of its inspiration. As Ary Leblond wrote in 1910, Gaudi sought a Gothic which was full of sunlight, structurally related to the great Catalan cathedrals, employing colour as both the Greeks and the Moors did, logical for Spain; a Gothic, half maritime, half continental, enlivened by Pantheistic richness . The result in the Casa Vicens was a Mud jar pastiche planned around a conservatory, which in its banded brick, glazed tiles and decorative ironwork was more exuberant than any house of comparable date (compare Shaw s Pierrepoint, at Frensham in Surrey, of \r",{"entities":[]}],["1876). Yet the structure transcended its exotic expression; for this was the first occasion on which Gaudi used the traditional Catalan or Roussillon vault, in which archlike forms are achieved through corbelling out laminated layers of tiles. This vault became a key feature of his style, appearing in its most delicate form in the thin shell structure of his Sagrada Familia School, Barcelona, of 1909. The initial achievements of Gaudi s career are inseparable from the various works that he and his colleague, Francesc Berenguer, designed for Eusebio GUell. Count Guell was a progressive, and his house in Barcelona, the Palau Giell [45], which Gaudi designed for him in 1888, became a Mecca for the intelligentsia of the 1890s. As the Casa Vicens had been built around a conservatory, so the Palau Guell was built around a music room, an organ loft and chapel. This composite space echoed the form of the typical Islamic court and ran through the entire upper section of the house. Prominent among Guell s enthusiasms were Ruskin and Wagner, and Gaudi seems to have been as much affected by the theories of the one as by the music-dramas of the other. At any event Ruskin s reputation was at its height at the turn of the century, and his dictum, so compatible with Wagner, that the architect who was not a sculptor or a painter was nothing but a framemaker on a large scale would clearly have appealed to Gaudi. For GUuell the transformation of society at large was to be effected through the garden city. To this end in 1891 he commissioned Gaudi and Berenguer to design a workers community for his textile plant at Santa Coloma de Cervelld, later known as the Colonia GUell. This was to be followed by a commission in 1900 for a middle-class suburb, the Park GUell, situated on the Montafia Pelada overlooking Barcelona, a project eventually realized without its perimeter of houses between 1903 and 1914. In the meantime Berenguer continued with the sporadic \r",{"entities":[]}],["development of the Colonia Guell, until Gaudi succeeded him there in 1908, to complete the work on the chapel. By then Gaudi s career as an ecclesiastical architect had already begun, since he had taken over the building of the Sagrada Familia Church [44] in Barcelona from Juan Martorell in 1906. 44 Gaudi, three progressive stages of the Sagrada Familia Church, Barcelona (left to right, 1898, 1915, 1918) and (far right) Viollet-le-Duc, plan for a cathedral, from his L Art russe, 1870. 45 Gaudi, Palau Guell, Barcelona, 1888. Gaudi s Park GUell emerged as the uninhibited crystallization of his ecstatic vision. For all that the park commanded a spectacular view, the only buildings to be completed there were the gatehouse, the grand stairway leading to the covered market above and Gaudi's own house. The irregularly shaped undulating vault of the market was carried on sixty-nine grotesque Doric columns, while its roof, bounded by a continuous serpentine bench, was intended to function as an arena or open-air stage. This exotic, mosaic-faced perimeter terminated in an esplanade, which in turn merged into the naturalistic random rubble construction of the rest of the park. The park itself was structured by serpentine pathways which, where necessary, were supported on vaulted buttresses, shaped so as to suggest petrified tree trunks. The Park GUell is the first of Gaudi s works to evoke directly, through the undulating profile of its arena, the obsessive image of his life - the famous mountain near Barcelona known as Montserrat. According to the medieval legend, celebrated by Wagner in Parsifal, the Holy Grail was concealed in the castle of Montsalvat, a site later identified \r",{"entities":[]}],["with Montserrat and its monastery, housing the patron saint of Catalonia. Gaudi, who first worked for the monastery in 1866, remained haunted by the serrated profile of the mountain for the whole of his life. The peaks and chimneys of the Casa Mila [46] rise out of the rational grid of Barcelona as the crown of an undulating cliff face, a cyclopean gesture whose overwhelming sense of weight seems to contradict its free and delicate organization about three irregularly shaped courts. This contradiction finds its parallel in the perverse suppression of the building s steel structure behind massive stone facing. As in the Park GUell, the articulation of the structure has been sacrificed to the evocation of some primal force. Nothing could have been further from Viollet-le-Duc, for neither the fabric nor its mode of assembly was explicitly rendered. Instead, huge blocks were laboriously worked so as to suggest a rock face eroded by time. A similar cosmic reference seems to be intended in the iron balconies, wrought by the Gaudi atelier in such a way as to suggest petrified strands of storm-tossed seaweed. Departing from the principles of Viollet-le-Duc, Gaudi finally transformed his raw material into an assembly of powerful images, whose emotive force recalls the operatic genre of Wagner. Seen in retrospect, the Casa Mila seems to anticipate something of the ethos of the Expressionism that was soon to emerge in Central Europe. In 1910, its symbolic solemnity served to isolate Gaudi, not only from the tradition of Structural Rationalism, but also from the lighter aspects of Symbolism, those flutters of farewells in space that constitute the general tenor of Catalan Modernismo . 46 Gaudi, Casa Mila, Barcelona, 1906-10. The situation in Brussels at the end of the century was similar in many respects to that in Barcelona. In the Flemish \r",{"entities":[]}],["capital a comparable accumulation of industrial wealth was paralleled by an equally obsessive preoccupation with national identity, although in Belgium the wealth was more evenly distributed and the nationalism mitigated by actual independence. All the same, Belgian architects were quite as anxious as the Catalans for the evolution of a truly modern but nonetheless national style. The architectural avant garde of the 1870s accused the Beaux-Arts architect Joseph Poelaert of cultural mendacity for his Neo-Classical Palais de Justice, completed in 1883: not only was it Piranesian and megalomaniacal, but it evoked a past which was international and hence by definition un-Flemish. As far as they were concerned, the model for a new native architecture could be found in the local 16th-century brick traditions, in which the principles of Viollet-le-Duc could flourish. One year after the publication of Entretiens, the newly formed Soci t Centrale d Architecture de Belgique started to campaign vigorously in their magazine L Emulation for a new national style. The issue of 1872 declared: We are called to create something which is our own, something to which we can give a new name. We are called upon to invent a style. E. Allard, the major theorist of L Emulation, later wrote: We must try first and foremost to create Belgian artists - we must free ourselves from foreign influences. Throughout the 1870s L Emulation continued to propagate the principles of a hypothetical style that was more constrained in its Structural Rationalism than that adopted by Gaudi. Nothing is beautiful in architecture unless true. Shun painted plaster and stucco. Architecture is drifting towards decadence; towards a veritable cacophony. Despite these exhortations, a convincing style took its time to materialize, and nothing of consequence was achieved in Belgium until 1892, when Victor Horta began his mature career with the realization of the H tel Tassel in \r",{"entities":[]}],["Brussels [47]. In this narrow-fronted, three-storey town house of traditional terrace format, Horta went beyond the achievement of his early career to become one of the first architects to make an extensive use of iron in domestic architecture. He treated iron as though it were an organic filament insinuated into the fabric to subvert the inertia of stone. Other than the works of Eiffel and Contamin, which he would have seen at the Paris Exhibition of 1889, the most influential image behind Horta s peculiar strapwork style was the contemporary graphic work of the Dutch-Indonesian artist Jan Toorop. This connection underlines the importance of painting in the Belgian Art Nouveau. Toorop was a member of that influential Post-Impressionist group, Les XX, whose later re-formation as La Libre Esth tique was to play a key role in disseminating the aims and principles of the English Arts and Crafts movement. 47 Horta, H tel Tassel, Brussels, 1892. In the open planning of the H tel Tassel, Horta exploded the 18th-century Parisian hd te/ formula. As the octagonal vestibule on the ground floor rose upwards through a half- level towards the garden, it expanded laterally into an adjacent foyer space covered by an iron superstructure. The free-standing columns of this space, embellished with iron tendrils, echo similar serpentine forms throughout the rest of the metalwork. From the balustrades to the light fittings the same aesthetic is dominant, a linear exuberance that is delicately echoed in the mosaic floor and wall finishes and in the coloured glass panels of the door to the salon. Yet for all this florid profusion the main volumes are still tempered by the use of Rococo mouldings, which serve to relate the more exotic elements to the received tradition of Louis Quinze. A similar balance is achieved on the exterior, where the ductile elements of the inner armature find their \r",{"entities":[]}],["discreet expression. In an otherwise Classical facade, the stone quoins of an iron bay window are wrought in such a way as to imply the thrust of the inner metallic structure. Over the next decade Horta continued this dialogue between the tensility of iron and the massiveness of stone in a number of other town houses in Brussels, including residences for the chemist Solvay and the industrialist Van Eetvelde and his own house and studio in the Rue Am ricaine, all built before 1900. All were partial elaborations of the H tel Tassel syntax, yet none, save the Hotel Solvay, equalled its simplicity and impressiveness. The Maison du Peuple [48], built for the Belgian Workers Socialist Party in 1897-1900, is the most original work of Horta s career and the only one in which he seems to have felt free to pursue the principles of Viollet-le-Duc to their logical conclusion. Here a native brick and stone vernacular was brilliantly exploited to create an architecture of revealed construction - brickwork being consistently modulated and moulded to receive stone, and stone being dressed to receive iron and glass. While externally this tectonic was comprised by the elevational expression of a complex programme and by the displacement of a concave plan-form over a sloping site, internally it achieved a dramatic and highly fluid expression through the exposed steel framework of all the major volumes, the offices, meeting rooms, lecture theatre and cafeteria. This consistent but strangely unresolved Neo-Gothic assembly of masonry, iron and glass was Horta s most influential achievement and one which he was not to surpass in his more resolved and last essay in this idiom, his Innovation department store, built in Brussels in 1901. 48 Horta, Maison du Peuple, Brussels, 1897-1900. Detail of facade. \r",{"entities":[]}],["In France, the line of succession linking Viollet-le-Duc to Hector Guimard passes through Guimard s master Anatole de Baudot, who had been a pupil of both Viollet-le-Duc and Labrouste. In 1894 de Baudot had designed, in association with the engineer Paul Cottancin, the church of St-Jean-de- Montmartre in Paris, a structure of reinforced brickwork and ciment arm that was surely the most profound essay in Structural Rationalism to date. Thus Guimard, in his early Parisian works, reveals his debt to both de Baudot and Viollet-le-Duc, particularly in his Ecole du Sacr Coeur and his Maison Carpeaux in the Boulevard Exelmans, both completed by 1895. While the former, a small school building with V-supports to the upper floor, was almost a direct realization of the famous illustration to Entretiens, the latter, a bourgeois town house, displayed the same tendencies towards a vestigial Classicism that we find in the works of Horta. In a letter to L.-C. Boileau in 1898, Guimard openly acknowledged his debt to Viollet-le-Duc: Decoratively, my principles are perhaps new but they derive from those already in use with the Greeks ... | have only applied the theories of Viollet-le-Duc without being fascinated by the Middle Ages. Yet Guimard was concerned to achieve that native style prescribed by the French theorist as conforming to usage, climate and national spirit and to the progress which has been made in science and practical knowledge . Thus we find him writing in 1903: A style of architecture, in order to be true, must be the product of the soil where it exists and of the period which needs it. The principles of the Middle Ages and those of the 19th century, added to my doctrine, should supply us with a foundation for a French Renaissance and an entirely new style. Let the Belgians, the Germans and the English evolve for themselves a national art and assuredly in so doing they will perform a true, sound and useful work.2 \r",{"entities":[]}],["We may assume that what Guimard, like Gaudi and Horta, had in mind was the evolution of the constituent elements of a national style as advocated by Viollet-le-Duc. Yet by the turn of the century there were at least three versions of Guimard s own style: a loose, rustic, mixed- media expression, as found in the country chalets that he built between 1899 and 1908, of which his Castel Henriette of 1900 is typical; an urban style of precisely assembled brick and dramatically sculptured stonework such as we find in his own house in the Avenue Mozart, Paris, of 1910; and finally a spidery ferrovitreous manner which was mass- produced soon after 1899, when he was awarded the commission for the Paris M tro stations. The entrances were made up of interchangeable standard iron pieces, cast in the form of naturalistic elements and framing enamelled steel and glass. Paradoxically, they were closer to the linear expressiveness of Horta than to the moral rigour of de Baudot; and Guimard even treated the typography and illumination of these structures as the sinuous continuation of their form. Thereafter, over the next four years, these apparently natural emanations from a wondrous subterranean world erupted over the streets of Paris, to make Guimard notorious as the creator of the Style M tro [49]. 49 Guimard, iron and glass M tro entrance, Paris, 1899-1904. Side and front elevations. This well-earned notoriety has unfortunately helped to eclipse the one short-lived masterpiece of Guimard s whole career, his Humbert de Romans concert hall [50], completed in Paris in 1901 and demolished in 1905. Like Horta s Maison du Peuple, this surely has to be regarded as one of the major achievements of Structural Rationalism. Fernand Mazade s text of 1902 is still capable of evoking the power \r",{"entities":[]}],["of an interior that, save for a few faded photographs, is entirely lost: 50 Guimard, Humbert de Romans concert hall, Paris, 1901.

The framework is of steel, but the metal is covered with mahogany ... the result is the most elaborate roof ever conceived by a French architect.? Throughout the two decades that spanned the turn of the century, there remained quietly in the background the Dutch architect Hendrik Petrus Berlage, who contrived to practise in a consistent manner until his death in 1934. Unlike Horta, Berlage did not allow his principles to become compromised by the acquired, alien tastes of an arriviste middle class. In Holland, in any case, the middle class was fully integrated into the general society, social co-operation being second nature in a country that was constantly threatened with inundation. In such a stable context Berlage enjoyed almost fifty years of uninterrupted practice, over a period that due to Dutch neutrality was not even disturbed by the hostilities of the First World War. Berlage received his professional education at the Eidgendssische Technische Hochschule, Zurich, in the late 1870s. There he studied under the immediate followers of Gottfried Semper, from whom he would have received an extremely rational and typological education. On his return to Amsterdam in 1881 he began to associate with PJ.H. Cuijpers, nearly thirty years his senior, who was already a disciple and correspondent of Viollet-le-Duc. In accordance with the principles of Structural Rationalism, Cuijpers sought \r",{"entities":[]}],["to rationalize his own eclecticism in an effort to evolve a new national style, an attempt which culminated in his Neo- Flemish Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, of 1885. This work strongly influenced Berlage s entry for the Amsterdam Exchange competition of 1883, which he designed in association with Theodorus Sanders in a similar turreted and gabled manner. Twelve years later Berlage received the commission for the Exchange, despite the fact that he had only been awarded fourth place in the competition. At once he began to rework the design after an arched brick syntax that he had developed in the interim, first in a villa built at Groningen in 1894, and then in an office building erected in The Hague in the following year. These crenellated, Neo- Romanesque brick structures, influenced without doubt by Richardson s work in the United States, were vehicles for an architecture of explicit construction, a fact that was most evident in the brick-vaulted stair complex of the office building. Yet for all the profundity of these early essays (reminiscent in their structural probity of the rigour of de Baudot) the final formulation of the Berlage idiom was to depend on the realization of the Exchange. The four versions of the Exchange [51, 52] that followed the initial project represent different stages in an arduous process of simplification. In this development Berlage seems to have been guided by a complex of theoretical ideas, some drawn from Viollet-le-Duc, some from Semper and some from his colleague Jan Hessel de Groot, who was the originator of the Amsterdam school of mathematical aesthetics. After the Exchange was opened in 1903, Berlage began to publish his own synthesis of these ideas in a series of theoretical studies, first in his Gedanken uber den Stil in der Baukunst ( Thoughts on Style in Architecture ) of 1905 and then in his Grundlagen und Entwicklung der Architektur ( Principles and Evolution of Architecture ) of 1908. As Reyner Banham has observed, the salient principles \r",{"entities":[]}],["stressed in these writings were the primacy of space, the importance of walls as creators of form and the need for systematic proportion . The distillation of the Exchange into its final form takes on a richer significance once we become aware of Berlage s views on the essential role of masonry, as first set forth in these texts. Before all else the wall must be shown naked in all its sleek beauty and anything fixed on it must be shunned as an embarrassment. Or again, The art of the master builder lies in this, in the creation of space, not the sketching of facades. A spatial envelope is established by means of walls, whereby a space ... is manifested according to the complexity of the walling. 51, 52 Berlage, Exchange, Amsterdam. Above, second design, 1896-97; be/ow, as built, 1897-1903. In his gradual refinement of the Exchange, Berlage largely retained the original plan of three top-lit rectangular volumes, one for each exchange, housed in an orthogonal matrix of four-storey perimeter walls. The progressive aim was to simplify this parti and its structure into an extremely astringent form, and to this end he gradually reduced the number of gables and turrets and slowly eliminated all lanterns and every trace of banded stonework. At one stage the scheme vaguely resembled Gustav Gull s Landesmuseum, then nearing completion in Zurich, while at the penultimate stage the reduced forms attained their final definition through the superimposition of a diagonal lattice derived from De Groot. After this all subsequent changes were largely confined to the design of the main entrance and its adjacent tower, which were conceived by Berlage as the prime representative elements of both the institution and the city. The load-bearing brick structure of Berlage s Exchange was precisely articulated in accordance with the principles \r",{"entities":[]}],["of Structural Rationalism. Inside, a mosaic frieze or a filigreed lamp are but inflections within large brick volumes where granite abutments, quoins, corbels and cappings consistently mark the points of structural transference and bearing [53]. The same dressed stones which in one instance are corbelled out to receive a steel truss in another articulate the keying of an arch. In this way the ethos and the logic of Viollet-le-Duc pervade the entire fabric as in no other structure of the 19th century. 53 Berlage, Exchange, Amsterdam, 1897-1903. Main hall. To this achievement the philosophical tenor of Berlage s thought added dimensions which went beyond any single structure, first into the immediate urban context and then, by extension, into the body politic at large. His model for an ideal urban society was first outlined in a set of essays published in 1910, of which one in particular, Kunst en Maatschappij ( Art and Society ), most clearly reveals the depth of his socio-political commitment. While socialism for Berlage was a prime article of faith, he nonetheless subscribed to Hermann Muthesius s view that the general level of a culture could only be raised through the production of high-quality, well-designed objects. On the other hand, he remained convinced as to the supreme cultural importance of the city, and deplored the disurbanizing tendency of the English garden city. In 1901 Berlage was given an opportunity to put his urban theory into practice, when the city of Amsterdam commissioned him to prepare a plan for Amsterdam South. For Berlage the street was essentially an outdoor room, the necessary consequence of the housing lining its length. This insistence on enclosure, prefigured in the medieval city, had already been postulated by Berlage in his design for the Exchange. After Alphand and the theories of the German \r",{"entities":[]}],["planner StUbben, the qualities of the street spaces in Amsterdam South vary according to their width and furnishing. The wider streets were furnished with parterres and flanking avenues of trees; the narrower ones were simply lined with trees and paving. At the major intersections centralized spaces were created somewhat after the principles of Stubben and Camillo Sitte (see p. 29). The whole was fed by a modern system of mass transit in the form of the electric tram. In 1915 Berlage totally revised his plan [54] to incorporate avenues of Haussmann-like scale, two of which, converging at a sector known as Amstellaan, were completed with their environs in the early 1920s. Their realization, which unequivocally demonstrated Berlage s concern for the physical continuity of the urban environment, eventually brought him into conflict with the anti-street polemic of the Congr s Internationaux d Architecture Moderne (CIAM), founded in 1928. Yet today the value of his urban achievement seems to be more pertinent than ever, for as Giorgio Grassi has written of Amstellaan: 54 Berlage, revised development plan for Amsterdam South, 1917. it is still the key point on the outskirts of Amsterdam, the point where one finds expressed most clearly the concept of collective living, where the civic value of single parts blends into a unified vision that - being less concerned with the optimum dwellings of certain rationalist experiments - has, in its nuclear concept of housing, well expressed the values of the city. And it has recognized not only the physical need of the dwellers for recreation and rest, but their impulse to form communities and to assume in this act a symbol of life.* \r",{"entities":[]}],["Chapter 5 Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Glasgow School 1896-1916 On the second floor of a modest building in the great industrial smoky town of Glasgow there is a drawing room amazingly white and clean looking.

E.B. Kalas De la Tamise a la Spr e l'essor des industries d art, 19051 By 1905, Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his wife, Margaret Macdonald, had already acquired an international reputation. In England they had achieved notoriety in 1896, when with Herbert McNair and Margaret s sister Frances Macdonald, as the Glasgow Four , they had exhibited their \r",{"entities":[]}],["early works at the London Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society show. Such was the impact of their work on this occasion that, despite official disapproval stemming from Walter Crane, they were appreciatively acclaimed as the Spook School by Gleeson White, editor of The Studio. This sudden success, which had been preceded by an exhibition of their student work at Li ge in 1895, was further confirmed by the acceptance in 1896 of Mackintosh s design for the new Glasgow School of Art, on which work commenced in the following year. The Four had been making furnishings since 1894, so Gleeson White's article in The Studio of 1897 could illustrate, in addition to their graphic work, repouss metal plaques, mirrors, sconces and clocks designed by the Macdonald sisters and cupboards and cabinets designed by McNair and Mackintosh. In all this, the Four had evolved a sensibility which for White was the expression of a quasi- malignant paganism , a style which took its linear manner from the graphic work of William Blake, Aubrey Beardsley and Jan Toorop and its sentiment, part nationalist and part Symbolist, from old Cymric motifs of Celtic origin and from names drawn from the mystical works of Maurice Maeterlinck and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Mackintosh s architecture also had other, somewhat less exotic, origins. Through his education within the mainstream of the Gothic Revival he had naturally acquired an affinity for a solid craft approach to buildings. Like Philip Webb, his architectural precursors were the Gothic Revivalists of the mid-century, men such as Butterfield and Street. This much is evident in his own early ecclesiastical work, such as his Queens Cross Church of Scotland, Glasgow, of 1897. In his secular work, however, he managed to temper the revivalist impulse with a more direct approach, deriving partly from Voysey and partly from the Scottish Baronial tradition (compare James MacLaren s Fortingall cottages of 1892).

Throughout Mackintosh s unique and highly influential development, Lethaby s Architecture, Mysticism and Myth of 1892 was to serve as an important catechism - not only because it revealed the universal metaphysical basis of all architectural symbolism but also because, coming from Lethaby s hand, it formed a bridge between the other- worldliness of Celtic mysticism and the more pragmatic Arts and Crafts approach to the creation of form. With regard to this last, Mackintosh took the traditionalist Ruskinian line and argued that modern materials, such as iron and glass, will never worthily take the place of stone because of this defect, the want of mass . There was to be no want of mass in the Glasgow School of Art, which was built from a local grey granite on three of its sides and from roughcast brickwork on the fourth. Yet, despite Mackintosh s avowed respect for masonry, glass and iron were present in abundance in the extensive studio northlights, which occupy the full length of the main facade. At the same time, from a technical standpoint, Mackintosh - like his American contemporary Frank Lloyd Wright - made every effort to incorporate ingenious and up-to-date systems for environmental control, such as the system of ducted heating and ventilation, built into the school from the beginning. Following the Gothic Revival tradition, Mackintosh designed the main body of the school as a loose-fitting envelope, with the bulk of the studio space being stacked on four floors. This mass, which was effectively read as two storeys throughout the length of the main facade, was complemented by ancillary elements (such as the library and museum) located to the sides, the centre and the rear. The result was an E plan-form [55], with an eccentrically counterbalanced main elevation, in which subtle displacements in both the main entrance and the forecourt \r",{"entities":[]}],["railings simultaneously engendered symmetrical and asymmetrical readings. The return east and west facades, steeply sloping down towards the rear of the site, were left partly blank so as to express the depth of the studio space. With the aid of finials, gables, projecting turrets and incised windows, this inherent asymmetry imparted to the east facade an overtly Gothic Revival character, which would have been repeated on the west had it not been for Mackintosh s radical redesign of the second stage in 1906. This west facade as finally completed represented Mackintosh at the height of his power. In no other work was he able to reach such authority and grandeur. Its three vertical oriels with their gridded fenestration served dramatically to light and express the rich volume of the library [56] and its adjacent upper floor. 55 Mackintosh, Glasgow School of Art, 1896-1909. Axonometric view and ground plan. 56 Mackintosh, Glasgow School of Art, Library, 1905-09. Built in two stages, the art school was a record of Mackintosh s stylistic development from 1896 to 1909. The difference between the Voyseyesque entry hall and stair of the first stage and the double-height library of the final stage, patently influenced by Norman Shaw, reflected the full range of his development by that date. In a matter of a few years he had fully crystallized that sinuous architectural syntax which he had first used on a grand scale in the design of the Willow Tea Rooms, Glasgow, in 1904. In contrast to those white and willowy interiors, the art school library was austere and geometrical, and executed in dark wood throughout. There was almost a Japanese quality about its structural articulation. It must be seen as a \r",{"entities":[]}],["transitional work, lying somewhere between Mackintosh s Art Nouveau period and the later, modern, almost Art Deco manner that characterizes his final work for W.J. Bassett- Lowke. The brief and brilliant, violet and silver period of organic ornamentation set against plain white surfaces, commonly regarded as the touchstone of the Mackintosh style and eulogized as such by Kalas in 1905, came to its maturity at the turn of the century. It was already developed in full in the furniture and d cor of Mackintosh s Glasgow apartment, designed in 1900. It was further elaborated in the Scottish section of the Viennese Secession Exhibition of the same year and in the music salon built for Fritz Warndorfer in Vienna in 1902. As a fully integrated aesthetic, both internally and externally, it reached its apotheosis in the Willow Tea Rooms, completed two years after the Warndorfer salon. Externally, the restrained yet moulded white facade of the Willow Tea Rooms was of the same genre as Mackintosh s Voysey-like house projects of the turn of the century or the two quasi-Baronial roughcast houses that he realized at Kilmacolm and Helensburgh [57] between 1899 and 1903. As Robert Macleod has written, these houses were an expression of conscious gaucheness, and an anti- pretty attitude that had as its chief historical exponents William Butterfield and Philip Webb . Mackintosh s perverse attempt to fuse the ornamental with the gauche was often far from successful, and the houses appear somewhat chaotic and unresolved when compared to the magnificent and highly influential Haus eines Kunst-freundes ( House for an Art-lover ), which Mackintosh designed as his entry to the limited competition organized in Darmstadt by Alexander Koch in 1901. 57 Mackintosh, Hill House, Helensburgh, 1902-03. \r",{"entities":[]}],["The unrealized House for an Art-lover and the Glasgow School of Art represent Mackintosh s essential contribution to the mainstream of 20th-century architecture. In the house he created a work which passed well beyond the constraints of the traditional Voysey model to display a formal plasticity of almost Cubist affinity. The organization of the house around a number of countervailing axes and its division into two major longitudinal masses that appear to be on the point of sliding past each other resulted in a tense but consolidated composition, and the enrichment of its otherwise plain surface with precisely proportioned windows and occasional accents of embossed ornament suggests at once the strong influence it must have exercised over Josef Hoffmann, in particular on his design for the Palais Stoclet, Brussels, of 1905. Nothing in any event could have been further from the yeoman rusticity of the winning design by Baillie Scott. It is ironic that Mackintosh should have begun and ended his career as an independent architect with the Glasgow School of Art, the effective years of his practice being from 1897 to 1909. In 1914 the Mackintoshes moved from Scotland to England, where Mackintosh, suddenly and somewhat inexplicably discouraged as an architect, turned to painting. In 1916, however, he made a brief comeback with the brilliant remodelling of a small terrace house for W.J. Bassett-Lowke, No. 78 Derngate in Northampton. The rich, abstract interiors are equal to any Continental work of comparable date. The plain geometrical bedroom furniture and the striped graphic d cor bonding the twin beds together were well in advance of their time, inasmuch as they anticipated the spatial and plastic devices to be employed by the Continental avant garde after the First World War (De Stijl, Art Deco, etc.). During the war Mackintosh designed clocks, furniture and posters for Bassett-Lowke, but even this patronage was withdrawn after 1918. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Rejected in Scotland and isolated in England, Mackintosh could sustain neither the values of his earlier life nor the creative impulse of his pre-war career. The last decade of his life was one of progressive decline, in which the commissioning in 1925 of the German architect Peter Behrens to design a new house for Bassett-Lowke was but a final blow. It was a tragic fate for one who, as P. Morton Shand has written, was the first British architect since Adam to be a name abroad and the only one that has ever become the rallying point for a Continental school of design . \r",{"entities":[]}],["Chapter 6 The Sacred Spring: Wagner, Olbrich and Hoffmann 1886-1912 A series of edifices expressed the Bildungsideal of Liberal Austria: university, museum, theatre and - grandest of all - the opera. The culture once confined to the palace had poured into the market place, accessible to all, Art ceased to serve only as an expression of aristocratic grandeur or ecclesiastical pomp; it became the ornament, the communal property, of an enlightened citizenry. The splendiferous structures of the Ringstrasse bore massive witness to the fact that Austria had replaced despotism and religion with constitutional politics and secular culture ... the economic growth of Austria created the basis for an increasing number of families to pursue an aristocratic style of life. Wealthy burghers or successful bureaucrats, many of whom acquired patents of nobility like Stifter s Freiherr von Risach [in the novel Der Nachsommer, 1857], established urban or suburban variants of the Rosenhaus, museum-like villas which became centres of a lively social life. Not only gracious manners, but also intellectual substance were cultivated in the salons and soir es of the new lite ... the English Pre-Raphaelites inspired the Art-Nouveau movement (under the name of Secession ) in fin de si cle Austria, but neither their pseudo-medieval spirituality nor their strong social-reformist impulse penetrated to their Austrian disciples. In brief, the Austrian aesthetes were neither as \r",{"entities":[]}],["alienated from their society as their French soul-mates nor as engaged in it as their English ones. They lacked the bitter anti-bourgeois spirit of the first and the warm melioristic thrust of the second. Neither degag nor engag , the Austrian aesthetes were alienated not from their class, but with it from a society that defeated its expectations and rejected its values. Accordingly, Young Austria s Garden of Beauty was a retreat of the beati possidentes, a garden strangely suspended between reality and utopia. It expressed both the self-delight of the aesthetically cultivated and the self-doubt of the socially functionless. Carl Schorske The Transformation of the Garden: Ideal and Society in Austrian Literature, 19701 As Carl Schorske informs us, that which realized itself in 1898 as the sacred spring , through the appearance of the Secessionist magazine Ver Sacrum, had some of its origins at mid-century in Der Nachsommer, the Indian Summer of Adalbert Stifter s idealistic novel of 1857. Otto Wagner s first suburban villa of 1886 may be seen as a realization of the Rosenhaus which Stifter had invented as the ideal location for the cultivation of a private aesthetic life. While Wagner had been born into the same class as Stifter s Freiherr von Risach, he did not attain immediate success. After a distinguished academic career, first at the Vienna Polytechnic and then at the prestigious Bauakademie in Berlin, purveyor of the Schinkel tradition, he practised independently for some fifteen years before receiving his first state commission, the d cor for the Emperor s silver wedding celebrations in 1879. Even this royal recognition did not bring him wide acclaim, so that when in 1886 he built his own Italianate version of the Rosenhaus at Hutteldorf he was still far from being professionally established. Four years later, however, he had not only \r",{"entities":[]}],["arrived artistically but had achieved some worldly success with the building of a small but lavish town house in Vienna for his own use. Wagner's influence as a teacher dates from his succession in 1894 to Karl von Hasenauer as professor at the school of architecture in the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. In 1896, at the age of fifty-four, he published his first theoretical work, Moderne Architektur. This was followed in 1898 by the first publication of the work of his students, given under the title Aus der Wagnerschule. Having been formed in Berlin by one of Schinkel s prime pupils, Wagner s architectural affinities at this time seem to have lain somewhere between the rationalism of the Schinkelschuler and the more rhetorical manner of those last great architects of the Ringstrasse, Gottfried Semper and Karl von Hasenauer, whose State Museums, Burgtheater and Neue Hofburg were under construction in the Ring throughout the last quarter of the century. Wagner's polytechnical education had left him acutely aware of the technical and social realities of his epoch. At the same time, his romantic imagination was drawn towards the radical stirrings of his more talented pupils - to the anti- academic art movement co-founded by his assistant Joseph Maria Olbrich and by his most brilliant pupil, Josef Hoffmann, who had graduated with a Prix de Rome in 1895. These men were not only influenced by the work of the Glasgow Four, then being illustrated in The Studio, but were also under the spell of the exotic vision of two young Viennese painters, Gustav Klimt and Koloman Moser. Under the leadership of Klimt, Olbrich, Hoffmann and Moser banded together in their revolt against the Academy and in 1897, with Wagner s blessing, they founded the Vienna Secession. In the following year Wagner declared his own sympathies for the Secession through the creation of a florid abstraction in faience for the facade of his pseudo-ltalianate Majolica \r",{"entities":[]}],["House in Linke Wienzeile, and in 1899 he scandalized the establishment by becoming a full member of the Secession. In 1898 Olbrich built the Secession building [58], apparently after a sketch by Klimt, who was to remain the prime mover of the revolt. From Klimt came the battered walls, the axiality and especially the laurel motif - with its dedication to Apollo - the last being rendered by Olbrich as a perforated metal dome, suspended between four short pylons and set above planar masses whose severe modelling recalls the work of such British architects as Voysey and Charles Harrison Townsend. A comparable symbol of organic vitality occurred on the cover of the first issue of Ver Sacrum - an ornamental shrub whose vital roots were depicted bursting through its tub into the earth beneath. Such was Olbrich s symbolic point of departure, a conscious return to the fertility of the unconscious, from which, ever subject to the influence of Voysey and Mackintosh and the claims of Klimt s pan-eroticism, he began to evolve a style of his own. 58 Olbrich, Secession building, Vienna, 1898. This evolution took place largely in Darmstadt, where Olbrich had been invited by the Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig in 1899. Later in that year he was joined by six other artists, the sculptors Ludwig Habich and Rudolf Bosselt, the painters Peter Behrens, Paul BUrck and Hans Christiansen, and the architect Patriz Huber. Two years later, this artists colony exhibited its life style and habitat as a total work of art, under the title Ein Dokument deutscher Kunst . The exhibition was opened in May 1901 by a mystical ceremony called Das Zeichen ( The Sign ), which took place on the steps of Olbrich s Ernst Ludwig House. In this ceremony an unknown prophet descended from the golden portal of the building to receive a crystalline form, as a symbol of base \r",{"entities":[]}],["material transformed into art, just as carbon may be changed into the brilliance of a diamond. The Ernst Ludwig House [60], built in 1901, was undoubtedly the most progressive work that Olbrich designed during his nine-year residence in Darmstadt. Consisting of eight studio living spaces, four on each side of a common meeting hall, it was in effect the colony s initial focus, around which a number of individual artists houses were eventually built. With its high, blank, horizontally fenestrated facade, shielding north lights to the rear, and its ornate, recessed circular entrance flanked by giant statues carved by Habich, it was the ultimate monumentalization of themes that Olbrich had broached in the Secession building. Between this early masterpiece and the final classicization of his style in 1908 - the year of his premature death - Olbrich continued his search for a uniquely expressive mode. Throughout the last decade of his life he created works of exceptional originality, culminating in his cryptic and brooding Hochzeitsturm or Wedding Tower, which, with the adjacent exhibition buildings [59], was completed on the MathildenhGhe in Darmstadt for the Hessische Landesausstellung of 1908. With its pyramidal composition the Mathildenh he complex, built on top of a reservoir, was in effect a city crown whose form anticipated the symbolic centre of Bruno Taut s Stadtkrone of 1919. Girded by a series of tiered concrete pergolas, it was drawn by Olbrich as a mountainous labyrinth of dense foliage, whose colour would change with the seasons from green to russet brown. Rising from the high ground like a mystical mountain, it consciously opposed the Edenic serenity of the formal plane-tree garden, or Platanenhain, on which it fronted. 59 Olbrich, Hochzeitsturm and exhibition buildings, Darmstadt, 1908. \r",{"entities":[]}],["60 Olbrich, Ernst Ludwig House, Darmstadt. Das Zeichen , May 1901. Over the whole of Olbrich s career there stood the challenging figure of Peter Behrens, initially a graphist and painter, who had come to Darmstadt from the Munich Secession in 1899. He emerged as an architect and a designer with the building and furnishing of his own house at Darmstadt in 1901. In their rivalry as Gesamtkunstler to the house of Hesse-Darmstadt it was Olbrich rather than Behrens who was to be the brilliant designer of objects, while in their careers outside Darmstadt, as architects, it was Behrens who became the more powerful creator of form. Above all it was he who anticipated their common return to the kind of crypto-Classicism that characterizes the work of Olbrich s final years, his Tietz department store in Dusseldorf and the mansion that he built for the cigar manufacturer Feinhals in Cologne, both completed in 1908. In 1899 Josef Hoffmann began to teach at the applied art school attached to the Austrian Museum for Art and Industry in Vienna (which had been founded, in accordance with Semper s educational programme, some thirty-five years before). A year later, he replaced Olbrich as the designer of the lite Hohe Warte suburb on the outskirts of Vienna, building four villas there between 1901 and 1905. He had succeeded Olbrich as the leading architect to the Secession, and his first work on this site, designed in the manner of English Free Architecture, was for Koloman Moser. By 1902, however, Hoffmann was already beginning to move towards a more planar and Classical mode of expression, based largely on the post-1898 work of Otto Wagner, that is towards a handling of mass and surface which was far removed from the British preoccupation with medieval, yeoman form. By the time of the Vienna Secession Exhibition of 1900, at which Mackintosh s actual work was shown in Austria for \r",{"entities":[]}],["the first time, Hoffmann had already arrived at a furnishing style of refined rectilinear form. This was his initial move away from the obsessive curvilinearity of his Apollo shop in Vienna of the previous year. By 1901 he was preoccupied with the possibilities for abstract form in design. | am particularly interested in the square as such, he wrote, and in the use of black and white as dominant colours, because these clear elements have never appeared in earlier styles. Together with Moser and other Secessionists, he became interested in the craft production of decorative and applied art objects, along the lines of Ashbee s Guild of Handicraft. By 1902, with his setting for Klinger s Beethoven statue, exhibited in the Secession Building, he had arrived at his own abstract style, in which certain contours or proportions are emphasized through the use of projecting beads and clusters of small squares. A year later, in 1903, with the backing of Fritz Warndorfer, the Hoffmann/Moser Wiener Werkstatte was started for the design, production and marketing of high-quality domestic objects. This organization and its output had achieved world fame by the time of its precipitate and inexplicable closure by Hoffmann in 1933. The last issue of Ver Sacrum was published in 1903: with its demise the high period of the Secession was over. In 1904, Hoffmann and Josef August Lux started to edit a new periodical, entitled Hohe Warte, named after the garden suburb. From the outset it was dedicated to the propagation of back to nature garden city values, and later, in less liberal times, it became the garden city platform of the Austrian National Socialist movement. Unlike Hoffmann, Lux was quick to react against its chauvinistic exaggeration of folklorish values, resigning his editorship in protest against its Heimatstil policy as early as 1908. By 1903 Hoffmann had moved closer to the style of his master Wagner, particularly in the design of the Classical and austere Purkersdorf Sanatorium, which was to have \r",{"entities":[]}],["such an influence on Le Corbusier s early development. In 1905 Hoffmann began to work on his masterpiece, the Palais Stoclet, built in Brussels between 1905 and 1910 [61, 62]. As in Perret s Th atre des Champs-Elys es, its reduced Classical decoration paid veiled homage to the Symbolist aesthetic of the Belle Epoque. But, unlike Perret s theatre, the Palais Stoclet is (as Eduard Sekler has observed) essentially atectonic: its thin white marble facing with its metal seams has all the mannered and handcrafted elegance of a Wiener Werkstatte object on a large scale. Of its conscious denial of structure and mass Sekler wrote: 61, 62 Hoffmann, Palais Stoclet, Brussels, 1905-10. A strongly linear element is introduced by these articulated metal bands but it has nothing to do with lines of force , the way linear elements did in the architecture of Victor Horta. At the Stoclet house, we have fines which occur equally along horizontal and vertical edges - they are tectonically neutral. At the corners ... where two or more of these parallel mouldings come together, the effect tends towards a negation of the solidity of the built volumes. A feeling persists as if the walls had not been built in a heavy construction but consisted of large sheets of thin material, joined at the corners with metal bands to protect the edges.2 These bands, which issue from the apex of the stair tower, where four male figures support a Secessionist dome of laurels, are vaguely reminiscent of Wagner s stylized cable mouldings, and serve as they cascade down over the corners to unite the whole building through the continuity of the seam. Wagner s mature style dates from his sixtieth year, with the completion of his Vienna Stadtbahn network in 1901. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Not a trace of his Italianate manner remains in his Die Zeit telegraph office of 1902, or in his Kaiserbad Dam Works of 1906, both of which seem to relate in their engineered elegance and punctilious revetment to the atectonic style of Hoffmann. Yet the dematerialization of the Palais Stoclet seems to have been anticipated by Wagner s own masterwork, his Imperial Post Office Savings Bank built in Vienna in 1904 [63]. Wagner, unlike his Secessionist pupils, always built for the reality of the present rather than for some remote Symbolist utopia that looked towards the aesthetic redemption of man. Thus his Grosstadt plan of 1910, with its hierarchy of neighbourhood units, was projected as a rationally planned and realizable metropolitan future. In all his public work Wagner built with great technical precision for a bureaucratic state which he could only regard as lasting indefinitely. Crowned by an honorific pergola hung with laurel wreaths and flanked by winged Victories whose arms are raised skywards, the Post Office Savings Bank represented the republican benevolence of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the height of its power. 63 Wagner, Post Office Savings Bank, Vienna, 1904. Detail of facade. Like the Palais Stoclet, the Post Office Savings Bank resembles a gargantuan metal box, an effect due in no small measure to the thin polished sheets of white Sterzing marble that are anchored to its facade with aluminium rivets. Its glazed canopy frame, entrance doors, balustrade and parapet rail are also of aluminium, as are the metal furnishings of the banking hall itself [64]. Faced in ceramic, lit from above and resting in its turn on a suspended concrete floor, studded with glass lenses for the illumination of the basement, this hall existed until recently in its original form. Its unadorned, riveted steelwork was formally related \r",{"entities":[]}],["to the industrial lighting standards and the aluminium heating cowls which flanked its perimeter. As Stanford Anderson has observed, 64 Wagner, Post Office Savings Bank, Vienna, 1904. Banking hall. The details of an engineered building are not placed before us in the sachlich manner of nineteenth-century exhibition halls or railway sheds; the concept of an engineered building is revealed to us instead through the building s own modernist symbols of exposed industrial materials, structure and equipment.? By 1911 the classicization of the Secession was complete, and for all his continuing interest in the evolution of an appropriate Hejmatstil, Hoffmann represented Austria at the Rome International Art Exhibition of that year with a pavilion design whose atectonic Classicism anticipated the rhetorical monumentality of Mussolini's New Rome. Equally prophetic was Behrens s representation of Prussia in St Petersburg with an embassy whose solemnity would point towards the official rhetoric of the Third Reich. In such a climate it fell to Wagner to close the Secession as it had begun, with the vigour of his extremely austere yet elegantly proportioned second villa, built in HUtteldorf in 1912. In this lucidly planned house, lyrically decorated by Moser and influenced to an equal degree by the work of Wagner s own pupils and the recently published works of Wright, Wagner was to spend his last six years. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Chapter 7 Antonio Sant Elia and Futurist Architecture 1909-14 We had stayed up all night, my friends and I, under hanging mosque lamps with domes of filigreed brass, domes starred like our spirits, shining like them with the prisoned radiance of electric hearts. For hours we had trampled our atavistic ennuit into rich oriental rugs, arguing up to the last confines of logic and blackening many reams of paper with our frenzied scribbling. An immense pride was buoying us up, because we felt ourselves alone at that hour, alone, awake, and on our feet, like proud beacons or forward sentries against an army of hostile stars glaring down at us from their celestial encampments. Alone with stokers feeding the hellish fires of great ships, alone with the black specters who grope in the red-hot bellies of locomotives launched down their crazy courses, alone with drunkards reeling like wounded birds along the city walls. Suddenly we jumped, hearing the mighty noise of the huge double-decker trams that rumbled by outside, ablaze with colored lights, like villages on holiday suddenly struck and uprooted by the flooding Po and dragged over falls and through gorges to the sea. Then silence deepened. But, as we listened to the old canal muttering its feeble prayers and the creaking bones of sickly palaces above their damp green beards, under the \r",{"entities":[]}],["windows we suddenly heard the famished roar of automobiles.

There s nothing to match the splendour of the sun s red sword, slashing for the first time through our millennial gloom! Filippo Tommaso Marinetti Le Futurisme , Le Figaro, Paris, 20 February 1909! With bombastic rhetoric, Italian Futurism announced its iconoclastic principles to the complacent bourgeoisie of the Belle Epoque. This millennialistic introduction was followed by an account of an impromptu automobile race on the outskirts of Milan ending in an accident which, as Reyner Banham has observed, had all the overtones of being the mimic baptism of a new faith . In a text that pretended to be part autobiographical, Marinetti told of the overturning of his car into a factory ditch: Oh! Maternal ditch, almost full of muddy water! Fair factory drain! | guilped down your nourishing sludge; and | remembered the blessed black breast of my Sudanese nurse. ... When 1 came up - torn, filthy, and stinking - from under the capsized car, | felt the white-hot iron of joy deliciously pass through my heart! ... And so, faces smeared with good factory muck - plastered with metallic waste, with senseless sweat, with celestial soot - we, bruised, our arms in slings, but unafraid, declared our high intentions to all the living of earth.? Then followed the eleven points of the Futurist Manifesto, the first four of which extolled the virtues of temerity, \r",{"entities":[]}],["energy and audacity, while asserting the supreme magnificence of mechanical speed in the now famous passage that declared a racing car to be more beautiful than the Winged Victory of Samothrace. Points five to nine went on to idealize the driver of such a vehicle as being integral with the trajectories of the universe and to celebrate other diverse virtues, such as patriotism and the glorification of war; point ten called for the destruction of academic institutions of every kind; and point eleven itemized the ideal context of a Futurist architecture: We will sing of the stirring of great crowds - workers, pleasure seekers, rioters and the confused sea of colour and sound as revolution sweeps through a modern metropolis. We will sing of the midnight fervour of arsenals and shipyards blazing with electric moons; insatiable stations swallowing the smoking serpents of their trains; factories hung from the clouds by the twisted threads of their smoke; bridges flashing like knives in the sun, giant gymnasts that leap over rivers; adventurous steamers that scent the horizon, deep chested locomotives that paw the ground with their wheels, like stallions harnessed with steel tubing; the easy flight of aircraft, their propellers beating the wind like banners with a sound like the applause of a mighty crowd.? Apart from its debt to the aeropoesia of the nationalist poet Gabriele D Annunzio and a feeling for the simultaneity of Cubist vision, this evocative passage was a straightforward homage to the triumph of industrialization - to the technical and social phenomena of the 19th century as they were then being extended through aviation and electrical power. In the face of Italian Classical, pass ist values, it proclaimed the cultural primacy of a mechanized environment that later informed to an equal degree the architectural aesthetic of Italian Futurism and Russian Constructivism. In 1909, as Joshua Taylor has remarked, \r",{"entities":[]}],["Futurism was an impulse rather than a style, so that for all its explicit opposition to both the Secession and to the classicizing Post-Secession, the form that a Futurist architecture might take was not immediately clear. After all, Futurism had proclaimed itself as being fundamentally opposed to culture, and this polemically negative stance could hardly have excluded architecture. In 1910, with the crucial contribution of the artist Umberto Boccioni, Futurism began to extend its anti- cultural polemic to the domain of plastic art. Boccioni produced two Futurist manifestos on painting in that year, and they were followed in April 1912 by his Manifesto tecnico della scultura futurista (Technical Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture). This later text, like most of the pre-war Futurist writings, gave evidence of a developed architectural sensibility. Thus Boccioni s opening critique, while ostensibly addressing itself to the pomp/er dead end that he wished to confront in contemporary sculpture, could have applied, with just as much pertinence, to the post-1904 work of Secessionist architects such as Joseph Olbrich and Alfred Messel - the former for his Tietz department store in Dusseldorf and the latter for his Wertheim store in Berlin. Boccioni wrote: We find in Germanic countries a ridiculous obsession with a Hellenized Gothic style that is industrialized in Berlin and enervated in Munich. By the same token Boccioni s positive concern to extend the field of the sculptural object to incorporate its immediate milieu had connotations which were intrinsically architectural. This he made explicit as a converse principle in his preface to the catalogue of the first exhibition of Futurist sculpture in 1913: The search for naturalistic form removes sculpture (and painting also) from both its origins and its ultimate end: architecture. In his concern for a non-naturalistic expression, Boccioni developed a plastic aesthetic that was entirely removed \r",{"entities":[]}],["from the concerns of the 1896 Secession. Again in his catalogue preface of 1913 he wrote: In sculpture, therefore, we are not necessarily looking for pure form, but for pure plastic rhythm, not the construction of an object, but the construction of an object s action. We have abolished pyramidal architecture to arrive at spiral architecture ... We must, therefore, raise the concept of the object to that of a plastic whole: object + environment. In this way we shall have the object extended into the rays of light which shine on to it, by uniting atmospherical blocks with elements of a more concrete reality. To achieve this sculptural simultaneity, Boccioni had already recommended, in his sculpture manifesto of 1912, that sculptors henceforth exclude the nude and exalted subject matter and the use of honorific materials such as marble or bronze in favour of heterogeneous media: Transparent planes of glass or celluloid, strips of metal, wire, interior or exterior electric lights can indicate the planes, the tendencies, the tones and half tones of a new reality. Paradoxically, this concept of a spirally structured, non-monumental, mixed-media object to be extended into the immediate environment was to have more influence on Russian Post-Revolutionary Cubo-Futurist Constructivism than on the evolution of Futurist architecture. Nevertheless, Boccioni s sculpture manifesto of 1912 and Marinetti s La Solendeur G om trique et M canique (Geometric and Mechanical Splendour and the Numerical Sensibility) of 1914 jointly gave the intellectual and aesthetic frame of reference within which a Futurist architecture could be postulated. Marinetti wrote: Nothing in the world is more beautiful than a great humming power- station, holding back the hydraulic pressures of a whole mountain range, and the electric power for a whole \r",{"entities":[]}],["landscape, synthesized in control panels bristling with levers and gleaming commutators. This pristine vision of mechanical splendour was fittingly paralleled by the young Italian architect Antonio Sant Elia s power-station designs of the same date. Prior to 1912 Sant Elia was still relatively isolated from the Futurists, and involved with the Italian Secessionist movement. This so-called Stile Floreale was to enjoy an extensive, if brief, national popularity after the resounding success of Raimondo D Aronco s flamboyant pavilion for the Exhibition of Decorative Arts held in Turin in 1902. Thereafter, in Udine, D Aronco continued to follow the lead of Olbrich, while the Milanese architects of the Stile Floreale attempted to integrate their taste for the Neo- Baroque with motifs drawn from the Wagnerschule. In Milan this impulse found its most powerful synthesis in the works of Giuseppe Sommaruga, who seems to have exercised a particular influence over Sant Elia s early development. Many of the characteristic elements of Sant Elia s dinamismo architettonico were surely anticipated in Sommaruga s hotel at Campo de Fiori, while Sommaruga s Faccanoni Mausoleum [65], built at Sarnico in 1907, seems to have served as the point of departure for Sant Elia s design of 1912 for a cemetery at Monza [66]. 65 Sommaruga, Faccanoni Mausoleum, Sarnico, 1907. 66 Sant Elia, design for Monza Cemetery, 1912. In 1905, at the age of seventeen, Sant Elia obtained his diploma as a master builder from a technical school in Como. He then moved to Milan and started to work, first for the Villoresi Canal Company and later for the city of Milan. In 1911 he took architectural courses at the Brera Academy, \r",{"entities":[]}],["and in the same year he designed a small villa above Como for the industrialist Romeo Longatti. By 1912 he was back in Milan, working on a competition entry for the central station. In the same year he collaborated with his friends Ugo Nebbia, Mario Chiattone and others to form the group Nuove Tendenze. At the first exhibition of this group, in 1914, Sant Elia showed his drawings for the Futurist Citta Nuova . At what date he had first made contact with Marinetti and the Futurist circle remains unclear, but he was fully under their influence by the time of writing, with the help of Nebbia, his Messaggio, as a preface to the 1914 exhibition. The Messaggio, signed only by Sant Elia, finally specifies - without once using the word Futurist - the rigorous form that architecture should adopt in the future. The most specific parts of this text, now categorically anti- Secessionist, read: The problem of modern architecture is not a problem of rearranging its lines; not a question of finding new mouldings, new architraves for doors and windows; nor of replacing columns, pilasters and corbels with caryatids, hornets and frogs, etc. ... but to raise the new built structure on a sane plane, gleaning every benefit of science and technology ... establishing new forms, new lines, new reasons for existence solely out of the special conditions of modern living and its projection as aesthetic value in our sensibilities.> The text then turns to contemplate the invigorating large-scale landscape of a new industrial world, paraphrasing the spirit if not the letter of Marinetti s diatribe against Ruskin and the whole of the English Arts and Crafts movement, delivered at the Lyceum Club in London in 1912. Against the pass ism of Morris s Nowhere , Marinetti asserted that \r",{"entities":[]}],["cosmopolitan travel, the spirit of democracy and the decay of religions had made completely useless the vast permanent and ornate buildings that once used to express royal authority, theocracy and mysticism ... the right to strike, equality before the law, the authority of numbers, the usurping power of the mob, the speed of international communications and the habits of hygiene and comfort demand instead large well-ventilated apartment houses, railways of absolute reliability, tunnels, iron bridges, vast high-speed liners, hillside villas open to the breeze and view, immense meeting halls and bathrooms designed for the rapid daily care of the body. In short, he correctly recognized the implacable advent of a new cultural milieu dedicated to a large-scale and highly mobile society: a society to be equipped in detail according to Sant Elia s Messaggio, in which he wrote: Calculations of the resistance of materials, the use of reinforced concrete and iron exclude Architecture as understood in the Classical or traditional sense. Modern structural materials and our scientific concepts absolutely do not lend themselves to the disciplines of historical styles ... We no longer feel ourselves to be the men of the cathedrals and ancient moot halls, but men of the Grand Hotels, railway stations, giant roads, colossal harbours, covered markets, glittering arcades, reconstruction areas and salutary slum clearances. We must invent and rebuild ex novo our modern city like an immense and tumultuous shipyard, active, mobile and everywhere dynamic, and the modern building like a gigantic machine. Lifts must no longer hide away like solitary worms in the stairwells, but the stairs - now useless - must be abolished, and the lifts must swarm up the facades like serpents of glass and iron. The house of cement, iron and glass, without carved or painted ornament, rich only in the inherent beauty of its \r",{"entities":[]}],["lines and modelling, extraordinarily brutish in its mechanical simplicity, as big as need dictates, and not merely as zoning rules permit, must rise from the brink of a tumultuous abyss: the street which, itself, will no longer lie like a doormat at the level of the thresholds but plunge storeys deep into the earth, gathering up the traffic of the metropolis connected for necessary transfers to metal cat- walks and high-speed conveyor belts. This prescription, specifying the form of Sant Elia s casa a gradinata designs of 1914 [67], is of such a dynamic nature as to suggest precedents other than Henri Sauvage s set- back apartment block completed in Rue Vavin, Paris, in 1912. The subtitle of the Nuove Tendenze exhibition, Milano l 'anno due mille , suggests the precedent of Antoine Moilin s book Paris, l an 2000 (1896), a work which Marinetti would have known through his contact with the Parisian poet Gustave Kahn. 67 Sant Elia, casa a gradinata for the Citta Nuova, 1914. Sant Elia s sketches for the Citta Nuova are not entirely consistent with his precepts. Where the Messaggio took a stand against all commemorative architecture and, in consequence, against all static and pyramidal forms, Sant Elia s drawings are replete with such monumental images. In retrospect it seems but a step from Sommaruga s Faccanoni Mausoleum to the soaring, massive and often symmetrical powerhouses and tall blocks that rise like mirages out of the scenographic landscape of the Citta Nuova. In this context, it is fitting and ironic that Sant Elia s memory should have been honoured in a monument to the dead of the First World War, which was erected on the shores of Lake Como in 1933 - to a design by Giuseppe Terragni based on one of Sant Elia s sketches. \r",{"entities":[]}],["The official Manifesto dell architettura futurista (Manifesto of Futurist Architecture), published in July 1914, seems to have had as its prime goal the public recognition of Sant Elia as a Futurist. It amounted to a new version of the Messaggio, edited, to all appearances, by Marinetti and signed by Sant Elia alone. Apart from the interjection of the word Futurist on every possible occasion, this text added little to the original save a number of militant propositions at the end, including the contradictory opposition to any kind of permanence, the assertion that our houses will last less time than we do and that every generation will have to make its own . By now Sant Elia was fully involved in Futurism and in 1915 he signed, with Boccioni, Marinetti, Piatti and Russolo, the Futurist proto-Fascist political manifesto, /talian Pride. |n July of that year he enlisted with other Futurists in the Lombardy Volunteer Cyclist Battalion and entered ona military career that ended with his front-line death in 1916. With the loss of Boccioni two months before (in a riding accident) the generative period of Futurism was brought to an abrupt end, ironically divested of its major talent in part by the first industrialized war. Out of this Futurist holocaust, Marinetti survived to remind his fellow Futurists, such as Balla, Carra, Severini and Russolo, of their duty to lead the post-war generation towards the final fulfilment of Italian nationalism in the triumph of a Fascist state. Typical of the confusion of Futurism in its decline, which undoubtedly paralleled Mussolini s rapprochement with the Vatican, was Marinetti s 1931 Manifesto of Sacred Futurist Art, where he urged that church candlelight must be replaced by powerful electric bulbs of brilliant white and blue light , that for the representations of Hell, Futurist painters must depend on their memories of shell-scarred battlefields , and that only Futurist artists ... can give form to interpenetrated space-time, to the super-rational mysteries of the Catholic dogmas . \r",{"entities":[]}],["That this absurd bravado had been anticipated in the initial manifesto (with its violence reminiscent of Georges Sorel) does not entirely account for the state of decadence to which Futurist culture had descended by 1931. After 1919 it was the revolutionary Russian Constructivists, and not the Italians, who took up the early militant modernism of Marinetti, Boccioni and Sant Elia. Some time was to elapse before the Italian Rationalist movement would begin to respond to the images of the Citta Nuova, and even then it would do so only in a climate that was concerned for the integration of modern values into the Classical traditions of Italian architecture. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Chapter 8 Adolf Loos and the Crisis of Culture 1896-1931 May | lead you to the shores of a mountain lake?

Adolf Loos Architektur, 19101 Adolf Loos, the son of a stonemason, was born in Brno, Moravia, in 1870. Following a technical education at the \r",{"entities":[]}],["Royal and Imperial State Technical College and further studies at the Dresden College of Technology, he left for the United States in 1893 - apparently to visit the World s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Although he seems not to have found work as an architect during his three-year stay in the States, he nonetheless became familiar with the pioneer achievements of the Chicago School and with the theoretical writings of Louis Sullivan, in particular with Sullivan s essay Ornament in Architecture (1892), which patently influenced his own essay Ornament und Verbrechen (Ornament and Crime), published sixteen years later. After his return to Vienna in 1896, Loos began his career by designing interiors and writing articles for the liberal Neue Freie Presse, on a wide variety of topics ranging from clothes to architecture and from manners to music. In 1908 he published Ornament and Crime, in which he elaborated the nature of his quarrel with the artists of the Viennese Secession, an argument that he had already enjoined by 1900 in the form of an anti-Gesamtkunstwerk fable, The Story of a Poor Rich Man . There Loos portrayed the fate of a wealthy businessman who had commissioned a Secessionist architect to design a total house for him, including not only the furnishings but also the clothes of the occupants: Once it happened that he was celebrating his birthday. His wife and children had given him many presents. He liked their choice immensely and enjoyed it all thoroughly. But soon the architect arrived to set things right, and to take all the decisions in difficult questions. He entered the room. The master greeted him with pleasure, for he had much on his mind. But the architect did not see the man s joy. He had discovered something quite different and grew pale. What kind of slippers are these you've got on? he ejaculated painfully. The master of the house looked at his embroidered slippers. Then he breathed in relief This time he felt quite \r",{"entities":[]}],["guiltless. The slippers had been made to the architect's original designs. So he answered in a superior way. But Mr Architect! Have you already forgotten? You yourself designed them! Of course, thundered the architect, but for the bedroom! They completely disrupt the mood here with these two impossible spots of colour. Can t you see that?? The Belgian artist Henry van de Velde is as much the unidentified cultural martinet of this sardonic piece as Joseph Maria Olbrich. For it was he and not Olbrich who designed special clothes for his wife to harmonize with the lines of their house, built at Uccle in 1895 (see p. 105). Nonetheless, Olbrich remained the essential focus of Loos s anti-Secessionist attacks throughout the next decade: he was even cited by name in Ornament and Crime as the progenitor of illegitimate ornament. Where will Olbrich s work be in ten years time? wrote Loos. Modern ornament has no forebears and no descendants, no past and no future. It is joyfully welcomed by uncultivated people to whom the true greatness of our time is a closed book, and after a short time is rejected. Loos s ultimate argument against ornament was not only that it was wasteful in labour and material, but that it invariably entailed a punitive form of craft slavery that could be justified only for those to whom the highest achievements of bourgeois culture were inaccessible - for those craftsmen who could find their aesthetic fulfilment only in the spontaneous creation of ornament. Loos justified the ornamentation of his bespoke footwear - which he would have preferred to be plain - in the following terms: We go to Beethoven or Tristan after the cares of the day. My shoemaker can t. | must not take away his joy as | have nothing to replace it with. But whoever goes to the Ninth Symphony and then sits down to design a wallpaper is either a rogue or a degenerate. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Such challenging ethical and aesthetic pronouncements isolated Loos not only from the Secession and his conservative contemporaries, but also from his true successors, those latter-day purists who even now have yet to comprehend fully the profundity of his insights. By the time of his critical essay Architektur of 1910, Loos had already begun to sense the full force of a modern predicament, which persists to this day. Given, as Loos argued, that the architect from the city was uprooted by definition and hence categorically alienated from the innate agrarian (or alpine) vernacular of his distant forebears, then it followed that he could not compensate for this loss by pretending to inherit the aristocratic culture of Western Classicism. For the urban bourgeoisie - whence he invariably came and whom he naturally served - were, whatever else they might be, patently not aristocrats. That much was already clear to Loos in 1898 when he wrote in Die potemkinsche Stadt, his satire on the Ringstrasse: Whenever | stroll along the Ring, | always feel as if a modern Potemkin had wanted to make somebody believe he had been transported into a city of aristocrats. All that the Italian Renaissance could produce in noble mansions had been plundered in order to conjure up for her Highness the common people a New Vienna which only people ina position to own an entire palace from the cellars to the chimney-pots could inhabit. ... Viennese landlords were delighted with the idea of owning a mansion and the tenants were equally pleased to be able to live in one.? Loos s solution to this dilemma, as posited in Architektur, was to argue that most modern building tasks were appropriate vehicles for bui/ding rather than architecture: Only a very small part of architecture belongs to art: the tomb and the monument. Everything else, everything that \r",{"entities":[]}],["serves a purpose, should be excluded from the realms of art. At the same time Loos considered that all culture depended on a certain continuity with the past, above all, on a consensus as to a typification. He could not accept the romantic notion of the highly gifted individual transcending the historical limits of his own epoch. Instead of self- conscious ornamental design, Loos favoured understated dress, anonymous furniture and efficient plumbing of the Anglo-Saxon middle class. Naturally in this respect he had America in mind rather than England. In this he anticipated Le Corbusier's notion of the objet-type, the refined, normative object, spontaneously produced by the craft- based industries of the society. To this end, objects of Anglo- Saxon affinity, such as clothing, sportswear and personal accessories, appeared as advertisements in Loos s short- lived periodical Das Andere ( The Other ) of 1903 [69], which was significantly subtitled A Journal for the Introduction of Western Civilization into Austria . Despite all his Anglophilia, the vernacular of the English Arts and Crafts movement (as documented in Hermann Muthesius s book Das Englische Haus of 1904) presented Loos with a problem: where was one to draw a line between such architecture, however sensible and convenient, and the self-conscious, craft-based, hermetic fantasies of the Secession? Since for Loos the last Western architect of stature had been Schinkel, his self-imposed predicament seems to have been how to combine the informal comfort of the Anglo-Saxon interior with the asperities of Classical form. Until 1910, Loos s practice was largely confined to the conversion of existing interiors. His best works of this period were the luxury shops that he designed in Vienna around the turn of the century, and his famous Karntner or American Bar of 1907. Externally these works, designed for the purveyors of Anglocentric civilization, were finished in \r",{"entities":[]}],["elegant, unobtrusive materials, while internally the style varied from the Japanese ambience of his first interior for Goldman & Salatsch [68] in the Graben (1898) to the classicized club-room elegance of the Karntner Bar. 68 A 1911 cartoonist s comment on Loos s Goldman and Salatsch facade (1910- 11). The original caption read: Brooding about art, the most modern man walks through the streets. Suddenly he stops transfixed. He has found that for which he has searched so long. 69 Cover of Das Andere, edited by Loos, Vienna, 1903. In Loos s domestic interiors the expression was even more eclectic, reflecting the fundamental split in his work between a comfortable rusticity on the one hand and a severe monumentality on the other. He invariably panelled his walls up to dado or picture-rail level in polished stone or wood; above this they were either left blank or topped with an ornamental pattern or Classical frieze in plaster. (In Ornament and Crime, Loos had admitted the eclectic appropriation of archaeological ornament, while categorically excluding the invention of modern decoration.) Ceilings, where public, were often blank; where private, they were coffered in wood or metal. On other occasions, particularly in dining spaces, they might be relieved by Richardsonian timber beams, which were often of grotesque proportions, as in the Steiner House in Vienna of 1910 [70, 71]. Floors were generally of stone of parquet and always covered with oriental carpets, while fireplace surrounds, frequently of brick, stood out in textured contrast to the highlights invariably provided by vitrines, mirrors, lamps and sundry metalware. As far as possible furniture was always built in. Otherwise it was selected by the client, although where it was movable and the building public, Loos restricted himself to standard Thonet bentwood furniture, as \r",{"entities":[]}],["in his somewhat Wagner-like Caf Museum of 1899. In his essay on the abolition of furniture he wrote: The walls of a building belong to the architect. There he rules at will. And as with walls so with any furniture that is not movable. Of movable pieces he wrote: The wrought-iron bedstead, table and chairs, hassocks and occasional chairs, desks and smoking stands - all items made by our craftsmen in the modern idiom (never by architects); everyone may buy these for himself according to his own taste and inclination. This categorical anti-Gesamtkunstwerk attitude was complemented by Loos s passion for rich materials of which he wrote in the vein of Semper: Rich material and good workmanship should not only be considered as making up for lack of decoration, but as far surpassing it in sumptuousness. 70, 71 Loos, Steiner House, Vienna, 1910. Below, dining room. The Steiner House initiated a series of houses in which Loos gradually evolved his conception of the Raumplan or plan of volumes , a complex system of internal organization that culminated in the split-level houses realized towards the end of his life: the Moller House in Vienna and the Miller House near Prague. By the time of the Steiner House, Loos had already arrived at a highly abstract external idiom - his white unadorned prism, which anticipated by at least eight years the so-called International Style . He began to elaborate his Raump/an concept in his Rufer House, Vienna (1912), where, in contrast to his later houses, the openings are quite freely disposed, following the free disposition of the internal volumes - an elevational counterpoint that anticipated the canonical works of De Stijl. Loos s Raumplan reached its apotheosis in his last domestic works, the Moller and Muller houses of 1928 and 1930. As anticipated in the open stair hall of the Rufer \r",{"entities":[]}],["House, both these works are organized about displacements in the respective levels of their principal floors, elisions that serve not only to create spatial movement but also to differentiate one living area from the next. The typically irregular Gothic Revival plan, documented in Muthesius s Das Englische Haus, clearly inspired Loos s wholly unprecedented development of the Raumpi/an, yet with his Classical predilection for cubic form he could not accept the picturesque massing that was its natural consequence. From this, no doubt, came the tortuous manipulation of the available volume of the prism as though it were just so much raw material from which to create a dynamic composition in section. Such plastic intentions were basically incompatible with an architecture of consistent distinction between structural and non-structural elements, and while Loos strove to maintain such distinctions in his public work, at a domestic level he gave primacy to the sensation of space, rather than to the revelation of architectonic structure. The principles of Viollet-le-Duc were in any event alien to him, since he deliberately contorted plans for the sake of providing an architectural promenade of sensual significance as Le Corbusier was to do. In almost all his domestic work structural junctions are invariably masked by revetment, either with the aim of hiding unresolved conditions or out of a desire to provide an appropriate level of decorum. During his tenure as chief architect to the Housing Department of Vienna, from 1920 to 1922, in the austere aftermath of the war, Loos applied his as yet undeveloped Raumplan to the problem of mass housing. The result was a number of remarkable housing studies, in which his preferred form, the cube, became transformed into a stepped terrace section. In 1920 he designed a brilliant and economical housing scheme, known as the Heuberg Estate [72]. Terrace houses were integrated with greenhouses and allotments, in which the occupants were expected to grow \r",{"entities":[]}],["their own food - a typical urban survival strategy of the inflationary post-war period, which became adopted as general policy in many German housing settlements during the 1920s. 72 Loos, Heuberg Estate, Vienna, 1920, showing conservatories and allotments. It is one of the paradoxes of Loos s career that he, the bourgeois architect and man of taste, should create his most sensitive larger projects in the service of the underprivileged. His disillusioned resignation as housing architect in 1922 and his subsequent migration to Paris, at the invitation of the Dadaist poet Tristan Tzara - for whom he was to design a house in 1926 - restored him to the cosmopolitan circles of the high bourgeoisie. There he became part of the fashionable world that surrounded the dancer Josephine Baker, for whom he designed a rather ostentatious villa in 1928. Save for Tzara and his old Viennese client, the internationally famous tailor Knize, for whom he had first designed a store in Vienna in 1909, none of his Parisian patrons had either the resources or the faith to realize any of the large-scale projects that he designed during his expatriate years. In 1928 he returned to Vienna, five years before his death, his career virtually at an end. In the final analysis Loos s significance as a pioneer depended not only on his extraordinary insights as a critic of modern culture, but also on his formulation of the Raumplan as an architectural strategy for transcending the contradictory cultural legacy of bourgeois society which, having deprived itself of the vernacular, could not claim in exchange the culture of Classicism. No one was better prepared to receive this hyperconscious sensibility than the post-war Parisian avant garde, in particular the circle editing L Esprit Nouveau, namely the proto-Dadaist poet Paul Derm e and the Purist painters Am d e Ozenfant and \r",{"entities":[]}],["Charles-Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier), who in 1920 reprinted the 1913 French translation of Ornament and Crime. And while (as Reyner Banham has observed) the roots of Purism lay in the abstract classicizing tendencies of Parisian culture, notwithstanding the ready-made sensibility of Marcel Duchamp, there is little reason to doubt that the influence of Loos was decisive in refining the typological programme of Purism: that impulse to synthesize, at every conceivable scale, the type-objects of the modern world. Above all, Loos must now be seen as the first to postulate the problem that Le Corbusier was eventually to resolve with his full development of the free plan. The typological issue posited by Loos was how to combine the propriety of Platonic mass with the convenience of irregular volume. This proposition was never more lyrically stated than in his 1923 project for a villa on the Lido in Venice [73, 74]; and this house was destined to become the type-form for Le Corbusier s canonical Purist villa, his villa at Garches of 1927. 73, 74 Loos, villa project for the Venice Lido, 1923.

Adolf Loos Trotzdem, 1931} The Belgian designer and theorist Henry van de Velde set out on what he called the voje sacr e of architecture in 1894, at the age of thirty-one, when after ten years as a Neo-Impressionist painter he published his famous essay, D blaiement d'art , in the Belgian Nietzschean journal La Soci t nouvelle. This essay, which called for the redeployment of art in the service of the society, was clearly influenced by those Pre-Raphaelite precepts which Van de Velde would have learned through his association with the avant-garde group, Les XX. Since its inception in 1889, this Belgian group of artists had had strong ties with England and in particular with William Morris s prot g Walter Crane. Under Crane s influence, the group turned from its fine art preoccupations to a concern for the design of the environment as a whole. Reorganized under the leadership of Octave Maus, Les XX became the Salon de la Libre Esth tique, whose first exhibition in 1894 featured the work \r",{"entities":[]}],["of the Belgian cabinetmaker Gustave Serrurier-Bovy. Serrurier-Bovy brought back to Belgium an Arts and Crafts sensibility that he had acquired in England during the second half of the 1880s. In 1894 he displayed the exceptional qualities of his unpainted furniture in a suite of strikingly sculptural pieces that recalled that Anglo-Japanese style, developed some twenty years before by Edward Godwin and Christopher Dresser. Van de Velde made his d but as an architect and as a designer in 1895, when he designed and built a house for himself at Uccle near Brussels. This without question was intended to demonstrate the ultimate synthesis of all the arts, for apart from integrating the house with all its furnishings, including the cutlery, Van de Velde attempted to consummate the whole Gesamtkunstwerk through the flowing forms of the dresses that he designed for his wife. The fall, cut and decoration of these clothes [75] already exhibited that energetic serpentine line that was to be Van de Velde s prime contribution to the vocabulary that he inherited from Serrurier-Bovy. Derived from Gauguin, it was used as an expressive device for imparting a more vigorous profile to the formal legacy of the Arts and Crafts. 75 Van de Velde s wife, Maria Sethe, wearing a dress to his design, c. 1898. For Van de Velde the ameliorative thrust of the English Arts and Crafts movement was complemented by the more anarchic but equally reformist visions of Tolstoy and Kropotkin. While he could share with the Pre-Raphaelites their intense antipathy to all architecture after the Gothic, he could not accept their conscious drive towards the medievalization of the present. As a socialist, he was more influenced by the young militants of the Belgian Socialist Party, with whom he had been in contact since the mid- 1880s: Emile Vandervelde, the socialist client of Horta s \r",{"entities":[]}],["Maison du Peuple, and the poet-critic Emile Verhaeren, whose critical study of urbanization, Les Villes tentaculaires, had been published in 1895. Yet in spite of these radical affiliations, Van de Velde still believed in the reform of society through the design of the environment; that is, he still adhered to a sensationalist faith in the primacy of physical form over programmatic content. For him, as for the whole of the Arts and Crafts tradition, the single family house was the prime social vehicle through which the values of the society could be gradually transformed. Ugliness , he held, corrupts not only the eyes but also the heart and mind. In his fight against ugliness, Van de Velde concentrated on the design of every aspect of the domestic environment [76, 77]. He was ill-equipped, either by temperament or training, to think at an urban scale: in his layout for the Hohenhagen garden colony, built at Hagen in Germany for Karl Ernst Osthaus in 1906, he singularly failed to demonstrate how the individual house might be aggregated into larger and more significant social units. And he was no more successful than William Morris in reconciling the contradictions between his socialist commitments and his patronage by the upper middle class. 76 Van de Velde s furniture atelier, Brussels, c. 1897. He is bending over a drawing on the right. 77 Van de Velde, desk for Meier-Graefe, 1896, and Ferdinand Hodler s Symbolist painting Day, c. 1896. From the mid-1890s on, Van de Velde was profoundly influenced by the aesthetic theories of the Viennese art historian Alois Rieg] and the Munich psychologist Theodor Lipps. Where the one stressed the creative primacy of the individual Kunstwollen or will to form , the other postulated \r",{"entities":[]}],["Einfahlung or empathy as the quasi-mystical projection of the creative ego into the art object. These complementary ideas had already been given a more specific context in Nietzsche s essay of 1871, Die Geburt der Trag die aus dem Geiste der Musik, wherein the Apollonian and the Dionysian were seen as the irreducible duality of Hellenic culture, the former aspiring to the typical and freedom within the law and the later to superabundance and pantheistic expression. These loosely related ideas, which vaguely informed Van de Velde s work after 1896, found a certain synthesis in Wilhelm Worringer s Abstraktion und Einfuhlung (Abstraction and Empathy), published in 1908. Van de Velde studied Worringer s text assiduously and found that his own work seemed to combine in a single entity the two antagonistic aspects of Worringer s cultural model - on the one hand the impulse towards the empathetic expression of vital psychic states, and on the other the tendency towards achieving transcendence through abstraction. While Van de Velde strove for an empathetic and vital culture of form, he was nonetheless aware of the innate tendency of all architecture towards abstraction. In this context, his lifelong respect for the Gothic may be regarded as a nostalgia for an architecture in which the immediate vitality of the form-force would come to be transcended by the sublime structural abstraction of the whole. The embodiment of such a force was the mainspring of his own aesthetic, from its initial appearance in the so-called Yachting Style suite of furniture that he designed in 1895 for Samuel Bing s Maison de I| Art Nouveau in Paris to his theoretical formulation in 1902, in Weimar, of the principles of what he called structurally linear ornament . Van de Velde maintained a subtle distinction between ornamentation and ornament, arguing that the former, by virtue of being applied, was unrelated to its object, while the latter, by virtue of being functionally (i.e. structurally) determined, was integrated into it. This definition of \r",{"entities":[]}],["functional ornament was inseparable from the importance that Van de Velde attached to the gestural crafted line, as the necessary anthropomorphic trace of human creation. The line , he wrote in 1902, carries the force and the energy of that which has traced it. For him the quasi-erotic impluses governing the course of a line were to be regarded as a literature without an alphabet. The powerful anti-decorative tendency of this purist view of culture was reinforced in 1903 when Van de Velde returned from a tour of Greece and the Middle East, overwhelmed by the power and the purity of Mycenaean and Assyrian form. From this point on he tried to avoid both the gestural fantasy of the Secession and the rationality of Classicism. He attempted to create pure organic form, such form as could be found, in his opinion, only in the cradle of civilization or in the monumental cryptic gestures of Neolithic man. This no doubt accounts for the telluric forms of the houses that he built in Chemnitz and in Hagen between 1903 and 1906. Yet despite the curious megalithic quality of these works, there remained in all of Van de Velde s work after 1903 a trace of Classicism that was not entirely mediated by his feeling for the archaic. This is most evident in the domestic objects that he designed between 1903 and 1915, pieces that seem to reflect his passionate reaction to the classic, not to say ineffable, qualities that he found in the Parthenon: On the Acropolis the living standing columns teach us that they do not exist, that they do not carry load, or rather that they are interspaced according to and end very different from that for which they were apparently erected. Even where they are still joined by an entablature, they proclaim in evidence that the columns around the Parthenon do not exist, but that between them gigantic perfect vases are poised, containing life, space and sun, sea and mountains, night and the stars.

Van de Velde s Apollonian conversion, so to speak, coincided with the climax of his career at Weimar. After having been consultant to the craft industries of the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar since 1901, he was nominated in 1904 to serve as the professor to the newly created Grand Ducal School of Arts and Crafts. This appointment gave him the commission to design new premises for both the school and the existing Academy of Fine Art - the nucleus that fourteen years later would become the Weimar Bauhaus. Prior to the opening of these buildings in 1908, Van de Velde continued to lecture in Weimar and to give his Kunstseminar for the cultural instruction of trained artisans. Yet this most triumphant moment of his entire career was overshadowed by profound inner doubts, in which he began to question the artist s prerogative to determine the form of objects. In 1905 he wrote: At what point do | have this right to impose on the world a taste and a wish which is so personal. Suddenly | no longer see the ties between my ideal and the world. After Gottfried Semper and Peter Behrens, Van de Velde had always sought to strengthen such socio-cultural ties through the agency of the theatre, conceiving its union of actors and spectators as the highest form of social and spiritual life. Directly influenced by scenographers such as Max Reinhardt and Gordon Craig, he devoted himself to the development of the tripartite stage, first formulated in a project for the Dumont Theatre in Weimar in 1904. He returned to this theme in 1911 in his compromise design for the Th atre des Champs-Elys es, Paris (realized by Auguste Perret in a modified form in 1913), and again in his Cologne Werkbund Exhibition Theatre of 1914 [78]. The highly expressive but short-lived Werkbund Theatre was the apotheosis of all his pre-war work. Erich Mendelsohn wrote \r",{"entities":[]}],["of it: Only Van de Velde, with his theatre, is really searching for new form.

The much admired Werkbund Theatre was to be the last formulation of Van de Velde s form-force aesthetic. Fusing actor with audience and auditorium with landscape, as in the open-air arenas of Neolithic man, it appeared as a unique empathetic expression. Such expression could of course find no place in the modest modular prefabricated house that Van de Velde built for himself after the First World War. The Werkbund dream of a world transformed by gute Form and industrial monopoly had proven just as vain as the reformist hopes of the socially conscious bourgeoisie whose fifty-year-old patronage of the Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau had been brought to an abrupt end by the first industrialized war. One could no longer fantasize about a society transformed through art, industrial design and the theatre, at a time when the provision of minimum shelter was a matter of the greatest urgency. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Chapter 10 Tony Garnier and the Industrial City 1899-1918 The city is imaginary: let us assume that the towns of Rive- de-Gier, St-Etienne, St-Chaumond, Chasse and Givors have conditions similar to those of this town. The site of this study is located in a region of southeast France, and regional materials have been used in its construction. Determining factors in the establishment of a similar city should be the proximity of raw materials, or the existence of a natural force capable of being used for energy, or the convenience of methods of transportation. In our case the determining factor in the location of the city is the force of the tributary river that is the power source; there are also mines in the region, but they could be located further away. The tributary is dammed, a hydroelectric plant distributes power, light, and heat to the factories and to the entire city. The principal factories are situated in the plain at the confluence of the river and its tributary. A mainline railroad passes between the factories and the town, which is located above the factories on a plateau. Higher still are placed the hospitals; they, as well as the city, are sheltered from cold winds, and have their terraces oriented to the south. Each of these main elements (factories, town, hospitals) is isolated so that it can expand. ...

Tony Garnier Preface to Une Cit industrielle, 19171 It would be hard to imagine a more concise statement of the basic economic and technical precepts for the foundation and organization of a modern city. The very lucidity of this outline - the sole theoretical statement of Garnier s career - reflects in its tone and content the fundamentally radical nature of his life and work. Born in Lyons in 1869 and raised in a radical workers quarter, he remained consistently committed to the socialist cause up to his death in 1948. Garnier s education and the commitment of his professional career are both inseparable from the city of Lyons. The radical syndicalism and socialism that Lyons nurtured stemmed from the fact that it was one of the most progressive industrial centres in 19th-century France, with its silk and metallurgical industries well established by the time of Garnier s birth. In addition to its favourable location in the Rh ne-Sa6ne corridor, the growth of Lyons had been stimulated soon after mid-century by one of the first main railway links in France. By the 1880s, with the electrification of its trams and local railway systems, it was well placed to become a main centre for technical and industrial innovation. Photography, cinematography, hydroelectric generation, automobile production and aviation all saw their first beginnings there between 1882 and the turn of the century. The influence of this technical milieu certainly found its reflection in Garnier s project for a Cit Industrielle , first exhibited in 1904, a project which \r",{"entities":[]}],["demonstrated his belief that the cities of the future would have to be based on industry. Other aspects of Lyons culture were also featured in the plans of Garnier s Cit , most notably the French regionalist movement in favour of reviving local culture, which was as a result committed to the broader political policies of federalism and decentralization. Thus Garnier included an old medieval town within the confines of his industrial city. The importance that he attached to such foundations is reflected in his location of the main railway station in close proximity to this regional centre. The municipality of Lyons was also important, even in Garnier s youth, for its progressive approach to urbanization. Its streets had been regularized between 1853 and 1864; after 1880 - as part of a slum clearance programme - the city began to improve its water and sanitation systems; and about 1883 it began to provide a range of welfare facilities, such as schools, workers housing, baths, hospitals and abattoirs. Entering the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, first at Lyons in 1886 and then at Paris in 1889, Garnier came under the influence of Julien Guadet who, as Professor of Theory after 1894, taught not only the precepts of Rational Classicism but also programmatic analysis and the classification of building types. Guadet s E/ ments et th ories de I architecture of 1902 was a programmatic updating of Durand s methods of 1805 for the rational combination of typified architectural forms, and it was this common elemental approach to design that was to inform the careers of Guadet s foremost pupils, Garnier and Auguste Perret. These two men, however, were to have very different careers, for while Garnier, after ten years in Paris, won the Prix de Rome in 1899 and spent another four years at the French Academy in the Villa Medici, Perret left the Beaux-Arts in 1897 after only three years of formal education to work for his father. Thus when the Cit Industrielle was first exhibited, in 1904, \r",{"entities":[]}],["Perret had already made his mark as an architect and a builder with his pioneer reinforced-concrete-frame apartment building in the Rue Franklin. From the time when Garnier was first a /ogiste for the Prix de Rome in 1892, he had been immersed in the increasingly radical climate of Paris, presided over by the figure of Jean Jaur s, who became a socialist deputy in 1893. The Parisian political scene was galvanized after 1897 by the Dreyfus affair, an event which converted Emile Zola into a passionate advocate of radical reform. Out of this came Zola s first utopian socialist novel, F condit , which was serialized in 1899 in the socialist journal L Aurore. Given Garnier s long-standing affiliation with the Soci t des Amis d Emile Zola, it is certain that he would have read these excerpts. In any event, the early sketches for the industrial city that he made in the same year seem to reflect Zola s vision of a new socio-economic order, which the writer was to elaborate in his second utopian socialist novel, Travail (1901). Against great opposition at the Villa Medici, Garnier continued to work on his city project throughout his stay. For the required testimony of academic study he prepared an imaginative and equally unprecedented reconstruction of the Roman hill city of Tusculum. Tusculum and the first version of the Cit Industrielle were jointly exhibited in Paris in 1904, the year when Garnier returned in triumph to Lyons. Over the next thirty-five years he was to work exclusively in and for this city, largely at the command of the progressive mayor, Edouard Herriot, and it was in Lyons, at the beginning of his public career, that Le Corbusier first met him in 1908. Set on a river escarpment, in a mountainous landscape that corresponded generally to that of the Lyons region, Garnier s industrial city of 35,000 inhabitants was not only a regional centre of medium size, sensitively related to its environment, but also an urban organization that \r",{"entities":[]}],["anticipated in its separate zoning the principles of the CIAM Athens Charter of 1933 [79]. It was above all a socialist city, without walls or private property, without church or barracks, without police station or law courts, a city where all the unbuilt surface was public parkland. Within the built area Garnier eventually established a varied and comprehensive housing typology, in accordance with strict standards for the provision of light, ventilation and green Space. These codes and the combinational patterns they generated were inflected by a hierarchy of tree-lined streets of varying widths. At an average height of only two storeys, such an open layout yielded a low density, and Garnier supplemented a 1932 edition of his scheme with residential sectors at a higher density. Integral to the residential quarters were different categories of schools, sited to serve specific districts, while facilities for technical and professional education were located between the residential and industrial sectors. 79 Garnier, Cit Industrielle: schematic plan, 1904-17. Below the hospitals is the administrative/cultural centre, flanked by housing. It has recently been shown that Garnier did not arrive at the concept of his city in isolation, and that among the remarkable young pensionnaires who were his colleagues at the French Academy in Rome must be counted L on Jaussely, whose Prix de Rome entry of 1903, A Metropolitan Square in a Large Democratic State , resembled in many respects the layout, content and ethos of the cultural and administrative centre of Garnier s Cit [80], which was rendered as a space of public appearance where a museum, a library, a theatre, a stadium and a vast public indoor swimming pool or hydroth rapie building are grouped around the axis of an assembly complex [81]. The prime organizing principle of this last, lozenge-shaped structure is \r",{"entities":[]}],["a peristyle of reinforced-concrete columns which enclose a cluster of union meeting rooms and a central circular 3,000- seat assembly hall, flanked on one side by an auditorium seating 1,000 and on the other by two 500-seat amphitheatres set side by side. Ostensibly dedicated to different democratic purposes, from parliamentary debate to conferences, committee work and cinematic display, the various kinds of assembly would have taken place here beneath the rationalistic image of a twenty-four-hour clock and an entablature which bore Courbet-like reliefs and was inscribed with two quotations from Zola s Travail. The first of these texts alluded to the Saint-Simonian programme for achieving international harmony through industrial production and communication, and the second to the ritualistic celebration of a utopian socialist harvest: 80 Garnier, Cit Industrielle: the centre (with lozenge-shaped assembly building) and housing, 1917. 81 Garnier, Cit Industrielle: detail of assembly building, 1904-17. This was the incessant production suitable for epochs of peace, rails and yet more rails, so that all frontiers might be passed over, and so that all peoples, reunited, might form a single people, on an earth entirely furrowed by routes. These were the great steel ships, no longer the abominable ships of war carrying devastation and death, but ships of solidarity and fraternity, exchanging the products of continents, increasing the domestic riches of humanity ten- fold, to that point when tremendous abundance reigned throughout. It was resolved that the feast would take place in the open air, near to the town, in a vast field, where the high corn sheaves stood, like the symmetrical columns of a giant \r",{"entities":[]}],["temple, the colour of gold under the clear sun. The colonnade stretched to infinity, to the far horizon, sheaves and yet more sheaves, telling of the inexhaustible fertility of the earth. And there it was that they sang and danced, with the good smell of the ripe corn, in the middle of the immense fertile plain, from which the labour of men, reconciled at last, obtained enough bread for the happiness of all.2 This last passage directly evoked that Classical arcadian life and landscape that Garnier had first fully understood after his visit to Greece in 1903. Like the agora, of which it was intended to be the modern counterpart, Garnier s assembly building was depicted as being populated by shadowy figures whose latter-day Biedermeier clothing evoked an appropriately Classical atmosphere. Their houses were to be equally plain, without cornices and mouldings and in many instances planned around courtyards and drained by impluvia. In short, despite its use of advanced constructional methods, its adoption of reinforced-concrete construction throughout (Hennebique) and its use of large steel spans in the industrial sector, after Contamin s Galerie des Machines of 1889, the Cit Industrielle remained above all else the vision of a Mediterranean socialist arcadia. For all that Garnier in Rome had been influenced by other important French urbanists, such as L on Jaussely and Eug ne H nard, whose first articles on urban transformation appeared in 1903, the unique contribution of his city lay as much in the extraordinary level of detail to which it was developed as in the modernity of its vision. Garnier s project not only stipulated the principles and the layout for a hypothetical industrial city; it also delineated, at many different scales, the specific substance of its urban typology, while giving at the same time precise indications as to the mode of its construction in concrete and steel. Nothing as comprehensive as this had been attempted since Claude- \r",{"entities":[]}],["Nicolas Ledoux s ideal city of Chaux of 1804. While Une Cit industrielle was not published until 1917, its author s contribution to contemporary urbanism was already being acknowledged by 1920, when Le Corbusier published material from the Cit folio in the Purist review L Esprit Nouveau. Despite the obvious impact of the Cit on the urbanistic thought of Le Corbusier, its overall influence was limited since, aside from Garnier s isolated works in Lyons, its basic propositions were never tested or extensively published. Unlike Ebenezer Howard's garden city model of 1898, which was realized as a developmental strategy at Letchworth Garden City in 1903, it could hardly be referred to as a proven model. These two alternatives could not in fact have been more opposed, for where Garnier s Cit was inherently expandable and graced with a certain autonomy due to its base in heavy industry, Howard s Rurisville was limited in size and economically dependent, with its base in light industry and small-scale agriculture. And where Garnier s Cit , in conjunction with Jaussely s Barcelona project of 1904, was to influence the theoretical planning models developed during the first decade of the Soviet Union, Howard's schema was to lead to the reformist proliferation of garden city communities and eventually to the equally pragmatic New Town programme that emerged in England after the Second World War. Garnier s urbanistic thought was expressed in his Grands travaux de la ville de Lyons of 1920, his abattoirs of 1906- 32 [82], his Grande Blanche hospital of 1909-30 and his Etats-Unis quarter, designed in 1924 and built by 1935. Each of these complexes amounted to a city in miniature that reasserted through its amenities the sovereignty of the city as a civilizing force - a mission for which the Anglo- Saxon garden city had little capacity. \r",{"entities":[]}],["82 Garnier, abattoir, La Mouche, Lyons, 1917. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Chapter 11 Auguste Perret: the Evolution of Classical Rationalism 1899-1925 In the beginning architecture is only wooden framework. In order to overcome fire one builds in hard material. And the prestige of the wooden frame is such that one reproduces all the traits, including the heads of the nails. Auguste Perret Contribution 4 une th orie de Il architecture, Paris, 19521 In 1897, after abruptly terminating a brilliant career at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Auguste Perret left the academic guidance of his master Julien Guadet to work for his father. This move consolidated his previous part-time involvement in the family contracting firm. Of his works from this period, starting as early as 1890, those designed after Perret left the Beaux-Arts are the most interesting; since they set the stage for the rest of his career. Of these, two are of considerable significance: a casino at St Malo, of 1899 [83], and an apartment building in the Avenue Wagram, Paris, of 1902. Where the one was a Structural Rationalist essay in the national-romantic style then being popularized in the rustic villas of Hector Guimard, the other was an eight- storey Louis-Quinze-cum-Art-Nouveau essay in dressed stone. Of the two, the latter has to be regarded as Perret s essential point of departure, since it demonstrated his \r",{"entities":[]}],["conscious return to the Classical tradition, a return that even anticipated, by a few years, the 1907 crystallization of the Secession Style in the work of such men as Behrens, Hoffmann and Olbrich. 83 Perret, Casino, St Malo, 1899. The Avenue Wagram building projected by a bay-window depth over the pavement as it ascended to its colonnaded sixth floor. This swelling stone profile was subtly complemented by a carved vine ornament which rose sinuously from the threshold to blossom forth in petrified abundance under the plinth of the sixth-floor colonnade. Attached to Symbolism, Perret had designed the masonry of this structure so as to evoke the floral imagery of the Belle Epoque. At the same time, not wishing to violate the ordonnance of a Parisian street, he took care to align its moulded openings with those of the Classical fagades on either side. All this, however, contradicted the Structural Rationalist canon, for it was patently not the architecture of articulate structure such as had been advocated by Viollet- le-Duc. Nor was it the naturally expressive and vernacular use of structure which Perret had displayed in the Casino at St Malo. Two books seem to have been influential in bringing Perret to adopt a trabeated concrete structure for his apartment block in the Rue Franklin of 1903: Auguste Choisy s monumental Histoire de I architecture (1899) and Paul Christophe s text on the Hennebique system, Le B ton arm et ses applications (1902). Where the first cited Greek trabeation as the Classical precedent for such structures, the second provided a definitive technique for the fabrication and design of a reinforced-concrete frame. Choisy, Professor of Architecture at the Ecole des Ponts et Chauss es, cultivated a deterministic view of history in \r",{"entities":[]}],["which he argued that the various styles had arisen not as the sports of fashion but as the logical consequence of developments in building technique. His preferred examples of such technically determined styles were (after Viollet-le- Duc) the Greek and the Gothic, although it was, of course, his reference to the former that made him the last influential theorist of Classical Rationalism. Choisy succeeded a long line of such Rationalists, dating back like Guadet and Labrouste to the 18th-century theorists Cordemoy and Laugier. Like most proponents of this school, Choisy saw nothing irrational in the Greek transposition of timber forms into the masonry components of the Doric order. Perret s initial use of ferroconcrete accorded more closely with Choisy s characterization of the Gothic as an architecture of ribwork and infill. In compositional terms, the Rue Franklin block compressed the format adopted one year earlier in the Avenue Wagram. In each case street facades, divided into five bays, with end bays corbelling out over the pavement, rise five or six storeys in height and terminate in an additional capping floor, before setting back. This floor in the Avenue Wagram is emphasized through an attached colonnade, while in the Rue Franklin its elemental character is stressed by the frame of two open loggias. There, however, all correspondence ends, for whereas the Wagram building is monolithic and horizontally expansive, the Rue Franklin block is articulated and vertically attenuated [84]. The articulation of its columns and the rise of its high pitched set-back roof give something of a Gothic feeling to this otherwise orthogonal structure, recalling the 17th- century work of Mansart. This was the closest that Perret was to come to the detailed prescription of Viollet-le-Duc. The reason for its hollow U-form front, so suggestive of the attentuations of the Gothic, was in fact eminently pragmatic: Perret could get more floor area by providing the regulation court at the front, rather than the rear. With equal \r",{"entities":[]}],["ingenuity, he clad the rear wall of the building with glass lenses in order not to infringe an easement. 84 Perret, 25 bis Rue Franklin, Paris, 1903. After 1903 Perret, like Choisy, regarded the charpente or structural frame as the quintessential expression of built form. The ferroconcrete frame of the Rue Franklin block was tiled in such a way as to suggest post-and-lintel construction in wood - the remainder being either windows or solid panels faced in ceramic mosaic. While the tessellated sunflowers of the latter gave the building that quality of fossilized Art Nouveau so peculiar to the end of the Belle Epoque, the frame itself, and the open planning it permitted, pointed towards Le Corbusier's later development of the free plan. The firm of Perret Fr res, consisting of Auguste and his brother Gustave, played an essential role in the development of Perret s style. In 1905 they erected a remarkable four-storey mechanical stacking garage in the Rue de Ponthieu. This was followed in 1912 by a house designed by Paul Guadet, Julien Guadet s son. Executed in reinforced concrete and rising in each instance to an attic floor or frieze capped by a projecting cornice, these works show the progressive refinement of a rational, trabeated Perret house-sty/e . Where the former may be regarded as having anticipated the format of Perret s later ecclesiastical style, the latter must be seen as the prototypical Perret facade, a modulated format that was given its ultimate expression in his reconstruction of Le Havre after the end of the Second World War. In 1911-13 came the tour de force of the Th atre des Champs-Elys es, following the unhappy confrontation between Auguste Perret and Henry van de Velde. Commissioned by the theatrical director G. Astruc in 1910, \r",{"entities":[]}],["Van de Velde soon realized that on such a restricted site it was necessary to work in reinforced concrete, and he therefore hired Perret Fr res as contractors. The decision was unfortunate, for Perret challenged the structural feasibility of his design, and proposed a similar scheme of his own. Within six months Perret s views had prevailed and Van de Velde had been reduced in status from collaborating architect to architecte-consultant. While the plan and elevation of the Th atre des Champs- Elys es were essentially Van de Velde s, its realization proved both Perret s mastery of detail and the technical prowess of the firm of Perret Freres. The programme required three auditoria, seating 1,250, 500 and 150 people respectively, with full ancillary space comprising stage, backstage, foyers, cloakrooms, etc., all on a site some 37 metres wide and 95 metres deep (120 by 310 feet). Perret suspended his main circular auditorium [85] within a perimeter of eight columns and four bowspring arches, both elements being integral with a continuous monolithic frame that rose from a raft foundation. The basic matrix of the skeleton was augmented by the intelligent application of cantilevers and trussed girders, so that the required volumes could be accommodated exactly within the confines of the site. Little of this dynamic structure is expressed on the exterior, which at the back and sides is generally rendered as a trabeated frame filled with brick. The main facade, however, is Classically treated, being faced with stone in a regular manner which is only tenuously related to the rich columnar subdivision of the foyer within. At the same time, the Symbolist culture of Paris, inherited from the Belle Epoque, still found a certain expression - both internally and externally - in the low reliefs and friezes of Antoine Bourdelle, and in the mural paintings of Maurice Denis. This nostalgia for a mythological antiquity found further reflection in the handrails, light fittings and furnishings designed by Perret himself. \r",{"entities":[]}],["85 Perret, Th dtre des Champs-Elys es, Paris, 1911-13. Section of the large auditorium, with reliefs by Bourdelle. In the decade following the inauguration of this theatre in 1913, Perret Freres were occupied with a remarkable series of utilitarian ferroconcrete structures, including dock buildings in Casablanca and various workshops in the vicinity of Paris. Then suddenly, in 1922, came Auguste Perret s first church commission, Notre-Dame du Raincy, completed in 1924. Here Perret arrived at the most pure formulation of his ferroconcrete style, almost twenty years after it first appeared in the Rue Franklin. The church was important not only for its elegant proportions and syntactic refinement but also for its formulation of the cylindrical column articulated within a non-load-bearing envelope. The precepts of Choisy were respected throughout, from the perforated, prefabricated wall screens to the fluted, tapered columns - each component reduced to its most explicit structural essence. Immediately after Le Raincy there came two temporary structures which were the climax of Perret s early career: his art gallery, the Palais de Bois, built in 1924 of standard timber scantlings which were reused after dismantling, and his small arena theatre in the Exposition des Arts D coratifs of 1925 [86]. Whereas the art gallery, like the Le Raincy church, was one of Perret s most articulate structures, the temporary theatre of lightweight construction was designed to simulate a heavy monolithic frame. The actual structure consisted of circular timber columns carrying a grid of steel- reinforced light-weight clinker beams. The whole was finished internally in lathe and plaster and clad externally in synthetic stone. As such it was certainly removed from the structural purity that had always been essential to the Rationalist thesis. This deception was excused by the \r",{"entities":[]}],["designer on the grounds that had it been permanent he would have built it in reinforced concrete. 86 Perret, theatre, Exposition des Arts D coratifs, Paris, 1925. For all its impurity, the Arts D coratifs theatre was the most lucid and lyrical statement that Perret ever made. Eight internal free-standing columns supported a ceiling ring beam which through ingenious transformations across its four diagonal corners supported a gridded and coffered skylight over the cruciform arena. The transverse loads of this inner structure were to be transferred to a perimeter beam, supported by a system of free-standing columns regularly spaced around the outside of the auditorium. Externally, however, the expression remained awkward and these apparently redundant columns that articulated the blank exterior reflected Perret s preoccupation with the creation of a new national-classical style, an obsession that was severely to limit the development of his later work. Apart from the lucidity of his architecture, and the extraordinary refinement attained in his built work, Perret s significance as a theoretician lay in his aphoristic, dialectical turn of mind - in the importance that he attached to such polarities as order versus disorder, frame versus infill, permanent versus impermanent, mobile versus immobile, reason versus imagination, and so on. Comparable oppositions may be found throughout the entire corpus of Le Corbusier s work. In the Exposition des Arts D coratifs of 1925, however, the ways of these two figures had already begun to diverge, and not only in their respective exhibition structures, but also at the level of theory, for nothing could have been more removed from Perret s precepts than Les 5 points d une architecture nouvelle that Le Corbusier published a year later, in 1926. \r",{"entities":[]}],["Chapter 12 The Deutsche Werkbund 1898-1927 Britain, the pioneer, found it more profitable to invest her surpluses abroad than to modernise her home environment and production.

Chipkin Lutyens and Imperialism , R/BA fournal, 19691 With the Prussian suppression of the Saxon Revolt in 1849 - a revolt in which both Mikhail Bakunin and Richard Wagner played prominent roles - Gottfried Semper, architect and liberal revolutionary, fled from Dresden, first to Paris, and then two years later, as the result of a special commission, to London. There, on the occasion of the 1851 Exhibition, he wrote his famous essay Wissenschaft, Industrie und Kunst (Science, Industry and Art), published in German in 1852, where he examined the impact of industrialization and mass consumption on the entire field of applied art and architecture. A decade before William Morris and his associates produced their first domestic objects, Semper \r",{"entities":[]}],["crystallized his critique of industrial civilization: We have artists but no actual art. In tough-minded opposition to the Pre-Raphaelite dream of returning to a pre-industrial era, Semper took the view that Unremittingly science enriches itself and life with newly discovered useful materials and natural powers that work miracles, with new methods and techniques, with new tools and machines. It is already evident that inventions no longer are, as they had been in earlier times, means for warding off want and for helping consumption; instead, want and consumption are the means to market the inventions. The order of things has been reversed. Later in the same text, he analyzed the impact on design of new methods and materials: The hardest porphyry and granite are cut like chalk and polished like wax. Ivory is softened and pressed into forms. Rubber and gutta-percha are vulcanized and utilized in a thousand imitations of wood, metal and stone carvings, exceeding by far the natural limitations of the material they purport to represent. ...

How will it prevent the general devaluation from expanding into the area of work which is executed by hand in the true old fashion, so that one may find in it more than affection, antiquarianism, superficial appearance and obstinacy? In this militant and incisive manner Semper raised the prime issues of the century, and touched on a range of cultural problems which even today are far from resolved. His ideas gradually became integrated into 19th-century German cultural theory, largely through the publication of his major theoretical text, Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen Ktinsten oder praktische Asthetik ( Style in industrial and structural arts or practical aesthetics ) of 1860-63. His general thesis of the socio-political influence on style was misunderstood until after the intense industrial expansion that occurred in Germany during the last quarter of the century. At the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition of 1876 German industrial and applied art products were regarded as inferior to those from England and America. Franz Reuleaux, a mechanical engineer, who by then had been Semper s colleague for ten years at the Eidgendssische Technische Hochschule in Zurich, wrote from Philadelphia in 1877 that German products were cheap and nasty . German industry must relinquish the principles of competition in price alone and instead use the intellectual power and the skill of the worker to refine the product and this to a greater degree the more it approaches art . For twenty years after the unification of Germany in 1870, German industry had neither the time nor the cause to heed such criticism. Under Bismarck s stable leadership it was concerned solely with the task of development and expansion. A crucial factor in this development was the founding by Emil Rathenau in 1883 of the Allgemeine Elektricitats Gesellschaft (AEG) in Berlin. This electrical \r",{"entities":[]}],["company grew, in the space of seven years, into a vast industrial combine, with a wide range of products and interests extending all over the world. After the resignation of Bismarck in 1890, a great change occurred in the cultural climate of Germany. Numerous critics held that improved design in both craft and industry was essential to future prosperity, and that Germany, without a cheap source of materials or a ready outlet for inexpensive goods, could only begin to compete for a share of the world market with products of exceptionally high quality. This argument was enlarged upon by the nationalist and Christian-Social Democract Friedrich Naumann in his 1904 essay Die Kunst im Maschinenzeitalter ( Art in the Epoch of the Machine ). There he argued, in opposition to William Morris s Luddism, that such quality could only be economically achieved by an artistically cultivated people, orientated towards machine production. This spur of industrialism and pan-German nationalism made the Prussian bureaucracy react against the Philistinism of Wilhelmine Germany and encourage the incipient Arts and Crafts revival of an intrinsic Germanic culture. To this end, in 1896, Hermann Muthesius was sent to London as an attach to the German Embassy, with a charge to study English architecture and design. He returned to Germany in 1904 and took up the post of privy councillor to the Prussian Board of Trade, with a special assignment to reform the national programme of education in applied art. This official Kunstgewerbeschule (school of arts and crafts) reform movement had been anticipated by Karl Schmidt s foundation in 1898 of the Dresdner Werkstatten fur Handwerkskunst (Dresden Workshop for Manual Art) at Dresden. In 1903 the whole movement had gained considerable impetus from the appointment of Peter Behrens as principal of the Dusseldorf Kunstgewerbeschule. In 1904 Muthesius propagated his ideal model of a native craft culture in his book Das Englische Haus. For him the \r",{"entities":[]}],["importance of British Arts and Crafts architecture and furniture lay in its demonstration of craftsmanship and economy as the basis of good design. Two years later, in 1906, as Arbeitskommissar to the third German Exhibition of Arts and Crafts in Dresden, Muthesius aligned himself with Naumann and Schmidt against the conservative and protectionist group of artists and craftsmen known as the Alliance for German Applied Arts by severely criticizing the state of applied art in Germany, while at the same time advocating the adoption of mass production. In the following year the three men founded the Deutsche Werkbund, whose initial membership comprised twelve independent artists and twelve craft firms. The individuals were Peter Behrens, Theodor Fischer, Josef Hoffmann, Wilhelm Kreis, Max Laeuger, Adelbert Niemeyer, J. M. Olbrich, Bruno Paul, Richard Riemerschmid, J. J. Scharvolgel, Paul Schultze-Naumburg and Fritz Schumacher. The firms were Peter Bruckmann & S6hne, Deutsche Werkstatten fiir Handwerkskunst Dresden-Hellerau und Munchen, Eugen Diederichs, Gebriider Klingspors, Kunstdruckerei Kunstlerbund Karlsruhe, Poeschel & Trepte, Saalecker Werkstatten, Vereinigte Werkstatten flr Kunst und Handwerk Munchen, Werkstatten flr deutschen Hausrat Theophil Muller Dresden, Wiener Werkstatten, Wilhelm & Co. and Gottlob Wunderlich. The Werkbund members dedicated themselves to the betterment of craft education and to the establishment of a centre for advancing the aims of their institution. As one might suspect from the heterogeneous nature of the founding group, the Werkbund was by no means totally committed to Muthesius s ideal of normative design for industrial production. It is significant that the site first proposed for the founding ceremony of the Werkbund was in Nuremburg - the setting of Wagner s guild opera Die Meistersinger. \r",{"entities":[]}],["The subsequent development of the Werkbund, particularly in its relationship to industry, is inseparable from that phase of Behrens s career which started in 1907 with his appointment as architect and designer to AEG, for whom he was to evolve a house style ranging from graphics to product design and industrial plant [87]. He brought to this challenging task his innate graphic ability and his experience as a precocious Jugendstil designer during his period at the Darmstadt colony in 1899-1903. His Darmstadt style was to be transformed under the influence of the Beuronic monastic school of geometrical proportion, as then practised by the Dutch architect J.L.M. Lauweriks, who joined Behrens in Dusseldorf when the latter became principal of the applied arts school there in 1903. 87 Behrens, poster for AEG bulbs, before 1910. Behrens s empathetic manner, his so-called Zarathustrastil , was epitomized in his Vorhalle for the Turin International Exhibition of 1902. Here energetic sinuous line and expressive arcuated form were combined in an attempt to evoke the Nietzschean will to form . This rhetoric gave way, under the influence of Lauweriks, to an airless atectonic style, first manifest in the pavilions that Behrens built at Oldenburg in 1905. This Neo-Quattrocento-Beuronic manner was elaborated by Behrens in his design for a crematorium built at Hagen in 1906 and adapted, with Neo- Classical overtones, to the pavilion he designed for AEG at the Berlin shipbuilding exhibition of 1908. On joining AEG, Behrens was confronted with the brute fact of industrial power. In exchange for his youthful visions of revitalizing German cultural life through an elaborately staged mystic ritual, he had to accept industrialization as the manifest destiny of the German nation, or, as he conceived of it, as the composite issue of Zeitgeist and \r",{"entities":[]}],["Volksgeist, to which it was his duty as an artist to give form. Thus the Turbine Factory that he built for AEG in 1909 was a deliberate reification of industry as the one vital rhythm of modern life [88, 89]. Far from being a straightforward design in iron and glass (such as the 19th-century railway shed), Behrens s Turbine Factory was a conscious work of art, a temple to industrial power. While accepting the ascendancy of science and industry with pessimistic resignation, Behrens sought to bring the factory under the rubric of the farm - to restore to factory production that sense of common purpose innate in agriculture, a feeling for which the newly urbanized semi-skilled labour of Berlin would supposedly still have a certain nostalgia. How else should one account for the faceted gable roof of the Turbine Hall or for the Sittesque farmyard layout of the AEG Brunnenstrasse complex of 1910? On joining AEG, Behrens had modified his Oldenburg manner, retaining its formal strength but dispensing with its rigid geometry. Thus the light steel frame of the street facade of the Turbine Factory is terminated at the ends by solid battered corner elements whose surfaces are rendered in such a way as to deny any capacity for sustaining load. This atectonic formula of flanking light trabeated frames with massive corners characterizes virtually all the industrial structures that Behrens designed for AEG. Where the skeletal frame was not a functional prerequisite, as in his Neo-Classical German Embassy in St Petersburg of 1912, this Schinkelesque corner emphasis is evident but less pronounced. 88 Behrens, AEG Factory complex, Berlin, in 1912.

( What is Monumental Art? ), where he defined such art as an expression of the dominant power group in any given epoch. In this same text he took issue with Semper s theoretical derivation of environmental form from technical and material exigencies. He rejected the importance which Semper attached to the typical tectonic element - to the expressive load-bearing column as it appears in Classical architecture. Instead Behrens was profoundly influenced by Alois Riegl s litist theory of the Kunstwollen or will to form which acts through the agency of talented individuals as an ordained atectonic principle. For Riegl this force was destined to oppose the specific technical propensities of an epoch. Consistent with this thesis, Behrens s contribution to AEG product design was to be in the realm of style rather than technique. This split between Norm and Form, between type and individuality, was soon to preoccupy the Deutsche Werkbund. The issue came to a head with Hermann Muthesius s address to the Werkbund assembly on the occasion of the Deutsche Werkbund Exhibition, held in Cologne in 1914. Muthesius s ten-point programme, highly influenced by the writings of Naumann, concentrated on the need for refining typical objects (compare Le Corbusier s objet-type). In points 1 and 2 he argued that architecture and industrial design can attain significance only through the development and refinement of types (7Typisierung), and in points 3-10 he dealt with the national need for products of high standard, so that these could be readily sold on the world market. Point 9 dealt with mass production: A precondition for export is the existence of efficient big firms, whose taste is impeccable. Particular single objects designed by artists would not even cover the demand in Germany. \r",{"entities":[]}],["This opportunistic emphasis on designing cultural objects for an international middle class was immediately challenged by Henry van de Velde who, in presenting his counter-thesis, at once rejected export art and proclaimed the essential creative sovereignty of the individual artist. For him, as for Behrens, only the natural process of Riegl s Kunstwollen could gradually bring about the evolution of a civilized Norm. Despite much controversy over this issue, there was enough support for Van de Velde s position, from figures as diverse as Walter Gropius and Karl Ernst Osthaus, for Muthesius to be forced to withdraw his programme. In his ten-point presentation Muthesius had elaborated his idea of type as follows: The way from individualism to the creation of types is the organic way of development , he argued. This is, today, the way in manufacture, where the product ... is steadily being improved . Again, he declared: Essentially, architecture tends towards the typical. The type discards the extraordinary and establishes order. Thus for Muthesius, as for Semper before him, type had two connotations: the product object gradually refined through use and production, and the tectonic object , which was an irreducible building element functioning as a basic unit of architectural language. The need for such a syntax, in the face of the sudden collapse of the Jugendstil, brought most of the architects at the 1914 Deutsche Werkbund Exhibition, including Muthesius, Behrens and Hoffmann, to express themselves in the language of a reinterpreted Neo-Classicism. The only two exceptions to this were Van de Velde s Werkbund Theatre, endowed by his form-force aesthetic with a quasitheosophical aura, and its close rival, Bruno Taut s Glass Pavilion, which evoked the ritualistic mysticism of Behrens s Turin Vorhalle of 1902. The 1914 Exhibition introduced to a wide public a new generation of Werkbund artists, including in particular Gropius and Adolf Meyer, who up to 1910 had worked \r",{"entities":[]}],["together in the office of Behrens. Gropius s activity between 1910 and 1914 followed along the lines of Behrens s Berlin career. In March 1910 he submitted to Emil Rathenau of AEG a memorandum on rationalized house production, as exemplified by workers houses that he had projected for Janikow in 1906. This text, written by Gropius at the age of twenty-six, remains even today one of the most exhaustive and lucid expositions ever made of the essential preconditions for the successful prefabrication, assembly and distribution of standardized housing units. In 1911 the new partnership of Gropius and Meyer was commissioned by Karl Benscheidt to design the Fagus shoe-last factory, at Alfeld-an-der-Leine. In 1913 the Deutsche Werkbund Jahrbuch carried an article by Gropius on industrial building, illustrated by grain silos and multistorey factories taken from the industrial vernacular of the New World. In the same year he started to work as an industrial designer, designing the bodywork and layout of a diesel locomotive and then the interior of a railway sleeping car. Finally, he and Meyer designed a model factory for the Werkbund Exhibition of 1914. In the Faguswerk, Gropius and Meyer adapted the syntax of Behrens s Turbine Factory to a more open architectural aesthetic. The corners still serve to contain the composition, as in all of Behrens s large AEG structures, but where Behrens s corners are invariably of masonry here they are of glass. The vertical panels of glazing, set forward from the battered brick facing, give the illusion of being miraculously suspended from the upstand at roof level. This pendant effect, plus the translucent corner, inverts the composition of the Turbine Factory, the sheer planar quality of the vertical glass facade being accentuated by the Classical entasis of the brick-faced frame. Despite such transpositions, the Faguswerk, with its atectonic glazing and its nostalgia for the Classical, remained subject to the influence of Behrens. \r",{"entities":[[26,34,"PER"],[35,42,"PER"],[104,111,"PER"],[114,120,"LOC"],[159,172,"PER"],[176,179,"ARCH"],[325,332,"PER"],[591,598,"PER"],[603,608,"PER"],[629,644,"PER"],[659,682,"ARCH"],[687,707,"PER"],[769,776,"PER"],[1094,1099,"PER"],[1180,1187,"PER"],[1192,1197,"PER"],[1220,1227,"PER"],[1230,1245,"ARCH"],[1367,1370,"ARCH"],[1700,1715,"ARCH"]]}],["This particular disposition, which manifested itself compositionally in emphatic corners and string courses, was to characterize all the public work of Gropius and Meyer up to Gropius s design for the Dessau Bauhaus in 1924. Certainly it was the stratagem adopted in their model factory complex designed for the Werkbund Exhibition of 1914 [90]. Here the corporeality of the glass skin was developed as a continuous membrane to embrace spiral staircases at either end of the building. Within this sheer glass envelope stood a brick armature, its separateness being accentuated by two end pavilions, each capped by a flat roof overhang after the style of Frank Lloyd Wright. In spite of this dramatic reversal of the roles of glass and masonry, the factory layout was highly conventional, not only in its axiality but also in its hierarchic and syntactical separation into administrative and productive elements. The public, Classical , white-collar fagade was placed to the fore, thus screening the private, utilitarian, blue-collar steel-frame structure to the rear.

This tragedy was not to be transcended by the quality of the war graves that the Werkbund artists were commissioned to design, which formed the exclusive subject of the Werkbund yearbook issued in 1916/17. After the war Behrens was a changed man, for the Volksgeist was patently no longer the same. Accordingly he gave up his frigid Classicism and his preoccupation with symbolizing the authority of industrial power. His renewed search for an art of building which would express the true spirit of the German people led back, via the pages of Bruno Taut s magazine Fruhlicht, beyond Behrens s own Neo- Romantic Nietzschean past to forms of medieval origin and association. However, his faith in the redeeming power of Riegl s will to form remained unshaken. When I.G. Farben commissioned him to design their new premises at Frankfurt-H chst in 1920 he attempted in a brick and stone structure to reinterpret the lost syntax of medieval civic architecture. The building has at its core a mystic space of public ritual and renewal (going back to Behrens s Turin Vorhalle of 1902) in the form of a faceted five-storey hall of corbelled brickwork, capped by a crystalline roof light. This was an allusion to that theatrical space of public appearance which had inspired his youth, to the Kultursymbol that obsessed, with equal intensity, the members of Bruno Taut s Glass Chain (see Chapter 13). A similar impulse informed his small exhibition structures of the 1920s - his steeply pitched Dombauhitte (cathedral masons lodge) with its diagonal banded brickwork, designed for the Munich Kunstgewerbeschau of 1922, and his Wrightian glass conservatory built for the Paris Exposition des Arts D coratifs in 1925.

It is a fact! New social welfare organizations, hospitals, inventions, or technical innovations and improvements - these will not bring a new culture- but glass architecture will. ...

At his most practical, he attempted to formulate models for agrarian and handicraft- based communities; at his most fantastic, he projected the building of glass temples in the Alps. Typical of Taut s Kropotkinian propositions was his model of a circular, radially subdivided, agricultural settlement. In its core were three separate residential sections, one for each class of citizen - Ktinder, Kunstler und Kinder (the enlightened , artists and children) - each grouped around lozenge-shaped courts. This tripartite organization led axially to the central crystalline Haus des Himmels or House of Heaven , where the governors of the community convened.

After establishing himself as an architect in Breslau in 1911, Poelzig had realized two seminal works which anticipated the later formal language of both Taut and Mendelsohn: a water tower for Posen (a Stadtkrone image if ever there was one) and an office building for Breslau, which led to the architectural format of Mendelsohn s Berliner- Tageblatt building of 1921. In addition, Poelzig s highly articulated brick chemical plant built at Luban in 1912 came close to rivalling the industrial style that Behrens had just invented for AEG. After the war, in his address as chairman of the Werkbund in 1919, Poelzig returned to the controversy over Typisierung and effectively argued yet again for the principle of the Kunstwollen.

As in his Istanbul Freundschaftshaus (House of Friendship) project of 1917, these arched forms were assembled in such a way as to create a ziggurat whose interior was a prismatic cavern made up entirely of \r",{"entities":[[0,9,"PER"],[13,19,"LOC"],[48,58,"PER"],[153,158,"PER"],[197,214,"PER"],[225,232,"PER"],[234,255,"ARCH"],[257,263,"LOC"],[635,642,"LOC"],[652,659,"PER"],[743,747,"PER"],[752,762,"PER"],[766,787,"ARCH"],[858,865,"PER"],[908,918,"PER"],[921,949,"ARCH"],[972,979,"PER"],[1095,1102,"PER"],[1125,1129,"ARCH"],[1197,1204,"PER"],[1405,1435,"ARCH"],[1548,1596,"ARCH"]]}],["pendentive elements. Apart from his sets for Paul Wegener s film The Golem (1920), the Schauspielhaus for Reinhardt was Poelzig s last fully Expressionist work. By 1925, with his Capitol Cinema for Berlin, he had already returned to the crypto-Classical fold. Mendelsohn realized his own version of the Stadtkrone in the observatory that he built for Albert Einstein at Potsdam in 1917-21 [93]. Combining as it did the sculptural forms of Van de Velde s Werkbund Theatre and the overall profile of Bruno Taut s Glass Pavilion, the design s point of departure lay in the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition. In its final silhouette, however, the Einstein Tower displayed a certain formal affinity to the thatched-roof vernacular of the Dutch architects Eibink and Snellebrand, who, with Theo Wijdeveld, represented the extreme organic wing of Dutch Expressionism, centred around Wijdeveld s magazine Wendingen ( Turnings ). It is hardly surprising, therefore, that soon after the completion of the observatory Mendelsohn visited Holland, at Wijdeveld s invitation, to see the work of the Wendingen circle for himself. In Amsterdam he visited a number of Expressionist housing schemes which were then under construction, as part of Berlage s plan for Amsterdam South, including Michel de Klerk s Eigen Haard (1913-19) and Piet Kramer s De Dageraad (1918-23). Executed in moulded brickwork and tile hanging, they exemplified a much more structural approach than the highly plastic and folkish preoccupations of Wijdeveld s vernacular architects. Outside the Amsterdam School of Wijdeveld, De Klerk and Kramer, Mendelsohn met and was influenced by a number of Dutch architects of quite different persuasion, such as the rationalist Rotterdam architect J.J.P. Oud and the Wrightian architect W.M. Dudok, practising in Hilversum. In a letter to his wife, Mendelsohn explained how neither the Amsterdam nor the Rotterdam school met with his full approval: \r",{"entities":[[45,57,"PER"],[120,127,"PER"],[179,193,"ARCH"],[260,270,"PER"],[303,313,"ARCH"],[351,366,"PER"],[370,377,"LOC"],[439,451,"PER"],[454,470,"ARCH"],[498,508,"PER"],[511,525,"ARCH"],[634,648,"ARCH"],[741,747,"PER"],[752,763,"PER"],[775,789,"PER"],[867,876,"PER"],[998,1008,"PER"],[1017,1024,"LOC"],[1029,1038,"PER"],[1109,1118,"LOC"],[1219,1226,"PER"],[1238,1247,"LOC"],[1265,1280,"PER"],[1309,1320,"PER"],[1323,1334,"ARCH"],[1544,1573,"LOC"],[1573,1594,"PER"],[1596,1606,"PER"],[1717,1726,"LOC"],[1737,1747,"PER"],[1776,1786,"PER"],[1838,1848,"PER"],[1875,1884,"LOC"],[1893,1909,"LOC"]]}],["93 Mendelsohn, Einstein Tower, Potsdam, 1917-21.

Otherwise, Rotterdam will pursue the way of mere construction, with deathly chill in its veins, and Amsterdam will be destroyed by the fire of its own dynamicism. Function plus dynamics is the challenge. As this letter suggests, the more structural of the Dutch Expressionists had an immediate impact on Mendelsohn s own development: after his visit to Holland he turned from the plasticity of his Potsdam observatory towards a concern for the intrinsic structural expressiveness of materials. The hat factory that he built at Luckenwalde in 1921-23 [94] reflects this influence. Its ridged and pitched-roofed dye shop and production sheds, modelled in the manner of De Klerk, stood in strong contrast to the smooth flat-roofed power house whose layered cubist expression in brick and concrete recalls the early work of Dudok. The principle established here, of setting dramatic tall pitched industrial forms against horizontal administrative elements, was repeated by Mendelsohn in his Leningrad textile mill project of 1925. In this instance, however, a further step was taken, for the banded modelling of the administration block anticipated the profiling of his metropolitan department stores, built in Breslau, Stuttgart, Chemnitz and Berlin between 1927 and 1931 [95].

A few years earlier, Haring had shared an office in Berlin with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who was four years his junior, and there is evidence that for a brief while the two men exercised a certain influence on each other. This is particularly noticeable in their entries to the famous Friedrichstrasse office building competition of 1921, where they adopted a similar organic approach to the genesis of form.

Despite an overtly Expressionist tendency, Haring remained preoccupied with the inner source of form, with that which he termed the Organwerk or the programmatic essence of the organism , as opposed to its surface expression or Gesta/twerk. Of this duality he wrote: We now attempt not to allow our attitudes towards function to conflict with our needs for expression, but to keep them side by side. We try to relate our ideas about expression to life, creation, movement and nature; for in our creation of functional forms we follow the path of nature. In nature form is the result of the organisation of many individual entities in space in order that life can unfold and action take place, a fulfilment of both part and whole, (whereas in the world of geometrical cultures form is derived from laws of geometry). lf we prefer to search for shapes rather than to impose them, to discover forms rather than to construct them, we are in harmony with nature and act with her rather than against her? At the Berlin Secession Exhibition in 1923 Hans and Wassili Luckhardt, with Mies and some of his contemporaries, had begun to show a more functional and objective mode of building, a development which led in the following year to their formation of the Zehnerring.

Proclamation of the Weimar Bauhaus, 19191 The Bauhaus was the outcome of a continuous effort to reform applied art education in Germany around the turn of the century, first with the establishment in 1898 of Karl Schmidt's Dresdner Werkstatten (which became the Deutsche Werkstatten, and moved to the garden city of Hellerau in 1908), then with the appointment in 1903 of Hans Poelzig and Peter Behrens to the directorships of applied art schools in Breslau and Dusseldorf, and finally, in 1906, with the founding of the Grand Ducal School of Arts and Crafts in Weimar under the direction of the Belgian architect Henry van de Velde.

After his enforced resignation as an alien in 1915, he advised the Saxon State Ministry that Walter Gropius, Hermann Obrist or August Endell would make a suitable successor. Protracted discussions took place throughout the war between the Ministry and Fritz Mackensen, head of the Grand Ducal Academy of Fine Art, as to the relative pedagogical status of fine and applied art, with Gropius arguing for the relative autonomy of the latter. Gropius advocated a workshop- based design education for both designers and craftsmen, while Mackensen stuck to the Prussian idealist line, insisting that artist-craftsmen should be trained in a fine art academy. This ideological conflict was resolved in 1919 in compromise: Gropius became director of a composite institution, consisting of the Academy of Art and the School of Arts and Crafts, an arrangement that was to divide the Bauhaus, conceptually, throughout its existence. The principles of the Bauhaus Proclamation of 1919 [97] had been anticipated in Bruno Taut s architectural programme for the Arbeitsrat fur Kunst, published late in 1918. Taut argued that a new cultural unity could be attained only through a new art of building, wherein each separate discipline would contribute to the final form.

Even the word Bauhaus, which Gropius persuaded the reluctant state government to adopt as the official title of the new institution, intentionally recalled the medieval Bauhutte or masons lodge. That such connotations were deliberate is confirmed by a letter written by Oskar Schlemmer in 1922: Originally the Bauhaus was founded with visions of erecting the cathedral of socialism and the workshops were established in the manner of the cathedral building lodges [Dombauhttten]. The idea of the cathedral has for the time being receded into the background and with it certain definite ideas of an artistic nature. Today we must think at best in terms of the house, perhaps even only think so. ... in the face of the economic plight, it is our task to become pioneers of simplicity, that is, to find a simple form for all life s necessities, which at the same time is respectable and genuine.2 For the first three years of its existence the Bauhaus was dominated by the charismatic presence of the Swiss painter and teacher Johannes Itten, who arrived in the autumn of 1919. Three years earlier he had started his own art school in Vienna, under the influence of Franz Cizek. In a highly charged milieu, coloured by the anarchic anti-Seccessionist activities of the painter Oskar Kokoschka and the architect Adolf Loos, Cizek had developed a unique system of instruction based on stimulating individual creativity \r",{"entities":[[460,467,"PER"],[701,716,"PER"],[1455,1469,"PER"],[1563,1569,"LOC"],[1594,1606,"PER"],[1705,1720,"PER"],[1739,1749,"PER"],[1751,1756,"PER"]]}],["through the making of collages of different materials and textures. His methods had matured in a cultural climate impregnated with progressive educational theory, from the systems of Froebel and Montessori to the learning-through- doing movement, initiated by the American John Dewey and vigorously propagated in Germany after 1908 by the educational reformer Georg Kerschensteiner. The teaching in Itten s Viennese school and in the Vorkurs, or preliminary course, that he initiated in the Bauhaus was derived from Cizek, although Itten enriched the method with the form and colour theory of his own master Adolf H lzel. The aims of Itten s foundation course, mandatory for all first-year students, were to release individual creativity and to enable each student to assess his own particular ability. Up to 1920, when, at Itten s request, the artists Schlemmer, Paul Klee and Georg Muche joined the Bauhaus, he taught, single-handed, four separate craft courses in addition to the Vorkurs, while Gerhard Marcks and Lyonel Feininger gave marginal courses in ceramics and printing respectively. Itten s anarchic position at the time may be gleaned from his 1922 response to a referendum on the provision of state welfare for artists: The mind stands outside any organization. Where it has nevertheless been organized (religion, church), it has become estranged from its innate nature. ... The state should take care that none of its citizens starve but it should not support art.3 Itten s anti-authoritarian, even mystical, position was substantially reinforced in 1921 by his extended stay in the Mazdaznan centre at Herrliberg near Zurich [98].

The growing division between Gropius and Itten was exacerbated by the appearance in Weimar of two equally powerful personalities: the Dutch De Stijl artist Theo van Doesburg, who took up residence in the winter of 1921, and the Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, who joined the Bauhaus, at Itten s instigation, in the summer of 1922. Where the former postulated a rational, anti-individualist aesthetic, the latter taught an emotive and ultimately mystical approach to art. Although the two men did not come into direct conflict, Van Doesburg s extramural De Stijl polemic instantly appealed to many Bauhaus students.

In 1922, after Van Doesburg had been proselytizing for nine months, the generally critical socio-economic situation brought Gropius to modify the craft orientation of the original programme. His initial attack on Itten appeared in his circular to the Bauhaus masters, where he indirectly criticized Itten s monastic rejection of the world. This text was in effect a draft for his essay /dee und Aufbau des Staatlichen Bauhauses Weimar ( The Theory and Organization of the Bauhaus ), published on the occasion of the first Bauhaus exhibition held in Weimar in 1923. He wrote: The teaching of craft is meant to prepare for designing for mass production. Starting with the simplest tools and least complicated jobs, he [the Bauhaus apprentice] gradually acquires ability to master more intricate problems and to work with machines, while at the same time he keeps in touch with the entire process of production from start to finish.4 This carefully worded argument by Gropius for the reconciliation of craft design and industrial production brought about Itten s immediate resignation. His position on the faculty was immediately filled by the Hungarian artist and social radical Laszl6 Moholy-Nagy.

He took down the dictated shapes in the correct position.> This spectacular demonstration of programmed art production seems to have impressed Gropius, for in the following year he invited Moholy-Nagy to take over both the preliminary course and the metal workshop. Under Moholy- Nagy s leadership the products of the latter were at once orientated towards a Constructivist Elementarism , which was tempered over the years by a mature concern for the convenience of the objects produced. In the meantime he introduced into the preliminary course, which he shared with Josef Albers, exercises in equilibrium structures in a variety of materials, including wood, metal, wire and glass. The aim was no longer to demonstrate a feeling for contrasting materials and forms, usually assembled as reliefs, but rather to reveal the statical and aesthetic properties of free- standing asymmetrical structures. The epitome of such exercises was the building of his own Light-Space Modulator , on which he was to be occupied from 1922 to 1930.

Two model houses, largely built and furnished by the Bauhaus workshops, characterize this period of transition, revealing common elements and striking dissimilarities. They are the Sommerfeld House, designed by Gropius and Meyer and completed in Berlin-Dahlem in 1922, and the Bauhaus Versuchshaus or Experimental House, designed by Muche and Meyer for the Bauhaus Exhibition of 1923 [100].

This minimum- circulation house was organized around an atrium - not an open court but a clerestory-lit living-room surrounded on all sides by bedrooms and other ancillary spaces. Each of these perimeter rooms was equipped in an austere manner, with exposed metal radiators, steel windows and door frames, elemental furniture, and unshaded tubular light fittings.

These serial houses were finally realized as masters residences built at the Dessau Bauhaus in 1926. After 1923 the Bauhaus approach became extremely objective , in the sense of being closely affiliated to the Neue Sachlichkeit movement. This affiliation, which was reflected, despite their rather formalistic massing, in the buildings for the Dessau Bauhaus itself, was to become more pronounced after Gropius s resignation in 1928. The last two years of Gropius s tenure were distinguished by three major developments: the politically enforced and well- orchestrated move from Weimar to Dessau, the completion of the Dessau Bauhaus [101, 102], and finally the gradual emergence of a recognizable Bauhaus approach, in which a greater emphasis was placed on deriving form from productive method, material constraint and programmatic necessity. 101, 102 Gropius, Bauhaus, Dessau, 1925-26.

Under a programme of increased technology | can only continue if | have a technical expert as my aide. For economic reasons this will never be possible. Largely liberated from the inhibiting influence of Gropius s star faculty, Meyer was able to steer the work of the Bauhaus towards a more socially responsible design programme. Simple, demountable, inexpensive, plywood furniture came to the fore and a range of wallpaper was produced. More Bauhaus designs were being manufactured than ever before, although the emphasis was now placed on social rather than aesthetic considerations. Meyer organized the Bauhaus into four major departments: architecture (now called building for polemical reasons), advertising, wood and metal production, and textiles. Supplementary scientific courses, such as industrial organization and psychology, were introduced into all departments, while the building section shifted its emphasis to the economic optimization of plan arrangements and to methods for the precise calculation of light, sunlight, heat loss/gain and acoustics. This ambitious programme required an increase in faculty, so that Wittwer s appointment as a technician was soon complemented by that of the architect-planner Ludwig Hilberseimer, the engineer Alcar Rudelt, and a studio staff comprising Alfred Arndt, Karl Fieger, Edvard Heiberg and Mart Stam.

The desperate attempt of the Mayor of Dessau to shore up the Bauhaus, in the name of liberal democracy, through the patriarchal directorship of Mies van der Rohe, was doomed to failure.

A year later came the Mannheim exhibition which bore the same name. The expression ought really to apply as a label to the new realism bearing a socialist flavour. It was related to the general contemporary feeling in Germany of resignation and cynicism after a period of exuberant hopes (which had found an outlet in expressionism). Cynicism and resignation are the negative side of the Neue Sachlichkeit, the positive side expresses itself in the enthusiasm for the immediate reality as a result of a desire to take things entirely objectively on a material basis without immediately investing them with ideal implications. This healthy disillusionment finds its clearest expression in Germany in architecture. G.F. Hartlaub Letter to Alfred H. Barr, Jr, July 19291 The term Sachlichkeit had been current in German cultural circles long before 1924, when the art critic G.F. Hartlaub hit upon the phrase die neue Sachlichkeit ( the new objectivity ) to identify a post-war school of anti- Expressionist painting.

These articles attributed the quality of Sachlichkeit to the English Arts and Crafts movement, particularly as manifest in the handicraft guilds (such as that of Ashbee) and the early garden suburbs. Sachlichkeit for Muthesius seems to have meant an objective , functionalist and eminently yeoman attitude to the design of objects, tending towards the reform of industrial society itself. The term was given somewhat different connotations by Heinrich W6lfflin, in his book, Kunstgeschichtliche Grundbegriffe (The Principles of Art History) of 1915, when he wrote of the linear vision of 1800: The new line comes to serve a new objectivity. Sachlichkeit had thus been qualified by the objective new well before Hartlaub gave the title Die Neue Sachlichkeit to his 1925 exhibition in Mannheim of Magical Realist painters, artists who since the First World War had depicted both the appearance and the essence of an austere social reality. Yet, as Fritz Schmalenbach has observed, In reality, it was not the objectivity of the new painting which the term was intended in the first place and above all to formulate, but something more universal underlying this objectivity and of which it was the expression, a revolution in the general mental attitude of the times, a general new Sachlichkeit of thought and feeling. By the early 1930s, the expression had achieved wide circulation and had come to connote, as Hartlaub had intended, an unsentimental approach to the nature of society. In 1926 the phrase was first used to designate a new-objective and explicitly socialist attitude to architecture, although, as Schmalenbach has noted, this transference did not derive from a community of style between Magical Realism and the new architecture.

With the advent of the Russian Revolution in 1917 and the military collapse of Germany in the following year, Russia and Germany both found themselves confronted by hostile Western powers. While the Soviet Union had to contend with foreign intervention in the midst of a civil war and with the deprivations of an economic blockade, Germany was crippled by the punitive reparation agreements of Versailles. The end of the Russian Civil War in 1921 and the easing of foreign pressure induced Lenin to proclaim his new Economic Policy, designed to attract foreign capital into corporate partnership with the Soviet Union. Soon afterwards Germany ratified a series of earlier negotiations with the Soviets, signing in 1922 the Treaty of Rapallo, which re-established diplomatic relations and pledged both countries to economic co-operation. With the opening up of Russo-German relations at the end of 1921, El Lissitzky and Ilya Ehrenburg came to Berlin as unofficial cultural ambassadors of the Soviet Union, their immediate task being to organize an official exhibition of Russian avant-garde art. In May 1922 they published the first number of a trilingual art review, Veshch/Gegenstand/Objet, which featured on its cover two significant images: a photograph of a snow plough locomotive, and the basic icons of Suprematism, a black square and a black circle [107]. Veshch thus invoked the sachlich engineered object and the Suprematist non-objective world. 107 Lissitzky, cover of Veshch/Gegenstand/Objet, 1922.

By his invented term Proun (from Pro-Unovis, for the school of the new art ), Lissitzky evoked a new realm of art somewhere between painting and architecture. Of the Proun room, comprising a small rectilinear cell, articulated and animated by a continuous relief extending over the floor and ceiling, Lissitzky wrote: The room ... is designed with elementary forms and materials ... and with surfaces which are spread flat on to the wall (colour) and surfaces which are perpendicular to the wall (wood) ... the equilibrium which | seek to attain in the room must be elementary and capable of change so that it cannot be disturbed by a telephone or a piece of standard furniture. The room is there for the human being - not the human being for the room.? Here, as on the cover of Veshch, Suprematist abstraction is seen as being compatible with standard objects. Unlike Frank Lloyd Wright in the Larkin Building, Lissitzky did not feel any need to restyle such manufactured objects as telephones, although as early as 1920 he had rejected the anti-art utilitarianism proclaimed by Tatlin s Productivist Group. While he recognized that empirically engineered (sachlich) structures could possess both spatial beauty and symbolic significance, his Lenin Tribune of 1920 exemplified his own subtle combination of engineering and Suprematism: the basic structure consisted of an inclined lattice girder, with Lenin photomontaged into position at its crown, while the rostrum and the base were treated as Elementarist forms, miraculously suspended in space. This incongruous juxtaposition of abstract, non-objective elements with empirically engineered form was to characterize Lissitzky s work until the early 1930s.

In 1922 the Dutch architect Mart Stam, then twenty-three years old, went to work for Max Taut in Berlin. There, while working independently on a competition for an office block in K6nigsberg, he met Lissitzky and for the rest of their stay in Berlin the two men remained in close contact. In 1923 Lissitzky projected his suspended office block for Moscow, the Wolkenbugel , of which two separate versions were eventually produced, one by Lissitzky alone and the other in conjunction with Stam. When, late in 1923, Lissitzky contracted tuberculosis and was forced to move to Zurich, Stam went with him. During the next year they acquired a Swiss following and in 1925, largely at Lissitzky s instigation, they formed the left-wing ABC group, centred on Basle. The Swiss members of the group included Emil Roth of Zurich and Hans Schmidt, Hannes Meyer and Hans Wittwer of Basle. These men dedicated themselves to the design of socially relevant buildings in accordance with scientific principles. In 1924 the ABC group began to propagate their views in the magazine ABC: Beitrage zum Bauen, edited by Stam, Schmidt and Lissitzky in collaboration with Roth. Although they did not adopt the phrase Neue Sachlichkeit , they nonetheless made their sachlich orientation explicit. The first number contained Stam s essay Kollektive Gestaltung ( Collective Design ) and Lissitzky s seminal text, Element und Erfindung ( Element and Invention ), in which he outlined the duality of his approach, his synthesis of functional structure with abstract elements.

Soon afterwards the ABC group summed up its distaste for massive architecture in the equation: building x weight = monumentality . With the publication of Meyer and Wittwer s Petersschule project for Basel of 1926 [109], the ABC group crystallized its Functionalist and anti-monumental programme. Meyer s description reveals the ABC preoccupation with precise calculation and social relevance, both to be made manifest through light-weight technique: The ideal would be to skylight all the rooms ... and to set aside a new site as part of a planned development of the town. At present there appears to be no prospect of such demands being realized and the following is a compromise solution on the basis of the old building. ...

The individual's isolation has led him to be dominated by his emotions. But the modern outlook ... sees life as the single reaching out of a single force.

In all this work Oud, as Rotterdam City Architect, remained committed to Berlage s traditional urban precept of the street, regarded as an enclosed, external room. The full measure of Stam s revolt against this tradition may be judged from his 1926 project for the Rokin district of Amsterdam, where the continuity of the existing street is vitiated by a continuously elevated office block, served by escalator access and an aerial railway, the ground being reserved for traffic parking, display and pedestrian movement.

The emergence of the Neue Sachlichkeit in Germany was inseparable from the Weimar Republic s crash housing programme, initiated by the stabilization of the Rentenmark in November 1923. In that year, Otto Haesler, the pioneer of Zeilenbau (row) housing, completed the Siedlung Italienischer Garten at Celle, near Hanover. Flat-roofed, with polychromatic rendered facades, its modernistic formula was to be adopted by Ernst May as a model for the first units to be built in Frankfurt, in 1925. In 1924, in the Siedlung Georgsgarten, his second work at Celle, Haesler developed Theodor Fischer s Alte Heide row housing model of 1919 into a general system, the housing being laid out in rows an optimum distance apart for sun penetration and ventilation. This pattern, based on Heiligenthal s rule (fig. 119, p. 149) that the rows should be spaced no less than twice their block height apart, became the normative Neue Sachlichkeit formula, to be repeated in any number of housing schemes realized in Germany between 1925 and 1933. In such layouts, following Haesler s example, south- or west-facing living rooms open onto communal green space. In Georgsgarten, Haesler added short south-facing blocks to the terraces, which ran north-south, thereby creating a series of L-shaped green courts, extending out into adjacent allotments. These allotments were subdivided into family plots for the cultivation of food (compare Adolf Loos s Heuberg Estate, Vienna, of 1926).

The replacement of the traditional Wohnktiche by a separate kitchen was a radical departure in mass housing, and had the critical social impact of shifting the household focus towards an austerity version of the bourgeois salon . Haesler was to upgrade his typical apartment in the Siedlung Friedrich Ebert-Ring at Rathenow, built in 1929, where a separate bathroom was introduced into the standard walk-up unit. Both these early settlements were equipped with communal facilities such as laundries, meeting rooms, libraries, sports fields, etc., while Georgsgarten was further provided with a kindergarten, a caf and a hairdresser. The sparse furnishing of these spaces, with their standard Thonet furniture and bare light bulbs, relieved by carefully detailed pipework and electrical conduit, synthesized the typical Neue Sachlichkeit interior: cold and austere and yet at the same time scintillating. Such qualities were echoed on the exterior, where plain rendered surfaces, steel windows, patent glazing and metal railing were combined to create the universal sachlich syntax. Despite the national and ideological divergence of the seventeen architects involved - including, from Germany alone, figures as diverse as Behrens, D cker, Gropius, Hilberseimer, Rading, Scharoun, Schneck, Mies van der Rohe and the brothers Taut - this objective mode of expression was more or less universally adopted in the Deutsche Werkbund Weissenhofsiedlung, erected outside Stuttgart in 1927.

His initial plan of 1929 for the Siedlung Rothenberg at Kassel is typical in this respect, not only of his own work, but of most other Neue Sachlichkeit housing of comparable date. \r",{"entities":[[332,339,"PER"],[384,413,"ARCH"],[417,425,"LOC"],[655,667,"LOC"],[1324,1331,"PER"],[1333,1339,"PER"],[1341,1348,"PER"],[1350,1362,"PER"],[1364,1370,"PER"],[1372,1380,"PER"],[1382,1389,"PER"],[1391,1408,"PER"],[1426,1430,"PER"],[1565,1574,"LOC"],[1631,1638,"PER"],[1836,1855,"ARCH"],[1859,1865,"LOC"]]}],["With May s appointment as City Architect of Frankfurt in 1925, the building of workers settlements began there on an unprecedented scale. Yet, owing to his early training with both Theodor Fischer in Munich and Raymond Unwin in England, May s rationalism was tempered by a feeling for tradition. Whereas Haesler had created an indented but continuous form at Georgsgarten and a serried open-ended layout at Rothenburg, May (like Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner in their contemporary Berlin-Britz housing) was more concerned with the creation of self-contained urban space, after the model of the traditional Prussian Anger village. Thus May s first work for Frankfurt, his Bruchfeldstrasse development of 1925 [115], designed with C.H. Rudloff, consisted of a large courtyard of zigzag housing, enclosing an elaborately landscaped communal garden. This unique layout, formally reminiscent of the Cit Moderne designed by Victor Bourgeois for Brussels in 1922, gave way to a more generalized approach in May s master plan for Neue Frankfurt of 1926 and in his Romerstadt, Praunheim, Westhausen and H henblick settlements built as parts of the Nidda Valley complex between 1925 and 1930. 115 May and Rudloff, Bruchfeldstrasse Estate, Frankfurt, 1925.

While the railroad layout of T rten reflected not only the standardization of its units but also the linear process of their prefabricated assembly by travelling crane, the Dessau Bauhaus still amounted to a formalist composition of asymmetrical elements. Its centrifugal, pinwheeling form, reminiscent of De Stijl planning, had first been attempted by Gropius and Meyer in their Chicago Tribune project of 1922 (fig. 99, p. 135) and reformulated by them as an asymmetrical, horizontal distribution of masses in their Erlangen Academy design of 1924. While the expression of a comparable aesthetic in the Dessau Bauhaus necessitated the wilful suppression of its structural frame, this was compensated for by the sachlich detailing of its secondary components, such as the radiators, the fenestration, the balustrading and the light fittings. All the same, the ultimate articulation of these large intersecting masses could not be achieved without recourse to changes in colour or toa shallow modelling of the facade that effectively recalled the Neo-Classical modenature of the Gropius and Meyer Werkbund Building of 1914. \r",{"entities":[[162,179,"ARCH"],[207,226,"PER"],[334,337,"PER"],[364,396,"ARCH"],[426,442,"PER"],[470,484,"PER"],[487,502,"ARCH"],[519,533,"ARCH"],[812,826,"ARCH"],[945,953,"PER"],[992,999,"PER"],[1004,1009,"PER"],[1019,1042,"ARCH"],[1157,1180,"ARCH"],[1244,1258,"ARCH"],[1718,1725,"PER"],[1730,1735,"PER"],[1736,1753,"ARCH"]]}],["117 Gropius, rationalized housing, Dessau-T rten, 1928.

Piscator had founded his Proletarian Theatre in 1924 after the model of the Russian revolutionary producer Vsevolod Meyerhold, whose October Theatre had been proclaimed in Moscow in 1920. Thus Gropius s PiscatorbUhne was largely designed to satisfy the requirements of a biomechanical stage, to provide the space for a theatre of action as outlined by Meyerhold and his Proletkult colleagues. The actor-acrobat was the ideal type for such a theatre, in which a circus-like mechanized performance was presented on an apron stage. In his remarkably elegant and flexible solution, Gropius provided Piscator with an auditorium which could be rapidly transformed into any one of the three classic stage forms, the proscenium, the apron or the arena [118]. How this provision was to be made, and to what theatrical ends, has been best described in Gropius s own words. In 1934, ata conference in Rome, he stated: 118 Gropius, Total Theatre project, 1927.

A similar demountable cyclorama was also available for the stage itself. The adaptability of this auditorium was to be further augmented by the provision for acrobatic display, just above the central arena. This aerial stage would have had the effect of transforming Gropius s egglike void into a truly three-dimensional play space, with the audience either surrounding or surrounded by the action on every side. Finally, the auditorium itself was a transparent box, through which its basic structure could be easily perceived, the open lattice of the ovoid roof being ingeniously reconciled with the column nodes of its elliptical ring support (compare the Meyer/Wittwer League of Nations auditorium). Of approximately the same date as the Total Theatre were the Haselhorst housing and Elberfield Hospital projects, designed by Marcel Breuer and Gustav Hassenpflug in 1928, and Hannes Meyer s Trades Union School, completed at Bernau in 1930.

After his resignation from the Bauhaus at the end of 1927, Gropius became increasingly involved with the problem of housing [119], so that apart from the extensive low-cost schemes that he designed and saw built in the late 1920s, in Dessau, Karlsruhe and Berlin, he became theoretically concerned with the improvement of housing standards and the development of the housing block into a classless system for community settlement. His unrealized housing projects for Berlin of 1929 were a significant advance over his previous work, offering higher living standards and more comprehensive social services, while his 1931 proposal for high-rise middle-class housing, on the Wannsee near Berlin, constituted his first attempt at a self- contained commune block equipped with a restaurant and a gymnasium-solarium on the roof. Gropius s views in the late 1920s lay to the left of the Social Democratic position, as his essay, Die Soziologischen Grundlagen der Minimalwohnung (The Sociological Bases of Minimum Housing), of 1929 makes clear. There he put forward the familiar socialist argument in favour of state involvement in the provision of housing: 119 Gropius, diagram presented at CIAM in 1930 demonstrating the increased density and open space to be obtained by using high-rise slabs.

These prescriptions were only barely in advance of the official housing policy of the Weimar Republic, which, between 1927 and 1931, was to subsidize publicly through social insurance and property tax the design and erection of around one million dwellings - about seventy per cent of the new housing starts made over the entire period. Such an extensive welfare state system could not, however, be maintained in the face of the stock market collapse, which accompanied the world economic depression of 1929. Foreign trade slumped, loans were called in, and Germany was once more plunged into economic and political chaos. This had the effect of swinging the opinion of the country to the right, and with this political shift the fate of the German Neue Sachlichkeit architects was more or less sealed. Nothing remained for them but to emigrate, and this they did, each according to the colour of his political conviction [120].

In reality, however, internationalism frequently devolved into centralism, in which the center exerted authority over its peripheries while overlooking their contributions ... Czechoslovakia between the wars can serve as a case Study for these exchanges for three reasons. First, it was located in the middle of Europe and its cultural heritage included contributions from Western and Eastern, as well as southern and northern Europe. Second, it was a multi-national country, whose population consisted of several ethnic groups, notably Czechs, Slovaks, Germans, Hungarians, Ruthenians, and Jews. Third, it was the only democracy in Central Europe which, thanks to relatively favorable political and economic circumstances, allowed artists to further develop their ideas throughout the 1930s.

The latter was culturally complex, poised between the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) of German-speaking Europe and the more utopian drive of Russian Constructivism as projected by Soviet avant-garde architects between 1918 and 1932. The key Czech critic mediating between Dev tsil and Constructivism was the polemical polymath Karel Teige. During the first half of the 1920s, Teige was an advocate of the picture poem collages of Poetism, an amalgam of graphics, typography and photography that veered into kinetic art and film. Jaroslav Andel informs us that another key figure at this time was Zden k PeSanek, whose drive towards a more dynamic form of art split the Dev tsil movement into its surrealist and functionalist factions, with the latter tending towards Constructivism in architecture. This last line was advanced by the journal Stavba (Construction), edited by Oldrich Stary and Oldrich Tyl of the Architects Club and strongly supported by the young architect Ludvik Kysela. The second number of this magazine, published in 1923, featured a Constructivist Manifesto signed by Stary, Kysela, Bedrich Feuerstein and the ubiquitous Teige, who was the journal s managing editor. This polemical publication was paralleled by the anthology Zivot II (Life I, edited by the architect Jaromir Krejcar [121]. Krejcar straddled the divide between the so-called emotional functionalism of Dev tsil and the objective functionalism of Stavba, the adherents of which included Kysela, Tyl, Jan Koula, FrantiSek Libra and Josef Fuchs. Mediating between the two factions, Krejcar arrived at his own emotionally expressive form of Constructivism, as found in the villa he designed for the writer Vladislav Vancura on a site near Prague [123].

All, however, with the exception of Van der Leck and Oud, were signatories of the eight-point manifesto published in 1918 in the second issue of the magazine De Stijl. This, the first manifesto of De Stijl, called for a new balance between the individual and the universal and for the liberation of art from both the constraints of tradition and the cult of individuality. Influenced as much by the philosophical thought of Spinoza as by the Dutch Calvinistic background from which they all came, they sought a culture that would transcend the tragedy of the individual by its emphasis on immutable laws. This universal and utopian aspiration was succinctly summed up by their aphorism: The object of nature is man, the object of man is style. By 1918 the movement had already been influenced by the Neo-Platonic, not to say theosophical, philosophy of the mathematician M.H.

Schoenmaeker s metaphysical world view was complemented by more concrete attitudes and concepts drawn directly from Berlage and Wright, the latter having become known in Europe through the publication in 1910 and 1911 of the two famous Wasmuth volumes dedicated to \r",{"entities":[[28,36,"PER"],[54,62,"PER"],[167,180,"PER"],[185,202,"PER"],[238,254,"PER"],[328,340,"PER"],[369,386,"PER"],[388,408,"PER"],[413,426,"PER"],[443,453,"PER"],[455,472,"PER"],[477,485,"PER"],[500,517,"PER"],[621,633,"PER"],[638,641,"PER"],[743,752,"PER"],[1009,1016,"PER"],[1456,1474,"PER"],[1553,1571,"PER"],[1781,1788,"PER"],[1793,1799,"PER"]]}],["his work. Berlage, on the other hand, was more influential for his sociocultural criticism, and it was from him that the De Stijl artists had appropriated the title The Style , which he in turn had probably taken from Gottfried Semper s critical study, Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen Kdnsten oder praktische Asthetik, of 1860. The appearance of Mondrian s first post-Cubist compositions, consisting largely of broken horizontal and vertical lines, coincided with his return to Holland from Paris in July 1914 and with the period that he and Van der Leck spent in Laren in almost daily contact with Schoenmaekers. From Schoenmaekers came the term Neo-Plasticism - from his coinage of nieuwe beelding - and from him too came the restriction of the palette to the primary colours of whose cosmic significance he wrote in Het nieuwe Were/dbeela: The three principal colours are essentially yellow, blue and red. They are the only colours existing ... yellow is the movement of the ray (vertical) ... blue is the contrasting colour to yellow (horizontal firmament) ... red is the mating of yellow and blue. Elsewhere in the same text he provided a comparable justification for limiting Neo-Plastic expression to orthogonal elements: The two fundamental, complete contraries which shape our earth and all that is of the earth are: the horizontal line of power, that is the course of the earth around the sun, and the vertical, profoundly spatial movement of rays that originate in the centre of the sun. For all his formative influence Schoenmaekers played no direct role in the aesthetic evolution of De Stijl. This was left to Van der Leck and Vantongerloo, whose very independence as artists caused them to split from Van Doesburg at an early date. Yet without their contributions it is doubtful if the characteristic De Stijl aesthetic could have been formulated with such clarity in so short a time. It is obvious, for example, that Van Doesburg s famous abstraction The Cow, of 1916, owes much to Van der Leck, while Vantongerloo s sculpture /nterrelation of Masses, of \r",{"entities":[[10,17,"PER"],[121,129,"PER"],[218,234,"PER"],[359,367,"PER"],[491,498,"LOC"],[504,509,"LOC"],[555,567,"PER"],[1610,1619,"PER"],[1637,1649,"PER"],[1654,1666,"PER"],[1729,1741,"PER"],[1829,1837,"PER"],[1946,1958,"PER"],[2031,2043,"PER"]]}],["1919, clearly anticipates the general massing of the Van Doesburg and Cor van Eesteren house projects of 1923. And even the aloof Mondrian, in the last number of De Stij/ (1932) - dedicated to the memory of Van Doesburg - brought himself to acknowledge his debt to Van der Leck, for the latter s use, as early as 1917, of saturated primary colours. The years 1914-16 had seen Mondrian in Laren, in frequent contact with Schoenmaekers. During this period he wrote his basic theoretical text, De Nieuwe Beelding in de Schilderkunst ( Neo-Plasticism in Painting ), which appeared in 1917 in the first issue of De Stijl. The enforced seclusion and meditation of the war years brought Mondrian to a new point of departure. His work now comprised a series of compositions consisting of floating, rectangular, coloured planes. Both he and Van der Leck had now arrived at what they each considered to be a totally new and pure plastic order, with the much younger Van Doesburg closely following their lead. Yet while Mondrian remained involved in planar compositions set within the shallow space of the picture plane, as represented in his Composition with Coloured Planes on a White Ground of 1917, Van der Leck and Van Doesburg were to arrive at a linear structuring of the picture plane itself, through the use of narrow bars of colour, etched in a white field. Van Doesburg s The Cow dates from this period, as does his Rhythm of a Russian Dance of 1918, both works being influenced by Van der Leck. The first architectural work associated with De Stijl was created by Robert van t Hoff, who had seen Wright s work on a visit to America before the war and in 1916 built a remarkably convincing Wrightian villa on the outskirts of Utrecht. Aside from this pioneering reinforced-concrete house at Huis ter Heide and a number of less elegant Wrightian works by Wils, there was comparatively little architectural activity in the early phases of De Stijl.

After abstaining from the 1918 manifesto he took pains to establish his artistic independence. He seems to have found in the compositions of the Austrian architect Josef Hoffmann a means for detaching himself from the more structural interests of De Stijl. The single exception to this was his Purmerend factory project of 1919, wherein Neo-Plastic elements were rather diffidently applied to an otherwise bland assembly of masses. There was, in effect, very little Neo-Plastic architecture before 1920, when it made its first appearance in the work of Rietveld. Prior to 1915 Rietveld had taken courses with the architect PJ. Klaarhamer, who, while never associated with De Stijl, was collaborating at the time with Van der Leck. The year 1917 saw the creation of the famous Red/Blue chair designed by Rietveld. This simple piece of furniture, based on a traditional folding bed-chair, provided the first occasion for a projection of the Neo-Plastic aesthetic into three dimensions. In its form, the bars and planes of Van der Leck s compositions were now realized as articulated and displaced elements in space. Aside from its articulation, the chair was distinguished by its exclusive use of primary colours in conjunction with a black frame - a combination which, with grey and white added, was to become the standard colour scheme of the De Stijl movement. Its structure enabled Rietveld to demonstrate an open architectonic organization that was manifestly free from the influence of Wright. It still predicated a Gesamtkunstwerk, but one that was free from the biological analogies of 19th- century synthetic Symbolism, that is to say, from Art Nouveau. Few, if any, of Rietveld s colleagues could have foreseen the full potential of the modest pieces of furniture that he went on to design between 1918 and 1920 - the buffet [127], baby cart and wheelbarrow which, as direct \r",{"entities":[[29,38,"LOC"]]}],["developments of the Red/Blue chair, were assembled from rectilinear wooden spars and planes, simply dowelled together. None of these pieces, however, fully anticipated the architectural environment attempted by Rietveld in his design for Dr Hartog s study, built at Maarssen in 1920. In this work each piece of furniture, including the suspended light fitting, appeared to be elementarized , and the effect was to imply, like Mondrian s later paintings, an infinite series of coordinates in space. 127 Rietveld, buffet, 1919. In many respects Van Doesburg embodied the movement in himself, for by 1921 the composition of the group had radically altered. Van der Leck, Vantongerloo, Van t Hoff, Oud, Wils and Kok had all by then disassociated themselves from De Stijl, while Mondrian had re-established himself as an independent artist in Paris. This Dutch defection convinced Van Doesburg that it was necessary to proselytize for De Stijl abroad. The fresh blood brought into the movement in 1922 reflected his international orientation. Of the new members of that year only one was Dutch, the architect Van Eesteren; the others were Russian and German - the architect, painter and graphic designer El Lissitzky and the film-maker Hans Richter. It was at Richter s invitation that Van Doesburg first visited Germany in 1920, and from this visit followed an invitation from Gropius to come to the Bauhaus in the following year. Van Doesburg s brief stay in Weimar in 1921 engendered a crisis within the Bauhaus, the repercussions of which have since become legendary, for the impact of his ideas on the students and faculty was both immediate and marked. Even Gropius who, under the circumstances, had reason to be apprehensive, designed in 1923 a suspended light for his own study which \r",{"entities":[]}],["displayed an undeniable affinity to the Rietveld fitting designed for Hartog. Of greater importance for the second phase of the De Stijl movement, lasting until 1925, was Van Doesburg s meeting with Lissitzky. Just two years before this meeting Lissitzky had developed his own form of Elementarist expression, evolved in collaboration with Kasimir Malevich at the Suprematist school in Vitebsk. Although Russian and Dutch Elementarism had quite independent origins - the one Suprematist, the other Neo-Plastic - Van Doesburg s work was transformed. After 1921, under the impact of Lissitzky s Proun compositions, both he and Van Eesteren began to project, as axonometric drawings, a series of hypothetical architectural constructs, each comprising an asymmetrical cluster of articulated planar elements suspended in space about a volumetric centre. Van Doesburg invited Lissitzky to become a member of De Stijl and in 1922 Lissitzky s abstract-typographic children s fable of 1920, The Story of Two Squares , appeared in the pages of the magazine. It is significant that the magazine itself changed its format at this juncture, Van Doesburg replacing the frontal composition and woodcut logotype designed by Huszar with an asymmetrical, Elementarist layout and a Constructivist logo. In 1923 Van Doesburg and Van Eesteren managed to crystallize the architectural style of Neo-Plasticism in an exhibition of their work, at L once Rosenberg s Paris gallery, L Effort moderne . This show was an immediate success and in consequence was restaged elsewhere in Paris and later in Nancy. Apart from the axonometric studies previously mentioned it included their project for a house for Rosenberg and two other seminal works, their study for the interior of a university hall and their project for an artist s house [128]. \r",{"entities":[[1208,1214,"PER"],[1456,1472,"ARCH"]]}],["128 Van Eesteren and Van Doesburg, preparing for the Rosenberg exhibition in Paris, 1923, with a model of their artist s house . Meanwhile in Holland, Huszar and Rietveld collaborated on the design for a small room to be built as part of the Grosse Berliner Kunstausstellung of 1923, Huszar designing the environment and Rietveld the furniture, including the important Berlin chair. Simultaneously, Rietveld began to work on the design and detailing of the Schr der-Schrader House in Utrecht [L29, 130]. This house, built at the end of a late 19th-century terrace, was in many respects a realization of Van Doesburg s Naar een beeldende architectuur ( 16 points of a Plastic Architecture ), published at the time of its completion. It fulfilled his prescription, being elementary, economic and functional, unmonumental and dynamic; anti-cubic in its form and anti-decorative in its colour. Its main living level on the top floor, with its open transformable plan , exemplified, despite its traditional brick and timber construction, his postulation of a dynamic architecture liberated from the encumbrance of load- bearing walls and the restrictions imposed by pierced openings.

In this way architecture acquires a more or less floating aspect that, so to speak, works against the gravitational forces of nature.? The third and last phase of De Stijl activity, lasting from 1925 to 1931, was announced by a dramatic rift between Mondrian and Van Doesburg over the latter s introduction of the diagonal into his paintings, in a series of counter- compositions that he had completed in 1924. By now the initial unity had been lost, as much by Van Doesburg s incessant polemical activity as by his arbitrary modification of the Neo-Plastic canon. From his association with Lissitzky he had come to regard social structure and technology as among the prime determinants of form, irrespective of any concerns he might still entertain for the De Stijl ideal of universal harmony. By the mid-1920s he realized that universality could, by itself, only produce an artificially delimited culture, which by virtue of its antipathy to everyday objects could only be against the initial De Stijl concern - subscribed to even by Mondrian - for the unification of art and life. Van Doesburg seems to have opted for a Lissitzkian solution to this dilemma, whereby both the environmental scale and status of the object should determine the degree to which it may be manipulated in accordance with an abstract conception. Thus, while furniture and equipment as produced by the society at large ought to be accepted as the ready-made objects of the culture, the built environment itself could and indeed should still be made to conform to a higher order. Van Doesburg and Van Eesteren gave an idealized version of this position in their essay Vers une construction collective ( Towards a Collective Construction ), published in 1924, in which they tended towards a more objective and technical solution to the problem of architectural synthesis: \r",{"entities":[[278,286,"PER"],[1064,1072,"PER"]]}],["We must realize that life and art are no longer separate domains. That is why the idea of art as an illusion separate from real life must disappear. The word Art no longer means anything to us. In its place we demand the construction of our environment in accordance with creative laws based upon a fixed principle. These laws, following those of economics, mathematics, technique, sanitation, etc., are leading to a new plastic unity.? Later one reads, under the seventh point of the manifesto, the essence of the spirit that was to inform Van Doesburg s last major work, the Caf L Aubette of 1928: We have established the true place of colour in architecture and we declare that painting, without architectural construction (that is, easel painting), has no further reason for existence.* Rietveld had little association with Van Doesburg after 1925. Nonetheless, his work developed in a similar direction, away from the Elementarism of the Schr der House and his early orthogonal furniture, towards more objective solutions arising out of the application of technique. Rietveld started in this direction by redesigning the seats and backs of his chairs as curved planes, not only because such shapes were more comfortable, but also because they possessed greater structural strength. This led naturally to the technique of wood lamination and from there it was but a step, once the inhibiting Neo-Plastic aesthetic had been relinquished, to moulding a chair out of a single sheet of plywood. Rietveld s two-storey chauffeur s house, built in Utrecht in 1927, was largely the product of a similar approach, where despite - or rather because of - its use of advanced technique, little of the original De Stijl aesthetic was left. Instead of primary colours, the exposed steel frame and concrete panels were painted black, and the \r",{"entities":[[577,590,"ARCH"],[1545,1552,"LOC"]]}],["surface of the panels themselves overpainted with a grid of white squares. Removed from Van Doesburg s conception of anti-cubic space as set out in his 16 Points of a Plastic Architecture , it was more determined by technique than by any drive towards universal form. The Caf L Aubette in Strasbourg, designed in 1928, comprised a sequence of two large public rooms and ancillary spaces set within an 18th-century shell. These rooms were designed and realized by Van Doesburg in association with Hans Arp and Sophie Tauber Arp. While Van Doesburg controlled the general theme each artist was free to design his or her own room. With the single exception of Arp s mural, all the rooms were modulated by shallow abstract wall reliefs, colour, lighting and equipment being integrated into each composition. Van Doesburg s own scheme [131] was, in effect, a reworking of his 1923 project for a university hall, in which a diagonal Elementarist composition had been deliberately imposed on all the surfaces of a partially orthogonal space. Van Doesburg s interior in L 'Aubette was similarly dominated and distorted by the lines of a huge diagonal relief or counter- composition, passing obliquely over all the internal surfaces. This fragmentation through relief - an extension of Lissitzky s Proun room approach of 1923 - was complemented by the fact that the furnishing was free of any Elementarist pieces. In their place Van Doesburg designed standard bentwood chairs and elsewhere employed extremely objective detailing. The tubular railing throughout was simply welded, while the main lighting consisted of bare light bulbs bracketed off two metal tubes suspended from the ceiling. 131 Van Doesburg, Caf L Aubette, Strasbourg, 1928-29. \r",{"entities":[[272,285,"ARCH"],[289,299,"LOC"],[1701,1714,"ARCH"],[1716,1726,"LOC"]]}],["L Aubette, finished in 1929, is the last Neo-Plastic architectural work of any significance. Thereafter those artists who were still affiliated with De Stijl, including Van Doesburg and Rietveld, came increasingly under the influence of the Neue Sachlichkeit and thereby subject to the cultural values of international socialism. Van Doesburg s own house, built in Meudon about 1929, barely fulfils any of the sixteen points of his 1924 manifesto. It is simply a utilitarian studio, of rendered reinforced-concrete frame and block construction, superficially resembling the type of artisan dwelling that had already been projected by Le Corbusier in the early 1920s. For fenestration Van Doesburg chose to use the standard French industrial sash, and for furniture he designed his own version of a sachlich chair in tubular steel. By 1930 the Neo-Plastic ideal of uniting the arts and transcending the division of art and life had been relinquished and returned to its origins in abstract painting, to the art concert of Van Doesburg s counter- compositions hung on the walls of his studio in Meudon. Yet Van Doesburg s conscious concern for a universal order remained alive, for in his last polemic, Manifeste sur I art concret (1930), he wrote: If the means of expression are liberated from all particularity, they are in harmony with the ultimate end of art, which is to realize a universal language. How these means were to become liberated in the case of applied art, such as furniture and equipment, was not made clear. A year later, at the age of forty-eight, Van Doesburg died in a sanatorium in Davos, Switzerland, and with him died the moving force of Neo-Plasticism. Of the original De Stijl artists only Mondrian seems to have remained committed to the strict principles of the movement, to the orthogonal and the primary colours which were the constituent elements of his mature work. With these he continued to represent the harmony of an unrealizable utopia.

Above all it seems necessary to remark on the distant Albigensian background of his otherwise Calvinist family, on that half-forgotten but latent Manichean view of the world which may well have been the origin of his dialectical habit of mind. | am referring to that ever-present play with opposites - with the contrast between solid and void, between light and dark, between Apollo and Medusa - that permeates his architecture and is evident as a habit of mind in most of his theoretical texts. Le Corbusier was born in 1887 in the Swiss watchmaking town of La Chaux-de-Fonds, which is situated in the Jura, close to the French frontier. One of the prime images of his adolescence must have been this highly rational gridded industrial town that had been rebuilt after its destruction by fire some twenty years before his birth. During his training as a designer-engraver at the local school of arts and crafts, Charles Edouard Jeanneret (as he then was) became involved in his late teens in the last phases of the Arts and Crafts movement. The Jugendstil manner of his first house, the Villa Fallet of 1905, was a crystallization of all that he had been taught by his master, Charles L Eplattenier, director of the cours sup rieur at the applied art school in La Chaux-de-Fonds. L Eplattenier s own point of departure had been Owen Jones, whose book The Grammar of Ornament (1856) was a definitive compendium of decorative art. L Eplattenier aimed to create a native school of applied art and building for the Jura region and, after Jones, he taught \r",{"entities":[[823,863,"LOC"],[1434,1459,"PER"],[1609,1621,"ARCH"],[1699,1720,"PER"],[1802,1815,"PER"]]}],["his students to derive all ornament from their immediate natural environment. The vernacular type and d cor of the Villa Fallet were exemplary in this respect: its overall form was essentially a variation on the wood and stone farmhouses of the Jura, while its decorative elements were derived from the flora and fauna of the region. Despite his admiration for Owen Jones, for the Budapest- trained L Eplattenier the cultural centre of Europe remained Vienna, and his one ambition was that his prime pupil should be apprenticed there to Josef Hoffmann. Accordingly, in the autumn of 1907 Le Corbusier was dispatched to Vienna. He was cordially received, but he seems to have rejected Hoffmann s offer of work and with it the sophistries of the now classicized Jugendstil. Certainly the designs that he made in Vienna for further houses, to be completed in La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1909, show little trace of Hoffmann s influence. This apparent disaffection with the Jugendstil in its decline was encouraged by a meeting with Tony Garnier in Lyons, in the winter of 1907, just as Garnier was beginning to amplify his 1904 project for a Cit Industrielle. Le Corbusier s utopian socialist sympathies and his susceptibility to a typological - not to say Classical - approach to architecture certainly date from this meeting, about which he wrote: This man knew that the imminent birth of a new architecture depended on social phenomena. His plans displayed a great facility. They were the consequence of one hundred years of architectural evolution in France. The year 1907 may be regarded as the turning point of Le Corbusier s life, for in that year he not only met Garnier, but he also made a crucial visit to the Charterhouse of Ema, in Tuscany. There he experienced for the first time the living commune which was to become the socio-physical model for his own reinterpretation of the utopian socialist ideas that he had inherited in part from L Eplattenier and in part from Garnier. Later he was to describe the Charterhouse as \r",{"entities":[]}],["an institution in which an authentic human aspiration was fulfilled: silence, solitude, but also daily contact with men. In 1908, Le Corbusier obtained part-time employment with Auguste Perret in Paris, whose reputation had already been made through his domestication of the reinforced- concrete frame in his apartment block built in the Rue Franklin in 1904. The fourteen months that Le Corbusier spent in Paris afforded him a totally new outlook on both life and work. Aside from receiving a basic training in reinforced-concrete technique the capital gave him the chance to broaden his knowledge of French Classical culture, by visiting the museums, libraries and lecture halls of the city. At the same time, much to the disapproval of L Eplattenier, he became convinced through his contact with Perret, that b ton arm was the material of the future. Aside from its malleable monolithic nature, durability and inherent economy, Perret valued the concrete frame as an agent for resolving the age-old conflict between the structural authenticity of the Gothic and the Humanist values of Classical form. The impact of all these diverse experiences may be gauged from the project that he made for his alma mater, on his return to La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1909. This building, evidently conceived in reinforced concrete, consisted of three stepped tiers of artists studios, each with its own enclosed garden, arranged around a central communal space covered by a pyramidal glass roof. This free adaptation of the Carthusian cell form, with its connotations of communality, was the first instance in which Le Corbusier reinterpreted a received type in order to accommodate the programme of an entirely new type. Such typological transformations, with their spatial and ideological references, were to become an intrinsic part of his working method. Since this synthetic procedure was impure by definition, it was inevitable that his works should become charged with references to a number of different \r",{"entities":[[130,142,"PER"],[178,192,"PER"],[407,412,"LOC"],[931,937,"PER"]]}],["antecedents at once. For all that this process may at times have been partly unconscious, the art school must be seen as being as much an heir to Godin's Familist re of 1856 as it was a reinterpretation of Ema. Nevertheless Ema was to remain embedded in Le Corbusier s imagination as an image of harmony to be reinterpreted innumerable times, first on a large scale in his Immeuble-Villa project of 1922 and then, less directly, in the residential block types that he designed, throughout the next decade, for his hypothetical city plans. Le Corbusier went to Germany in 1910 ostensibly to further his knowledge of reinforced-concrete technique, but while he was there he was commissioned by the art school of La Chaux-de-Fonds to study the state of decorative art. This undertaking, which resulted in a book, brought him into contact with all the major figures of the Deutsche Werkbund, above all with Peter Behrens and Heinrich Tessenow, the two artists who were to exercise a strong influence on two of his later works in La Chaux-de-Fonds - the Villa Jeanneret P re of 1912 and the Scala Cinema of 1916. Aside from this, the Werkbund contact made him conscious of the achievements of modern production engineering, the ships, automobiles and aircraft that were to form the substance of his polemical essay Des Yeux qui ne voient pas. At the end of the year, after five months in the office of Behrens, where he would certainly have met Mies van der Rohe, he left Germany to take up a teaching post at La Chaux-de-Fonds, offered him by L Eplattenier. Before returning to Switzerland, however, he made an extensive tour of the Balkans and Asia Minor, and henceforth Ottoman architecture was to be a muted but decided influence on his work. This much is evident from his lyrical record of the trip, his Voyage d Orient of 1913. The five years prior to 1916 shaped the orientation of his future career in Paris.

In 1913 he established his own office in La Chaux-de-Fonds, ostensibly to specialize in b ton arm . In 1915, in conjunction with his boyhood friend, the Swiss engineer Max du Bois, he evolved two ideas that were to inform his development throughout the 1920s - his reinterpretation of the Hennebique frame as the Maison Dom-Ino, which was to be the structural basis of most of his houses up to 1935, and the Villes Pilotis , a city projected as being built on piles, the concept of the elevated street evidently deriving from Eug ne H nard s Rue Future of 1910. The year 1916 saw the culmination of his early career in La Chaux-de-Fonds with the building of the Villa Schwob, which was an extraordinary synthesis of all that he had experienced so far. It was, above all else, an elaborate assimilation of the spatial potential of the Hennebique system, permitting its author to impose on a skeleton structure stylistic elements drawn from Hoffmann, Perret and Tessenow. There was even an erotic evocation of a seraglio, from which the building took its nickname of Villa Turque . At the same time, it was the first occasion on which Le Corbusier conceived a house in honorific terms, that is, as a palace. The alternately wide and narrow bay system and the symmetrical organization of the plan bestowed on the Villa Schwob a structure that was undeniably Palladian. Similar Classical connotations were indicated in the text that accompanied its publication in L Esprit Nouveau in 1921, wherein Julien Caron wrote: Le Corbusier had to resolve a delicate problem which was contingent upon making a pure work of architecture, as postulated by a design in which the masses were of a primary geometry, the square and the circle.

The first was the free-standing individual bourgeois villa of Palladian precedent, as exemplified in the masterly houses of the late 1920s; the second was the collective dwelling, conceived as a Baroque palace that could evoke through its set-back plan the ideological connotations of a phalanstery. Soon after he moved to Paris in October 1916 to establish a practice, Le Corbusier had the good fortune to be introduced by Auguste Perret to the painter Am d e Ozenfant, with whom he was to evolve the all-embracing machine asthetic of Purism. Grounded in Neo-Platonic philosophy, Purism extended its discourse to cover all forms of plastic expression from salon painting to product design and architecture. It was nothing less than a comprehensive theory of civilization which strenuously advocated the conscious refinement of all existing types. Hence it was as much against what Le Corbusier and Ozenfant regarded as the unwarranted distortions of Cubism in painting (see their first joint polemic entitled Apr s /e Cubisme of 1918) as it was in favour of the evolutionary perfection of, say, Thonet bentwood furniture or standard caf tableware. Their first full formulation of this aesthetic came with their essay entitled Le Purisme , which appeared in 1920, in the fourth number of the magazine L Fsprit Nouveau, a literary and artistic journal which they were to continue to edit with the poet Paul Derm e until 1925. Without doubt the most fertile \r",{"entities":[]}],["period of their collaboration came with the gestation of Vers une architecture which, prior to its publication as a book in 1923, was published in part in L Esprit Nouveau under the double pseudonym of Le Corbusier-Saugnier. This text - the credit for which in book form was appropriated by Le Corbusier - articulated the conceptual duality around which the rest of his work was to revolve: on the one hand the imperative need to satisfy functional requirements through empirical form, and on the other the impulse to use abstract elements to affect the senses and nourish the intellect. This dialectical view of form, introduced under the heading Esth tique et architecture de ingenieur , was exemplified by the most advanced engineering structures of the epoch, by Eiffel s Garabit Viaduct of 1884 and by Giacomo Matt Trucco s Fiat Works of 1915 to 1921. The other aspect of the Engineer s Aesthetic - product design - was represented by the ships, automobiles and aircraft which were featured as separate subsections under the general heading Des Yeux qui ne voient pas . The third section returned the reader to the antithesis of Classical architecture, to the lucid poetry of the Athenian Acropolis, which was appraised in the penultimate chapter under the title Architecture, pure cr ation de l esprit . Such was Le Corbusier s admiration of engineering exactitude that the profiles of the Parthenon were presented as being analogous to those now wrought by machine tools. He wrote: All this plastic machinery is realized in marble with the rigour that we have learnt to apply in the machine. The impression is of naked, polished steel. Over the first five years of his intense activity in Paris, during which he painted and wrote in all his spare time, Le Corbusier earned his living during the day as the manager of a brickworks and building materials plant at Alfortville. In 1922 he relinquished this position to enter into practice with his cousin Pierre Jeanneret, a contract which lasted until the \r",{"entities":[[767,773,"PER"],[776,791,"ARCH"],[807,826,"PER"],[1860,1881,"ARCH"],[1959,1975,"PER"]]}],["outbreak of the Second World War.

Be/fow, structure of Dom-Ino unit; above, perspective and plan showing possible grouping. The Dom-Ino prototype was evidently open to different levels of interpretation. While on the one hand it was simply a technical device for production, on the other it was a play on the word Dom-ino as a patent industrial name, denoting a house as standardized as a domino. This play acquired the force of a literal pun where the free-standing columns could be regarded in plan as domino dots and where the zigzag pattern of an aggregation of these houses resembled the formations of dominoes in play. With their symmetrical arrangement, however, such patterns could also acquire specific connotations by either resembling the typical Baroque palace plan of Fourier s phalanstery or alternatively by recalling Eugene H nard s Boulevard a Redans of 1903. With his own rue a redents of 1920, Le Corbusier managed to combine the image of the phalanstery with his own anti- corridor street polemic. At the same time he wished to see the Dom-Ino as a piece of equipment, analogous in its form and mode of assembly to a typical piece of product design. Such elements were seen by Le Corbusier as objets-types, whose forms had already become refined in response to typical needs. In Vers une architecture he wrote: lf we eliminate from our hearts and minds all dead concepts in regard to the house, and look at the question from a critical and objective point of view, we shall arrive at the House Machine , the mass-production house, healthy (and \r",{"entities":[[243,258,"ARCH"],[282,296,"ARCH"]]}],["morally so too) and beautiful in the same way that the working tools and instruments which accompany our existence are beautiful. The post-war attempt by the Voisin aeroplane company to break into the French housing market with an assembly- line production of timber houses was enthusiastically acclaimed by Le Corbusier in the second issue of L Esprit Nouveau. Yet at the same time he realized that such production could only be obtained through the exercise of high-grade skills under factory conditions, a combination of circumstances rare in the building industry. He acknowledged these limitations in his Maison Dom-Ino proposal which aside from the formwork and the steel reinforcement was designed to be built by unskilled labour. As early as 1919 he had adopted a comparable collagist approach to construction, when he proposed to use corrugated asbestos sheets as permanent shuttering for the concrete vaulted roof of his Maison Monol. In 1922 both the Maison Dom-Ino and the Villes Pilotis were further developed as the Maison Citrohan and the Ville Contemporaine , both projects being exhibited in the Salon d Automne of that year. Where the latter was directly evolved, at least in section, out of H nard s Rue Future of 1910, the former utilized the Hennebique frame to project a long rectilinear volume, open at one end, which approximated to the traditional megaron form of the Mediterranean. Within this basic type - designed in two successive versions - Le Corbusier projected for the first time his characteristic double-height living space, complete with a sleeping mezzanine and children s bedrooms on the roof. Aside from its roots in the Greek vernacular, this type, which he first produced in 1920, seems to have been derived from a workers caf in Paris, in the Rue de Babylone where he lunched each day with his cousin.

Perspective, ground and floor plans. While the Maison Citrohan, elevated on pilotis, came close to anticipating Les 5 Points d une architecture nouvelle, which Le Corbusier finally formulated in 1926, it was hardly applicable to anything other than suburban development. He was soon to use a version of it to this end in the garden city estates he built at Liege and Pessac in 1926 [136]. Among the 130 reinforced-concrete frame houses built at Pessac for the industrialist Henri Frug s, there was one prevalent type known as the skyscraper unit which was in effect a combination of the Maison Citrohan and the back-to-back units that he had designed for the city of Audincourt in the same year. A true version of the Citrohan type was not realized, however, until his work at the Stuttgart Weissenhofsiedlung of 1927. Pessac, as its mixture of unit types would indicate, was a culmination of his incessant attempts in the early 1920s to put his various designs for the standardized dwelling into production. The name Citrohan was a play on the patent name of the famous automobile company, indicating that a house should be as standardized as a car. Pessac showed the first conscious integration of Purist colour displacements into architecture. The architect observed at the time: The site at Pessac is very dry.

Again we have confused certain sections with the foliage of gardens and trees, through pale green facades.* Unlike his European contemporaries, Gropius [135] and Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier was anxious to develop the urban connotations of his architecture. The Ville Contemporaine for three million was the ultimate demonstration of this aspect in his work up to 1922. Influenced equally by the gridded skyscraper cities of the United States and the image of the city-crown as put forward by Bruno Taut in his book Die Stadtkrone (1919), Le Corbusier projected the Ville Contemporaine as an lite capitalist city of administration and control, with garden cities for the workers being sited, along with industry, beyond the security zone of the green belt encompassing the city. 135 Gropius, Frau Gropius and Le Corbusier in a Paris caf . 136 Le Corbusier, Pessac housing estate, near Bordeaux, 1926, on opening day. The city itself, textured like an oriental carpet and some four times the surface area of Manhattan, consisted of residential blocks some ten to twelve storeys in height plus twenty-four sixty-storey office towers in the centre, the whole surrounded by a Picturesque park which, like the traditional g/acis, maintained the class separation of the urban lite from the suburban proletariat.

None of this was lost on the Communist newspaper L Humanit , which regarded the entire project as reactionary. Their sense of Le Corbusier s commitment to Saint-Simonian methods of management and control was entirely confirmed by the publication of his book Urbanisme (The City of Tomorrow) in 1925, its last plate depicting Louis XIV supervising the building of the Invalides. Even Le Corbusier was sufficiently embarrassed by this image to place underneath its caption the rider that it was not to be understood as support for the French Fascist party Action Francaise. The Ville Contemporaine was no less ideological in the detailed organization of its residential districts, which were made up of two different block prototypes - the perimeter block [137] and the set-back or redent formation - each postulating a different conception of the city. The former was still committed to the idea of a walled city made up of streets, while the latter pre-supposed a wall-less open city , that vision finally to be achieved in the Ville Radieuse, of a dense city elevated above the surface of a continuous park. The implicitly anti-street polemic of this vision was finally made explicit in an essay on the street that Le Corbusier wrote in 1929 for the Syndicalist newspaper L /ntransigeant. 137 Le Corbusier and Jeanneret, Ville Contemporaine, 1922.

Notwithstanding their financial support, the car/aircraft cartel, Voisin was no doubt only too aware of the economic and political impossibility of raising vast cruciform towers next to the lle de la Cit . 138 Le Corbusier and Jeanneret, Plan Voisin proposal for Paris, 1925. The hand points towards the new business centre of the city. The most important and enduring contribution of the Ville Contemporaine was its Immeuble-Villa unit, an adaptation of the Maison Citrohan as a general type for high-rise, high- density living. These units, stacked up on six double floors, included garden terraces, one for each duplex, an arrangement which today seems to be one of the few acceptable solutions for high-rise family living. In the so- called cellular perimeter blocks of the Ville Contemporaine, these terraced duplexes opened at ground level to bounded rectangular green space, equipped with recreational facilities for communal use. The marginal provision of additional communal space within the block and around the periphery of this area and the intended provision of hotel service throughout situates this proposal somewhere between the bourgeois apartment block and the socialist collective dwelling (compare the phalanstery and Borie s A rodromes). The Immeuble-villa living unit was finally worked out in detail and exhibited as a prototype in the form of the Pavillon de L Esprit Nouveau, built for the Exposition des Arts D coratifs held in Paris in 1925.

This finely balanced assembly of folk, craft and machine-made objects, borrowed in spirit from Adolf Loos, was posited here under the patronage of the Minister for the Arts as a polemical gesture against the Art Deco movement. 139 Le Corbusier, Pavillon de l Esprit Nouveau, Exposition des Arts D coratifs, Paris, 1925, furnished with objets-types and Purist canvases by L ger and Le Corbusier. In 1925 Le Corbusier also returned to the theme of the bourgeois villa, first in his Maison Cook, completed in the following year as a demonstration of Les 5 points d une architecture nouvelle, which were published in 1926, and then in the project for the Villa Meyer, which anticipated the villa at Garches and the Villa Savoye at Poissy, completed in 1927 and 1929 respectively. All these houses depended for their expression on the syntax of the five points : (1) the pilotis elevating the mass off the ground, (2) the free plan, achieved through the separation of the load-bearing columns from the walls subdividing the space, (3) the free facade, the corollary of the free plan in the vertical plane, (4) the long horizontal Sliding window or fen tre en longueur, and finally (5) the roof garden, restoring, supposedly, the area of ground covered by the house. \r",{"entities":[[40,68,"ARCH"],[769,797,"ARCH"],[799,836,"LOC"],[1004,1015,"ARCH"],[1175,1186,"ARCH"],[1210,1226,"ARCH"],[1235,1247,"ARCH"],[1251,1257,"LOC"]]}],["The latent potential of the Hennebique frame in the Maison Dom-Ino and the solid lateral walls of the Maison Citrohan determined to an equal degree the basic parti of all these houses, with the liberal use of free-standing columns, strip-windowed facades and cantilevered floor slabs.

Palladio s Villa Malcontenta of 1560 and Le Corbusier s villa at Garches [140, 141] of some 350 years later are equally predicated in the longitudinal direction on alternating double and single bays producing a rhythm of 2:1:2:1:2.

Rowe goes on to contrast the centralization of the Villa Malcontenta with the centrifugality of the villa at Garches: At Garches the central focus has been consistently broken up, concentration at one point is disintegrated, and replaced by a peripheral dispersion of incident. The dismembered fragments of the central focus become, in fact, a sort of serial installation of interest round the extremities of the plan. Aside from its Purist layering of frontalized planes in space and its play with literal and phenomenal transparency, remarked on by Rowe and Robert Slutzky, Garches was significant for its resolution of a problem that had first been posed by Loos: how to combine the comfort and informality of the Arts and Crafts plan with the asperities of geometrical, if not Neo-Classical, form - how to reconcile the private realm of modern convenience with the public facade of architectural order. As Le Corbusier s Four Compositions of 1929 would indicate, Garches was able to achieve this, with an elegance denied to Loos, through the displacements afforded by the invention of the free plan. The disjunction, so to speak, of the complex interior was held away from the public front, by the elision of the free facade. If Garches is to be associated with the Villa Malcontenta, the Villa Savoye [142], as Rowe again points out, may be compared to Palladio s Villa Rotonda. The almost square plan of the Villa Savoye, with its elliptical ground floor and centralized ramp, may be read as a complex metaphor for the centralized and biaxial plan of the Rotonda.

The first was his Maison La Roche of 1923, which he presented in 1929 as a Purist version of the Gothic Revival L-plan - a genre plutdt facile, pittoresque, mouvement ; the second was shown as an ideal prism, and the third and fourth (the villa at Garches and the Villa Savoye) as alternative strategies for reconciling the first two, the former depending on a subtle integration of the first and second and the latter on the encompassing of the first by a prism. 143 Le Corbusier, the Four Compositions of 1929: (1) Maison La Roche, (2) villa at Garches, (3) Weissenhofsiedlung in Stuttgart, (4) Villa Savoye.

The competition's conditions stipulated two buildings, one for the secretariat and one for the assembly, and this programmatic duality led the architects to take an Elementarist approach to the design: the constituent elements being first established and then manipulated in order to generate a number of alternative arrangements. This extension of the Elementarism professed at the turn of the century by the Beaux-Arts master Julien Guadet would have come to Le Corbusier via Guadet s pupils, Garnier and Perret. That he was to adopt this approach generally when dealing with large complexes is shown by his preliminary studies for the project for the Palace of the Soviets, Moscow, of 1931 [145]. There under eight alternative arrangements we read the caption: the various stages of the project, wherein one sees the organs, already independently established, the one from the other, take up little by little their reciprocal places to culminate in a synthetic solution. We find a comparable remark appended to an alternative scheme for the SdN project published in Le Corbusier s Une Maison, Un Palais ( A House, A Palace ) (1928). Under a symmetrical layout (evidently more rational, from an operational point of view), we read: alternative proposition employing the same elements of composition .
