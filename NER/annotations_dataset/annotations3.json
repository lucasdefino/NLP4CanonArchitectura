Written in 1923 (though not published until 1926), it preceded the later German publications of Walter Gropius, Ludwig Hilberseimer, Walter Curt Behrendt, and Bruno Taut and sheds much light on them.? Today the Anglo-American audience remains largely familiar with European Modernism through the narrow focus of Henry-Russel Hitchcock and Philip Johnson s The International Style, 1932, although Hitch- cock s earlier Modern Architecture: Romanticism and Reintegration, 1929, had presented a somewhat more varied picture of recent developments. By con- trast, arguments about Modernism were articulated in surprisingly rich and complex ways in the aforementioned European works of the 1920s. Behne's Der moderne Zweckbau is crucial for understanding modernist polernics contextually, especially those later subsumed under the notion of functionalism. In a general sense, the increasing concern with purpose and Sachlichkeit in early Modernism signifies the change from older, aristo- cratic value systems to an emphasis on everyday and common experience as the new paradigm. Behne s text is also helpful in reconsidering some of the standard assumptions and questions about this period, especially the presumption of a visually coherent style. Instead of emphasizing the exter- nal appearance of buildings, German texts dealing with Modernism in the 19208 identified the new architecture through its underlying conceptua premises. Contemporary expression was therefore seen as a reflection of philosophical attitudes toward modernity, and this view allowed for greater visual diversity perhaps only because an exact correspondence between idea and form was difficult to establish. The three-year delay in the publication of Der moderne Zweckbau reveals much about the competitive nature of early Modernism. Gropius had sought Behne s assistance in preparing the Bauhaus exhibition Internationale Archi- tektur in 1923; but when Behne in turn asked Gropius to change the con- tent or delay the publication date of the book of the same title (the first entry in the Bauhausbiicher, or Bauhaus book series, which was projected for publication in 1924) because of its similarity to Behne s own work, Gropius \r",{"entities":[[36,47,"PER"],[314,328,"PER"],[330,349,"PER"],[351,371,"PER"],[377,387,"PER"],[530,552,"PER"],[557,571,"PER"],[614,625,"PER"],[910,915,"PER"],[2025,2032,"PER"],[2044,2049,"PER"],[2080,2087,"ARCH"],[2146,2151,"PER"],[2166,2173,"PER"],[2301,2308,"ARCH"],[2396,2401,"PER"],[2414,2421,"PER"]]}],["refused. Gropius s decision to start a book series hampered Behne s efforts on other fronts as well. When Behne shortly thereafter approached J. J. P. Oud (whose work Behne had promoted in 1922 in his monograph on Dutch architecture) and asked him for material for his own book, Oud responded that he would prefer to have his work published in the Bauhaus book series. He clearly expected more publicity and credibility given the Bauhaus s insti- tutional backing. Nevertheless, books such as Gropius's Internationale Architektur, 1925, portrayed contemporary architecture as did Behne in an astonishingly varied way. Frank Lloyd Wright's Larkin Building and Erich Mendeisohn s equally massive-looking double house in Berlin were included among Inter- nationale Architektur s illustrations. Hilberseimer s Internationale neue Bau- kunst (New international architecture), which appeared in 1927 under the auspices of the German Werkbund, was similarly diverse in scope. Its exam- ples ranged from an apartment house by Jan Wils to housing by Taut, in addition to unexecuted schemes by Russian Constructivists. In Die neue Baukunst in Europa und Amerika (simultaneously published in English as Modern Architecture), 1929, Bruno Taut was also extraordinarily inclusive in his selection of examples. Whereas several of these books alluded to the perceived internationalism of contemporary architecture, only Behrendt s Der Sieg des newen Baustils The victory of the new building style), 1927, treated the new architecture as a style, as would Hitchcock and Johnson s later study.* Notwithstanding his title, even Behrendt presented a varied picture of contemporary architecture, one that included works by Hans Poelzig, Mendelsohn, and Willem Dudok. ie saw Wright's Robie House and Henry van de Velde s theater at the Werk- bund exhibition of 1914 as the key precedents to modern architecture; and he presented an organic plan by Hugo Haring next to Ludwig Mies van der Rohe s De Stijl-inspired plan for a brick country house so that side-by-side they appeared as equally central examples of the new style. But because Ger- man proselytizers of Modernism tended to downplay the aesthetic aspects of architecture, their criteria depended less on visual elements than did Hitchcock and Johnson s work. Reinforcing this attitudinal difference was the fact that contemporary architecture was commonly referred to in Ger- many as Neues Bauen (new building), just as in Holland it was known as Nieuw Bouwen. 5 It is not entirely clear why the term Neues Bawen became prevalent in the 19208. The word modern was more commonly used prior to 1923, as for example in Karl Scheffler s Moderne Baukunst, 1907, or, for that matter, Behne s Der moderne Zweckbau. Possibly under the influence of the general Expressionist conception of the new man, and more specifically the Neues Bauen exhibition of 1920 at J. B. Neumann's gallery in Berlin, and the popu- larization after 1923 of Gustav Hartlaub s Neue Sachlichkeit (conceived by him as a further evolution of Expressionism, nota reaction to it), the term new attained wide currency among the German avant-garde. Taut s Die neue Woh- nung (The new dwelling), 1924, suggests the link to Expressionism. Neu seems to have implied change and the progressivism associated with the new movement more clearly than the term modern. The latter seerns almost to have been perceived as a neutral chronological marker synonymous with contemporary. Behne himself signifies the shift from modern to neu in his Neues Wohnen Neues Bauen (New dwelling New building), 1927, and the emphasis on the new is apparent in the titles of Hilberseimer s Interna- tionale neue Baukunst, Behrendt s Der Sieg des neuen Baustils, or Taut s Bauen Der neue Wohnbau (Building The new domestic architecture), 1927. It is also possible that neu carried political overtones that had prewar origins in Germany. The weekly newspaper of the Social Democrats was called Die neve Zeit. Behne wrote an essay for this paper in 1914 on the rep- resentation of workers in art. His first book (subsequent to publication of his doctoral thesis) was titled Zur neuen Kunst (Toward the new art) and was published in 1915 by Der Sturm. Modern in a political context may have meant simply of the present time, whereas neue Zeit and by implication neu suggested a rupture with past times. Such contextual or regional shifts in terminology do not apply in the same way to the Anglo-American sphere, where modern continued to be the preferred term. It is significant that Taut s Die neue Baukunst in Europa und Amerika, 1929, appeared in its English edition of the same year under the title Modern Architecture. And Behrendt, the author of Der Sieg des neuen Baustils, 1927, later, while living in America, wrote Modern Building, 1937.1 There are, however, subtle variations even within the more general discus- sion of modern developments, as Alan Colquhoun has recently pointed out.'! Whereas in England in the 1950s the avant-garde of the 1920s was generally referred to as the Modern Movement suggesting a degree of activism and ongoing development today we tend to prefer Modernism, a word that seems to denote a historical period.

For this purpose Behne s Der moderne Zweckbau is the most revealing text. It fully explores and carefully sets the stage for later arguments and for the development of concepts such as Sachlichkeit (objectivity, functionalism) and Zweck (purpose, function). In this respect Behne s role is comparable to that of Hartlaub in the staging of the exhibition of 1925 on the Neue Sachlichkeit in painting. Beyond that, Behne, a critic of both art and architecture, was also an astute observer of the con- temporary scene. Although his writings do not have the acerbic consistency of Adolf Loos, many of his essays and books contain sharp, perceptive com- ments and critiques of the Werkbund, Expressionism, and the Bauhaus, as well as the work of close friends. He was not a practicing architect, yet he was not exactly a completely detached observer. Bene was a major partici- pant in Expressionist architectural groups after World War 1. Like Sigfried Giedion, he had the advantage of an academic education in art history and a close acquaintance with nearly all of the principal architects of his time. Adolf Bruno Behne was born in Magdeburg on 13 uly 1885, the son of an architect. When he was a year old his parents moved with him and his two older brothers, Erich and Karl, to Berlin. He grew up class districts of eastern Berlin near the Centralvie in one of the working- hhof (main slaughter- house) and attended a Gymnasium from which he graduated in 1905. His academic training commenced with the study of architecture at the Techni- sche Hochschule (Polytechnic school) in Berlin-Charlottenburg, but in 1907 he decided to study art history at the Friedrich-Wilhelm Universitat. After a stay in Italy, he produced his dissertation, Der Inkrustationssti] in Toscana (The incrustation style in Tuscany), in 1912. Among his teachers were Hein- rich Wolfflin (with whom Giedion had also studied) and Georg Simmel, the great philosopher and sociologist. Thereafter he taught in a Hochschule as well as a Volkshochschule (an adult education program), and he became part of the Volksbildungsbewegung (People s education movement). This move- ment was concerned with furthering education outside of academic institu- tions, and it remained an interest for Behne throughout his career. In 1913 he married Elfriede Schneider, the daughter of a railroad engineer, whom he had met through the mathematics club at the university. They had two daughters Karla, born in 1913, and Julia, born in 1921.4 Before the war Behne also belonged to the Choriner Kreis (Chorin circle), a group of young writers, artists, and architects that met on weekends for walks in the woods around the small town of Chorin near Berlin. Max Beckmann and Taut were also members of the group, and Behne formed a 4 long-lasting friendship with Taut.!* Among Behne s earliest articles were those in Die Hilfe the weekly journal published by Friedrich Naumann, a politician, former Protestant pastor, and one of the key organizers of the Werkbund. Naumann had founded Die Hilfe in 1894 as the organ of the pro- gressive wing of the Christian-Social movement. He had been interested in using the arts to improve the quality of products because he believed that doing so would raise the value of labor, improve the worker's status, increase his joy in work, and thus reverse the trend to proletarianization hitherto associated with the advance of capitalism. \"5 Together with the soci- ologist Max Weber, with whom he was closely associated, Naumann rejected the Marxist view that economics is the central factor in social change. Both men stressed the plurality and interdependence of causes. Behne s name appears for the first time as a member of the Werkbund in 1913, the year after he received his doctorate. Before World War 1 he published articles on the work of Peter Behrens and Taut. His articles appeared in Der Sturm, Die Welibiihne, Sozialistische Monatshefte, and Das neue Frankfurt, among many other periodicals. He wrote frequently on the role of the museum in the general education of the public and more specifically on the ambigu- ous nature of the framed picture in the museum setting. Since the museum imposes a change in context on all works of art, he saw the common concern with original art as a false issue. In his essay Das reproduktive Zeitalter (The reproductive era} of 1917, he seems to prefigure Walter Benjamin s well- known thesis about the effect of mass produced images on art.' Behne was also interested in advertising and its wide-ranging effects on culture: he once referred to Mendelsohn s urban buildings as Reklamearchitektur (adver- tising architecture). He did not, however, see eye-to-eye with the prevailing Werkbund policy imposing aesthetic standards on all aspects of daily life. Advertising, he wrote in 1924, was as central to a modern economy as money, and any attempt to control it through aesthetic regulations was bound to be counterproductive in that it would treat advertising as a purely formal problem. On the one hand, Behne did not believe that using art to mask a subject was necessarily good.'? On the other hand, he wrote about films as art as early as 1921, and he included the important role of film in his discussion of pedagogy.' As noted above, Behne s first book, Zur neuen Kunst was published in 1915 by Der Sturm, the major disseminator of contemporary, and particu- larly Expressionist, art. An excerpt from the book titled Expressionistische Architektur appeared in the magazine Der Sturm in the same year.

Behne s description of Expressionism was not narrowly Germanic or medievalizing, and his essay included Cubism and Futurism as equally important aspects of this contemporary expression. In 1915 Behne also wrote an article in Die Tat entitled Der Hass der Neutralen (The hatred of the neutrals), in which he complained about the lack of support for Germany during the early war years. He returned the idea of an avant-garde to its original military meaning when he wrote that those who did not commit themselves were fearful of the new. Behne was hardly alone in this attitude. The sociologist Weber described the war as great and wonderful, and Thomas Mann saw it as purification, liberation ...an immense hope. 2 Behne s position during the war years has led to a diverse set of assess- ments concerning his political beliefs. lain Boyd Whyte in his otherwise exceptionally informative Bruno Taut and the Architecture of Activism, 1982, uses this essay and Behne s association with the Choriner Kreis (among other things) to show that he (and Taut) were essentially conservative.?! Fol- lowing the Marxist, or more correctly Stalinist, argument of Georg Lukacs in his attack on Expressionism of 1934 (by this time he had become an apologist for Stalinism), Whyte finds conservatism endemic. Lukacs viewed Expres- sionism as counterrevolutionary because it was a product of imperialist cap- italism and therefore responsible for fascism. According to the Lukacsian formula, the association of Behne and Taut with the Choriner Kreis estab- lishes them as conservative, because the group's back-to-nature component can be regarded as part of the Wanderv gel Movement, which began in the 1890s. By the 1930s this movement was clearly an extension of the National Socialists nationalism and racialism; however, before World War 1, it was perhaps patriotic but not nationalist. ? As with the Werkbund, however, political uniformity cannot be ascribed to the members of any large orga- nization, By the same token, one cannot say that the Expressionists or mod- ernists were all liberal. A similar restrictive Lukacsian formula led Magdalena Bushart in Der Geist der Gotik und die Expressionistische Kunst (The spirit of the Gothic and Expressionist art), 1990, to categorize Behne as an oppor- tunist because of his later shift in political opinion. ? But not all changes of attitude reflect ulterior motives. Walter Benjamin, for instance, who was generally recognized as a Marxist in the 1920s, had participated in the Ger- man youth movement before 1914.%4 Lukacs s reductive argument was countered in the late 1930s by one of his former friends, the Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch (they had met in Simmel s seminar). Bloch wrote that Lukacs s opinions were based primarily on literary Expressionism, as opposed to painting and architecture. He argued further that Expressionism did in fact question basic social values and asserted the constructive value of utopianism. Bloch also found the Expressionists' inclusion of folk art from many countries more meaningful than the Neoclassicism that Lukacs had endorsed.* Most contemporary Neo-Marxist historians such as Manfredo Tafuri and Francesco Dal Co cite only Lukacs and not Bloch, thereby overlooking the vigorous debate and dis- agreements about a politically engaged art that took place in the 1920s and 19308. Possibly because of Lukacs s influence on recent literary criticism, his opinions about Expressionist literature have been carried over into the other arts of the period with which, however, he was not as familiar. Whyte is correct when he maintains that a shift in beliefs took place as World War 1 progressed. Some, like Taut, became pacifists. Behne joined the alternative service as a medical orderly during the war. As early as 1914 three of Behne's lectures were published by the educational committee of the Social Democratic Party (spp), and he wrote for the party s weekly, Die neue Zeit. In 1917, on the other hand, he wrote a book that was published under the auspices of the Diirerbund, a fairly conservative educational asso- ciation for the appreciation of art founded in 1902. In 1917 he also wrote an essay in praise of the Russian Revolution. 8 It is clear that at the beginning of his career his interest in a populist approach to art colored most of his associations. However, sometime during these early years he joined the spp, and in 1913 he had begun writing for Sozialistische Monatshefe, which publi- cized the international socialist movement. After the war he joined the uspp, the Independent Social Democratic Party and the schismatic left wing of the majority Socialists; this group had been founded in 1917 to call for an end to the war and to help politicize the labor force.29 Lukacs, in fact, had coupled his critique of Expressionism with an attack on the uspp. In his opinion the uspn s attitude toward revolution, like that of the Expressionists, was half-hearted. Lukdcs s scorn directed at Expression- ists and the uspp reflects the uneasy alliance between these groups and the Spartacists from 1919 on the Communists (krp} and their later extreme doctrinal split. By the late 1920s the kpp and the uspp had become arch- enemies. But in the last year of the war the Spartacists were loosely asso- ciated with the uspp, and in reality the uspp participated in the mislabeled \r",{"entities":[[139,144,"PER"],[333,338,"PER"],[675,680,"PER"],[784,795,"PER"],[967,982,"PER"],[1026,1036,"PER"],[1097,1102,"PER"],[1288,1300,"PER"],[1632,1637,"PER"],[1642,1646,"PER"],[2265,2282,"PER"],[2808,2819,"PER"],[3303,3318,"PER"],[3323,3344,"PER"],[3524,3530,"PER"],[3719,3724,"PER"],[3827,3831,"PER"],[3851,3856,"PER"],[4913,4919,"PER"]]}],[" Spartacus Uprising of January 1919. Both the spp and the KPD were working-class parties. The kpp, however, contained more unskilled and unemployed workers. The parties respective social programs reflected the differences in their makeups. The Social Democrats sought to develop orthodox Marxism into a Volkssozialismus (popular socialism) and Kultur- sozialismus (cultural socialism) within the capitalist system; the Com- munists, however, demanded radical change and regarded any reform as illusory. Much of the energy of the labor movement was dissipated by the intense enmity between these parties. After 1928 the change of policy of the Soviet Communist Party and the Comintern imposed complete sepa- ratism on the xpp, which became openly confrontational with the spp.?! If one talks about the fate of the Weimar Republic and the responsibility for the onset of fascism, a great deal of blame can be meted out not just to con- servatives but also to the Communists for their refusal to form an alliance with the Socialists. Luk cs s simultaneous attack of Expressionism and the uspp in 1934 must therefore be viewed not just in contrast with Bloch s response but even more as an instance of the hard-left approach of the German xpp and its ongoing internecine struggle with the competing workers party, the Social Democrats. By the end of the war Behne had become unquestion- ably associated with the uspp. In rg19 he complained in an article titled Unsere moralische Krisis (Our moral crisis), published in the Soziali- stische Monatshefte, that nothing had changed and that there had really been no break with old attitudes of nationalist arrogance.}? At the same time, Behne, although often critical of German society, retained the Social Demo- crats belief in the possiblity of reform. While some of his books were addressed to a cultural elite, many more of his publications in the 1920s were directed to a larger audience. Among these were his introductions to art and contemporary art respectively, both published in 1925 by the Arbeiter-Jugend Verlag, Die Uberfahrt am Schreckenstein: Eine Einfithrung in die Kunst (The passage to the Schreckenstein: An introduction to art) and Von Kunst zur Gestaltung: Eine Einfithrung in die moderne Kunst (From art to design: An introduction to modern art). His deep commitment as a teacher to the Volkshochschule Movement is another indication of his general agreement with the Social Democrats attempt to develop a popular and cul- tural socialism.*? Does Modernism Equal Functionalism? For many architectural historians, even those who are well acquainted with German developments in the 1920s, Modernism and functionalism have become nearly synonymous.** Within the comparatively brief period of Modernism, however, functionalism assumed many guises. Although it is not within the scope of this essay to do justice to the complexity of function- alist beliefs in modern architecture, some arguments about functionalism are useful to consider in order to understand both the underlying conven- tions of functionalism in the 19208 and the considerable misunderstand- ings that have become embedded in postmodern discussions. Two extreme positions regarding functionalism help to introduce suc- cinctly the conflicting issues of the history of the term and current reac- tions to it. Characteristic of the positive view of functionalism in the 1950s is Edward Robert de Zurko s excessively broad and uncritical history Origins of Functionalist Theory, 1957. Typical of the early postmodernist reaction against functionalism is David Watkin s rather narrowly conceived Morality and Architecture, 1977. The shared assumption in both works is that func- tionalism is synonymous with Modernism. Using a rather circular argument, de Zurko writes that the literature of functionalism consists largely of the writings of recognized functional- ists (such as Horatio Greenough, Louis Sullivan, and Taut). 3* Whereas de Zurko s book is perhaps too inclusive regarding ideas of purpose and utility, Watkin s tone is that of a postmodern scold. He belittles Le Corbusier's Vers une architecture, 1923, because, in Watkin's words, What is simple, suppos- edly functional, and materialistic in aim, light in colour, and immediately apprehensible in form enjoys advantages in terms of health and morality over other different or more complex solutions. Thus it must be imposed on society as soon as possible if we are to avoid revolution. He goes on to insist that the apocalyptic overtones of Le Corbusier s functionalist argument were later exaggerated by Taut in his Modern Architecture, 1929, and cites the fol- lowing passage from Taut to prove his point: If everything is founded on sound efficiency, this efficiency itself, or rather its utility, will form its own aesthetic law. A building must be beautiful when seen from outside if it reflects all these qualities... The architect who achieves this task becomes a creator of an ethical and social character; the people who use the building for any purpose, will, through the structure of the house, be brought 9 \r",{"entities":[[1679,1684,"PER"],[3407,3429,"PER"],[3581,3593,"PER"],[3965,3970,"PER"],[4043,4049,"PER"],[4101,4113,"PER"]]}],["to a better behaviour in their mutual dealings and relationship with each other. Thus architecture becomes the creator of new social observances.** If Watkin himself takes on a moralizing voice in his critique of moralizing theories (in this instance a Puginian trust in social control through architec- ture), de Zurko is more open-minded than most modernist historians in his belief that modern discussions of functionalism show a dual approach: the rational and the poetic. He cautions also that the frequency of statements by modern architects regarding functionalism indicates that functionalism is neither a clear and unchallenged law of architecture nor a spent force, but a vital concept requiring clarification. Important for understanding modern functionalism and Behne s attempt to categorize the various tendencies is de Zurko s discussion of two major nineteenth-century functionalist trends: the mechanical and the organic analogies. The former uses machines as a paradigm for aesthetic theory and is a response to the Industrial Revolution. Although the latter trend draws its references from nature and the former employs models of mechanical production, both could be invoked together. A clear and early example is the theory of the American sculptor Horatio Greenough, who in 1843 proposed a functionalist approach to architecture in order to create what he thought of as a tabula rasa, or hedge against the influence of the older European styles. He believed that functionalism could foster an indigenous American approach to design and recommended, Let us consult nature, and in the assurance that she will disclose a mine richer than was ever dreamed of by the Greeks. He went on to say that the law of adaptation is the fundamen- tal law of nature in all structure. Together with this organic justification, Greenough drew a parallel between natural selection and the production of man-made artifacts in general and machines in particular, If we compare the form of a newly invented machine with the perfected type of the same instrument, we observe, as we trace it through the phases of improvement, how weight is shaken off where strength is less needed, how functions are made to approach without impeding each other, how straight becomes curved, and the curve is straightened, till the straggling and cumbersome machine becomes the compact effective and beautiful engine. * In addition to the organic and mechanical paradigm, Greenough, through his close relationship with Ralph Waldo Emerson, gave his ideas an ethical dimension as well. Behne would also address all three functional concepts present in Modernism the organic, the mechanical, and the social but 10 whereas he described the first two in his role as a historian of the 19208, he only advocated a type including a social dimension. His advocacy of a social functionalism, in fact, resembles Louis Sullivan's polemics. Sullivan s dictum form follows function, stated first in 1888, employed two components of Greenough s functionalism. Its Lamarckian organi- cism is the most evident, and disregarding Greenough's mechanical anal- ogy, Sullivan gave the ethical aspect of functionalism greater importance. Although initially indebted to Transcendentalism as much as to Greenough, Sullivan came under the influence of Chicago School pragmatic realism and John Dewey s utilitarian instrumentalism in the 1890s. These philoso- phies assumed a complex interrelationship between human thought and action and the environment. This interrelationship contrasts with the simple behaviorist model of Pugin, in which the environment affects human action but not vice versa. Hugh Dalziel Duncan explains the Chicago School and Sullivan's dictum thus, Forms arise in attempts to solve problems in social action, form and function are real, not because of their relationship to an essence outside of or beyond action, but within action in society ? The distinctly utilitarian ethics of form follows function do not seem to have on the surface at least a direct relationship with Central Euro- pean ideas in the early twentieth century. However, Beline s stress on the social implications of functionalism, despite his rejection of utilitarian- ism as he understood it, cannot be divorced altogether from the social meaning of utilitarianism or from Sullivan s understanding of function as a social tool. Because form follows function is such an easy-to-recall, alliterative, and concise phrase, it has unfortunately been remembered far too often. In popular usage throughout the second half of the twentieth century, it has usually been forgotten that the phrase was coined by Sullivan, and today it is frequently associated with European Modernism in general or, just as often, with the Bauhaus specifically. In fact, form follows function and Bauhaus functionalism have become imprecise, interchangeable clich s that are used either descriptively by modernists or critically by postmodernists as a presumed shorthand for Modernism. n Hitchcock and Johnson's The International Style so important for introducing an American audience to European Modernism this confu- sion had not yet occurred. Hitchcock and Johnson, in fact, tried to discredit modern functionalism for its lack of aesthetic concerns: Il \r",{"entities":[[314,319,"PER"],[833,838,"PER"],[1268,1285,"PER"],[1830,1839,"PER"],[2452,2461,"PER"],[2499,2518,"PER"],[2565,2570,"PER"],[2882,2896,"PER"],[2909,2917,"PER"],[2999,3008,"PER"],[3126,3134,"PER"],[3259,3268,"PER"],[3270,3278,"PER"],[3344,3354,"PER"],[3580,3585,"PER"],[3653,3665,"PER"],[4653,4661,"PER"],[4821,4828,"ARCH"]]}],["Some modern critics and groups of architects both in Europe and in America deny that the aesthetic element in architecture is important, or even that it exists. All aesthetic principles of style are to them meaningless and unreal. This new conception, that building is science and not art, developed as an exaggera- tion of the idea of functionalism. In its most generally accepted form the idea of function is sufficiently elas- tic. It derives its sanctions from both Greek and Gothic architecture, for in the temple as well as in the cathedral the aesthetic expression is based on structure and function.* They held Hannes Meyer, in particular, responsible for a contemporary doc- trinaire functionalism, because he was an anti-aesthetic functionalist who claimed that the basis of all design must be economic. Lewis Mumford in an essay of 1951, Function and Expression in Archi- tecture, saw the failure of modern architecture, by contrast, to be its lack of symbolic communication. He identified an excessive reliance on a machine aesthetic and a misunderstanding of form follows function as the central problem in the later development of Modernism: Now all this is not to say that the doctrine that form follows function was a misleading one. What was false and meretricious were the narrow applications that were made of this formula. Actually, functionalism is subject to two main modifications. The first is that we must not take function solely in a mechani- cal sense, as applying only to the physical functions of the building. Certainly new technical facilities and mechanical functions required new forms; but so, likewise, did new social purposes and new psychological insights.*! For Mumford the modern period is an age of deep psychological explo- ration and heightened social responsibility. It is not just the age of Albert Einstein, Henry Bessemer, and Frederick Taylor but also the age of Charles Darwin, Henri Bergson, Sigmund Freud, and Pyotr Alekseyevich Kropotkin. Mumford s analysis is similar to that of Joseph Hudnut in his essay The Post-Modern House, 1945.*? Hudnut was then the dean of Harvard s influ- ential Graduate School of Design and was responsible for bringing Gropius to Harvard. He criticized the use of a dogmatic functionalism and struc- tural invention for its own sake. As early as 1931 (that is, before Hitchcock and Johnson), he had complained that the doctrine of functionalism could be obfuscating and mystifying if a rigid utilitarianism became the sole 12 principle of design. He regarded as naive the belief that beauty is automati- cally created by building logically, the shibboleth of form follows function. If this were correct, no school of architecture would have to concern itself with the teaching of beauty; it would be enough to teach economics, busi- ness, and the cost of materials. The present-day misunderstanding of modernist functionalism does not in fact spring from either Taut s or Hannes Meyer's conception; it is based on an overly narrow definition of function as a single issue that is presumed to be a practical design response within a specific building, one that does not seem to embrace environmental, social, or economic factors. In this later, simplistic version of functionalism, biological and utilitarian ideas have become not only hopelessly abbreviated, frozen, and canonical but also nearly meaningless. One problem with interpreting functionalism as if it were a law or mathematical theorem (the belief that there is indeed a specific form for each possible function) is that it is based on a fundamental misappre- hension of design procedures. In truth, a single function if it can ever be completely segregated conceptually from all other functions can be inter- preted by the architect in many appropriate formal expressions. Never- theless, form follows function in its popular conception may be difficult to dislodge because it provides a semblance of rules in an area where there are none. Not all architectural histories that address functionalism are as extreme as de Zurko s in their apparent unpolemical neutrality or as hotly polemi- cal as Watkin s. For instance, Heinrich Klotz in The History of Postmodern Architecture, 1988, makes a fair assessment of the difference between the functionalism of classical Modernism and a later vulgar or doctrinaire functionalism. He even takes time to discuss the less well-known organic functionalism of Haring, a form of modernist functionalism that Behne also deals with at length. The postmodern reaction against Modernism as well as the consequent tendency to present Modernism in an overly simplis- tic form has been most apparent in the Anglo-American sphere, whereas elsewhere attitudes have reflected a calmer evolutionary approach. In this context it is significant that Klotz s book, when it was first published in Ger- many in 1984, was called Moderne und Postmoderne: Architektur der Gegen- wart. The German title suggests that Modernism and postmodernism are simultaneously present in contemporary architecture; in the title of the American version Modernism has been banished. %3 \r",{"entities":[[619,631,"PER"],[814,827,"PER"],[1911,1925,"PER"],[1927,1940,"PER"],[1942,1955,"PER"],[1961,1990,"PER"],[1991,1998,"PER"],[2032,2045,"PER"],[2201,2208,"PER"],[2350,2359,"PER"],[2364,2371,"PER"],[2954,2966,"PER"],[4065,4070,"PER"],[4141,4147,"PER"],[4165,4179,"PER"],[4491,4496,"PER"],[4820,4825,"PER"],[4865,4874,"LOC"]]}],["Whereas de Zurko described the progress of functionalism uncritically, Colquhoun in his Essays in Architectural Criticism: Modern Architecture and Historical Change, 1981, assessed the possible meaning of functionalism in a few words but with far greater cogency: Positivism, in separating pure instrumentality from meaning, impelled architecture simultaneously toward eclecticism and functionalism. Ever since the late eighteenth century, architecture has oscillated between two poles of thought: that according to which all styles are possible and that according to which all styles are forbidden between synchronic and diachronic relativism. But diachronic relativism the belief in the continuous evolution of architec- tural form can be seen, from another point of view, as the continuation of the eighteenth-century search for the origins of architecture. There is still the sense of a return to the primitive statement unsullied by the historical accumu- lation of metaphor. We see then that the origins of modern functionalism lie in a very complex intermixture of the notion of architecture as relative and evolu- tionary and the notion of architecture as based on natural law.** Equally suggestive, Stanford Anderson in his essay The Fiction of Func- tion, 1987, has argued that functionalism is a weak concept, inadequate for the characterization or analysis of any architecture. He continues: It may be useful to recognize functionalism to the extent that one can find some naive functionalist arguments to contrast with Hitchcock and John- son s antifunctionalist rhetoric. However, any serious examination of the buildings at issue will reveal that none of them, whatever the surround- ing rhetoric, can be explained functionally. It was a fiction that function provided a crucial line of demarcation within modern architecture. *5 He goes on to describe functionalism in modern architecture as a specific form of fiction not a lie but a storyline that was used to describe a vision of the world that is richer and broader than the postmodern, truncated notion of functionalism projected onto Modernism. Of course, postmodernists demonized Modernism in the same manner that modernists demonized nineteenth-century eclecticism another form of fictionalizing the past, in this case with Gothic horror stories. Anderson's suggestion for studying the functionalist storyline of the modernists will allow us to comprehend their understanding and self-presentation vis-a-vis theory and architecture in its widest implications. Modernist texts need to be examined, therefore, in order to discover both their constructive and constructed fiction. 14 To date, a general awareness of specific modernist books is inadequate, perhaps because so few of these texts of the 19208 have been translated. Taut s Modern Architecture was the only one of the German books of this time that also appeared in English. Le Corbusier's Vers une architecture, translated into English in 1927, is really his own vision for a new architecture and is not about the work and ideas of his colleagues. In addition, many of the cen- tral texts of this period are not readily accessible. They are usually found in special collections of only the best libraries. It is not surprising, therefore, that the historically important International Style or Giedion s Space, Time, and Architecture, 1941, still form the basis for understanding Modernism. The Background to the Debate in Germany: The Structure and Politics of Education As a Competitive System During the 1920s Germany became the center of Modernism in architec- ture. The creation of the Bauhaus in 1919; the Werkbund Ausstellung Die Wohnung (a housing exposition held at Weissenhof in Stuttgart) in 1927 (with an international group of architects that included Mies, Le Corbusier, and Oud); and the meeting of cram 11 (Congr s Internationaux d Architec- ture Moderne) in 1929 in Frankfurt are only a few of the more publicized events. Germany s centrality in the architectural avant-garde is not entirely due to the presumed liberalism of the Weimar Republic, with which the revolutionary tendencies of the decade are often equated. The prelude to Germany (and Central Europe) becoming the interna- tional focus of modernist theory and debate must be sought, at least in part, in the exceptionally competitive and pluralistic educational system estab- lished in the course of the nineteenth century and fully in place by the end of the century.* This was not the case in France. The Acad mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture and the Acad mie Royale d Architecture (which merged in the nineteenth century to become the Ecole des Beaux-Arts) had been cen- tralized under Louis xrv in order to preernpt the power of the guilds. Similarly, the Ecole Polytechnique, founded in the late eighteenth century, followed in the tradition of the older Ecole des Ponts et Chauss es (School of bridges and roadways). Although both the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and the Ecole Polytechnique underwent considerable restructuring over the years, neither was decentralized until after the student protests of 1968. 5 \r",{"entities":[[11,16,"PER"],[1208,1225,"PER"],[1532,1541,"PER"],[1546,1555,"PER"],[3799,3803,"PER"],[3805,3817,"PER"],[3917,3926,"LOC"],[3973,3980,"LOC"],[4186,4193,"LOC"],[4199,4213,"LOC"]]}],["The difference in Germany was not the quality of the schools as such but the structural variation determined by the country s political history. In Ger- many, for instance, the struggle for control between the older guild system and the newer academies was not changed by the fiat of a powerful monarch as it had been in France. Debates about the respective merit of each contin- ued into the early 1920s and the beginning years of the Bauhaus, when the school vacillated between being a lodge for artisans and an elite academy turning out designers for industry. More importantly, because Germany consisted of a large number of inde- pendent principalities, the growth and development of architectural edu- cation differed from region to region. In the late eighteenth century, for instance, Prussia experimented with architectural instruction carried out in an art academy, but apparently because of an overemphasis on rules of taste and purely ceremonial expression, a separate school of architecture was founded in 1799, the Bauakademie in Berlin. Here construction and civic planning were given greater importance. The Berlin Bauakademie was united with the Gewerbeakademie (Crafts academy) in 1879 to form the Technische Hochschule (Polytechnic school). In the course of the nine- teenth century separate polytechnic schools, rather than architecture depart- ments attached to art academies, became the most prestigious schools of architecture, although those within art academies continued into the twenti- eth century. A polytechnic school was founded in Karlsruhe in 1825, in Dres- den in 1838, in Stuttgart in 1840, in Hannover in 1862, in Darmstadt in 1864, in Munich in 1865, and in Aachen in 1870. Still others were founded after Germany s unification in 1871.*8 Even after unification, polytechnic schools remained extraordinarily var- ied. Local traditions, once established, were not readily surrendered. Further- more, member states were not treated equally. The larger southern states, such as the kingdomis of Wiirttemberg and Bavaria, had exacted special priv- ileges not extended to other states. At any rate, the control of civil liberties, the police, and education belonged to the separate states, not the federal gov- ernment. Despite Prussia s attempt in the 1880s to establish educational standards for polytechnic schools in the Reich, it is not surprising that schools continued to differ in their pedagogical emphases, nor that those in the southern states, which had had a strong anti-Prussian history before 1871, were the most liberal institutions. Both the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart and that in Munich, for example, were less pedantic in their educa- tion than the Berlin polytechnic school, which emphasized memorization 16 and extremely long examinations. The schools in Karlsruhe, Darmstadt, and Dresden were more middle-of-the-road, somewhere between Berlin s con- servative institution and the more liberal ones in Stuttgart and Munich.*? The most important unifying factor among the various polytechnic schools was of course the German language, allowing professors and stu- dents to move from one school to another. Gropius, for instance, attended both the Berlin and the Munich Technische Hochschule. For this reason students and teachers were kept aware of pedagogical differences. Where students were unable to influence curricula, they could certainly vote with their feet. Add to this matrix the polytechnic schools in German-speaking countries among them, those in Vienna, Prague, Graz, Brno, and Zurich and one can see the obvious potential for a lively competition. At the same time, Germany, like most other countries, continued to rely on the older apprenticeship system. But unlike other countries, it also had a Bauschule (building school) or Baugewerksschule (building trade school); in 1957 such institutions were given the more impressive name Ingenieur- schulen fiir Bauwesen (engineering schools for the construction trade). The polytechnic school was the most academically structured of these options, requiring graduation from a Gymnasium, the higher secondary school attended only by those who plan to go on to a university. A diploma from a polytechnic school was also the prerequisite for administrative jobs with the governmental bureaucracy. In this respect, the German polytechnic school was comparable to attending the Ecole des Beaux-Arts or Ecole Poly- technique in France. The Bauschule, on the other hand, required only previous work as an apprentice. In Germany compulsory education ends at age fourteen with education in a Volksschule. For most of those entering an apprenticeship system, however, education continues in a trade school where classroom attendance is combined with on-the-job training. The Bauschule was close in conception to the trade schools set up for apprentices in other fields. Courses were usually given during the winter months when there was little construction, and summers were spent as an apprentice. The Bauschule, therefore, combined academic and apprenticeship training. It was in effect a part-time academy that retained the advantages of practical experience. The Munich Bauschule, the oldest, was founded in 1820, and the Weimar Bauschule was founded by Goethe in 1828. By the early twentieth century, architectural education had attained a hierarchic configuration with the greatest prestige residing in the most 17 \r",{"entities":[[18,25,"LOC"],[148,157,"LOC"],[321,328,"LOC"],[436,443,"ARCH"],[590,597,"LOC"],[1044,1051,"LOC"],[1563,1572,"LOC"],[1607,1616,"LOC"],[1629,1637,"LOC"],[1650,1659,"LOC"],[1672,1678,"LOC"],[1695,1701,"LOC"],[1743,1750,"LOC"],[2260,2267,"LOC"],[2616,2625,"LOC"],[2638,2644,"LOC"],[2898,2904,"LOC"],[2963,2972,"LOC"],[2977,2985,"LOC"],[3166,3173,"PER"],[3521,3527,"LOC"],[3529,3535,"LOC"],[3537,3541,"LOC"],[3543,3547,"LOC"],[3553,3559,"LOC"],[3642,3649,"LOC"],[4535,4542,"LOC"]]}],["academic training. Nonetheless, it was entirely possible for architecture stu- dents to avail themselves of ail three systems polytechnic school, Bau- schule, or apprenticeship really four systems if one includes the architecture departments in art academies. Thus the picture became even more cormn- plex and competitive. Taut, for example, studied at a Bauschule, then was apprenticed to several architects, and thereafter attended selected courses at the Berlin Technische Hochschule. Given the diversity of schools within the Reich as well as the ability of students to attend several schools of the same academic rank in different states and to participate in the various hier- archic levels of architectural training it becomes extremely difficult for the historian to make succinct generalizations about architectural education in Germany. One can only speculate that its basic structural complexity exposed young architects to a variety of competing approaches and philoso- phies, which in turn may account for the intensive debates surrounding architecture in the early twentieth century. The political change after 1918 would not have made an immediate impact, because the structure of these competing and interrelated pedagogical systems did not change drastically. Moreover, the modernists of the 1920s were all educated before 1918, at a time when these varied educational systems were all in place. A comparison of two influential architects and mentors, Behrens and Theodor Fischer, can perhaps explain why certain architects became impor- tant teachers for the generation that came into prominence in the 1920s and how these teachers were affected by their own varied regional and educa- tional backgrounds. Today, Behrens is still unfortunately seen as a proto- modernist to whom Gropius, Mies, and Le Corbusier were all apprenticed. As Stanford Anderson has pointed out, this definition of Behrens is a kind of back-forrnation introduced by such historians as Nikolaus Pevsner and Hitchcock;3 they saw Behrens through the work of his pupils and decided that he was the originator of modern industrial forms. A better case can be made, however, for viewing Behrens as an influential, if somewhat conser- vative, architect who received important commissions from German indus- try as well as from the Reich. His case is also interesting for demonstrating the shift from aristocratic to industrial, corporate patronage of crafts and architecture symptomatic of Germany s late industrialization, which was burgeoning in the early twentieth century and transforming the country into one of Europe s foremost manufacturing centers. Behrens s education as an architect was of the most unconventional sort, even in the context of the German pedagogical system. After receiving his 18 training as a painter, he worked in Munich, where in 1897 he became one of the cofounders of the Vereinigte Werkstitten fiir Kunst im Handwerk (United workshops for art in craft}, one of the several reformist arts and crafts associations that took their cue from the English Arts and Crafts Movement. In 1899 Behrens was one of seven artists invited by Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig of Hesse to become a member of the Darmstadt Artists Colony. Because Ernst Ludwig was Queen Victoria s grandson, he had made many trips to England, where he had come in direct contact with the English Arts and Crafts Movement, and he had commissioned M. H. Baillie Scott and C. R. Ashbee to design rooms for him in Darmstadt. The Darmstadt Artists Colony was the only one of such turn-of-the-century ventures to be orga- nized by an aristocratic patron, as opposed to the artists themselves. On the Mathildenhohe, a hill overlooking the city, Ernst Ludwig wanted to establish a New Athens in order to compete with nearby, more established cultural centers. The artists were paid a salary and were expected to produce a Volks- kultur. Their communal studio building, designed by the Austrian Joseph Maria Olbrich (the only architect in residence), was initially called the Arbeitshaus (house of work) and later the Ernst-Ludwig-Haus. The location of such an exclusive colony on the Mathildenh he above both city and palace, inverting the traditional hierarchy vividly revealed the grand duke s high regard for the arts. It was an arrangement that remains, nevertheless, intrinsically hierarchic. It simply placed the artist at the top of the pyramid in place of the ruler. If Ernst Ludwig expected a trickle-down effect from his New Athens, the architecture and crafts exhibited on the Mathildenhdhe never fostered a Volkskultur. On the contrary, some contemporary critics saw only an expression of luxury in the form of a Gesamtkunstwerk. In 1901, the year of the Mathildenh he s first exhibition, a deficit of 300,000 Marks was in- curred by the Artists Colony; this huge amount indicates that the artists were living like princes in the grand duke s not-so-rich Hesse.5! Similarly, the Wiener Werkstatte went through a series of near-bankruptcies and bailouts by wealthy patrons.%? This is not to question the beauty of many designs made by the Darmstadt group or the Wiener Werkstatte but rather their ability to bring their reforms to a wider audience as they intended. If they had studied the English Arts and Crafts development more diligently, they might have also discovered that William Morris had already encoun- tered the problem of crafts production as something only the well-to-do could afford. 19 \r",{"entities":[[323,327,"PER"],[838,846,"LOC"],[1469,1476,"PER"],[1481,1496,"PER"],[1731,1738,"PER"],[1797,1804,"PER"],[1806,1810,"PER"],[1816,1828,"PER"],[1854,1871,"PER"],[1908,1915,"PER"],[1978,1994,"PER"],[1999,2008,"PER"],[2020,2027,"PER"],[2174,2181,"PER"],[2830,2836,"LOC"],[3158,3170,"PER"],[3240,3252,"PER"],[3422,3441,"PER"],[3714,3726,"PER"],[3962,3982,"PER"],[4446,4458,"PER"],[5359,5373,"PER"]]}],["Despite the Artists Colony s shortcomings, Behrens s contact with this group was important for his subsequent career change. At Darmstadt, Behrens was the only artist who was allowed to design his own house; all other buildings were designed by Olbrich. Without even an architectural apprenticeship, Behrens made the transition from painting and arts and crafts to architecture. He left Darmstadt in 1903 to take over the directorship of the Kunstgewerbeschule (Arts and crafts school) in Diisseldorf. During his Diisseldorf period Behrens met the wealthy, young Karl Ernst Osthaus, who quickly replaced Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig as a more modern patron of the arts and architecture. Osthaus came from a banking and industrialist family and at the age of twenty-two had inherited 65 million Marks. He established the Folkwang Museum in Hagen, an exhibition space for con- temporary art with an interior designed by Henry van de Velde. Between 1904 and 1912 Behrens designed eight projects for Osthaus, including a plan of 1907 for Hagen-Eppenhausen, a garden suburb. Osthaus also became closely associated with the Werkbund and in 1909 helped to create the Deutsches Museum fiir Kunst im Handel und Gewerbe (German museum for art in trade and craft), in effect a Werkbund museum for traveling exhibitions. With Osthaus s patronage Hagen became a new cultural center, significantly in the middle of the industrial Ruhr district. In 1907 Behrens was named the chief architect and designer of the az, then Germany s foremost manu- facturer of electrical products, which had its headquarters in Berlin. His fac- tories for the arc and his designs of the company s electric products were, if not frank industrial expressions, symbolic expressions of industrial might. It was during this period that Gropius, Mies, and Le Corbusier were apprenticed to Behrens (not all at the same time). Each arrived with a differ- ent background, rather characteristic of any group of architects in Germany at the time. Gropius had the most formal education with four years of schooling at two different polytechnic schools. Mies had gone through sev- eral apprenticeships before joining Behrens, and Le Corbusier had attended an arts and crafts school at La Chaux-de-Fonds in the Swiss Jura, where he had initially learned to engrave watches. He arrived in Berlin, however, after an apprenticeship with Auguste and Gustave Perret in Paris. Behrens was not much their senior in terms of actual building experience, yet all chose to work for this artist-architect who had an ability to evoke powerful images. Le Corbusier in his report on German crafts and architecture, published in Switzerland in 1912, writes that Behrens s aEG Turbine Factory was referred to as a cathedral of labor, suggesting perhaps the reason for Behrens s 20 rapid progression from high art at the Mathildenhohe to industrial image- making in Berlin.* Behne would later take issue with Behrens as a modernist. Though less well known today, even among architectural historians, Fischer had a greater reputation as an architect and teacher than Behrens before 1914. Le Corbusier first set out for Munich hoping to work for Fischer, and only when Fischer did not have a place for him in his office did he ven- ture on to Berlin in 1910 (with recommendations and letters of introduction from Fischer). During this period Le Corbusier also met with Hermann Muthesius, Osthaus, Bruno Paul, Wolf Dohrn, and Heinrich Tessenow, all among the more recognized figures of the early Werkbund.5+ Le Corbusier may have preferred to work with Fischer because he dealt with issues of city planning and was much better and more conventionally trained as an archi- tect than Behrens. Fischer had been a student at the Munich Technische Hochschule and served an apprenticeship under Paul Wallot, the architect of the Reichstag in Berlin. In 1893 Fischer established himself as a practic- ing architect in Munich. He moved to Stuttgart in 1901 when he received an offer to teach at the Technische Hochschule there. He returned to Munich in 1909 and taught at the Munich Technische Hochschule until 1928. Among his many students and apprentices were Taut, Mendelsohn, Dominikus B hm, Haring, Oud, Ernst May, Alois Welzenbacher, Fred Forbat, Martin Elsasser, and Paul Bonatz. His Swiss student Peter Meyer wrote in the 1930s that more than two hundred Swiss architects received their training with Fischer. Fritz Schumacher, professor of architecture at the Dreseden Tech- nische Hochschule and the keynote speaker at the first Werkbund meeting in Munich in 1907, referred to him as the real teacher of a whole generation of architects. The historians of the Neues Bauen in the 1920s Behrendt and Gustav Adolf Platz still spoke of him as a great teacher. In 1932 he was one of the few to protest the closing of the Dessau Bauhaus ~ not because he was especially sympathetic to its pedagogy but because he believed on prin- ciple that an experimental school should be allowed to continue. Throughout his career Fischer concerned himself with architectural edu- cation and was disturbed by its academic trend. He insisted on greater emphasis on learning through practical experience. One of his moitoes reveals his openness to his students ideas: I do not have a fixed conviction. I like to hear the opinion of the next generation in order to measure myself against it. * He also encouraged his students to follow their own interests and inclinations in order to gain confidence about their work, and he advised them to look for examples not in books but in their surroundings. 21 \r",{"entities":[[43,50,"PER"],[139,146,"PER"],[245,253,"PER"],[300,307,"PER"],[532,539,"PER"],[615,627,"PER"],[824,839,"LOC"],[913,932,"PER"],[955,962,"PER"],[1434,1441,"PER"],[1501,1508,"LOC"],[1792,1799,"PER"],[1801,1805,"PER"],[1811,1823,"PER"],[1844,1851,"PER"],[1976,1983,"LOC"],[1997,2004,"PER"],[2102,2106,"PER"],[2165,2172,"PER"],[2178,2190,"PER"],[2393,2407,"PER"],[2411,2417,"LOC"],[2418,2425,"PER"],[2585,2597,"PER"],[2693,2700,"PER"],[2707,2722,"ARCH"],[2798,2805,"PER"],[2895,2903,"LOC"],[2904,2909,"PER"],[2938,2945,"PER"],[3029,3036,"PER"],[3116,3128,"PER"],[3147,3153,"LOC"],[3270,3276,"LOC"],[3369,3381,"PER"],[3396,3413,"PER"],[3415,3422,"PER"],[3424,3434,"PER"],[3436,3446,"PER"],[3452,3469,"PER"],[3534,3546,"PER"],[3579,3586,"PER"],[3708,3716,"PER"],[3717,3724,"PER"],[3751,3757,"LOC"],[3815,3826,"PER"],[3862,3869,"LOC"],[3878,3885,"PER"],[3937,3944,"LOC"],[3957,3966,"LOC"],[4094,4100,"LOC"],[4180,4184,"PER"],[4186,4196,"PER"],[4198,4212,"PER"],[4214,4220,"PER"],[4222,4225,"PER"],[4227,4236,"PER"],[4238,4256,"PER"],[4258,4269,"PER"],[4278,4286,"PER"],[4292,4304,"PER"],[4323,4334,"PER"],[4577,4583,"LOC"],[4726,4744,"PER"],[4851,4858,"ARCH"],[5039,5046,"PER"]]}],["Fig. 1.

While Sitte had not dealt with the social and economic issues of plan- ning, his approach was based more on developing principles of psychologi- cal perception rather than on romantic, aestheticized imagery. Like Sitte, Fischer sought a practical aesthetics that was based on empirical studies and anthropological constants.** Appointed as the director of Munich s municipal expansion office in 1893, Fischer had considerable influence on the development of new con- struction. Just as Sitte before him, he was critical of monumental, freestand- ing structures and preferred instead building sequences that maintain an urban texture and form a continuous enclosure. In addition to private commissions he built five schools and three bridges for the municipal gov- ernment during his early Munich period. He received a large number of commissions for institutional buildings, such as museums and theaters. Among his larger projects were the Stadttheater in Heilbronn (t902-1913); the Universitat in Jena (1905-1908), for which Taut produced one of the renderings; the reinforced concrete Garnisonskirche in Ulm (1908-1910); the Hessisches Landesmuseum in Kassel (1907-1913); the Museum in Wiesbaden (1911-1920); and the Kunstgebaude in Stuttgart (1909-1913), the last probably his most superbly sited public building. Fischer completed two houses for Tessenow s garden city of Hellerau near Dresden (1909-1910) and a school project that remained unexecuted. His numerous housing projects include the factory town of Gmindersdorf, near Reutlingen (1903-1915; fig. 1), as well as housing in Munich-Laim (1910-1911; fig. 2). In his Alte Heide housing estate in Munich (1918-1930), executed for workers by a cooperative housing association in response to the postwar housing shortages, he turned to the severe scheme of a Zeilenbau (housing set in parallel rows) arrangement in order to rationalize as many small apartments as possible. It was quite unusual within the context of his previous work. His earlier projects influenced the housing of Taut, May, and Oud. Alte Heide, on the other hand, prefigures the rigidly rationalized Zeilenbau projects of the late 1920s, ostensibly produced to deal with the increasing housing shortage and worsening economy. 23 \r",{"entities":[[16,23,"PER"],[25,29,"PER"],[46,77,"ARCH"],[107,168,"LOC"],[215,245,"ARCH"],[258,319,"LOC"],[347,360,"PER"],[361,368,"PER"],[656,669,"PER"],[817,822,"PER"],[1031,1038,"PER"],[1167,1173,"LOC"],[1212,1219,"PER"],[1297,1302,"PER"],[1600,1606,"LOC"],[1751,1763,"ARCH"],[1767,1776,"LOC"],[1794,1805,"ARCH"],[1809,1813,"LOC"],[1837,1841,"PER"],[1889,1913,"ARCH"],[1917,1920,"LOC"],[1938,1961,"ARCH"],[1965,1971,"LOC"],[1989,1995,"ARCH"],[1999,2008,"LOC"],[2030,2042,"ARCH"],[2046,2055,"LOC"],[2128,2135,"PER"],[2161,2195,"LOC"],[2326,2338,"LOC"],[2388,2410,"ARCH"],[2439,2457,"ARCH"],[2468,2474,"LOC"],[2852,2856,"PER"],[2858,2862,"PER"],[2867,2871,"PER"],[2872,2882,"PER"]]}],["Like the work of Behrens and Josef Hoffmann, Fischer s approach became more conservative stylistically and therefore less influential by the 1920s. Most of his students cannot be called mainstream modernists, but several became pivotal figures in the Expressionist Movement in architec- ture after World War 1, and many turned to social issues of housing. But sore, like Elsdsser and Bonatz, remained traditionalists. Bonatz, who had become Fischer s successor at the Stuttgart Technische Hochschule and who later became a National Socialist, railed against Fischer as a wrecker of order. In the end Fischer regretted the increasing stylistic and political conservatism of the Stuttgart School even though it had originally been inspired by his work. In 1907 both Behrens and Fischer became founding members of the German Werkbund, the association of architects and industrial firms that (according to modernist histories) left behind the retrospective ideals of the Arts and Crafts Movement and looked instead to progressivist notions of art and industry.5? Fischer became the first president of the Werkbund in 1907, and he designed the main hall for the German Werkbund exhibi- tion in Cologne in 1914 (fig. 3). Fischer's low-slung, Renaissance-inspired structure was flanked on either side by the templelike buildings by Behrens and Hoffmann. This group of Werkbund pavilions reveals the relative power of these traditionalists vis-a-vis the younger generation of Gropius and Taut, whose Werkbund buildings were assigned compara- tively marginal sites. Although Fischer occupied a central position in the early Werkbund, he soon withdrew from its ideological struggles and came to believe that this organization for the raising of the production stan- dard should have been dissolved after a few years.%* Julius Posener in his text of 1964, Anfange des Funktionalismus (The beginnings of functionalism), has already shown that most of the found- ing firms such as the Deutsche Werkstatten fiir Handwerkskunst Dresden, Vereinigte Werkstatten fiir Kunst im Handwerk Miinchen, the Wiener Werkstatte, and several publishers were more closely tied to the crafts than to modern industry, even though the intention of some of the members was certainly to move in the direction of design for industrial production.* The group had contemplated holding its first meeting in Nuremberg, site of Richard Wagner's Meistersinger, in part to emphasize a relationship to medieval guilds rather than to industry. In the end the first meeting was held in Munich, home of the Werkbund s first presi- dent, Fischer. 24 fiat ted ae Fig. 3. Theodor Fischer, Main hall, German Werkbund exhibition, Cologne, 1914.

Hermann Muthesius, who might also be included among the conservatives, was instrumental in the creation of the Werkbund as well, but for political reasons he had stayed in the background during its first meeting, so as not to jeopardize its foundation. As a bureaucrat of the Prussian Ministry of Trade in Berlin, Muthesius had criticized the imita- tion of styles in art and industry in a speech he made in early 1907; this in turn had provoked angry reactions and appeals to Kaiser Wilhelm for his dismissal from the Fachverband fiir die wirtschaftlichen Interessen des Kunstgewerbes (Trade association to further the economic interests of the art industries). Because of the Werkbund s extraordinarily varied makeup and the broad range of backgrounds among its members, by 1914 (that is, the year of its first major exhibition in Cologne), it was already split into hostile factions of arts-and-crafis individualists and progressive rationalists, as well as liberal and conservative camps. It was referred to at the time as an association of the most intimate enemies.\"? Despite the Werkbund s lack of a clear direction, it became an important extra-academic transmitter of architectural ideas through its extensive mem- bership, publications, and exhibitions. Stanislaus von Moos has shown that Le Corbusier appropriated some of the ideas and images he used in Vers une architecture (first published in L esprit nouveau) from prewar Werkbund pub- lications.*? The Werkbund in its very makeup and heterogeneity was a reflection of the complex German educational scene in the early twentieth century. The debate at the Werkbund meeting of 1914 was in fact a political one, but it also hinged in part on a misunderstanding of the word Typisierung (standardization), prefiguring arguments and differences of opinion in the 1920s. Modernism as both practice and ideology was not a uniform concept, but it changed in the course of the 1920s and was constantly challenged from within and without the movement. The Werkbund, to which Behne belonged by 1913, illustrates perfectly the numerous academic and quasi- academic prewar institutions that fostered public discussion of the social implications of architecture and design. Behne, in addition to his association with the Werkbund and his even- tual critique of its goals, was a loyal supporter of the Volkshochschule Move- ment: a crucial but not well known aspect of nineteenth-century German 26 educational reform. The Volkshochschule in Germany evolved in the second half of the nineteenth century and was based on Scandinavian models. It did not fall within the complex system of professional architectural education but added yet another layer to the already pluralistic professional educa- tional possibilities. Volkshochschule teaching was like a mixture of American adult education and the courses taught to workers and new immigrants under Jane Addams at Chicago s Hull House and many later settlement houses in the early twentieth century. It might further be compared to the turn-of-the-century art education movement in Germany, inspired by Alfred Lichtwark, who was appointed the director of the Hamburg Kunst- halle in 1886. Lichtwark directed his efforts especially toward the art edu- cation of young people. Volkshochschule lectures did not require entrance examinations, nor did they lead to diplomas (they were not set up for high school equivalency degrees as some such programs are in the United States). Courses, lectures, and study trips were meant to further the education of the public at large. Behne taught from the beginning until the end of his career within this open-ended, unstructured, and completely nonhierarchic educational program. Behne s central role in the Expressionist Arbeitsrat fitr Kunst (Work council on the arts) immediately after the war may also explain the group s concern in its manifestos with art education outside of estab- lished institutions. Questions about the place of architecture and design that had arisen before the war against the background of a socially complex education sys- tem were not resolved after the war. In his well-known opening manifesto of 1919 for the Bauhaus (which was initially a state school, then a munici- pal school, and finally a private academy), Gropius insisted that only crafts can be taught, not art. He used the medieval guilds as his model of instruc- tion. In 1922-1923 the Bauhaus curriculum began to address the design of industrial prototypes, but at the same time it hardly moved beyond a machine aesthetic; and only from 1928 to 1930, under Hannes Meyer's directorship, did Bauhaus instruction concern itself expressly with functionalism. Under Mies' s directorship (1930-1933), the Bauhaus changed focus yet again toward straightforward architectural training without regard for the integra- tion of the arts, which had been the mainstay of early Bauhaus teaching. Today, however, the Bauhaus is known for its Bauhaus style and Bauhaus functionalism. Gropius later insisted that there was no such thing as a Bauhaus style. He was only partly correct. There were in fact several Bauhaus styles, suggesting an eclectic amalgam of several modernisms. 27 \r",{"entities":[[34,41,"PER"],[46,53,"PER"],[200,224,"PER"],[225,242,"PER"],[531,537,"LOC"],[539,548,"PER"],[702,716,"PER"],[1489,1508,"PER"],[1524,1536,"PER"],[2255,2260,"PER"],[2450,2455,"PER"],[2716,2723,"LOC"],[3125,3136,"PER"],[3140,3160,"ARCH"],[3308,3315,"LOC"],[3329,3345,"PER"],[3385,3405,"LOC"],[3415,3424,"PER"],[3686,3699,"LOC"],[3797,3802,"PER"],[3945,3950,"PER"],[4512,4519,"PER"],[4818,4830,"PER"],[4922,4926,"PER"],[5188,5195,"ARCH"],[5229,5236,"PER"],[5356,5363,"ARCH"]]}],["Behne's relationship with Gropius and the Bauhaus was an uneasy one. As early as 1923 Behne criticized Gropius and the first Bauhaus exhibition for its superficial use of several styles at the same time. When Gropius had a chance to design a new building for the Bauhaus in Dessau, he was asked by his patron, the mayor of that city, to include space for the local crafts schoo!. Thus, he could have brought together in a real sense traditional crafts training with Bauhaus instruction, but by the mid-1920s his pedagogical paradigm had become more technocentric. The two schools remained entirely separate entities within the new building, each with its own entry. Old hierarchies in the actual relationship between the avant- garde school and the municipal crafts school were disguised in the modern- looking plan of the building: it appears as if it has no center, but Gropius s office was in the bridge that both connected and separated the two schools. Behne, Critic of Modernisms Even before the end of the war, in 1917, Behne wrote a critique of the Werk- bund that questioned its nationalist economic goals. He wrote that the Werkbund s attempt to bring art to bourgeois, commercial, and political life would lead only to sentimentality. He considered artless utensils far preferable to designed ones. He further questioned the art-into-life beliefs of the Jugendstil and of the Darmstadt Artists Colony (which continued to form an underpinning of the Werkbund s principles), as well as the Werk- bund s emphasis on economic competition. The introduction of aesthetics to the everyday object does not bring about an improvement in quality, he went on to argue, but turns it into kitsch. Somewhat perversely he stated that he preferred kitsch to the imposition of art on ordinary objects. He concluded (and here his argument is revealed as proto-Expressionist) that art should always remain a separate enterprise. His belief suggested the bifurcation of art and the everyday, so common in Expressionism and probably best known in Gropius's assertion that art cannot be taught. in 1920 Behne criticized the Werkbund again in the pages of Sozialistische Monatshefte. Once more he complained about its obsession with everything artistic, from artistic norms to artistic advertisements. He hoped that the new members on its executive committee (twenty altogether, including Gropius, Osthaus, Taut, Bernhard Pankok, C sar Klein, and Poelzig as direc- tor) would bring about a change. He also conceded that the Werkbund was 28 correct in rejecting Scheffler s Ein Arbeitsprogramm fir den Deutschen Werkbund (A working program for the German Werkbund), which had insisted on a boycott of all foreign products.% After the war Behne became closely associated with the Arbeitsrat fiir Kunst, which was founded in 1918, initially under Taut s leadership, and taken over a year later by Gropius. The Arbeitsrat consisted of a group of architects, critics, and artists and was modeled on the Arbeiterrate of the German Revolution of 1918. It sponsored publications, exhibitions, dis- cussions, and circulars that raised questions about art education, public architecture, and the role of institutions in a postrevolutionary society. Behne became the business manager of the Arbeitsrat in 1919 and wrote the texts of several of its publications.** Although the Arbeitsrat maintained the Expressionist interest in mysticism, utopianism, and art as a transfiguring enterprise, it also became concerned with bringing art to a wider public by sponsoring exhibitions in the taverns of Berlin's working quarters. In March 1919 the Arbeitsrat followed a suggestion made by Taut and Behne and proposed a joint venture with the Werkbund to help with the reconstruction of northern France.* This idea for helping war-torn France is a succinct example of the groups activist pacifism and especially of Taut s constructive utopianism. Behne, however, was not hopeful about the success of this effort. He was afraid that if German architects were sent to France, the French might wrongly assume that the Germans believed that the French did not have qualified architects of their own. The Werkbund, in any case, voted the project down. By early 1921 when the artists of the Berlin Dada group had begun to intensify their critique of Expressionism for its emphasis on individualism and for not producing art that appealed to the worker,** the Arbeitsrat had already disbanded. As it became clear that the Arbeiisrat s expectations for a new society were far from the political reality, a disillusionment and with- drawal from the intense utopianism of the immediate postwar years took hold among its former members. As for the Dada effort to create a public art, it was no more successful than that of the Expressionists. Nevertheless, Dada s use of collages containing elements taken from the mass media, while not necessarily any clearer to the public than the Expressionists use of folk art or children s art, proved to be an immensely fruitful artistic direc- tion and prefigured the other modernisms of the later 19208. Like the Expressionists, Dada artists believed that art could be used to revitalize soci- ety, a recurrent theme in early twentieth-century German art. 29 \r",{"entities":[[0,5,"PER"],[26,33,"PER"],[86,91,"PER"],[103,110,"PER"],[209,216,"PER"],[242,270,"ARCH"],[872,879,"PER"],[958,963,"PER"],[1027,1032,"PER"],[2092,2097,"PER"],[2377,2384,"PER"],[2386,2393,"PER"],[2395,2399,"PER"],[2401,2416,"PER"],[2424,2429,"PER"],[2435,2442,"PER"],[2725,2730,"PER"],[2832,2836,"PER"],[2882,2890,"PER"],[3227,3232,"PER"],[3805,3811,"LOC"],[3916,3921,"PER"],[4035,4041,"LOC"]]}],["In an article in Die Weltbiihne in 1926, entitled An den Verein kom- munistischer Kunstmaler (To the Union of communist painters), Behne engaged in a direct confrontation with John Heartfield on the issue of politi- cal art. The debate was occasioned by an earlier comment Behne had made about an exhibition organized by his friend Otto Nagel, a communist painter, in a store in the working-class district in Berlin-Wedding. Heart- field, then representing the official position of the kpp, insisted that the masses first have to be seized emotionally before art can be discussed. Behne, on the other hand, believed that the best art would, in the end, pro- duce the best political art. The work on view was intended to show the suf- fering of the working class. Behne thought that the working class needed no instruction about its suffering and believed that this kind of art was regres- sive because it used the same means as bourgeois art. During a lecture Behne gave at the exhibition, workers demanded that pictures by Otto Dix showing proletarian women be removed. Their realism was found offensive. The xpp s attitude, Behne thought, was not unlike that expressed by the National Socialists, and he concluded that if one wants to seize the masses, one had better understand their psychology. Behne repeated similar ideas in an unpublished essay of 1932, Sozialistische Kunst (Socialist art). He praised as successful the paintings of the German section of the Inter- national Exhibition of Socialist Art in Amsterdam in 1920, as well as the Frauen in Not (Women in distress) exhibition, organized by himself and Nagel in 1931; the latter was again held in the working-class district of Wed- ding. ! The great irony in this debate was that although John Heartfield was an outstanding artist, the kpp vacillated in its support of his work. In 1921 Behne also became the German correspondent for the English periodical The Studio. In 1920 he made a trip to Holland, probably in con- nection with the International Exhibition of Socialist Art, where he met Theo van Doesburg, Hendrik Berlage, H. Th. Wijdeveld, and Oud. ? At the same time he was preparing a book on Dutch architecture, Hollandische Baukunst in der Gegenwart (Contemporary Dutch architecture), which was published in 1922.7? An excerpt from this book was published in De Stijl. As the various modern art movements were becoming increasingly international in the early 1920s, Behne also made contact with architects and artists from other countries. Through his contact with Laszl6 Moholy- Nagy, Behne had even tried to get Oud a commnission for a house in Berlin. Moholy-Nagy had seen an article by Behne on Oud s work and through him Oud received the commission for a Mrs. Kallenbach. Oud came to 30 visit Berlin to see the site, but the project fell through in 1922.74 It was also Behne who first introduced Moholy-Nagy to Gropius. > In 1920 Gropius met van Doesburg at the house of Taut during van Doesburg s trip to prose- lytize De Stijl. 6 It is revealing that the two figures who in 1922-1923 were instrumental in directing the Bauhaus away from its Expressionist begin- nings Moholy-Nagy and van Doesburg were not known to Gropius before Taut and Behne introduced them to him. Thus the key figures of the Expressionist Arbeitsrat played a direct role in bringing about the change toward international Modernism, particularly the incorporation of De Stijl and Constructivism, in the Bauhaus after 1922. During the early 1920s Behne, as well as Taut, was among the founding members of the Gesellschaft der Freunde des neuen Russland (Society of friends of the new Russia}. Behne thereafter occasionally wrote articles for Neues Russland, the society s publication. In 1923, because of his association with this group, he was invited by the Soviet government to visit Petrograd and Moscow, In 1923 he also wrote one of his most insightful reviews of the first public exhibition at the Bauhaus: The exhibition suffers, I believe, because it takes place at a time when the Bauhaus is in a period of change. The new attitude toward linkage with technol- ogy, that is, standardization, is already recognizable, but does not yet appear with any consistency at all. The small-mindedness of handicrafts is also present and confuses the work, and even turns pure machine form into crafts. ... The rejected decorative principle...celebrates triumphs in other places... why did this happen? In order to show that the new, the so-called Constructivist forms have been mastered. ... The [model] house Am Horn stands among all these difficulties as somewhat uninteresting and unknowing. It is half-luxurious, half-primitive; half-ideal, half-time-bound; half-crafts, half-industrial; half-stan- dardization, half-idyll. It is in no sense pure and convincing, but again an aes- thetic, papery affair. Behne held Gropius responsible for this attitude, because he found the same problems within the Internationale Architektur exhibition that was organized solely by Gropius as part of the larger Bauhaus exhibition. Behne felt that Gropius sought to disguise his uncertainty with an abrupt one-sidedness. Because of Gropius s pseudoradical attitude, sachlich tendencies, accord- ing to Behne, were simply presented as yet another direction. Behne con- cluded that the future of the Bauhaus would depend on whether Gropius 31 \r",{"entities":[[131,136,"PER"],[176,191,"PER"],[273,278,"PER"],[332,342,"PER"],[581,586,"PER"],[960,965,"PER"],[1024,1032,"PER"],[1126,1131,"PER"],[1299,1304,"PER"],[1514,1523,"LOC"],[1853,1858,"PER"],[2060,2077,"PER"],[2079,2094,"PER"],[2096,2113,"PER"],[2118,2122,"PER"],[2337,2346,"PER"],[2444,2449,"PER"],[2543,2562,"PER"],[2564,2569,"PER"],[2592,2595,"PER"],[2625,2632,"LOC"],[2633,2644,"PER"],[2668,2673,"PER"],[2677,2680,"PER"],[2704,2707,"PER"],[2743,2754,"PER"],[2755,2758,"PER"],[2776,2782,"LOC"],[2852,2857,"PER"],[2894,2902,"PER"],[2925,2937,"PER"],[2954,2958,"PER"],[2966,2978,"PER"],[3153,3164,"PER"],[3169,3181,"PER"],[3200,3207,"PER"],[3215,3219,"PER"],[3224,3229,"PER"],[3423,3431,"PER"],[3520,3524,"PER"],[3648,3653,"PER"],[3697,3711,"PER"],[3959,3966,"LOC"],[4045,4052,"LOC"],[4550,4570,"ARCH"],[5024,5031,"PER"],[5054,5073,"LOC"],[5074,5079,"PER"],[5090,5097,"PER"],[5174,5181,"PER"],[5244,5249,"PER"],[5299,5304,"PER"],[5340,5347,"LOC"],[5372,5379,"PER"]]}],["could find his way to an absolute Sachlichkeit: This would allow him to take up all inspirations openly and without prejudice and competitiveness and to incorporate them together with his assistants. This would protect him from dipping into surface features here and there (in five projects Gropius changed his style of representation five times). 7 The same year that Behne wrote this cogent analysis of Bauhaus styles, he assembled material for his most important book, Der moderne Zweckbau. He apparently completed the text in 1923. When he could not find a pub- lisher, he asked Gropius in 1924 to hold back his publication of Interna- tionale Architektur, but Gropius refused. The latter was in fact surprised that as a result Rehne considered him uncollegial and responded that there was room for more than one publication, even if many of the illustrated build- ings were similar. Gropius must have known, however, that a book pub- lished under the auspices of the Bauhaus would have a greater impact on public perception. As noted earlier, Behne encountered further difficulties in assembling the material for his book because of the projected Bauhaus book series. Specifically, Oud no longer wanted to supply Behne with a copy of a lecture because he preferred to have it published by the Bauhaus. * Behne must have found all this extraordinarily ironic. In May of 1923, before the Bauhaus exhibition, Gropius had written to Behne requesting his assis- tance in the planning of the Internationale Architektur exhibition. In the same letter, however, Gropius announced that he could not give photo- graphs of the Bauhaus to Behne because he was already planning a special publication that obligated him not to release illustrations beforehand. While asking for Behne s help with his own project, Gropius (even before Behne s critical review of the Internationale Architektur exhibition) was un- willing to share information. Behne was probably less concerned about any similarity between his and Gropius's books than the prospect of having his serious analysis of Modernism overshadowed by the reputation of Bauhaus publications, a fear that was entirely justified. In 1928, two years after Der moderne Zweckbau eventually appeared and shortly before Hannes Meyer replaced Gropius as the director of the Bauhaus, Behne wrote an appreciative article on Meyer's school in Bernau, near Berlin (fig. 4). In a letter Meyer had informed Behne of his deep interest in the cooperative movement in Scandinavia and its influence on his own work.* In 1929 Behne edited the periodical Newes Berlin with Martin Wagner, an early advocate of cooperative housing associations and later the socialist chief city planner for Berlin. 32 Fig. 4.

On the one an , Bel did not leave Germany, as did Taut, Mendelsohn, Gropius, Martin Wagne and many others. On the other hand, Mies, who eventually did emigrate, di so only after he had tried unsuccessfully to work for the Nazis. vs that bi What is clear from Behne s writings, at least up until 1933, is t vat s incisive criticism was rarely held back. Together with his more specialize texts on art and architecture, he pursued his lifelong concern for wider ia - lic education through popular books on illustrators such as Heinrich Zille, who was known for his humorous and satirical drawings of the Berlin pro < tarjat.82 Behne also wrote critical essays about the pedagogical function o their acquisitions policies. me nehne s a vees always have historical, contextual interest, but many of his critiques have not lost their power and meaning for the ne reader. As Fritz Neumeyer wrote in The Artless Word: Mies van der Rohe on tne Building Art, 1991: The most explicit critique of Mies s theme was formulated by Adolf Behne in his work Der moderne Zweckbau.... It ranked among the most important publications up to then dealing with the New Building and has retained its significance as key work on the discussion of the theory of architecture. Behne s merit was that he had undertaken a summary of all the ee impulses that originated in the years from 1990 to 1923 and arranged t em in their contextual sequence, whereby he stressed the various concepts 0 rationalism and functionalism, illuminating their respective dogmas and prejudices. Der moderne Zweckbau Despite its title, Der moderne Zweckbau is not a narrow interpretation of functionalism of the sort ascribed to Hannes Meyer by Hitchcock and John- son, nor of the sort that postmodernists assume defines Modernism. From the outset Behne makes his approach abundantly clear. He defines the original need for building traditionally, that is, as a protective device against climate, animals, and enemies. The first building, he writes, fulfilled spe- cific needs and had a purely functional character. In this sense buildings are essentially like tools. But from the beginning of human culture, he contin- ues, there has been an urge toward playfulness, coupled with the need to be practical. He writes that primitive man was not strictly utilitarian as this double urge is verified in tools that are also beautiful and ornamented. The house is no exception: a house is as much a toy as a tool. What does change over time, in his opinion, is the balance between these two impulses, between function and form. In times when formalism has become para- mount and tyrannical, it is necessary to stress function. Design, no matter what the current emphasis, should always aim for an equilibrium between these two competing factors. Thus Behne did not insist on the primacy of function as such but consid- ered it from a larger historical context that requires periodic adjustment. It could be an adjustment that moved toward function or form, but Behne per- ceived his own time to be so overwhelmed by formalism that he thought emphasis should be placed on functionalism. One might argue at this point that Behne was simply employing a larger picture of architecture in order to give contemporary functionalism historical legitimacy. His extensive expla- nation of the drawbacks of the functionalist position in later segments of the book, however, reveals that he was not a mere advocate of functionalism. His linking the production of tools to the design of architecture is, of course, hardly new. With the rise of archaeology and anthropology in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, an interest in relating all human artifacts became increasingly pronounced. This new concern eventually came to include a consideration of crafts in any developmental process. Gottfried Semper s writings, especially his incomplete text on style, are probably the best-known instances of such an inclusive approach.** By the late nineteenth century Semper's influence could be seen in the art histori- cal theories of Cornelius Gurlitt, as well as in Alois Riegl s Altorientalische Teppiche (Old oriental carpets), 1891.% Riegl had been keeper of textiles at 35 \r",{"entities":[[2681,2693,"PER"],[2697,2706,"PER"],[2711,2716,"PER"],[3798,3803,"PER"],[4838,4854,"PER"],[5079,5096,"PER"],[5112,5123,"PER"],[5183,5188,"PER"]]}],["ak he the Osterreichisches Museum fur angewandte Kunst (Austrian museum of applied arts) and thus was well aware of the importance of ol in oP ain ing cultural production. This allowed him to move beyon it e san nt notion of a high period of Roman art in his book Die sparomite e \" rs industrie (Late Roman art industry), 1901. Using late Roman crafts pre : tion as his model, he not only directed art historical studies away rom specific high period but included what used to be called the minor ar = The incorporation of tools and crafts in theoretical considerations ne and architecture was not only affected by new fields of research suc as anthropology but also by the changing value systems of the nineteent ee tury, which now stressed the everyday, bourgeois values of an essen ially postaristocratic society.

The notion building as both a toy and a tool no matter what the current mn al ances does not imply any cultural progression or regression. He writes thata er at gulf opened up in architecture between formal and functional approat because form and function were separated. Thus, while employing tl se two apparently opposing concepts, Behne objects merely to their segreg tion. The balance between formal and functional building, Behne argues, has undergone a sea change in the last decade with the realization t at a functional building can be formally pleasing and that formal buildings in themselves are not necessarily beautiful. Then he goes on to examine the current condition: Attitudes really had changed fundamentally. Architectural form was seen danger, and fulfillment of function was seen almost as a guarantee a i genesis of a good building. Whereas before people believed that artists ied to be very clever in order to produce good buildings despite function ...that 1s, buildings were again being seen much more as tools. wa Functional architectural concepts replaced formal ones. Functional nt - ings used to be specifically defined by their use, a link between the nee creations of architects and the bare utilitarian structures of engineers an ak technicians. Now every building became a functional building, that is, was tack- led on the basis of its type and function. Fulfillment of purpose became one of the means of architectural design as it had been ever since Otto Wagner in 1895 wrote in Baukunst unserer Zeit: Something impractical cannot be beautiful. ** Although Behne is not an advocate of functionalism, his occasional tan- gents on nineteenth-century historicism do reveal some of the prejudices of a modernist. Yet his belief that function and form must be balanced allows him to be critical of an overemphasis on function, and unlike Pevsner or Giedion in their early writings he does not see current trends as the only course for modern architecture. His model presumes that the present focus on functionalism would, at some point in the future, have to be adjusted in favor of formalism. In this sense Behne s Der moderne Zweckbau is about a modernist theory that contains within it the possibility of postmodernism. The progression of his discussion spreads splendidly in ever-widening circles throughout the chapters of the book. After his analogy of tools and toys to architecture in the introduction, he moves from chapter 1, No Longer a Facade but a House, to chapter 2, No Longer a House but Shaped Space, and to chapter 3, No Longer Shaped Space but Designed Reality. Here he brings us back to the larger social context of architecture, In addition to singling out Otto Wagner in his opening chapter, he also speaks of Berlage s Amsterdam Stock Exchange and the demand for a sach- lich development of architecture in Berlage s collected lectures Grundlagen und Entwicklung der Architektur (Foundations and development of architec- ture), 1908,* He also commends Alfred Messel s Wertheim Department Store in Berlin, which, on first view, he believes to be the most revolutionary work of these three architects (figs. 5, 6). On further reflection, however, he finds that the fulfillment of function in Messel s building is not absolutely sachlich. The department store s emphatic piers, which appear to be the most structural of its elements, reveal their intrinsically decorative nature in the way they merge with an overhanging roof line. Behne sees Taut s com- petition design of rgio for the store's expansion as much more consistent fig. 7), and he agrees with Le Corbusier s comment that German modern architecture frequently looks like elevator-shaft architecture. * Behne includes the country house in his broad conception of functional building, because he writes that in the houses of Frank Lloyd Wright (which he assumes to be country houses), the plan was freed of formalist rigidity and was used for a free balancing of space based on the most careful inclusion 37 \r",{"entities":[[1177,1182,"PER"],[2850,2861,"PER"],[4127,4134,"PER"],[4137,4161,"ARCH"],[4225,4232,"PER"],[4386,4411,"ARCH"],[4415,4421,"LOC"],[4608,4614,"PER"],[4847,4852,"PER"],[4858,4862,"PER"],[4972,4984,"PER"],[5080,5085,"PER"],[5201,5219,"PER"]]}],["Fig. 5.

Introduction of all requirements of comfort, quiet, and clear design. There is no longer any trace of symmetry or an axis, simply walls succinctly marking and accompanying the most comfortable traffic patterns for all the rooms. The accommodation to living functions goes so far that each piece of furniture has its specific place in the floor plan. For Behne, Wright's plans set Space in motion as asymmetric as life itself. The description of Wright's interiors and furniture as accommodating living functions may have resulted from Behne s personal sympathy with this arrangement, but it may also have been based on his lack of direct experience with Wright's houses. Even though their plans are indeed fluid and asymmetrical, there is another sort of stasis and control in assigning every piece of furniture and built-in elements a fixed place, and this makes Wright s interiors actually quite inflexible. For Behne, as for Le Corbusier, the plan, rather than the eleva- tion, has the most important value for contemporary architecture (Hitch- cock and Johnson also state that functionalism had its strongest influence on the plan). Behne then moves on to a discussion of industrial buildings, which he, like other modernists, believes are the most impressive in the United States. He quotes extensively from Henry Ford s Autobiography, which had just appeared as a best-seller in a German translation in 1923. The popularity of Ford s book was but an indication of the cult of Amerikanismus that swept Germany in the mid-i920s.* Ford s description of factory buildings seemed to combine the toughness of the demanding industrialist with Taylorism and an almost surreal emphasis on the Protestant work ethic and clean- liness. It is, in fact, a succinct example of the devolution from the Protestant work ethic to capitalism that Weber had described so convincingly in his Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism of 1920. Behne quotes Ford thus: Our machines... are scientifically arranged, not only in the sequence of operations, but so as to give every man and every machine every square inch that he requires and, if possible, not a square inch... more than he requires.... The dark corners which invite expectoration are painted white. One cannot have morale without cleanliness. *! Behne also cited Ford s opin- ion on art: We need artists who master industrial relationships. We need masters of industrial methods, and We will not put up elaborate buildings as monuments to our success. The interest on the investrnent and the cost of their upkeep would only serve to add uselessly to the cost of our products so these monuments of success are apt to end as tombs. Although Behne may not have agreed with Ford in general, by using this (and the 41 \r",{"entities":[[8,18,"PER"],[60,85,"ARCH"],[166,172,"LOC"],[1567,1581,"LOC"],[1803,1810,"LOC"]]}],["architecture of Behrens for the akc in particular) as his introduction to the design of German factories, he is able to highlight Behrens s aesthetic inter- pretation of form, which Behne earlier had criticized as exhibiting too much pathos. ? Henry Ford s phrase monuments of success are apt to end as tombs is thus left in place as a signpost to Behne s interpretation of Behrens s turbine factory. Behrens, in Behne s opinion, defines the machine as a pseudoaesthetic form. On the other hand, he regarded van de Velde as the first representa- tive of a romantic machine cult, in which function is expressed as dra- matic form. Behne detects van de Velde s continuing influence with younger architects, such as Mendelsohn. In Mendelsohn's work the decorative self- satisfaction of Hermann Finsterlin s organic projects is transformed into an engineerlike tension and energy. The attenuated character of Mendelsohn s Einstein Tower borders on anthropomorphism and is dramatic in the sense of van de Velde s work. Behne agrees with the Dutch architect J. F. Staal that the tower is more memorial than workshop. However, he finds Mendelsohn s Luckenwalde Hat Factory more sachlich with a purposeful organization of its production spaces. Behne then further defines his concept of the functional plan, which he had touched upon in discussing the work of Wright. He describes orthogo- nal space not as a functional form but as a mechanical one. Organic life is not determined by the right angle. He gives as examples designs by Haring and Hans Scharoun, which on first sight are reminiscent of Finsterlin but have none of that painter s romantic willfulness. He also concedes that only an approximate, rather than absolute, adaptation to the natural fluidity of movement is possible. He makes his expanded notion of functionalism even clearer when he goes on to insist that although the functionalist can be extremely practical, he is not to be confused with the utilitarian. Whereas the solutions of func- tionalists and utilitarians on some occasions may be related, their attitudes toward the problem of function are quite different: Functionalists are concerned with solving a problem of general significance to our culture. The utilitarian only asks: What is the most practical way for me to act in this case? But the functionalist asks: How do I act most correctly in principle? Their attitude inclines toward philosophy and has a metaphysical basis.... There is no question but that the functionalists, even the most [sach- lich] ones, could more readily be classified as romantics than as rationalists. 42 Behne s functionalism at its most extreme would turn the building into a pure tool and negate form (play) entirely. Would such an ultimate function- alism not lead to a dead end? He responds that the functionalist is right only as long as he is concerned with the individual room. Invoking his earlier description of the organic functionalist plan, he writes that it is correct that orthogonal space is not economical, that the curve describes functional space with greater precision. But when we group together several such functional rooms there is a loss of space because of poor tessellation, Haring s device of widening and narrowing corridors to accommodate the amount of traffic they bear, for instance, is based on the example of organic arteries. A building in this sense, however, is not analogous to a living organism that always performs the same function. Haring s undulating corridors assume that they will always carry the same distribution of traffic over the life of a building. Behne argues that this type of organic solution, which appears functional as a specific response at a certain moment in time, may also be too individualistic in a larger built context. Thus, from a social point of view, orthogonal space may in fact be more functional because it is more neutral when we consider a series of rooms or a group of buildings over time. He concludes that the deciding factor must be the gen- eral attitude of society. Behne s argument for a neutral architecture in the public realm resem- bles the ideas of Loos. Although Behne mentions Loos only in passing in his text, he does list several of his books and essays in a footnote and in his rec- ommended bibliography. But in an earlier article in Frihlicht of 1921-1922, Behne had specifically pointed to Loos's centrality in the demands for a sach- lich architecture.% Behne is at the same time always insistent that Sachlichkeit and the ques- tion of a functional architecture must be used to serve people. Staying close to postwar Expressionist beliefs, he therefore rejects outright technocentric justifications or machine metaphors. He writes that Le Corbusier's concept of a machine for living is acceptable if we view the machine as a prototype for a full-fledged human achievernent. Le Corbusier s phrase will be misun- derstood, according to Behne, if it is applied as a stylistic notion, that is, if it is used in the name of a falsely understood Constructivism that assumes that buildings and furniture must look smooth, cold, and polished, like machines. If it is misconceived, we will only arrive at a new subcategory of the Jugendstil, that is, a new taste or a new fashion that is nothing but a new pseudo-Constructivist machine formalism. 43 \r",{"entities":[[16,23,"PER"],[130,137,"PER"],[244,254,"PER"],[630,635,"PER"],[644,656,"PER"],[713,724,"PER"],[783,801,"PER"],[905,915,"PER"],[918,932,"ARCH"],[993,1005,"PER"],[1014,1019,"PER"],[1052,1063,"PER"],[1129,1139,"PER"],[1142,1165,"ARCH"],[1352,1359,"PER"],[1525,1531,"PER"],[1536,1549,"PER"],[1591,1601,"PER"],[4142,4147,"PER"],[4157,4162,"PER"],[4880,4889,"PER"],[4937,4942,"PER"]]}],["Behne further defines the differences between functionalism, rational- ism, and utilitarianism: When the functionalist refers to the machine, he sees it as the moving tool, the perfect approximation to an organism. When the utilitarian refers to the machine, he sees it as an economic prin- ciple of saving work, power, and time. When the rationalist refers to the machine, he sees it as the representative and patron of standardization and typification.** His description of the functionalist as someone who interprets the machine as an organic model is not much different from Greenough s mid-nineteenth- century functionalism. He does not suggest that functionalism is preferable to rationalism but instead describes the pitfalls of both these positions: the rationalist, who is concerned first of all with general principles (he places Le Corbusier in this category}, must guard against becoming a rigid formalist. The functionalist, who is concerned with the specific principle, must be careful not to fall into the trap of individually expressed functions. In his summary of German architecture in the context of European developments, Behne writes that Germany is somewhat inclined to devote itself to an extreme that changes fairly frequently and then gives way to the opposite extreme the consequence of an inner uncertainty.\" He sees Rus- sia (the East) and France (the West) as countervailing forces to Germany's persistent individualism: It is a feature common to the East and West that ...they proceed from the collective. But the collective is fundamentally dif- ferent here and there: France has a structurally articulated society, Russia is dominated by the masses. Behne, using a social interpretation of interna- tionalism, calls for a fusion of these tendencies. He quotes from Heinrich Mann to support such a linkage: We are in the middle and it is our task to link East and West; one does not shut off nature. In the future we will be the republic in which representation of class and parliamentarianism are interlinked. 98 Behne finds that recent Dutch architecture is also a good model: it exhibits a political realism and confidence that save it from the extremes of German architecture. He concludes the book with quotations from van Doesburg and Oud and an illustration of Vladimir Tatlin s Monwment to the Third Inter- national. In Der moderne Zweckbau Behne does not allude to the conflict in Dutch architecture between the Amsterdam School and De Stijl, although 44 he had mentioned it in his book Hollandische Baukunst in der Gegenwart, 1922. This may have been due to his acquaintance with van Doesburg and Oud, or more likely to the fact that by 1923 the Expressionist Amsterdam School had waned in importance in the face of van Doesburg s concerted efforts to prose- lytize De Stijl. Behne s change in emphasis also reflects the shift in Ger- many from Expressionism to the Neue Sachlichkeit between 1920 and 1923. In general, however, his definition of architectural problems as moving between form and function, and between East and West in the cultural realm, resorts to a dualistic conception. In fact, he recommends a book by the German sociologist Alfred Vierkandt, Dualismus im modernen Weltbild (Dualism in the modern world picture}, published in 1923. Vierkandt s methodology was phenomenological, not inductive. In this, he followed Simmel s sociology of human interaction. Vierkandt also invoked the treat- ment of community and society as irreducible phenomena in the sense of Ferdinand Toennies s Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft (Community and soci- ety), 1887. In Behne s use of this dualism one is also reminded of Wolfflin s reliance on a more formalist dualistic model in his first book, Renaissance und Barock, 1888. In Der moderne Zweckbau the dualistic paradigm is never reduced to a set of rules, however, since Behne investigates the differences between form and function only in order to draw them together without ever assuming the possiblity of a complete balance. Within Behne s own writings this book was prefigured in his short essay Architekten, which appeared in Friihlicht, a periodical edited by Taut from 1920 to 1922.' Friihlicht was initially an extension of and a voice for the Expressionist Glaserne Kette (Glass chain) group and was first published as an appendix to the periodical Stadtbaukunst alter und neuer Zeit (Art of city planning of past and new times). From the fall of 1921 until the summer of 1922, it was published as an independent journal in Magdeburg, where Taut had been appointed that city s chief planner. During its Magdeburg phase, when Behne s essay was published, the magazine had shifted away from the utopian Expressionism of the postwar years and increasingly covered issues of architecture and city planning. The period between 1920 and the stabi- lization of the runaway inflation at the end of 1923 (after which architectural construction resumed a normal level} is, therefore, a transitional period between Expressionism and what is commonly called the Neue Sachlich- keit.! ! Friihlicht s articles during 1922 dealt primarily with urban issues but also included an essay by Kurt Schwitters and articles about Russian archi- tecture, among them one on Tatlin s Monument to the Third International. 45 \r",{"entities":[[579,588,"PER"],[840,852,"PER"],[1344,1352,"LOC"],[1368,1374,"LOC"],[1414,1421,"LOC"],[1647,1653,"LOC"],[1682,1687,"PER"],[1797,1810,"PER"],[2255,2267,"PER"],[2272,2275,"PER"],[2299,2314,"PER"],[2317,2355,"ARCH"],[2452,2468,"LOC"],[2473,2481,"PER"],[2701,2717,"LOC"],[2807,2816,"PER"],[3187,3203,"PER"],[3294,3303,"PER"],[3376,3382,"PER"],[3522,3540,"PER"],[3661,3669,"PER"],[5174,5189,"PER"],[5260,5296,"ARCH"]]}],["Behne's Architekten rejects what he calls Expressionism s understand- able utopianism and is directed instead toward an internationalism that became important after 1919, possibly under the influence of the Third (Communist) International or the revival of the Second International by more moderate Socialists also in 1919. In this essay he also mentions the publication of Mendelsohn s work in Wendingen and a lecture he gave in Holland. Loos, Oud, and Le Corbusier are all cited in terms of their demands for a sachlich architecture. He quotes from Le Corbusier in L esprit nouveau as he was later to do in Der moderne Zweckbau on the primacy of the plan in modern architecture, the banishment of all decoration, as well as the idiosyncratic. He believes that the new architecture is collective and supraindividual. Behne s anti-individualism also clearly sets this essay apart from his own earlier Expressionism. The idea of the supraindividual seems to be indebted to van Doesburg s critique of Expressionism and his stress on apparently rational forms. What Behne does not address whereas he exposes many forms of pseudofunctionalism and pseudorationalism is De Stijl s own mystical, Platonic component.' De Stijl represents an ideology of the objec- tive that effectively disguises its spiritual and transcendent beliefs. Behne ends his essay by pointing to the transition from belief to action. He singles out in particular the work of the German cooperative housing associations that are helping to introduce rationalization and social concerns to the building industry. Quoting Martin Wagner, who headed one of these cooperative societies, he details the resistance of the larger building industry to change in conventional building methods. He asserts that those forms belonging to the tradition of handicrafts will change in any case (and here he uses an economic argument that had been employed by Loos earlier} because they are becoming a luxury. Oud, who had distanced himself from De Stijl in 1922, became an important architect of social housing in Holland, which in turn provided a model for German housing. The cooperative building societies in Germany, which were generally set up by unions, benefited in the 1920s from funds that were collected as taxes on speculative building. As already noted, in Holldndische Baukunst in der Gegenwart, 1922, Bene mentions the tension between the Amsterdam School and De Stij] but writes that he prefers the impersonal and sachlich architecture of Rotterdam.' In another essay of 1922, Kunst, Handwerk, Technik (Art, craft, technology), he makes comparable statements about technology vis-a-vis crafts and sati- rizes Gropius s opening manifesto for the Bauhaus: 46 Depersonalization, which is in logical terms a process of objectivization, will bring nota creative revival of the crafts and folk art but rather a new and techni- cal concept of labor. It is sufficient to glance at the important new European art, such as that of L ger, Malevich, Archipenko, Schlemmer, Baumeister, Tatlin, Mondrian, van Doesburg. Does it still have any inner connections to craft? It is antimanual, and instead intellectually constructive and technical. The phase of expressionism still cherished the cult of the crafts, but today, when the young European art has at last achieved a unison with the time and location of its crea- tivity, the infatuation with the crafts (which, as the Dutch architect Oud rightly declares, blossoms at times when the delight in singular forms flourishes) is finished. Architects, sculptors, painters... all of us must return to the crafts??? No, we must move forward toward the demanding service of the intellect!!5 As in his Expressionist writings, Behne is openly polemical, but now he has become an advocate for De Stijl. In his critique of the Werkbund in 1917 he had still argued that the aesthetic aura of art kept it from being applied meaningfully to the common, everyday object, and in his Expressionist Die Wiederkehr der Kunst (The return of art), 1919, he had proclaimed art as the only true reality. He now questions the essential unity of the arts, as he will later question the idea of Gesamtkumstwerk, which had been an under- pinning of design theory from Jugendstil to Expressionism and the early Bauhaus. By 1927 in an essay titled Von der Sachlichkeit, he refers to the ideal of a Gesamtkunstwerk as a fata morgana.' In 1924 he wrote a brief article, Funktion und Form, in Sozialistische Monatshefte. It is basically his introduction to Der moderne Zweckbau and uses his toy and tool analogy to form and function. He may have pub- lished this when he realized that Gropius would neither share his illustra- tions nor delay the publication of Internationale Architektur. The Terms of the Debate Behne's frequent use of Sachlichkeit and Zweck in his book raises questions concerning the meaning these terms had for him and whether his usage remained the same in the 1920s. Also of interest is the relationship between his understanding of these words and that of earlier and later writers.

Sachlichkeit is more properly translated as the simple, practical, straightforward solution to a problem, as matter-of-facmess and occasionally as objectivity. Sachlichkeit simul- taneously suggests the world of real objects and that of a conceptual ratio- nalism. The philosophical allusions of Sachlichkeit in fact become more prevalent in the avant-garde books of the later 19208 and displace to some degree the term s simple, practical overtones. Because of its complexity and also because of its very particular associations with German culture, we have retained the German in this text and the translation. Sometimes Behne also uses the terms Funktion and funktionell. On many occasions he uses Zweck, Sachlichkeit, and Funktion interchangeably or as a series. But in his larger argument, as explained earlier, he draws a clear distinction between functionalism, rationalism, and utilitarianism. As Harry Mallgrave has shown in his introduction to Otto Wagner s Mod- em Architecture and elsewhere, the architect Richard Streiter used the term Sachlichkeit as early as 1896 to define realist tendencies that had been a part of the German debate for nearly a decade. Streiter raised the term in con- junction with Zweckm afigkeit and Funktion, establishing a linked meaning of these concepts from the beginning. Yet, the precise meaning of Sach- lichkeit was not altogether clearly defined. Streiter, for instance, used the word to describe the vernacular architecture of the Bavarian Gabriel von Seidl. The following year Lichtwark invoked the term in relation to the design of Messel s Wertheim Department Store in Berlin. This new linguis- tic preference within German theory for Sachlichkeit over the older term Realismus is made fully transparent in 1899 when Lichtwark, in the course of republishing an essay of 1897, changed its title from Realistische Archi- tektur to Sachliche Baukunst. ! Stanford Anderson has examined the use of such concepts in the early twentieth century. He writes that Muthesius did not advocate the pure Sachlichkeit of machines but rather a sachliche Kunst, an approach in which aesthetics seems to be paramount. Anderson has summed up a turn-of-the- century definition as follows: It was commonplace to recognize the engineering achievements of the nine- teenth century, from tools or instruments to the great bridges and railroad sheds. Whether the critics saw these works as exemplary achievements or, resignedly, as the representative objects of a materialist epoch, they could agree that such works and the processes that produced them were marked by ratio- 48 PHITOGUC ton nality, functionalism, and Zweckmafigkeit. Muthesius subsumed such qualities under the term pure Sachlichkeit.... Sachlichkeit is, then, a convenient umbrella term that invokes simplicity, a rational and straightforward attention to needs as well as to materials and processes, !1 Anderson cautions at the same time that Sachlichkeit cannot be understood completely by such a generalization. Variations of meaning existed in the work of Otto Wagner and Behrens, who Anderson believes employed a symbolic functionalism.\"\"' Behne and the Neue Sachlichkeit Since there was already a degree of variation in the way Sachlichkeit was used at the turn of the century, we should not expect that the term ever assumed a completely uniform connotation. The Neues Bauen in general and the references in architectural texts to Sachlichkeit have understandably been associated with the Neue Sachlichkeit, a name first popularized by Hartlaub in May 1923 when he used it in a circular announcing an exhibi- tion at the Mannheim Kunsthalle that took place in 1925. Ina letter to Alfred Barr of July 1929 Hartlaub explained that the term applied to the new real- ism with a socialist flavor.'2 In 1923 in a review of the Bauhaus exhibition Giedion also mentioned the neue Gegenstdndlichkeit (new objectivity) that is everywhere in evidence in painting.'? Gegenstand refers to a concrete object and is the same as the Russian veshch, which formed part of the Con- structivist debate. A Sache, by contrast, is a more general fact or thing with abstract connotations. The art historian Fritz Schmalenbach, who during the 1930s was at work ona book on the Neue Sachlichkeit, noted in an essay of 1940 that Wolfflin in his Kunstgeschichtliche Grundbegriffe (Principles of art history) and August Grisebach in Die Baukunst im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert, both of 1915, had used the term neue Sachlichkeit in passing. Schmalenbach, however, believed that Hartlaub s use of Sachlichkeit should be traced back to its architectural ori- gins in the writings of Muthesius, Lichtwark, and Loos.''* The use of neve in Neue Sachlichkeit, according to Hartlaub in a letter to Schmalenbach, was intended to position the artists in his exhibition against the old bourgeois naturalism of the Diisseldorf Academy.

In this conjunction of sachlich with Expressionistn we find a similarity to Behne s use of Sachlichkeit, that is, at least in the early 19208; the combination was used to suggest a transi- tion away from Expressionism without implying a complete rupture with Expressionism. Even Giedion, who later formed an intense dislike toward Expressionism, wrote in 1923 that the neue Gegenstdndlichkeit... has ab- sorbed the results of Expressionism. '! Dennis Crockett in his disserta- tion, Die Neue Sachlichkeit : Post-Expressionism in Germany, 1919-1925, which contains a more detailed discussion of these issues and a thorough overview of the transitional nature of Neue Sachlichkeit in painting, has also pointed out that for Hartlaub himself the Neue Sachlichkeit exhibition was not about al! of German art at the time it did not include abstract art, for instance, nor did it cover, in Hartlaub s opinion, all of realist art. He never regarded it as a counterdevelopment to Expressionism but rather as only one tendency in an evolution away from Expressionism. Hartlaub wrote that the new art was already contained in the old and retains much of the vision- ary quality of the older art. \"? In 1929 Hartlaub noted in his aforemen- tioned letter to Barr that the expression ought really to apply as a label to the new realism bearing a socialist flavour. It was related to the general contemporary feeling in Germany of resignation and cynicism after a period of exuberant hopes (which had found an outlet in expressionism). Cynicism and resignation are the negative side of the Neue Sachlichkeit, the positive side expresses itself in the enthusiasm for the immediate reality as a result of a desire to take things entirely objectively on a material basis without immediately investing them with ideal implications.!' Schmalenbach, however, in his essay of 1940 did not agree with Hartlaub s specific understanding of the term: In reality, it was not the objectivity of the new painting which the term was intended in the first place and above all to formulate, but something more universal underlying this objectivity, and of which it was the expression, a revolution in the general mental atti- tude of the times, a general new Sachlichkeit of thought and feeling. He also wrote that it constituted a radical rejection of all emotional bias, a deliber- ately cultivated unsentimentality.\" Most later historians defined Neue Sachlichkeit in terms of its sobriety and resignation but usually in oppo- sition to Expressionism. Marxist historians in particular saw it as the victory 50 of capitalism, Amerikanismus, and Fordism see, for example, Helmut Lethen, Neue Sachlichkeit, 1924-1932, 1970 or as an instance of a reac- tionary culture produced during the period of economic stabilization as in Jost Hermand s study of Neue Sachlichkeit, 1977.17 At any rate, the label from the outset, even Hartlaub s own early desig- nation, was somewhat tenuous because the title of the exhibition itself changed as it traveled throughout Germany. Also, Hartlaub s terminology initially competed with Franz Roh s preferred term Magischer Realismus (Magic Realism), which was influenced by Italian metaphysical painting. Occasionally historians have categorized two constituent wings of Neue Sachlichkeit, a left and a right: respectively, those artists who fall under Hartlaub s notion of realism with a socialist flavor, and those who fall under Roh s concept of Magic Realism.!21 In the second half of the decade Neue Sachlichkeit became a popular label without the distinctions Hartlaub had conceived; it was viewed as one example of the several coexisting mod- ernisms. Schmalenbach clearly preferred to use the term in its later, gener- alized, more all-encompassing sense. As noted above, in his letter to Alfred Barr of 1929, Hartlaub discussed the positive aspect of Neue Sachlichkeit as an enthusiasm for immediate reality, whereas its negative side was its cynicism and resignation. Hartlaub also explained that this healthy disillusionment finds its clearest expression in Germany in architecture. In the last analysis this battle cry is today much misused and it is high time to withdraw it from currency. Thus Hartlaub, who had coined the label in 1923, believed the term to have become mean- ingless by 1929. Of course, one does not have to agree with Hartlaub s complete rejection of Neue Sachlichkeit. His complaint about its misuse, however, tells us a great deal about its volatility over a brief six-year period. Behne, as early as 1926, had referred with a sense of irony to the gebildete Spiessertum s (cultured philistines ) enthusiastic embrace of a vulgarized version of Neue Sachlichkeit.'?? Most interesting for a discussion of Behne s Der moderne Zweckbau is Hartlaub s subtle understanding of a multifarious, ayered Modernism. To the degree that Hartlaub does not accept Neue Sach- ichkeit as a unified, comprehensive term, he seems to be in accord with Behne's definition of several directions present in 1923. Even more important for understanding the use of Sachlichkeit within the architectural debates of the r920s is Schmalenbach s suggestion that the abel Neue Sachlichkeit had its origins in architectural texts written before the war. This is supported by Hartlaub s belief, expressed in 1929, that Neue 5I \r",{"entities":[[395,402,"PER"],[645,652,"LOC"],[3142,3150,"LOC"],[3204,3209,"PER"],[4857,4862,"PER"]]}],["Sachlichkeit finds its clearest expression in German architecture. If the polemics at this stage have become too circular those in the arts look to architecture for justification, and those in architecture look to the arts for an explanation we can at least gain some insight from the intensity and back- and-forth of definitions that surround the controversies of the Neue Sach- lichkeit. We realize that it was by no means a static concept; it was in fact continually redefined. The same is true for Behne s notion of Sachlichkeit and his attitude toward Neue Sachlichkeit: meanings and emphases changed in his writings in the course of the 19208. In Die Wiederkehr der Kunst, 1919, Behne had elevated the study of folk art even above the study of Albrecht Diirer or any high art. He wrote in char- acteristic Expressionist fashion that we must rid ourselves of the rule of technology. Folk art dies where technique appears. '4 He also complained about Behrens s use of Sachlichkeit as if it could be employed as a template. In Behne s essay Architekten, 1921-1922, where he frequently refers to Sachlichkeit, his outright rejection of naturalism still has much in common with the Expressionists opposition to it, rather than with a resurgent real- ism of the Neue Sachlichkeit. He writes that art is a complete product of the human spirit and in this sense is antithetical to naturalism. He speaks of a tension between the natural and artistic, and he recommends replacing naturalism with Oud s belief in man s spiritual equality with nature. And using one of De Stijl s curious technospiritual metaphors, Behne concluded by exalting the spiritual freedom of the machine. 25 When he wrote Der moderne Zweckbau, however, Behne seems to have been more or less in agreement with Hartlaub, even though he uses the term naturalism, rather than realism, as was more common in painting: Academic and historical styles have been abandoned and the concept of the facade has been disposed of. Yet the house is still standing. Success is achieved by returning to purpose in an architectural development that has its precise counterpart in painting of the period, which likewise disposed of aca- demic and historical styles. Its medium is naturalism, which in the develop- ment of painting always allows a new freedom from prejudice, quite analogous to the significance that a return to function had for building. Naturalism in architecture is functional fitness (Karl Scheffler: Messel, p. 14). In Der moderne Zweckbau Behne did not satisfactorily explain why Zweck, Funktion, and Sachlichkeit are often used to form a constellation of words 52 that seem to stand for slightly different aspects of Modernism, or why Zweckbau is used in the title, and not Funktion or Sachlichkeit. Perhaps these were evolving concepts at the time. In his later writings, however, his defi- nition becomes clearer and the word Sachlichkeit begins to dominate other usages, probably in response to the increasingly widespread use of the term Neue Sachlichkett. In one of his books intended for a mass audience, Eine Stunde Architektur (One hour of architecture), 1928, he is more explicit re- garding the meaning of these terms: Zweckm dfigkeit is only our minimum expectation. We conceive function in a more thoroughgoing way. The archi- tect must not only fulfill given traditional functions, he must also establish new and higher functions. For this reason we shall prefer to speak of Sach- lichkeit.... Therefore, fulfillment of function is for us not an end-in-itself but a means to get closer to life.... Reality as a medium of work must be conquered. }?7 In 1927 Behne expanded his definition of Sachlichkeit in Neues Wohnen Neues Bauen, and Zweck no longer appears as often as it had in 1923. He writes that Sachlichkeit does not imply, as most assume, dryness, sobriety, or a solution from a purely mathematical point of view. Sachlichkeit simply means that the solution is adjusted to the Sache. He then goes on to explain what a Sache is: Each Sache is a nodal point, a crossing point of relations between human being and human being.... To work sachlich means there- fore to work socially in each discipline. To build sachlich means to build socially.\"8 Behne s explanation of Sachlichkeit as a primarily social enter- prise is similar to Simmel and Weber's notion of social action, and it aligns him in fact completely with Hartlaub s explanation of Neue Sachlichkeit. At the same time, his warning that it has nothing to do with a mathematical outlook, as most assume, indicates that by 192'7 a mechanistic and techno- centric understanding of the term had probably become prevalent. In Newes Wohnen Neues Bauen Behne further addresses some of the social issues that he had begun to explore in his earlier Frithlicht article in which he had praised Martin Wagner and the cooperative housing associa- tions as a transition to action (fig. 8}. He regards the housing shortage as the most pressing question in architecture, but goes on to say that housing is a political issue from the outset because it cannot be dealt with without also confronting the ownership of land (fig. 9). As in his and others Expres- sionist writings, the idea of the new man is still used. This is why he refers in the title of the book to dwelling before building.!2 In his Expressionist writings he had stressed the harmonious, unifying elements of folk art and 533 \r",{"entities":[[0,12,"PER"],[3722,3727,"PER"],[4836,4849,"PER"]]}],["Fig. 8.

This shift in Behne's atti- tude completely parallels changes seen in Taut s work and writings. Behne explains in greater detail in Neues Wohnen Neues Bauen what he means by building socially. He cites, among other examples such housing complexes as the Siedlung Reichsverband fiir Kriegsbeschidigte in Berlin- Friedrichsfeld, 1925-1926, for which concrete panels were cast on the site and put in place with the help of cranes on tracks a method adopted from Holland and further refined by Ernst May in Frankfurt. Yet Behne sees stan- dardization only as the precondition for social building. In a chapter called Diktatur oder Sachlichkeit (Dictatorship or Sach- lichkeit) he writes that Sachlichkeit can help to limit the dictatorship of the architect from above and the dictatorship of the tenant from below. He also points out that while some housing may took welcoming when new, it will look cramped once occupied because the tenants cannot afford new furni- ture. Often tenants themselves will add a petit bourgeois feeling to the interior by adding valances or antimacassars. But he also sees a tendency in modern architecture toward dictatorship if the building looks too much like a prison, and here he cites some of the housing by Oud. Whereas in his ear- lier writing he had been apologetic for the plain, apparently uninteresting look of Oud s work, he is now more critical, perhaps because Oud had refused to provide him with materials for Der moderne Zweckbau. Be that as it may, Behne maintains that if ornament is absent, the tenant feels his habitation looks like a penal institution and may automatically feel debased to the level of the proletariat because ornament is associated with the houses of the rich. He concludes that the architect has a tendency toward dictatorship in his attitude toward tenants and that tenants are partly right if they expect that architects are to serve them. At the same time he suggests that the tenant must be educated to become a ruling type just like the architect. His call for mutual education is rather characteristic of his trust in public education.\" In place of the Gothic cathedral of his Expressionist writings, Behne now turns to the image of a medieval knight encased in cumbersome armor as a metaphor for the general resistance to the concept of a social Sachlichkeit. In addition, he uses the walled city and its moat as an analogy for excluding Sachlichkeit in urban issues. He describes the Mietskaserne (literally, rental barracks) as the last castle, an example of an isolated, defensive space.132 Though the normal five-story apartment block with forty to sixty families is 56 a proper planning unit, it is in his opinion not an economic unit because ownership may change every twenty meters. There may also be a rigorous exploitation of the terrain, but this is not a sachliche, funktional zweckmafige solution. The knight in armor, he writes, has been placed at the disposal of high capitalism (figs. 10, 11).133 In his Von der Sachlichkeit, 1927, an introduction to a book on the work of Max Taut, Behne writes that a building can have many functiona requirements and that Sachlichkeit is really the disciplined thought required to weigh them against each other. Here he also launches a very early critique of the Zeilenbau, the placement of parallel rows of buildings running north and south without regard to the site or street configuration. Behne regards the Zeilenbau method as too dogmatic because hygiene has been allowed to become the sole determining factor of architecture. This solution, he believes, is completely unsachlich and, in the end, formalistic. Behne and Bruno Taut among the modernists (fig. 12) in contrast to Gropius, May, and Hannes Meyer criticized the Zeilenbau, which was used as a plan- ning scheme with increasing frequency in the late 1920s. Behne in an essay of 1930 would find fault with Gropius s Dammerstock Siedlung for this reason. Martin Wagner, associated with both Behne and Bruno Taut, also objected to the Existenzminimum, or minimum housing standard, as defined at cIAM 11 in Frankfurt, even though he strongly supported a rationalized system of production throughout the 1920s.134 In Neues Wohnen Neues Bauen Behne summarizes his argument with the statement that the greatest work of art results from the creation of a maximum of human respect for the most. \"5 This assertion in effect seems to be simply a slight reformulation of Jeremy Bentham s eighteenth- century utilitarianism, which held that the greatest happiness of the greatest number is the self-evident, fundamental principle of morality. Just as utili- tarianism later came to be understood as a purely pragmatic, economic con- cept Behne himself uses it in its debased form in Der moderne Zweckbau so the social implication of Behne s notion of Sachlichkeit, shared by Hart- laub s concept of Neue Sachlichkeit, was made blander and more uniform in its popularized form. In his Eine Stunde Architektur, 1928, Behne maintained his basically antimechanistic notion of Sachlichkeit by writing that fantasy need not be left behind.#3* Contrasting the image of the armored knight as a metaphor for regression, he introduces the saint as the prophet of Sachlichkeit: Func- tion is the real saint in art history.

Saint Jerome, the scholar-monk on whose translation of the Bible the Latin Vulgate was based, has been brought out of his study into the open air of a Siedlung (housing development}. The mysticism with which the Middle Ages was often invested in Expressionism has now simply become a shorthand device for revealing the new man at the center of Sachlichkeit. Behne s Blick tiber die Grenze: Baukunst des Auslandes (View across the border: Architecture of foreign countries), published in 1925 in association with the Werkbund, contains the same internationalism and many of the same ideas expressed the following year in Der moderne Zweckbau. Like his Funktion und Form article of 1924, this may have been an attempt on his part to stake out his position vis-a-vis Gropius s Internationale Architektur. In Blick iiber die Grenze Behne expands upon his critique of German culture as moving from one extreme to the other and on its position between East and West. He writes that countries with a strong identifiable culture tend to be evolutionary and rarely succumb to dictators. He then makes one of his politically most insightful statements: Germany ...lacks a common culture and would be easy prey for a dictator, if it did not have a chronic shortage of strong authoritarians [Wilensmensch]. No country has a harder time making unequivocal decisions. It swings between mistrust and belief, between democracy and dictatorship; between union with and isolation from Europe, between East and West, between yesterday and tomorrow. '3* Although criti- cal in his assessment, Behne is not sufficiently prescient in believing that there is a shortage of authoritarian figures. By 1925, however, he is less san- guine than he had been in 1923 when he quoted Heinrich Mann on the need for a union between East and West. Still using his dualistic paradigm, he describes Russia as Europe s dynamic pole (speaking about Futurism and Constructivism) in whose revolutionary setting time becomes defined as experience. On the other hand, France to him represents a static pole in which time becomes a measure defined by tradition. More interestingly, he asks whether politics is not always the determining factor and writes that in Italy and Russia political methods have become dictatorial because both Bolshevists and Fascists are antidemocratic.

After all, much of what is today considered modern architecture had not yet been built. Behne is, nevertheless, more comprehensive than Hitch- cock and Johnson when it comes, for example, to Russian architecture. He is one of the few authors who during this period included the work of a female architect, Alexandra Exter s Isvestia Pavilion (1923). Chronologically, Behne s work might be compared with Mendelsohn s lecture Dynamik und Funk- tion, delivered in Amsterdam in 1923, in which Mendelsohn noted: Whereas the grasping, pulling, and tearing activities of the machine are purely utilitarian functions, and function as conceived of in construction demon- strates only mathematical inevitability, function in architecture can only mean spatial and formal dependence on the givens derived from the program, the material and the construction. Therefore it seems impossible to me to some- how want to transfer the purposeful function of machines to the space, or the technological organization to the organism of architecture.... The machine, previously the obedient handyman of deadly exploitation, becomes a construc- tive element of a new living organism. ... Thus the machine simultaneously becomes a symbol of decay as well as an element of a newly ordered life.\" {In general, Mendelsohn s concern with expression and the representation of dynamic tension clearly differentiates this practicing architect-polemicist from the more analytical considerations of Behne, who grouped Mendel- sohn with the romantic functionalists.'4 Behne continued to be concerned about the belated publication of Der moderne Zweckbau, even after its appearance in 1926. In Neues Wohnen Neues Bauen, 1927, he lists Der moderne Zweckbau both in the text and in the bibliography as having been published in 1925, probably a deliberate pre- dating that was inadvertently picked up in a bibliography of Behine s writings by the Werkbund Archiv in 1972 and in some other publications.\" At the sare time, Behne, while listing Gropius s Internationale Architektur in his bibliography, does not give it a date. His initial conflict with Gropius over the publication of their respective books was clearly not forgotten. Behne today, however, has the last word: in the republication of his book in the Ullstein Bauwelt Fundamente series in 1964, the date of its conception and writing, not of its publication, appears prominently on the cover. Gropius and Behne were often on opposite sides of the architectural debate in the late 19208, but they also never stopped communicating with each other. In October of 1934 Gropius sent a letter to Behne, who by that 62 Fig. 13. Max Fischer, Collage of Albrecht Diirer s Saint Jerome and Le Corbusier's roof garden at Stuttgart-Weissenhof.

Gropius wrote that he hoped that Behne was not too depressed and remarked that sometimes such an involuntary break is useful in sorting out those events that are truly meaningful: You are not really missing anything here. The conditions are so terribly distasteful, because an unparalleled irresolution reigns. Even in the camp of those in power opinions swing from one extreme to the other. The cultural area, which we think we know especially well, seems gro- tesque, and no one, even responsible people with whom I spoke in the min- istry of propaganda and in the Reichskulturkammer, know where the trip is headed. !#? Behne s supposition of 1925 that Germany would be an easy prey for a dictator but lacked authoritarian figures had turned out to be overly optimistic. Sachlichkeit in the Publications of Other Modernists None of the later books by Behne s friends and colleagues carried the detailed precision of Der moderne Zweckbau. They tended to rely more on their illustrations than had Behne s book. In Internationale Architektur Gropius freely admitted the existence of individual and national characteris- tics in current architecture, but despite this he discerned certain unifying characteristics, in effect the international architecture that had been the subject of his Bauhaus exhibition of 1923. He saw the common characteris- tics as a manifestation of a shared Gestaltungswille, or creative will. Any notion of Sachlichkeit that he perceived as yet another aspect of the new mode was subsumed under this idealistic concept of a creative will.!3 In his Internationale neue Baukunst, first published in 1927 under the auspices of the Werkbund, Hilberseimer finds a unity in contemporary architecture much as Gropius had, in the existence of a creative wil! rather than a style: The creative will of the architect dominates everything ...[The new archi- tecture is the] expression of spiritual permeation. ... It is not based on a styl- istic conception. '*4 Neither Gropius nor Hilberseimer defines the new architecture as a style or in mechanistic terms. However, their reliance on the idea of a creative will seems to be indebted to Schopenhauer or Riegl s idea of Kunstwollen. Sachlichkeit here seems to be an extension of the creative will 64 and not, as in Behne s explanation, a social issue. Bruno Taut s definition of functional architecture in his book Modern Architecture, 1929, does address social and ethical questions, although in a less subtle way than Behne. By the 1930s, however, Taut would criticize his own earlier definition as too reductive.\" German writers were, of course, not unique in presenting Modernism as more than a technocentric polemic. Alberto Sartoris s Gli elementi dell archi- tettura funzionale (Elements of a functional architecture), first published in 1932, defined functional architecture in terms of paired opposites. He saw contemporary building characterized by both logic and lyricism, the practi- cal and the aesthetic, both matter and spirit.1 There were also noteworthy exceptions to this modulated analysis of con- temporary architecture. Behrendt s Der Sieg des neuen Baustils, 1927, pub- ished in conjunction with the Stuttgart Werkbund Exhibition, emphasized the style of the new architecture: its simple forms, flat planes, and absence of ornament. Behrendt regarded this as a proper expression of contem- porary life, which he equated with machines, cars, and airplanes in the uninflected manner of early Futurism. And Giedion, for example, in his Bauen in Frankreich, Bauen in Eisen, Bauen in Eisenbeton (Building in France, Building in Iron, Building in Ferroconcrete), 1928, based his methodology as he would later in Space, Time, and Architecture) almost entirely on a materialistic premise, the development of new materials like iron and concrete, and the expectation of a yet-to-be-invented, even newer material for the twentieth century. In his review of the Bauhaus exhibition of 1923 he had already set out a similarly deterministic viewpoint. He wrote that while each material imposes absolute requirements, the Stilwille (style will) of our time will select instinctively those materials that are most adapted to its psyche, such as glass, concrete, and iron. He adds further that above this automatic response to ideal form is the machine.'#* Giedion s curious combination of idealism (Stilwille) with materialism is, of course, what prevailed as the standard reading of architectural history into the mid- twentieth century. More moderate books published in the second half of the 1920s do not differ substantially from those of the avant-garde in a broad and usually non- mechanistic interpretation of functionalism. Gustav Platz in Die Baukunst der neuesten Zeit (Architecture of the most recent time), 1927, saw current architecture as existing between two poles: between the social, collective problems of the period and an unbridled activity of individual impulses. 65 \r",{"entities":[]}],["Like Behne before him, Platz distinguished between functionalism and util- itarianism. Function for Platz could even be a spiritual, artistic agent. 49 Another one of these moderate books is Berliner Architektur der Nach- kriegszeit (Berlin architecture of the postwar period), 1928, edited by E. M. Hajos and L. Zahn. And although its subject was more circumscribed, it had a perceptive introductory text by Edwin Redslob. Redslob, an art historian, later became (with the Werkbund s urging) Reichskunstwart, or overseer of all federal art projects. He defined modern architecture as follows: Cre- ation, not imitation should be the appropriate expression of our day. For the architect this means an end to the repetition of old styles... , but at the same time [creation] also mitigates against copying of engineering motifs, some- thing the fashion of the day has decreed as a substitute for the despised imi- tation of styles. \"* Not unlike Behne, Redslob regarded both approaches as potentially dangerous. He called the imitation of older styles a decorative formalism produced by the romanticizers of history ; the copying of engi- neering motifs he referred to as functional formalism practiced by the romanticizers of technology. What makes it impossible to associate the general notion of Sachlich- keit exclusively with Modernism in Germany is that conservatives claimed it as well. The most influential among these was undoubtedly Schultze- Naumburg, who since the start of the century had produced a series of books under the general title Kulturarbeiten (Cultural works). These dealt largely with anonymous urban, rural, and garden architecture. Schultze- Naumburg s didactic books were intended for a general public, and they were indeed widely read. In addition to texts they also contained pictorial contrasts of good and bad architecture, or examples and counterexamples, as he called them. In almost all of his comparisons older buildings are seen as preferable to more recent ones. Further, his categorical good and bad con- trasts made his books a simple, efficient, and popular teaching tool.15! In his book Kunst und Rasse (Art and race}, 1928, Schultze-Naumburg turned to a racial explanation of visual expression. The best art, he claimed, was always produced by pure, unmixed races. He did not insist on the supremacy of the Aryan race as some other writers had. Instead, he blamed what he regarded as the current low state of the arts on a greater mixture of formerly discrete racial types, a racial hodgepodge that he felt was made possible by modern technology, especially by the new faster modes of trans- portation. Behne castigated Kunst und Rasse in a review of 1929. He wrote that aside from its racism, it was patently absurd art history, because 66 Schultze-Naumburg assumed a clear analogy between pictorial figural rep- resentations and the way the human body actually looks.'5? Most interestingly, Schultze-Naumburg criticized modern buildings not because they were too abstract nor because they had no ornament, but because he linked them with the debased expressions of an industrialized society. For this reason he disliked buildings from the late nineteenth century as much as current architecture, He made this point over and over in another one of his books of the late 19208, Das Gesicht des deutschen Hauses (The face of the German house), 1929, which was really a sequel to Kunst und Rasse, but one that dealt exclusively with architecture. Schultze- Naumburg, for instance, contrasted an old rural town, which for him expressed coherence, with modern architecture that displayed what he regarded as the incoherence of the machine age. Schultze-Naumburg s good-and-bad juxtapositions do not have quite the moralizing conviction of Augustus Welby Pugin s Contrasts of 1836. Nevertheless, as in Pugin, there is in all of Schultze-Naumburg s writings a high degree of nostalgia for a less confusing past. Both men reacted against industrialization and urban- ization. While the Industrial Revolution had occurred in England over a long period of time, in Germany it was telescoped into a few decades of the late nineteenth century, producing disturbingly rapid social changes that, in the words of the historian Golo Mann, could be compared to an explosion. !54 What Schultze-Naumburg seemed to look for in preindustrial architecture was the security of calm simplicity and also, surprisingly, Sach- lichkeit. In the preface to Das Gesicht des deutschen Hauses he wrote that his object with the earlier Kulturarbeiten had been to call attention to the then little-noticed, simple, bourgeois architecture before 1800. In fact, Schultze- Naumburg s selections are almost analogous to those of Pau] Mebes in his influential Um 1800 (Around 1800) of 1908.'* It represents, in effect, a Bie- dermeier revival of sorts with parallel implications of a withdrawal from the contemporary world and its social upheavals into a more comfortable realm of older conventions. Although Schultze-Naumburg objected to the Werkbund s Weissenhof Siedlung illustrated by him without proper identification (ail counter- examples are condemned in his books to eternal anonymity) he rejected not its severity, abstract quality, or even modern style. What he disliked was the absence of pitched roofs. While Schultze-Naumburg had been an early member of the Werkbund, by 1925 he had distanced himself from its activities. For Schultze-Naumburg the pitched roof was the primordial 67 \r",{"entities":[[5,10,"PER"],[23,28,"PER"],[100,105,"PER"],[294,305,"PER"],[310,318,"PER"],[409,423,"PER"],[424,431,"PER"],[945,950,"PER"],[952,959,"PER"],[1659,1677,"PER"],[2129,2134,"PER"],[2139,2144,"PER"],[2167,2184,"PER"],[2663,2668,"PER"],[2673,2678,"PER"],[2784,2801,"PER"],[2936,2953,"PER"],[3421,3426,"PER"],[3431,3436,"PER"],[3488,3506,"PER"],[3840,3845,"PER"],[3866,3883,"PER"],[4099,4106,"LOC"],[4256,4265,"PER"],[4311,4328,"PER"]]}],["Figs. 1qa, Bruno Taut, Photograph of the SS Australia as modern architecture.

He wrote that to omit it would be like having a face without a nose (a rather awkward physiognomic analogy). His general objec- tion, symptomatic of contemporary conservative reactions to Modernism, is part and parcel of a racial theory of physiognomic expression. But at the game time he also couched his critique in a rational argument. He wrote that the flat roof may be quite suitable for a Mediterranean setting, where it can be regarded as an indigenous ethnic expression, but he found it totally inappropriate in the North, where it lacks tradition and is impractical. He complained that the new architecture pretends to be sachlich but is nothing of the sort. Although his argument was rife with inconsistencies, he and other traditionalists claimed Sachlichkeit for themselves. Possibly because of the inflammatory quality of Schultze-Naumburg s writings, the flat roof of modern architecture became a major issue of the architectural debate in Germany.\"** This was surely an instance of the negative side of the intense architectural polemics in Germany in the early twentieth century. To summarize attitudes in Germany in the 1920s, questions of function- alism ranged from the nuanced discussion of Behne, to the more simplis- tic idealizing interpretation of Gropius and Hilberseimer, to the reductive utilitarian-pragmatic explanation of Schultze-Naumburg, in whose writing Sachlichkeit is a cover for ethnic appropriateness. The functionalism ascribed by Hitchcock and Johnson to Hannes Meyer was hardly symptomatic of the whole conceptual development and complexities of this issue in German theory. Taut s Modern Architecture, used by David Watkin to criticize the mod- ernist notion of functionalism, contains the following passage: The out- ward characteristics of the new construction flat roofs, huge sheets of glass... horizontal ribbon windows with pillars...were finally reduced to the level of a kind of sport, as has happened and is still happening to the admirable ancient styles.... In the same way, the modern style has been imitating itself (figs, 14a, b).!5 Thus three years before Hitchcock and John- son elevated conternporary aesthetic tendencies to stylistic principles, Taut had already satirized them as fashionable clich s. Like Taut, his friend Behne had demonstrated even earlier that the definition of a modern style should not be of central concern. By investigating the ideologies behind the various approaches to functionalism in the early 1920s, he uncovered at the same time the eclecticism and pluralism of early Modernism. qo Notes References of the type The Modern Functional Building (oo} direct the reader to the appro- priate page of the translation of Behne s text that appears in this volume.

No Longer a Facade but a House In the last few decades of European architecture, Baroque design has congealed into an arid academicism. Among the very rare buildings of char- acter are Franz Schwechten s Stettin and Anhalt railroad stations in Berlin (1878). The plan was dominated by facades overloaded with decorative motifs, Heidelberg castles with a composition irrelevant to their functional requirements. The most grotesque example: Ihne s Staatsbibliothek in Berlin, a concrete building that needs an artifical, complicated iron frame to support its sandstone Baroque facade, like a mask; or, by the same (hne, the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum, in whose plan the flight of stairs in the vestibule could be moved from one side to the other without having the slightest effect on the architecture of the building as a whole. At almost the same time a determined opposition, associated with the names of H. P. Berlage, Alfred Messel, and Otto Wagner, was successfully asserting itself in Holland, Germany, and Austria. Buildings by these lead- ing architects, which became benchmarks, are the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Wertheim Department Store in Berlin, and the buildings for the Vienna Stadtbahn. Work on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange started in 1897, the first phase of the Wertheim Building on LeipzigerstraBe was com- pleted in 1898, and the Vienna Stadtbahn dates from 1894 to 1897. The casino in Saint-Malo by the brothers Auguste and Gustave Perret, with a reinforced concrete vault that is very bold for its period, dates from the same time (1899/1900). But, as was so often also the case with the Perret brothers later buildings, the architecture remained untouched by the con- structional innovations. Berlage (b. 1856), Messel (b. 1853), and Otto Wagner (b. 1841) are the first generation of leaders in the fight for the renewal of architecture. * America s first modern architect, Arthur [Louis Henry] Sullivan, born 1856 in \r",{"entities":[[188,204,"PER"],[207,243,"ARCH"],[247,253,"LOC"],[331,349,"ARCH"],[449,465,"ARCH"],[469,475,"LOC"],[625,648,"ARCH"],[906,919,"PER"],[921,934,"PER"],[940,951,"PER"],[990,997,"LOC"],[999,1006,"LOC"],[1012,1020,"LOC"],[1095,1119,"ARCH"],[1125,1150,"ARCH"],[1154,1160,"LOC"],[1188,1205,"ARCH"],[1218,1242,"ARCH"],[1283,1300,"ARCH"],[1304,1319,"LOC"],[1353,1369,"ARCH"],[1399,1419,"ARCH"],[1436,1462,"PER"],[1613,1628,"PER"],[1719,1726,"PER"],[1738,1744,"PER"],[1760,1771,"PER"],[1900,1906,"PER"],[1921,1929,"PER"]]}],["Berlage, Messel, and Wagner were all trained during the period of acade- micism and eclecticism, and their own early works were eclectic. It suffices to name Berlage s fantastic plan for a mausoleum in which he actually intended to use all historical styles side by side (1889), Messel s Werder-Haus and his office building on KrausenstraBe (Berlin, 1894/1895), and Otto Wagner's ideal design, Artibus (1880). This makes their historical achieve- ment all the more important. They developed the first sound modern buildings in which form was no longer a finished, independent construct based on books and rules, with only very superficial connection with the Berlage: Stock exchange elevation object, but actually became an always new, young, and specific function of the project, or at least approached it. Berlage, Messel, and Wagner provided the new architecture with the gift of Sachlichkeit; they were the first who dared affirm consciously and consistently and to make into a positive design tool something that until then had been avoided and pushed aside: purpose.? This development is particularly clear in the case of Berlage. His first competition sketch for the stock exchange, from 1895 academic architec. ture in a Dutch Renaissance style, scarcely distinguishable from Cuypers s railroad station or his Rijksmuseum has such a confused abundance of motifs that it looks tike a small town.' in 1897 three designs rapidly devel- oped into a modern stock exchange.  Boston, died 1924 in Chicago, belongs to the same generation. His Wainwright Building in St. Louis was the earliest skyscraper. he first already shaws an extraordinary degree of simplification. A unified building emerges from the gables, towers, and onion domes; a single roof runs fram the entrance, stripped of its peculiar architecture, right through to the last room. The confident strength of the quiet masses replaces the uncertainty of many facades fitted over one another. The new feature of the strong corner tower emphasizes the building s unshakable strength. The second design shows no fundamental progress but translates the first design s very arid institutional Gothic into a suppler, more personal ecclesiastical Gothic. The third version almost completely replaces ele- ments of historical style with a very energetic reassurance and an increas- ing respect for rectangularity, a tendency further strengthened in the built version. Incidentally the small De Nederianden office building in The Hague, built in 1895 and much improved by remodeling in 1905, acted as a harbinger for the work on the stock exchange. n his book Grundlagen und Entwicklung der Architektur [The foundations and development of architecture} (Berlin, 1908), based on lectures given in Zurich in 1907, Berlage defines the path that we must now adopt, the path that will be available for the future, and that will lead us to a new art: 1. A geometric scheme should once again provide the basis of architectural corn- position. 2. The characteristic forms of earlier styles should not be used. 3. Architectural forms should be developed in the spirit of Sachlichkeit (p. 100).) The successive versions of the building Berlage put up in Amsterdam more and more resembied a commercial conference center or office block. The first design could equally weil have been interpreted as a theater, museum, railroad station, restaurant, palace, or town hall, The final build- ing does not unmistakably say stock exchange, but it no longer contains misleading elements, with the possible exception of the tower. At least it has a general physiognomy, and that is the main thing. A French critic (l architecte, 1924, p. 8) compares the creator of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange with Vaudremer: But Vaudremer did not have the honor of defi- nitively leading the young generation down the path of a French national architecture. Berlage has that honor in Dutch architecture. ?

(The stages of his own work were the Werder-Haus, the house on Krausenstra@Be, the Wertheim store on OranienstraBe, the Wert- heim store on RosenthalerstraBe.) y To his contemporaries the Wertheim store represented a more forcefu and lucid sally against the tradition of form than any other building of its period. Here a desire to do complete justice to purpose and to resist aes- thetic clich was more successful than anywhere else. It was not Messel s ambition to build a beautiful facade behind which enough space could ul mately be found to accommodate the business of a department store but rather to provide an entirely distinct, concise form for the management of a department store, one arising from the most refined and alert sense of its quite particular and specific requirements and needs. Thus out of the require- ment for maximum light and display window area, Messel designed for LeipzigerstraBe a glass wall hung between slender stone piers; he designed open light wells that reveal the structure of the building as if in cross section. Here a new type arose from the fulfillment of purpose. This building could be nothing other than a department store, a warehouse, an emporium, a gigantic department store. Otto Wagner s contemporary buildings for the Vienna Stadtbahn are seemingly much less revolutionary (incidentally, in 1884, Wagner, too, pro- duced a project for the Amsterdam Stock Exchange). A certain classicism persists but yet they are essentially modern. They have an austerity, clarity, and coolness that enable them to accommodate constructional parts remarkably well, even when highly traditional elements remain. Consistent with their building sequence: The stations of the Stadtbahn show the grad- ual development of this utilitarian style. On the Gilrtellinie, Wagner is still working freely with classical forms, predominantly with the Doric style; on the Wientallinie, the iron construction is formally ermphasized in the great decorative arches of the outer halls; the Donaukanallinie represents another step forward: everything becomes simpler and more structural as iron arches are replaced by stanchions with braced girders (Dagobert Frey).8 Simple horizontais and verticals are retained almost throughout, placed strictly parallel to the always dominant track; and in their emotionless, dis- tant cooiness they absolutely produce the effect of transport buildings. They remain perfectly within their sphere, whereas Messel s Wertheim Building contains a strongly alien artistic element, which was to appear increasingly in Messel s later work. It is indeed curious that Messel, who at first showed the most revolu- tionary achievement among the three architects, did not continue along the newly opened path, whereas both Berlage and Otto Wagner moved step by step toward their goal. Berlage s route led from the stock exchange to the Diamantbewerkersbond (1899), the De Nederlanden office building in Rotterdam (1910), Muller & Cos office building in London (1914), and the sketch for the Upper House in The Hague (1921). And Otto Wagner created the Postsparkasse building in Vienna after 1903 at a time when Messel had already returned to a traditional building style that in 1910 fed to his sketches for a Berlin museum, that is, to a style that once more completely suppressed purpose in favor of a beautiful facade. In contrast, Otto Wagner s development went as follows: Kirche Am Steinhof (1906), Universitatsbibliotek (1910), block of flats in Vienna vii (1911), Lupusheil- statte [Sanatorium] (1913). From Otto Wagner s Baukunst unserer Zeit (first edition, 1895); Here it is appropriate to shout a loud and encouraging forward to the modern creative architect and to warn him against an excessive and heartfelt devotion to the old, so that he might regain a (however modest) self-confidence, without which no great act whatsoever can arise.!4 ... If | were to summarize what has been said in this book and try to coin in a few words what is essential, in order to show the young architect the shortest and best way to the goal in any kind of work, these words and the sequence of their application would run approximately as follows: 1. A scrupulously exact apprehension and compiete fulfillment of the purpose (down to the smallest detail); 2. A happy choice of the material of construction to be used (meaning one that is readily available, easily workable, long-lasting, economical); 3. Simple and economic construction; and only considering these three main points; 4, The form arising from these premises (it will flow from the pen as if of its own accord and will always be easily understandable). !> lf we look more closely, we ought to recognize that the Wertheim Building to put it paradoxically is more revolutionary than its architect, yet not as revolutionary as it seems.

But even in Germany, beginning with Olbrich's Tietz store in Dusseldorf, we soon see walls once again gaining mass, the system of piers receding, and horizontals again reappearing, so that by the time we get to Emil Schaudt s Kaufhaus des Westens in Charlottenburg, there is nothing at all left of Messel s system. No doubt this development was affected by building codes that for fire protection required a solid wall at least one meter high between every two floors; thus, horizontal articulation was arrested, but the ultimate reasons went deeper than this. Messel s facade seemed highly structural in its intention, but in the shadow of the roof and behind the capital-like ornamental headwork the piers are without much ado transformed into a harmless wall, thus revealing that the grandiloquent profile is merely decorative. The connection between roof and wall is very superficial, and the roof is a feeble, spaceless stopgap. In a competition design of 1910 for an extension to Messel s building, Bruno Taut underlined Messel s principle with greater purity: his smooth piers are arched above to form the wall supporting the roof.! In his design for a Mittag department store in Magdeburg (1913), the same architect carried Messel s idea of verticality to its logical constructional solution by supporting the roof from above with concrete piers using a system of arches. Messel s piers were not really the strong element that they first appeared but rather the weak element of his building. They were a conse- quence of the unclear thinking that led Messel to stack five ground floors on top of one another. The idea of increasing display space fivefold is looking at the matter rationally a mistake, as only the ground-floor windows are actually display windows. The upper rows of windows have little or no signifi- cance for advertising purposes; in fact, displays were very quickly removed from them and replaced with screenlike stands. Thus one did not even take full advantage of an additional light source. This is why we said that Messel s idea, directed solely at light and display space, was not entirely sachlich. It led him to stack five floors of display windows atop one another, and this in turn led to a verticality that brought piers into being as a stop- gap measure; basically the piers are nothing more than the additive lifting above the street level, a fivefold raising of the street elevation making Le Corbusier s remark that modern German architecture is frequently an elevator-shaft architecture absolutely accurate in the case of the Wertheim Buiiding.18 And it is also because of the internal inconsistency of these apparently so grandiloquent piers that the roof sits on them as it does: unrelated, thin, and random, like a makeshift roof. (Anyone wishing to adopt the terminology of Leo Frobenius in Das unbekannte Afrika could see verticalism as a continuing effect of Ethiopian-tellurian pile-frame architec- ture and horizontalism as a persisting element of Hamitic-chthonic building. It is incidentally also remarkable that Frobenius describes Hamitic social structure as horizonta! layering [castes] and Ethiopian social structure as vertical layering [clans].)}!9 There is thus a great deal to criticize in this building of 1898, which when it was expanded, probably contrary to Messel's original conception, acquired multiple axes. And yet at the time it was of the greatest signifi- cance, although this was probably more psychological than strictly tectonic. The department store as a type did not develop in this direction, not in Germany, indeed not even in Berlin, and Messel himself recognized why in the way he terminated the building facing Leipzigerplatz. Here, warmly applauded by cultured people, he adopted an ecclesiastical note with a strong Gothic element, which led a Berlin critic to remark that the opening of a new department store in the Lustgarten (Raschdorff's cathedral) cain- cided with the consecration of a new cathedral on Leipzigerplatz.2 The ecclesiastical note had already been struck in the first building phase with the system of tall monumental piers. When foreshortened, they closed to form a solemn church wall. It rather gave the impression of a gigantic Gothic church converted into a store by installing intermediate ceil- ings and glass paneling. In the first building phase this tendency may have derived from an inner uncertainty, but in the section facing the square it became a conscious game with Gothicizing style elements. Allin all this building, apparently designed more radically in pursuit of purpose than any other of its period, is a very artificial construction, which is probably clearest when one compares it with, for instance, the architec- ture of the Louvre Department Store in Paris. It cannot be said, however, that this establishes a new type if there really is such a thing! The fact that a department store has become much larger has not changed the basis for the French architect. He thinks per- haps more conservatively but also genuinely more sachlich. He places large display windows where they are appropriate and have a purpose: on the ground floor. On the upper stories there are many windows arranged in \r",{"entities":[[62,69,"PER"],[104,119,"LOC"],[218,224,"PER"],[259,266,"LOC"],[315,322,"LOC"],[339,346,"PER"],[514,526,"PER"],[529,549,"ARCH"],[553,567,"LOC"],[601,607,"ARCH"],[864,870,"ARCH"],[1289,1295,"ARCH"],[1308,1318,"PER"],[1330,1336,"PER"],[1463,1486,"ARCH"],[1490,1499,"LOC"],[1535,1541,"PER"],[1683,1689,"PER"],[1862,1868,"PER"],[2350,2356,"PER"],[2734,2746,"PER"],[2872,2892,"ARCH"],[3882,3889,"LOC"],[3910,3916,"LOC"],[3922,3928,"LOC"],[4218,4240,"ARCH"],[5058,5081,"ARCH"],[5085,5091,"LOC"]]}],["regularly ordered rows. One story is placed above another: not as a repeated ground floor but as second, third, fourth, and fifth floor, i.e., with conscious emphasis on the horizontal, corresponding to reality. Finally the vaulted roof with its many skylights and chimneys makes the whole thing look like a warehouse, a gigantic storehouse accommodating a large number of things at the same time. in brief, the modern department store ultimately finds a mode of expression here where it was not being sought, an expression more genuine and purer than in Messel s work simply because the tendency to grandiose stylization is absent, a tendency that inclined excessively toward art and thus led to a falsely ecclesiastical character, isolating the building fram its neighbors, although its purpose is not particularly different from theirs. The Louvre Department Store remains entirely a part of the street, and precisely this is part of its truth. As the department store was built quite specifically in, on, and for the street, it is not allowed to be the most alien, conspicuous, and isolated building along the entire street, which was the case with Messel s store along LeipzigerstraBe. Messel s pointed, one-sided emphasis on a single function display made him untrue to the whole; the building lacked integration. If we nevertheless assign Messel s building such an important place, it is because it had enormous psychological impact. He gave others the courage to break away from conventional schemes, to dare to create new types even though his own attempt was far less happy and far less sachlich than it first appeared. The modern country-house plan was also developed in the mid-1890s by the Chicago architect Frank Lloyd Wright, Sullivan's student.2! Conventional ter- minology would not place the country house in the category of functional buildings, but the sensibility articulated in Wright's new floor plans is extra- ordinarily important as it is characterized by the liberation of the plan from formalist rigidity by returning to the functional element. This development begins somewhere between the plans for the Winslow House in River Forest (1893) and the Heller House in Chicago (1896) and reaches its peak in the plan for the Coonley House in Riverside (1908). Here Wright has given up fitting the rooms together in an ornamental scheme in favor of free balanc- ing in space (Herre), based on the most careful inclusion of all require- ments of comfort, quiet, and clear design.?? There is no longer any trace of symmetry or axis, simply walls succinctly marking and accompanying the most comfortable traffic patterns for all the rooms. The accommodation to living functions goes so far that each piece of furniture has its specific place in the floor plan. This plan unfolds. The house is not complicated by stairs ascending to the upstairs a rudiment of medieval castle and masonry wall architecture. The plot of land has space enough to allow the building and almost all its rooms to develop directly at ground level. In Wright s plans the rooms are not inserted next to one another but set in motion as asymmetrically as life itself, strangely enough. Influenced by the Japanese, Wright already started building unusually flat roofs, mostly with wide overhangs. This means suppressing the picturesque and stressing constructional and cubic elements. It is logical that a house organized as reely balanced spaces should reject the roof as a hat that unites every- thing. Even the roof changes from a motif into a function. Wright's influence on European architecture was significant: in Germany (Peter Behrens, Gropius, Mendelsohn, Mies van der Rohe); in Holland (Oud b. 1890], Jan Wils, van t'Hoff, Greve); in Switzerland (Le Corbusier); in Czechoslovakia (Obrtel, Krejcar, Tyl, Cerny, Vigek, Fragner, Feuerstein) at irst probably affecting the elevation more than the plan, which has only recently come to be fully understood.?? Compositionally, Wright's country houses are of the greatest significance because they consistently emphasize the horizontal. Their high-tension, nervy force, always contrasting ingeniously with concise verticals, actually makes the houses look as though they are a component of the street, although in their very idiosyncratic interpenetration of public and private space they almost never open to the roadside. Eschewing all ornament, which to our taste often plays a surprising role in the interior (recently increasing also on the exterior), he achieves the aesthetic composition of the house from the basic elements of accelerated horizontal movement, subtly and strikingly stopped verticals, and textured walis that never appear as supporting but always as supported parts. All visible parts are com- pletely conveyed as function: the precise relationship of open and closed areas produces the building Every attentive observer senses the close connection with machine aes- thetics, completely new in the history of architecture. In an essay for the New York Architectural Record in 1908, Wright says: The machine cannot be removed from the world, it is here to stay. It is the fore- runner of the democracy that is the final goal of our hopes and dreams.

But what does he do instead? He abuses this tool in reproducing forms born of other times, under distant skies, forms that today seem boring because one cannot avoid them anywhere; all of this happens with the help of the machine, whase main task it is to destroy just these forms.?4 Berlage, Otto Wagner, and Alfred Messel (the latter with the reservations mentioned above) had successfully championed the cause of Sachlichkeit. But their Sachlichkeit was restricted primarily to resisting and avoiding Unsachlichkeit. Common sense, a feeling for cleanliness and its practice found acceptance, and fear of purpose ceased. But they still failed to address the task directly enough. They remained house builders. It may be that their commissions (stock exchange, office building, etc.) had some- thing to do with this. At any rate, they did not approach the plan in a new way. Even Otto Wagner expressly stresses the importance of symmetry in the plan: A simple, clear plan in most cases requires the symmetry of the work. In a symmetrical arrangement there is some measure of self- containment, completeness, balance; an impossibility of enlargement; even self-assurance. Gravity and dignity, the constant companions of architec- ure, also demand symmetry. 25 Wright provided the first real breakthrough. Through a positive Sach- lichkeit, he developed the country-house plan as something new and directly based on life, by returning to the most elementary functions of the inhabi- ants. This was the decisive turn from formal restraint to a commitment to ife itself in the confidence that a form appropriate to a healthy and orderly life will of necessity be beautiful space newly conquered by purpose and function. This attitude, when applied to the great tasks typical of the times, could ead to a new architecture. And to an increasing extent in the first decade of the century, factory buildings and industrial problems represented just such tasks. Academic and historical styles have been abandoned and the concept of the facade has been disposed of. Yet the house is still standing. Success is achieved by returning to purpose in an architectural development that has its precise counterpart in painting of the period, which likewise disposed of academic and historical styles. Its medium is naturalism, which in the development of painting always allows a new freedom from prejudice, quite analogous to the significance that a return to function had for building. Naturalism in architecture is functional fitness (Kar!

No Longer a House but Shaped Space Industrial commissions had already produced surprising solutions in America. Walter Gropius put together an interesting selection in his essay Die Entwicklung moderner Industriebaukunst [The development of mod- ern industrial architecture} in the German Werkbund yearbook of 1913.27 The distinguishing feature of these American buildings (without exception the work of engineers, not architects) is their complete absence of compul- sive ideas about form, their quite unprejudiced design, and their spatial ealization of production and working processes. Take the grain silos for he Washbury-Crosby Company in Buffalo: a group of vertical tubes of dif- erent heights and widths, with bracing quite openly revealed no hint of adding, balancing, or refinement. Note also the contrast of angular eleva- tor sections and connecting tracks extending horizontally, an absolutely asymmetrical and irregular plant that for this reason is so convincingly a legitimate and thrilling example of functional or dynamic building. It is a building that seizes upon tensions arising from the production process, and in working with them it actively articulates space without inhibitions or sup- pressions. It is completely analogous to the approach of Wright, who has had no industrial commissions himself with the exception of the Larkin Building in Buffalo. (The film studios [sic] in Olive Hill, California, also can- not be classified as such.)

It is much more that those who built them seem to have retained a natural sense for large-scale, concise forms in a way that is indepen- dent, healthy, and pure. There is a valuable lesson in all this for us. We should once and for all cease paying attention to historical yearnings and other misgivings of an intellectual nature, which are crippling modern European artistic creativity and obstructing artistic naivet . 6 Henry Ford s remarks on the subject of factory building are very typical: One point that is absolutely essential to high capacity, as well as to humane pro- duction, is a clean, well-lighted and well-ventilated factory. Our machines are placed very close together every foot of floor space in the factory carries, of course, the same overhead charge. The consumer must pay the extra overhead and the extra transportation involved in having machines even six inches farther apart than they have to be.... This brings our machines closer together than in probably any other factory in the world. To a stranger they may seem piled right on top of one another, but they are scientifically arranged, not only in the sequence of operations but so as to give every man and every machine every square inch that he requires and, if possible, not a square inch, and certainly not a square foot, more than he requires... When we put up the older buildings, we did not understand so much about ventilation as we do today. In all the later build- ings, the supporting columns are made hollow and through them the bad air is pumped out and the good air introduced. A nearly even temperature is kept every- where the year round and, during daylight, there is nowhere the necessity for arti- ficial light.... The dark corners which invite expectoration are painted white. One cannot have morale without cleanliness, We tolerate makeshift cleanliness no more than makeshift methods (p. 113 ff.).29 Ford writes about his hospital: Because of the arrangements it is easily possible for a nurse to care for seven patients who are not desperately ill. In the ordinary hospital the nurses must make many useless steps. More of their time is spent running around than caring for the patient. This hospital is designed to save steps (p. 55).3 It will not take us too far away from the point at hand to quote the longer passage in which Ford formulates his attitude toward art: We seemingly limit the creative functions to productions that may be hung on walls, or heard in concert halls, or otherwise displayed where idle and fastidious people gather to admire each other's culture. Bui if a man wants a field for vital creative work, let him come where he is dealing with higher laws than those of sound, or line, or colour; let him come where he may deal with the laws of person- ality. We need artists who master industrial relationships. We need masters of industrial methods. We need those who can mould the shapeless mass in political, social, industrial, and moral respects into a sound and shapely whole. We have limited the creative faculty much too much and have misused it for too trivia! ends. We need men who can create the working design for all that is right and good and desirable (p. 104).3! Ford is also being entirely consistent with this when he says: We will not put up elaborate buildings as monuments to aur success. The interest on the investment and the cost of their upkeep would only serve to add uselessly to the cost of our products so these monuments of success are apt to end as tombs. A great administration buiiding may sometimes be necessary, although it arouses my suspicion that perhaps there is too much administration. We have never found a need for elaborate administration and would prefer to be advertised by our product, rather than where we make our product (p. 173).32 The first European to solve industrial tasks in the grand style was Peter Behrens (b. 1868), whom Emil Rathenau called to be artistic adviser to the AEG in 1907.33 Peter Behrens started his career as a painter in Munich, moved on to decorative and applied artwork at an early stage, and risked the leap to architecture in Darmstadt in 1901. The house in Darmstadt was followed by the Dusseldorf exhibition garden (1904), the Oldenburg exhibition pavil- ions (1905), a private house in Saarbriicken, some rooms for the Dresden Applied Arts exhibition [Kunstgewerbeausstellung] (1906), and the crema- torium in Hagen, Westphalia (1907), all works then outstanding for their stereometric simplicity and conscious return to clear, cubic proportions. It is certainly not yet possible to talk about a real creation of space; there is more reduction than production, more graphics than architecture. But there was an unmistakable hint of a modern attitude in the work, a pleasure in concise, precise, and technical form elements that make Rathenau s choice seem the happiest that could have been made at the time. \r",{"entities":[[690,700,"PER"],[2602,2606,"PER"],[4147,4160,"PER"],[4177,4190,"PER"],[4243,4256,"PER"],[4292,4298,"LOC"],[4424,4442,"ARCH"],[4463,4491,"ARCH"],[4504,4536,"ARCH"],[4547,4576,"ARCH"],[4583,4628,"ARCH"],[4630,4653,"LOC"],[4671,4684,"ARCH"],[4688,4705,"LOC"],[5111,5119,"PER"]]}],["What had been happening in German industrial architecture until then? Factories were thrown up here, as everywhere, in the rawest and cheap- est way with, in fact, insulting contempt. Not even a minimum of design consideration was wasted on them, and if occasionally a bit of Gothic trac- ery or a Renaissance gable was added, the effect was all the more artificial. Factories with dark courtyards, narrow passages, blind windows, and low, dark rooms, more like prisons than places for productive work, repellent, stifling, joyless hammer mills mirrored perfectly the ever more terrible back premises of the urban tenements in which the majority of toilers in the fac- tory had to live. No one has drawn the horrific misery of these buildings with their hordes of subtenants, lodgers, transients, and illicit stills more accurately and movingly than Heinrich Zille.44 This hopeless brutality, this contemptuous negation of all design con- sciousness was highly fitting for a period dominated by middle-class culture. Art was Raphael and Hans Makart, and what did a factory have to do with Raphael and Hans Makart?!35 Peter Behrens s early work for the AEG was on a small scale. Arc lamps, fans, electrical cooking and heating equipment were designed simply, clearly, and logically, entirely without ornament. Behrens s great gift for creating new aesthetic values with the object itself was already beginning to show, and this was probably the first time in our age that things emerged that were typical rather than individual in form. Great emphasis was placed upon precise proportions and appropriate handling of materials. These works aroused general interest, for instance, at the Berlin shipbuilding exhi- bition of 1908. They were an early attempt at a clear and pure form for our times. The AEG s most important buildings are the HuttenstraGe Turbine Factory (1909), high-voltage factory (1910), small-motor factory (1911), assembly plant (1912) all at Humboldt-Hain. Later came buildings for other indus- rial concerns, such as the administration building for the Mannesmann Factory in Dusseldorf (1911/1912), the Frankfurt Gasworks (1911/1912), the NAG [Nationale Automobil-Gesellschaft] Factory in Berlin-Obersch neweide (1920), and more recently, the administration building for the H chst Dye Factory. We should not underestimate the contribution made by Peter Behrens in recognizing the historical meaning of the task that fell to him. Early on he correctly sensed that here was a jab to do that had to be fundamental for he formation of a style for our times. From the start, Behrens had no doubts that he had to adapt his work to typical solutions. The poorly imi- tated, dissipated, ornate Baroque motifs jumbled together to suffocate, inhibit, and dislocate any life there might have been in the original architec- tural rhythms were, with a new pride, replaced by the beauty of the pure surface, of taut smoothness, of precise and concise outline, and of exact edges fitting things for an age in which the machine had started to orga- nize a fundamentally new working process. Wright was unmistakably a model for all this. Here are some striking passages from an essay by Peter Behrens for the AEG (Plakat, June 1920): In questions of form for all industrial plants it is always a matter of creating char- acter from the very nature of the things to be designed, to discover the type, just as all past art is seen today to reveal sublime greatness by being typical of the respective condition of the times. This means no less than that one must address all the artistic and technical conditions that a plant imposes, support them, indeed elevate them to a fundamental principle and let this principle become a visible expression. This applies first to the placement of the building. It has to follow the scale of the production process. The location of railroad tracks is crucial to the siting of the building. Staggering the buildings allows for the proper entry of rail tracks through the gates of the factory buildings. At the same time spacious storage yards should be provided, and this touches upon a city planning principle of great aesthetic significance. It is precisely this staggering of buildings, necessary in Practical terms, that will give the plant an effective silhouette; and the necessary layout of the yards fulfills a demand by a past master of city planning, Camillo Sitte, who described a square enclosed by buildings as one of the most necessary aspects of architectural effects. Whenever the opportunity arises to compare plants designed from such a purely practical point of view with others based on random factors or built in stages, one is astonished to see how such different impressions can be created with the same expenditure of construction and materials. But the same is also true of a factory s interior layout. The spatial arrangement grows out of the organization of the production process. Clear layout, ease of interchange and forward movement of products, and unhampered mobility of tools, machines, or trucks require open, uncluttered, well-lit halls. Workplaces should be as well lit and spacious as possible. It is therefore recommended that staircases and elevators be moved to the exterior; this will at the same time make the archi- \r",{"entities":[[1025,1032,"PER"],[1037,1048,"PER"],[1089,1096,"PER"],[1101,1112,"PER"],[1117,1130,"PER"],[1309,1316,"PER"],[1837,1865,"ARCH"],[1960,1974,"LOC"],[2055,2090,"ARCH"],[2094,2104,"LOC"],[2122,2140,"ARCH"],[2158,2195,"ARCH"],[2277,2313,"ARCH"],[2367,2380,"PER"],[3095,3101,"PER"],[3190,3203,"PER"],[4399,4412,"PER"]]}],["tectural effect more impressive, producing a long sequence of work spaces inside and on the outside rows of windows picturesquely enlivened by protruding stair- wells and elevator shafts towering above the roof. Since light is a prerequisite for good work, factory buildings should have large window openings; they should dominate, control the surface of the building, and lend support in their effect as windows. For this reason they should not seem like large holes in the wall but appear flush with the outer wall, giving the exterior a friendly appearance .3 At this point | should like to draw attention to an important essay by H. Lulwes, Was mu beim Entwurf neuer Werke beachtet werden? [What has to be considered in the design of new works?] (Hawa-Nachrichten, January 1922),3 If we compare Peter Behrens s achievements with American examples, the crucial difference is that Behrens is still intent on stylization, on artistic interpretation through form, whereas the Americans present the object com- pletely bare. There is no doubt that Behrens was extraordinarily refreshed, broadened, and strengthened in his forms by an unprejudiced accommeda- tion to the living process of industry, but in the end his behavior was not altogether without prejudice. He abandoned a number of conventions, gave up a great deal of rigidity and tradition, but he did not unquestioningly devote himself to the purpose, to function. Many concepts persisted for him, even the concept of a house. And it is just this clinging to this notion of a house that compels him to stylize. For how could the small-motor factory on VoltastraBe express itself as such and Peter Behrens cared for expres- sion other than by applied forms (in this case strongly stressed piers) if the basic layout of the plan is not fully and unconditionally committed to the thing, and then of course it is no longer a house. A duality still remains in the case of Behrens: a good fulfillment of pur- pose and its integration into a normal body wall, roof, window, etc. But because he wanted to destroy the normal house for the sake of a greater and more powerful concept, Peter Behrens s pathos was born, which unfor- tunately found many imitators. For example, Stoffregen s Delmenhorst Factory showed an inclination toward the vertical, perhaps still under the influence of Messel.#8 It is now very interesting to see that the earliest of Behrens s AEG build. ings makes the greatest and freest break with the conventional house type, and that his last industrial buildings (Obersch neweide) are classical. There seems to be a certain analogy with Messel's development. With the Turbine Hall in HuttenstraBe there suddenly emerged an indus- trial building that was a new type, a new life: no longer a house, no longer a shed, no longer convention, and no longer a cross between various his- torical types. For the first time in this country, industry built a workspace solely according to work requirements, not as a trivial stopgap but with self- confident strength, using the new materials iron, concrete, and glass. The new feature of this building was the stronger unification of a more massive body. The body built here to house the working process was an indivisible, unbroken whole: from socle to ridgeline its mass is informed with a will and a life; it stands like an improbable giant amid the childishly stuccoed tene- ment facades of the area. Decoration, ornament, and form were swep away. The building was itself form, it needed no forms. The shaping force was directed away from an obsolete concern with facade ballast and toward the body, toward fulfilling purpose, and toward exploiting the new materi- als. They had of course been used before (Perret), but with a few exceptions their style-forming possibilities had never been recognized. In contrast to this, in the Frankfurt Gasworks we find once again the method of delimiting and dividing, and the reduction of the design to a few abstract forms ( sphere, cone, and cylinder ). In the NAG buildings in Obersch neweide we definitely find the emphasis on classical form, the neutralization of function and purpose behind impenetrable calm, here con- sistently also forgoing any expression. The house reasserts itself. We could establish a parallel between the Turbine Hall and the Wertheim Building with the following observation: the Turbine Hall, more than any other building by Behrens, is devoted to function. This makes it the most unusual, revolutionary, and influential of his buildings and at the same time, very analogous to the Wertheim Building, the one most isolated and alien in its surroundings, so that the juxtaposition of tenement buildings and the Turbine Hall borders on the grotesque. Just as the desired typology led the Wertheim Building toward the ecclesiastical, the Turbine Hall was driven toward the heroic. The hail arose in the style of a Cyclopean force, for which there was no basis. The assembly hail in Humboidt-Hain was essen- tially more sober, more sachlich, thus more honest and also more consistent, making better use of the materials. Allin all, Peter Behrens still builds factories. The same is true of Hans Poelzig, whose chemical plant for Milch & Co. in Lubin near Posen is proba- bly the best and most sachiich of all built factories. Unfortunately the excellent Werder Mill design has not been executed.

He (the artist) thinks of nothing but the chance that he may plant this piece of land with the constructs of his imagination to the extent they are at his disposal and only then does he try to whittle down his constructs to the level on which present-day life moves.39 Purpose? What a dreadful epithet for a work of art. Result? The Salzburg Festspielhaus! Elsewhere Poelzig says: Art begins only where one is building for the good Lord (Neubau, 10 January 1924). For the good Lord in other words, for no one! The Fagus factory in Alfeld an der Leine, built in phases by Walter Gropius (b. 1883) beginning in 1913 [1911], may be considered, along with his build- ings for the Cologne Werkbund exhibition (1914), to be the first factory that was no longer built but constructed from iron, concrete, and glass. The following sentence from the essay mentioned above may serve to character- ize Gropius s approach: A clear internal pian that also from the outside clearly expresses the layout simpli- fies the production process considerably. But it is by no means socially immaterial whether the modern factory worker does his work in a dreary, ugly, industrial barracks or in well-proportioned rooms. He will work with much greater pleasure on large collective projects if his workplace, designed by an artist, complies with the sense of beauty innate in all of us, one that has an enlivening effect on the monotony of mechanical work. Thus the increasing contentment will increase the working spirit and the business performance.* (Sept arts, 15 February 1923 [Brussels], demands that the noise and racket of a large factory should also not be allowed to rage unchecked: Doubtiess, one will never arrive at some sweet harmony, but it is necessary to strive for a rational organization of all sonorous brutality. )# It is clear from the Alfeld factory how much Gropius's study of American utilitarian buildings had a liberating effect and just as clear that Gropius nevertheless subjects American directness to a certain aesthetic filtering. There is a sense of distant refinement, even caution, that detracts from the unconditional inner unity of the first phase of this important building. The way in which all false pathos is coolly avoided is very admirable, but a certain aesthetic urge deprives the work as a whole of its ultimate simplic ity. This simplicity could almost be called complicated. It vacillates between object and form, between America and Osterndorf. But there is no doubt that it is still the most modern, the most exemplary German factory of the prewar period, not perhaps as compelling or as direct as Poelzig's plant in Lubin but unquestionably bolder. Gropius s view coincides with Jean Cocteau s, for instance, who writes in Le cog et l'arlequin: American machines and buildings resemble Greek art in the sense that utility confers on them a spareness and a grandeur stripped of the superfluous. But this is not art. The role of art consists in grasping the sense of the time and drawing upon the spectacle of this applied spareness to create an antidote to the beauty of the useless that encourages the superfluous. 42 Fritz [Friedrich] Kaidenbach s Seeck [Sack] Factory in Dresden also deserves an honorable mention.%3 Apart from a relatively unimportant factory for Vorster & Co. in Hagen, West- phalia, Henry van de Velde (b. 1863) has produced no industrial buildings. And yet his work is important for the further development of functional archi- tecture because of its consistent emphasis on functional form. By including the element of movement in architecture, van de Velde gave the younger European generation courage to devote itself with real frankness and with- out classical prejudice to the force of technical and economic functions. We have already talked about the element of movement in the case of Wright. For van de Velde it Is an essentially different matter. The difference is between a sober, sachlich American and a romantic European; for there is a romantic in van de Velde as well as a rationalist. Wright's movement is a more consistent and conscious conception of space (in plan) and a tighter relationship of tension between the parts of \r",{"entities":[[71,79,"LOC"],[103,126,"ARCH"],[1059,1081,"ARCH"],[1240,1253,"ARCH"],[1297,1311,"PER"],[1617,1624,"PER"],[2286,2294,"LOC"],[2682,2689,"PER"],[3351,3366,"ARCH"],[3370,3375,"LOC"],[3403,3410,"PER"],[3433,3445,"PER"],[3872,3889,"PER"],[3890,3900,"PER"],[3903,3923,"ARCH"],[3927,3934,"LOC"],[4009,4034,"ARCH"],[4038,4043,"LOC"],[4045,4057,"LOC"],[4059,4077,"PER"],[4322,4334,"PER"],[4569,4576,"PER"],[4738,4750,"PER"]]}],["he building (in elevation). The building parts themselves are absolutely expressionless ; they are immobile, technically determined, standardized, ready-made pieces. Movement works as a mechanical force from the out- side. A human will, with the machine s help, has constructed the building rom prefabricated parts, with all its angles and corners. Van de Velde takes movement in a more titeral sense, as a force plasti- cally organizing the building from the inside. He arrives at curves and lourishes, at forms that could be true once only, i.e., they are valid in only one context. He arrives at expressive forms that speak. Human will, which is seen as limited, does not determine and fix the work, but the will of Sachlichkeiten, of purposes, of materials is itself translated into reality: hus the human being is more the mediator. Van de Velde injects an empa- hy into the function, and from there he arrives at a formal expression of movement that Wright definitely avoids. Van de Velde s conception paral- els the Expressionist Movement, making its appearance somewhat later in painting. Function movement expression as well symbolism romanticism individualism and finally anthropomorphism are logically very closely related, that is, van de Velde's influence was important and valuable but not completely harmless. It also contained a danger. n Wright s conception the house type could continue to exist despite all innovations and improvements. Unequivocalness, clarity, and the assur- ance of edges delimited a space that the human will had conquered and arranged, n van de Velde s conception these limits are easily blurred. The freely given forces of strong curves and flourishes could very well destroy the box and replace it with a free organism of a completely different nature a small example: the Osthaus desk. Van de Velde s houses (for Esche and Korner in Chemnitz; Hohenhof and Springmann in Hagen, Westphalia; Diurckheim and Henneberg in Weimar; and Schulenberg in Gera) do not show dissolution of the conven- tional house concept and they therefore do not show any dissolution (the one that comes closest is the house for Dr. Leuring, a physician in Scheveningen). The reason for this is that van de Veide is both a romantic and a constructor. As such, he only abandons the house type where there is a sachlich imperative, as in the Weimar Kunstschule or the Werk- bund Theater in Cologne, which unfortunately has been pulled down for no obvious reason. These last two buildings show how valuable van de Velde s view of move- ment can be regarding the renewal of the building mass despite the many echoes of the Jugendstil still resounding here. Of course if we want to see the ultimate consequence of a functionalism colored with a romantic and pantheistic tinge, then the best place to look is among Hermann Finsterlin s designs, the most radical dissolution of the house concept imaginable, approaching the forms of organic, growing nature. The formal type that is the last greatest genial invention of the terrestrial spirit organic form lies between the crystalline and the amorphous. My architecture also sprouts at this transition point. Inside the new house one will not only feel as though one is the occupant of a fabulous crystal druse, but like the internal resi- dent of an organism, wandering from organ to organ, a symbiont of giving and receiving within a fossil of a gigantic mother s body. A small fragment of the trans- posed set of boxes of world forms is to be found in the sequence of town, house, furniture, and vessel; growing out of one another like the gonads of an organism, these hollow creatures need no longer be displaced foreign bodies as they have been hitherto. Tell me, are you never irritated by the brutal scheme of your six walls and the injected material coffin of your thousand necessities? Has the mys- terious urge never crept over you to rearrange yourselves in accordance with the rhythm of your breathing souls? (Fruhilicht, no. 2, p. 36). Finsterlin, who refers to his designs as glacier crevice systems for the | [Seelengletschermuhlensysteme], is an unabashed romantic. Van de Velde is not just a romantic but a rationalist at the same time, Neither van de Velde the romantic nor Finsterlin are backward-looking in their views and the rationalist is emphatically a man of our times. Nothing is ugly in the world of technical inventions, machines, and Sou the thousand everyday objects that serve purposes just as important as architecture and the applied arts. Yes, their forms so shaken by truth and boldness have elicited the greatest admiration from all those who were passionately waiting for a new beauty, the beauty of the future (Die drei Suinden wider die Schdnheit [The three sins against beauty], p. 41).45 The thing that seems most to bother people who oppose these principles is the fact that they are just principles, that they moreover require an intellectual effort to which people are no longer accustomed....

It is a rule that, after everything is examined and checked off, one only includes those things (no matter what field) that still seem reasonable, powerful, and capable of being followed up by things that are even more reasonable and powerful (Innen-Dekoration, November 1902),% The bridge between van de Velde the romantic and van de Velde the rationalist is construction. !n summing up his comments on the shape of his column in the Folkwang-Museum vestibule, van de Velde says: Its form shows its soul or, to put it more precisely, its bones (Innen-Dekoration, October-November 1902).* In searching for expressive form he found those forms arising from construction to be the most expressive; or rather, reason leads him to can- struction and feeling interprets construction. Another passage characteristic of van de Velde is his commentary on the Folkwang-Museum: ( searched a long time for a solution to the banister, which was made significantly more difficult by the design of the steps.

Van de Velde even sees machines in formal and aesthetic terms, for he bitterly rejects their consequences. Whereas Peter Behrens somewhat coolly defines machines as pseudo-aesthetic structures, van de Velde is the first representative of a romantic machine cult that has found many followers. Machine: that means standardization, typification, collectivism but van de Velde is a passionate individualist! At the Cologne Werkbund conference (1914) he led the artists group against Muthesius s proposals for types. He declared: The artist is in his innermost essence a fervent individualist; he will never of his own free will submit to a discipline that imposes a type upon him. The essay Devant l architecture indicates a change. It is imbued with a profound understanding of the collective architectural task of our times and a fine confidence in the work of the younger generation in all countries (Europe, 15 July 1924).5 Van de Velde was less prone to notions of historical-monumental form than Behrens. He was drawn more to the idea of movement in every living thing and thus developed form determined by function, a dynamic form that he himself was fond of describing as dramatic, that is, a less histori- cal form, an emergent form, with its character rooted in engineering and construction. It is revealing to compare a utensil by van de Velde with Peter Behrens s AEG lamps, for instance. Van de Velde tries to find the unifying thrust of movement through empathy and the fulfillment of the functions of standing, rising, gripping, carrying, etc. He frequently says of his forms: | reveal their innermost nature, their soul. Peter Behrens, closer to Wright, contrasts simple stereometric forms, There temperament, here distance. Van de Velde s marked influence on the younger generation of European architects is seen very clearly in Erich Mendelsofn s (b. 1887) Einstein Tower near Potsdam (1920/21). A certain hint of Olbrich (early Darmstadt exhibition buildings) can be traced in Mendelsohn. Early sketches for the Einstein Tower (the title page of the Wendingen issue [of 1919], for instance) show how very close Finsterlin was to him at the time as well. Compare, for example, Finsterlin's works on pages eleven or fourteen in this Wendingen issue to the drawing by Mendelsohn cited above. Finsterlin's decorative self- sufficiency is certainly transformed into an engineer-like energy and tension by Mendeisohn. Incidentally, it is very characteristic that the journal of the Amsterdam Movement in Holland, which inclines to romanticism (De Klerk d. 1923], van der Meij, Kropholler, Wijdeveld, etc.), should devote special issues to these two Germans: Mendelsohn and Finsterlin. ! The desire for exaggerated characterization and expressive individuality brought Mendelsohn, with his Einstein Tower and also less markedly his Mosse Building (Berlin, 1921-1923), to an architecture that worked a great deal with movement and anthropomorphism, that really can be called dra- matic in van de Velde s sense, and that must definitely be placed within he Expressionist Movement.
