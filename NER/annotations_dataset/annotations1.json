Now that modern architecture is familiar and we ve seen how it became both celebrated and vilified it s hard to imagine how novel it once seemed. Expensive Western buildings became transformed from ornamented fancies, which referred to the classical and medieval pasts, into strikingly plain reflections of novel materials, technologies, and ideas. It s equally hard to remember how modem architecture promised transformation, seemingly poised to turn dirty, overcrowded cities characterized by packed slums and Satanic mills into spacious realms of generous housing and clean mechanized production, set in parkland. At certain times and in certain cultures, modern architecture stood for the liberation of the future from the past. The phrase modern architecture describes a spectrum of buildings and ideas. From Shakespeare s times until the 19th century, modern in English meant up to date . The idea of progress became important in the 19th century and that made the modern progressive : part of an apparently predestined course from an impoverished past, to a still inadequate present, towards an idealized future. More recently however, the term modern largely came to describe a specific time in the 20th century when many people, especially in the West, seemed persuaded that a better future was on its way. \r",{"entities":[[892,903,"PER"]]}],["For some historians, modern architecture refers primarily to stark white buildings from the 1920s and 1930s: crisp, hovering edifices which, so the story goes, reflected honestly their internal functions on the outside, illustrating how they were put together, highlighting the shock of the new . For others, the idea of a modern architectural future had a longer history. It dated back to the Paris World s Fair of 1889, or John Ruskin s 1849 exhortations about how medieval Gothic cathedrals expressed structure honestly in stone. Just as it s possible to argue about the beginnings of modern architecture, its demise has been much debated. For various commentators, modern architecture is over. It was supplanted by postmodernism in the 1980s and 1990s, when architects became less interested in the expression of function, and returned to historical motifs (like the 1991 extension to London s National Gallery, designed by Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates), or striking shape-making of various kinds (like the sinuous Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, 1997, designed by Frank O. Gehry s studio). For others, modern architecture as the expression of contemporary building technologies, as the idea of making construction legible and transparent remains current, no matter that other disciplines insist on the demise of modernity in their fields. I ll take a long and broad view of modern architecture here, examining what Harold Rosenberg called the tradition of the new , arguing that it didn t just emerge fully formed in the 1910s and 1920s, or as the consequence of 19th-century pioneers, but was instead the product of two centuries of industrialization, and the global spread of industrial culture. I set out neither to promote nor condemn modern architecture. Rather, my aim is to illustrate how it was produced out of and reflected the cultures that constructed it. I explore it in all its strangeness and thoughtfulness, as designed by some curious, obsessive characters. The organization of this book Certain famous modern architects were skilled self-publicists. Memorable aphorisms, like Ludwig Mies van der Rohe s less is more , and Le \r",{"entities":[[425,436,"PER"],[889,914,"LOC"],[928,935,"PER"],[937,948,"PER"],[1026,1043,"LOC"],[1045,1051,"LOC"],[1071,1085,"LOC"],[1422,1438,"PER"],[2100,2124,"PER"]]}],["Corbusier s the house is a machine for living , entered the lexicons of popular quotation. Less widely known, but chortled-at by generations of architecture students, is Louis Kahn s 1971 conversation with a brick: If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, What do you want, Brick? And Brick says to you I like an Arch . And if you say to Brick Look, arches are expensive and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that Brick? Brick says I like an Arch . This image of architect in communion with brick illustrates a point which preoccupied modern architects: that different building materials imply their own inherent logics. How particular materials go together, Kahn suggested, make certain combinations of structure, wall, and building assembly seem inevitable: brick wants to make arches; timber wants to make lattices of beams and posts; steel wants to make frames; reinforced concrete wants to make frames too, and also thin planes and big spans. You can persuade those materials to behave otherwise, but why Kahn implied as a thoughtful modern architect, would you do that? This was not new. In 1863, Parisian architect Eug ne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc wrote that any change of material must bring about a change of forms . The contemporaneous German writer Gottfried Semper argued that brick, wood, and iron should be treated according to their statical laws . Both responded to Ruskin s ideas about honesty to materials and the honest visual expression of the uses of a building. Their earnest morality persisted into modern architecture. And the idea that materials have their own inherent logics explains how I ve organized this book. Historians often gave architects more credit than they deserved for shaping modern architecture. Moder architects imaginations were hugely extended by material innovations. Developments in steel and reinforced concrete radically altered possibilities for shaping buildings, as did new systems for electric lighting and handling air. These technical innovations, in turn, emerged from new cultures of industrial production. Thus, my story is organized around the technical innovations that opened up the cultural and intellectual opportunities for modern architecture to happen. This isn t to say that architects were involved in the invention of new technologies most weren t, and many disapproved at first but, as Adrian \r",{"entities":[[0,9,"PER"],[170,180,"PER"],[231,236,"PER"],[249,254,"PER"],[274,279,"PER"],[285,290,"PER"],[338,343,"PER"],[439,444,"PER"],[446,451,"PER"],[684,688,"PER"],[1035,1039,"PER"],[1147,1177,"PER"],[1283,1299,"PER"],[1405,1411,"PER"],[2379,2385,"PER"]]}],["Forty has argued, architects special ability was to conjure up images for new technologies that made them seem striking and appealing. Architects didn t create steel and reinforced concrete, or fluorescent tubes and air conditioning, but they appreciated how those technologies could make the world look and feel different. And they designed knowingly in relation to imagery from other spheres, like modern art and industrial design. The British modern architect Wells Coates wrote in 1931 that there was a choice between the use of the new ... materials as prisoners the slaves of old habits, old social prejudices, old visual prejudices; or as the means to new forms, new habits of life, a new vision . My story thus explores the architectural consequences of iron and steel, reinforced concrete, brick, air conditioning, and electric light to illustrate how modern architecture produced powerful cultural images expressing the potential of the future. These new technologies were not adopted by architects in a linear sequence but, to some extent, in parallel. So, each chapter here while organized broadly in chronological order shifts back in time to begin before the previous one ends. Some definitions I define modernity here as the condition of living in an industrialized society. Industrialized societies are those shaped by modern science and consumer technologies: by mass production, mass markets, mass consumption, mass education, and mass media; by novelty and fashion; and by accelerating globalization fuelled by the power of global finance. Underpinning industrialized societies was an idea that perpetual scientific progress operated hand in hand with economic growth, and also sometimes amulti-party democracy. Alongside industry, work, and changing patterns of domestic life, the category of modernity encompassed ideas from art, literature, film, theatre, media, music, philosophy, and architecture: cultural endeavours reflecting modern societies, and shaping them through the reflections they offered. Modern technology, and the cultures it produced, seemed poised to liberate people from rigid constraints traditionally imposed by their gender, class, or ethnicity. But the same progress could also seem alienating disrupting traditional communities and ways of life. Modernity thus mixed optimism about the social \r",{"entities":[[0,5,"PER"],[463,475,"PER"]]}],["opportunities of technology with deep unease about its consequences. The peak of modernity occurred between the late 19th and mid-20th centuries in the West. Indeed, modernity extended beyond the West in different places at different times, sometimes associated with colonization in the 19th and 20th centuries, and sometimes with postcolonial societies. More recently, faith in perpetual progress was shaken. Science and technology appeared fallible. Power structures linking the funding of science and political parties with industry, finance, and military endeavours became more apparent. The operation of these power structures in service of people of a particular class, ethnicity, and gender, from particular comers of the globe, was highlighted. And the vast consumption of energy and disposable goods was questioned in terms of sustainability. For these reasons, it s widely assumed that modernity as an idea about progress ended during the latter part of the 20th century, or at least became much more complicated. The term postmodern was coined to describe what followed. I define modern architecture here as architecture produced out of the condition of modernity. In particular, it s architecture that contributed to modernity, because the images of its buildings seemed to express what modernity stood for. Modern architecture s champions referred to the modern movement , associating it with radical movements in art. The term also implied connections with radical political movements that its characters occasionally hooked up with, in Russia and Italy in the 1910s, and Germany and France in the 1920s. Only when tidied up by sympathetic historians in retrospect, however, did it look like a coherent movement. There were always multiple modern architectures and the term meant different things to different people at different times. In his 1896 book Modern Architecture, architect Otto Wagner associated the idea with the rational and honest expression of materials, structure, and function, and with the purging of unnecessary decoration themes familiar as late as the 1970s. In the 1910s, however, quite different architectures of Art Nouveau , characterized by swirling floral motifs, would also have been called modern, alongside the \r",{"entities":[[1551,1557,"PER"],[1562,1567,"PER"],[1586,1593,"PER"],[1598,1604,"PER"],[1899,1910,"PER"]]}],[" expressionist crystalline shapes of Bruno Taut s Crystal Chain group. By the late 1930s, however, these counted as modern less frequently. At that time, modern architecture became more tightly defined around buildings evoking glamorous technologies of the age: cars, ocean liners, and aeroplanes. This was the so-called International Style, matching white planes with flat roofs, open plans, extensive glazing, horizontal windows, and blocks you could see below or through. By the late 1950s, multiple modern architectures proliferated again, reconsidering what then became seen as the early modern architecture of the 1930s. Certain architects at that time hoped to make modern architecture more humane, dramatic, monumental, or systematically scientific. Despite these differences, the idea of a single modern movement persisted. It sounded glamorous and sold textbooks. Modern architecture was also defined by how architects designed it. There are three primary kinds of scaled architectural drawing: the elevation, depicting a facade; the section, a vertical cut from roof to foundations showing floors stacked up; and the plan, a horizontal cut showing the layout of rooms on a floor. Where architects previously agonized over elevations, often adapting plans and sections around decisions made about the facades, modern architects prioritized the plan. They claimed that the layout of rooms the best functional arrangement for a house, library, or office should come first, and that elevations should be secondary. The most famous modern architect, Le Corbusier, wrote that the plan is the generator . Louis Sullivan s catchy aphorism form ever follows function was a slogan for this way of working. In the writings of Adolf Loos, it became elevated to a moral imperative. By the 1930s, most modern architects believed there was something truthful about designs prioritizing function, and something dishonest about designs emphasizing a building s artistic decoration. Despite the rhetoric, however, modem architects remained deeply concerned with the imagery of their buildings. Indeed, numerous modern buildings can be understood as architectural images dedicated to undermining the idea of architectural imagery. From the 1930s, modern architecture increasingly became called Modernism , making it sound like a cause. The term allowed historians to characterize modern architecture as a style like other architectural styles \r",{"entities":[[37,47,"PER"],[1556,1568,"PER"]]}],["(Neo-Classicism or Gothic Revivalism, for example). It also helped them link it to other modernisms in art and literature that similarly responded to technological cultures, industrialization, and globalization. This appealed to critics who made reputations out of classifying trends. But many modern architects thought they were isolating honest, timeless ways to design not indulging in something as fleeting as a style and vigorously rejected the idea. Modernism appears with and without a capital m . Some advocates of modern architecture used the capital letter to sort out buildings they felt were special symbols of the movement from buildings that were merely new. Others used it to elevate Modernism to the status of other nouns capitalized in English, like Church or God. You won t see Modern or Modernism written with a capital m again here. And I'll use modernism sparingly. I don t want to make modern architecture seem more important than other architectures. Nor do I find obsessing about which famous buildings fit into which stylistic categories particularly fruitful. When studying architecture, it seems more interesting to think instead about buildings themselves: how they work, what they do, and what they say. Having reflected on the modern in modern architecture , it s worth pausing on architecture . Nikolaus Pevsner, the prominent modern historian, famously made a distinction between architecture and building: A bicycle shed is a building , he wrote, whereas Lincoln Cathedral is a work of architecture . Distinctions like this are widespread but obstructive. All buildings bicycle shed or cathedral, banal office building or obsessively detailed museum offer insights into the values of the people and cultures which produced them, illustrating the ideas informing their design, construction, and use. All are valid objects of scholarly attention. I ve included (big) sheds and bridges in this book, alongside churches and high-rise towers, because they all yielded important architectural images of modernity. If anything distinguishes the buildings I ve included here from others, it s that they became famous because they proved inspiring or troubling enough for people to have projected ideas about modernity onto them. \r",{"entities":[[1488,1505,"ARCH"]]}],["Most histories of modern architecture bring the story up to date. But, because I contend that modernity transformed into something else, my story closes in the 1970s, accepting that architecture transformed with it. This end point coincides with a time when building regulations introduced in the West made the idea of truth to materials harder to achieve at the level of architectural detail. While ideas from modern architecture remain doggedly persistent, and numerous architects still practice as paid-up modernists, ours is now the architecture of another time which will attract its own histories in due course. Histories of the future Modern architecture owed as much to its storytellers as its buildings. Le Corbusier s 1923 book Towards a New Architecture which became admired in the Anglosphere in the 1930s tried to establish moral and visual principles for modern architecture. Meanwhile, certain historians rewrote architectural history to make modernism its logical consequence, including Hitchcock and Johnson, whose 1932 term International Style I ve already mentioned, and Pevsner, whose Pioneers of Modern Design, 1936, sought to persuade sceptics inclined towards the past that modern architecture actually emerged from a long history. Sigfried Giedion illustrated in 1941 how architecture could be understood in terms of time and space. And in the 1960s, (Peter) Reyner Banham historian of the immediate future extended the category of architecture to include all sorts of industrial structures, technologies, and gadgets. Robert Venturi s Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture, 1966, reminded readers that history always infused modern architecture, and anticipated the postmodernism that followed. It s a curious quirk that modern architecture whose most extreme forms rejected the past was so extensively consolidated by its historians. Architectural histories have strange conventions. Buildings are usually designed in studios full of architects and technicians, with clients, builders, engineers, and regulations that help to shape them. Nevertheless, historians mostly attribute famous buildings to a single architect usually male, white, and Western, like most of the historians themselves even if that individual hardly spent any time on the project.

Another convention as old as the book The Lives of the Artists by architect Giorgio Vasari, 1550 depicts famous architects as visionary geniuses working against the odds. This idea persists, and certain modern architects became elevated into superheroes who could do no wrong. I'll highlight one such anointed superhero in each chapter, recalling the celebrity worship that still pervades architectural culture. Few architectural history books stray from sites of financial and cultural power. Most discuss buildings that were novel when they were constructed becoming models for others that followed, built in places with the wealth necessary to make them, the cultural sensibilities that prized their novelty, and celebrated by local critics influential enough to get them widely noticed. Architectural historians now worry about this, about repeatedly retelling dominant but partisan stories. To compensate, they ve worked to make their histories more diverse and inclusive, to illustrate who has the power to build what, when, where, how, and for whom, A very short book like this inevitably has to omit far more than it includes, so I ve focused here on a small selection of buildings that also account for bigger cultural ideas. I emphasize what modern architecture was like, why it was like that, and how it was imagined, more than the global patterns of where and when. This approach helps me to argue that buildings themselves should be the primary source of architectural research: that every building cathedral or bicycle shed, glamorous gallery or your own home contains architectural, cultural, technical, and historical knowledge. It also emphasizes the buildings that you need to know to talk knowledgably with others who think they already know about modern architecture. Its consequence, however, is to reinforce the Euro-American mainstream, omitting buildings and characters from other contexts. I ve tried to mitigate this by including some less familiar projects and introducing some familiar examples in less familiar ways. Ultimately though, I hope this book will encourage you to read further, to go beyond buildings designed largely by white Western men in the most powerful countries in the world to explore less-charted but equally important moder architectures. \r",{"entities":[[161,175,"PER"]]}],["Chapter 2 Iron and steel A bridge to modernity My story about modern architecture begins with an iron bridge completed in 1779 (Figure 1).

The bridge was made from five arched cast-iron ribs, spreading their load to two masonry abutments, assembled without using nuts and bolts. The bridge became so famous, because its construction was so novel, that the town forming around it took its name.

The Iron Bridge was proposed by an architect, Thomas Pritchard and it bears his ornamental flourishes but it was executed under the direction of \r",{"entities":[[16,26,"ARCH"],[28,42,"LOC"],[316,329,"PER"],[663,686,"LOC"],[757,768,"ARCH"],[799,815,"PER"]]}],["a fabricator, Abraham Darby III. The Darby family s Coalbrookdale foundry was then a world leader in iron production. The first Abraham Darby had worked out how to use coked coal, rather than charcoal made from timber, to raise temperatures in the blast furnaces where iron was made. This yielded consistently higher quality iron at lower cost, made in large furnaces that could run continuously. Coalbrookdale s innovations in the volume production of iron, and growing experience in fabricating iron components, contributed not just to the bridge but to the whole Industrial Revolution. The Iron Bridge introduces four themes that recur throughout this book. First, it indicates the beginnings of a shift in global culture, over two centuries, from artisan manufacturing towards mass production. While the components of the bridge were sourced nearby using local ironstone, clay, sand, limestone, coal, and water it was assembled from a limited number of repeated components. This anticipated a huge cultural shift. New technologies enabled cheaper and quicker manufacturing, opening up industrial production in fields like textiles and furniture that were previously the province of artisans. This new industrial culture usually separated design from making. Where seamstresses or joiners, for example, made design decisions with their tools in hand, based on their experience of working materials, designers began to emerge in various fields who imagined artefacts and drew them for others to make. In consequence, makers skills became increasingly channelled into the accurate reproduction of given designs. While the figure of the architect emerged well before mass production out of ancient origins rediscovered in the 15th century the modern idea of the professional who draws buildings got shaped in association with this emerging idea of design. The modern notion of construction as an industry emerged with it, gradually replacing old priorities of art and craft in building with new ideas about efficiency and predictability. Second, the Iron Bridge illustrates the emergence of the idea of a single global culture. Early mass production, like that in the Severn gorge, quickly exceeded the stock of local raw materials. The hunger of new factories, from blast foundries to textile mills, and the hunger of their owners for profit, meant that materials and workers were sought elsewhere as local \r",{"entities":[[14,27,"PER"],[128,141,"PER"],[397,410,"PER"],[593,604,"ARCH"]]}],["supplies dwindled. Associated ideas about raw materials being commodities, and individual workers combining into a collective called labour, started to form the modern habit of imagining the world in terms of resources to be exploited. The more the machines produced, and the greater the demand for their cheaper products, the wider the distribution of those products. Transport infrastructures were constructed to bring in material and labour resources, and to ship out manufactured ones. For example, in a short time at the end of the 18th century, the River Severn flowing through Ironbridge became linked to other rivers via a canal network connecting British cities, joined with ports linked to global shipping. By the middle of the 19th century, these canals were supplanted by railways that could move more goods and people at higher speeds. In the later 20th century, railways themselves became overtaken by motorways, air transport, and containerization. Thus, the transport infrastructures made necessary by industry expanded and accelerated during the modern period. They produced in their wake a global culture where industry flourished, and where global consumption and mass travel seemed to shrink distances and cultural differences. This alliance of trade, industry, and shipping fuelled Western countries colonization of parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas during the 18th and 19th centuries. For example, in northeast England, on the River Tyne rather than the Severn, Lord Armstrong s Elswick Works produced munitions, ships, and hydraulic construction equipment. These were sold without scruple to armies, militia, governments, and corporations including famously both sides of the same conflict. Fuelled by technocratic enterprises like Armstrong s, colonialism opened up what became imagined as the material and human resources of conquered lands to the new industries. It brought enormous wealth to European and North American captains of industry, and often significant suffering to the places and peoples plundered. The novel goods and values exported by new industries celebrated global commerce, market forces, and the idea of industry as progress which then seemed to become their inevitable consequence. \r",{"entities":[[555,567,"LOC"],[1346,1352,"LOC"],[1354,1358,"LOC"],[1368,1376,"LOC"],[1429,1446,"LOC"],[1455,1465,"LOC"],[1490,1504,"LOC"],[1507,1520,"LOC"]]}],["Just as the idea of a single global culture is latent in the reproduced components of the Iron Bridge, so too are modern ideas of economy and technology. Taken together, these constitute the third theme I argue that the bridge illustrates. New industries like Coalbrookdale Foundry produced massive social and cultural change in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The population of England s West Midlands, like much of Western Europe and later the USA, shifted largely from rural agricultural work to urban industrial work. Growing urban populations sustained industrial production and encouraged the consumption of its outputs. The massive changes that successive generations observed the emergence of labour-saving devices, for example, from the mangle to the fridge; or wonder drugs from anaesthetics to antibiotics became inextricably linked in people s minds with the idea of technology. And this association of technology with progress, popularized through novel innovations, became inseparable from modernity. The reach of manufacturing industries and transport infrastructures increasingly extended into almost every facet of everyday life. And the global economy on which the modem idea of progress relied became increasingly pervasive. The word economy once referred to the frugal management of a household, to an ancient villa and its land, sustaining a society of people living and working there, standing for the idea that just enough was sufficient. But the substantial costs of industrial production, and the extravagant profits to be made from it, made loan finance once condemned as the evil of usury more culturally acceptable. The financiers made the biggest profits of all. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, colonialism and transport globalized finance at least as much as they globalized the new industries. The Iron Bridge also introduces a fourth idea, about architectural imageability . Whether or not it was the first iron bridge in the world that s been debated it was the first whose image became widely distributed. At the time, its spindly see-through structure looked remarkable to eyes accustomed to brick or stone. How could something so apparently fragile be evidently so strong? The structure drew artists intrigued to depict it. An exhibition celebrating the bridge s bicentenary in 1979, held at London s Royal Academy, collected over fifty images made between 1750 \r",{"entities":[[90,101,"ARCH"],[382,405,"LOC"],[420,434,"LOC"],[449,452,"LOC"],[1843,1854,"ARCH"],[2342,2364,"LOC"]]}],["and 1830. Pictures of the bridge, sat in its picturesque gorge, symbolized the wonder of technology. And new media technologies like engraving and printing allowed the widespread distribution of its imagery, lending it global significance. Like many famous works of modern architecture, images of the Iron Bridge seemed to surpass the structure s own physical presence. Its depiction, in paintings and engravings, acquired a currency beyond the original, admired by a much bigger audience than had seen the bridge first hand, making it a striking symbol of the idea of the new. The Iron Bridge also illustrates imageability in another way. Made in iron, assembled from multiple components, it s constructed in the same form as a masonry arch. Effectively, it took what was then the known image of a bridge the arch and reproduced it in a new material. Arches suit how brick and stone behave in compression (when loaded with weight from above), distributing loads evenly from central keystones to the ground. Iron, meanwhile, has different properties. Made into chain links and cables, it performs better in tension (where forces tend to pull it apart). This was exploited in 1801 in the inventor James Finlay s design for Jacob s Creek Bridge in Westmorland County, Pennsylvania, suspending a deck from iron trusses and establishing the basic components of the modern suspension bridge. Later structures, like engineer Thomas Telford s Menai Bridge in North Wales, 1820, and Isambard Kingdom Brunel s Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, UK, 1834, consolidated a new logic for iron construction and a new image for iron bridges derived more directly from the logic of the material. While Ironbridge s Iron Bridge was innovative, it was nevertheless constrained in its designers imaginations by their prevailing idea of what a bridge ought to look like. This raises an important point that there remain deeply embedded cultural assumptions about the imagery of certain types of buildings and structures. Children learn culturally coded images so they can distinguish a living room from a street, for example, or a house from an office, and people think they know what buildings look like after that. But these codes become so powerful that designers take time to challenge them. More significantly, they become so powerful that people find it hard to accept new architectural images when familiar ones are challenged. \r",{"entities":[[582,593,"ARCH"],[1196,1208,"PER"],[1222,1242,"ARCH"],[1266,1278,"LOC"],[1419,1448,"ARCH"],[1475,1526,"ARCH"],[1530,1537,"LOC"],[1689,1699,"ARCH"]]}],["I want to mention one last way that the Iron Bridge anticipated modern architecture. Recent surveys of the bridge showed how its repeated components were adjusted individually, during manufacturing, to fit their neighbours. There is, it s been shown, tens of millimetres difference between seemingly identical components. The ideal of mass production in architecture has always been that: an ideal. Despite ongoing enthusiasm for industrialization, particular builders usually constructed modern buildings on particular sites for particular clients, from the drawings of particular designers. During the 20th century, it grew less common for architects to design every detail of buildings and more common for them to specify mass-produced components, like prefabricated doorsets, roof trusses, or kitchen units. Only rarely, however, were whole buildings mass produced. Nevertheless, the image of mass production remained insistent in modern architecture, to the point where bespoke buildings were sometimes made to look prefabricated to assert their modernity. Commentators keen on industrial production argued repeatedly over more than a century that prefabrication was the imminent future of architecture, without it being fulfilled on any scale. Iron and modern science It s remarkable that iron manufacturing ever became widespread. Iron is extracted from mineral, from iron ore, at a boiling point of 1,535 C, involving fierce heat and light. This doesn t produce pure iron but an impure substance named pig iron after the shape of the casting beds once used which is hard and brittle. This then gets remelted, during which time it is carefully decarburized to control the level of carbon and impurities like sulphur, improving the strength of the material, before being left once again to cool. It s sometimes claimed that the engineering innovations of the Industrial Revolution emerged from modern science. But, until the mid-19th century, the history of iron manufacturing was largely the history of trial and error. Telford s and Brunel s bridges, for example, were worked out from instinct and experience, preceding any comprehensive theory of structures. Thomas Newcomen s and James Watt s 18th-century work developing steam engines despite the latter s theoretical research into chemistry late in life \r",{"entities":[[40,51,"ARCH"],[2168,2183,"PER"],[2190,2200,"PER"]]}],[" emerged from the workshop and not from calculation. Likewise, the Darby family s endeavours at Coalbrookdale were based on testing and observation. Early 19th-century engineering aspired to scientific authority, however, and science encouraged the culture in which engineering flourished. The modern idea of science seeking mathematical descriptions of natural phenomena out of systematic experiments emerged in the West in the 16th and 17th centuries. It was popularized by the reputations of figures like Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543), who proposed in 1549 that the Earth revolved around the sun and not vice versa, and Isaac Newton (1642-1727), whose physics linked astronomical observations with Earth-bound ones, producing theories of optics and calculus. Theories like these emphasized rational analysis, encouraging a gradual shift from a God-fearing medieval society, where humans imagined themselves subservient to the natural world, towards a 20th-century secular condition where science and technology made humans feel they could control the world. After the construction of the Iron Bridge, there were rapid improvements in making iron stronger and more predictable. Henry Cort patented the puddling process in 1783, stirring molten iron to draw in oxygen and burn out carbon. In 1832, John Gibbons tried different geometries of blast furnace, significantly increasing production capacity. By the mid-19th century, wrought iron became a reliable construction material, albeit that mass-produced components were still tested by hand and eye to ensure their soundness. It was only towards the end of that century that the design of iron structures became more scientific, when engineers learnt to calculate stresses and deflections accurately. The St Genevi ve Library in Paris was designed by architect Henri Labrouste between 1838 and 1850, at the point between early experiments in mass producing iron components and their widespread use in building, between trial and error and applied science. The twin iron vaults of its lofty reading room were tied to thick stone piers lining the perimeter, connected by arched openings containing tall bookstacks with windows above (Figure \r",{"entities":[[508,527,"PER"],[625,637,"PER"],[1182,1192,"PER"],[1301,1313,"PER"],[1761,1781,"ARCH"],[1785,1790,"LOC"],[1817,1832,"PER"]]}],["2). In conjunction with the building s spare decoration, the vaults anticipated the light and airy qualities of modern buildings. 2, St Genevi ve Library, Paris, France, 1850. Slender iron vaults contained by masonry walls, built at a time poised between trial and error in engineering and the emergence of reliable structural calculations. Its architect, Henri Labrouste, sought a new resolution between novel technologies of construction and the idea that architecture could be a vital expression of culture. St Genevi ve Library was controversial in mid-19th-century Paris. It rejected the prevailing idea, promoted by that city s famous architecture school, L Ecole des Beaux-Arts, that architecture should involve the artful composition of decorative forms derived from scholarly study of the orders of classical architecture. The library instead appeared strikingly plain. Structure and decoration were effectively separated out. Decoration was applied to panels set into, and between, the primary structure, expressing the structural design of the building visually. These ideas chimed with \r",{"entities":[[133,153,"ARCH"],[356,371,"PER"],[511,531,"ARCH"],[664,684,"LOC"]]}],["emerging architectural thinkers, notably John Ruskin, whose book Modern Painters (first published anonymously in 1843) argued that art should be honest to the realities of nature; expanded in his Seven Lamps of Architecture, 1849, which promoted truth including the honest expression of structural forces as essential to beauty and life. For these reasons of material, structure, and decoration the St Genevi ve library was later claimed as a progenitor of modern architecture. But it also stood for emerging modernity in another way. Labrouste knew the novelist Victor Hugo, who remains famous for The Hunchback of Notre Dame, written at the time of the July Revolution in France in 1830 and published in 1831. Hugo asked Labrouste to comment on a draft chapter criticizing scholarly Beaux Arts architecture. Set in Notre Dame Cathedral in 1482, the chapter follows an encounter between archdeacon Claude Frollo and a character who turns out to be King Louis XI. At a key moment, Frollo glances down at a printed book on the table and then up through a window to the towers of the Cathedral. This (the book), he reflects wistfully, will kill that (the Cathedral). Hugo s novel was set when the invention of the printing press, by Johannes Gutenberg in 1436, allowed the widespread distribution of books. But Hugo made a contemporary point. He claimed, via Frollo, that architecture was understood before printing, before mass production, not just in terms of shelter or as a container of human activities but instead as a form of knowledge. And that knowledge carved in stone in the great buildings of human culture was a kind of cultural currency that could be read by the people whose lives those great buildings touched. Architecture, he suggested, was a force for social integration because it expressed shared symbols. Hugo s character argued that architecture was losing its uniting power to the page, prophesizing that the spread of Copernican and Newtonian science, through printing, would encourage the culture of industrialization to take over every facet of human life. Hugo thus took aim at the Beaux Arts architects who derived their designs from book learning, copying, and recopying forms from the Greeks and Romans, forgetting, he thought, how to think for themselves. They made empty copies of ancient architecture, he implied, in a city where Notre Dame showed how architecture once embodied the latest knowledge, and where it could do that again. \r",{"entities":[[41,52,"PER"],[399,419,"ARCH"],[535,544,"PER"],[563,574,"PER"],[712,716,"PER"],[723,732,"ARCH"],[817,837,"ARCH"],[899,912,"PER"],[981,987,"ARCH"],[1165,1169,"PER"],[1231,1249,"PER"],[1309,1313,"PER"],[1357,1363,"PER"],[1825,1829,"PER"],[2082,2086,"PER"],[2362,2372,"ARCH"]]}],["The historian Neil Levine argued that Labrouste s design for his strange, plain library with its spindly iron vaults and resistance to Classical style was an optimistic response to Hugo s criticism: an attempt to make architecture a cultural force again, this time reflecting the 19th century s emerging knowledge. The library s plain stone facades were carved with 810 names in twenty-seven panels, presenting a roll call of thinkers collected in the library (all male), organized in chronological order from the Old Testament figure Moses to the Swedish scientist Bezelius, who died in 1848 when the names were carved. The architecture of the library thus echoed and celebrated the printed page. If the book had killed ancient architecture, as Hugo supposed, then St Genevi ve Library suggested that architecture could be made afresh out of the new scientific world of the book. The names on the library s fagades described the huge intellectual shift from medieval European cultures dominated by a single Christian God, to the so-called rational thought of 19th-century modern science and technology. Designed at the beginning of the so-called Second Republic in France, the names also described a parallel, connected shift towards ideas of modern industrial democracy, away from the absolute monarchies of the European past. The library s vaults made in iron, the technological material of the moment were physically and metaphorically tied to stone walls whose carved names expressed the intellectual forces that iron seemed to represent. The vaults stood for their architect s premonition that a meaningful modern architecture was possible, derived from modem science and the technical culture of industrial production. The library highlighted an apparent tension emerging at that time between engineering and architecture, between new technologies of construction and an older idea of architecture as an expression of culture. How, it seemed to ask, might the organization and imagery of architecture embrace the culture of modernity? This fraught question preoccupied certain architects well into the next century.

St Pancras Station, London, 1868, is a famous example. Its train shed s arched trusses designed by engineer William Barlow soared 75 metres over the tracks without intermediate columns. Still influenced by older ideas about civic decorum, however, this striking display of iron s potential was enclosed within masonry walls and concealed from the street by the ten-storey Midland Grand Hotel: a Gothic Revival fairy tale decorated with gables and fancy balconies, designed by architect George Gilbert Scott. Architecture and engineering, trainshed and station building, were frequently separated physically and intellectually in such railway terminals. But it was the iron sheds that most captured peoples imaginations. It s no coincidence that painter Edouard Manet chose the trainshed of a Parisian station, buzzing with activity and filled evocatively with steam, to depict the emerging atmosphere of modernity rather than the conventional station building in his painting Gare Saint-Lazare, 1873. At that time, engineers not architects were most comfortable with the structural opportunities, imagery, and space-enclosing potential of iron. Some, like Gustave Eiffel and Joseph Paxton, came from working-class backgrounds and transcended rigid class structures through entrepreneurship and technical cunning. Paxton and Eiffel cultivated the image of self-made practical people that just got on with things, in opposition to scholarly gentleman architects who, the implication was, dithered and delayed. They reimagined iron not just as a material for roofs within masonry walls, but as structural framing that could define the spaces of buildings. Indeed, they helped define the idea of space as the end result of modern architecture: a notion still forming as recently as the 1920s. Paxton was a gardener turned engineer. He earned his reputation as the Duke of Devonshire s fixer, transforming the Duke s park at Chatsworth, UK, with hydraulic fountains, water displays, and a new village to replace one previously disrupting the Duke s view.

The shell of the Crystal Palace then the largest enclosed space in the world was erected in just four months. Opening panels were added at high level to extract rising hot air, and a timber slatted floor allowed cool air to be drawn in to replace it at low level, with the Paxton gutters profiled to collect condensation. These climate control measures were carefully considered but they couldn t mitigate the overheating and overlighting problems of putting an exhibition in a large greenhouse in summer, and various exhibitors including Armstrong s Elswick Works and Coalbrookdale Foundry hung giant drapes to shade their exhibits. Attracting visitors in vast numbers, the exhibition illustrated modern ideas and helped establish a new popular enchantment with technological progress. The Crystal Palace stood for fresh mythologies celebrating rational science and technical innovation, and a gradual shift away from traditional religious mythologies. Moreover, it served as a display case for the emerging products of modern globalized trade, illustrating vividly the burgeoning connections between global finance and colonial exploitation, ideas about progress and a universal free market, and industrial production and the idea of the state. Refining ideas about mass production already latent in the Iron Bridge, the Crystal Palace also anticipated the modern idea of space. Visitors circulated inside its grid of slender columns and spidery trusses, with countless glimpses appearing and disappearing in a perpetual interlacing of structure. In long perspective, the grids of columns and glazing bars stretched almost to infinity. The palace s volume thus exemplified the mathematical conception of space: as a grid measured in equal increments on x, y, and z axes, as a field extending to infinity in all directions. If moving around the Crystal Palace felt strikingly new, then the first experiences of climbing the curving latticework of Eiffel s Tower must have seemed something else again. Gustave Eiffel, son of a German forester, began as an apprentice engineer before founding a design-build firm serving the railway boom, opening metal workshops in a Parisian suburb.

Eiffel also engineered the Statue of Liberty shipped to New York as a gift from France, 1881 developing a mathematical solution for the tricky structural problem of raising Liberty s torch-bearing arm outwards from her body. Eiffel s tower was the centrepiece of another temporary exhibition of technological wonders the 1889 Paris World s Fair housed in pavilions around its base. Designed for rapid construction, it tapped his previous experience. The tower was effectively a giant bridge pylon without the bridge, sat on foundations made using pressurized waterproof caissons, invented for building footings in rivers, allowing it to be constructed on sodden ground. Opened at a time when few aviators had flown, and aerial views were figments of artists imaginations, the public found the tower s three lofty viewing platforms spectacular. Equally striking was the experience of moving upwards through its structural legs in innovative elevators, themselves at the forefront of technology. Glimpses soared skyward, framing distant prospects: a cinematic experience before the popularization of cinema. Spiral stairs sometimes locked deep in the structure and sometimes flying precariously outside became panoramic viewing devices. The tower was not universally popular, especially among Paris s elite one of whom quipped that he preferred to eat at its restaurants because it was only there that he couldn t see it on the skyline. Sensitive to such criticism, Eiffel talked up the tower s patriotic role for making military observations in the event of invasion, and topped it with a meteorological laboratory to associate the tower with scientific enterprise. And it quickly became a tourist staple, now characterizing Paris in countless depictions, models, and novelty paperweights. Around the time the Eiffel Tower was imagined, the idea of space was being contested in German language art criticism by theorists like Conrad Fiedler, Gottfried Semper, and August Schmarsow. In 1846, Karl B tticher had understood architectural style as an integration of systems of production and symbolization, proposing a new, similar, integration for \r",{"entities":[[64,71,"LOC"],[75,98,"ARCH"],[106,112,"PER"],[133,150,"ARCH"],[162,170,"LOC"],[186,192,"LOC"],[331,345,"ARCH"],[432,450,"LOC"],[1570,1576,"PER"],[1915,1927,"ARCH"],[2031,2045,"PER"],[2047,2063,"PER"],[2069,2086,"PER"],[2096,2102,"PER"]]}],["iron. In 1878, Semper argued that architecture should express, monumentally, the structures of society. Architecture, he believed, should give order to culture, and symbolize culture, particularly through its Bekleidung, meaning clothing or cladding . That word cladding became important. It helped modern architects to imagine facades as curtains hung around spaces, rather than as heavy structures enclosing them. Meanwhile, Schmarsow s room theory , 1893, argued that dynamic bodily movement around space offered a better way to appreciate architecture than the static viewing of forms. Adrian Forty has highlighted that such theories about space which entered English-language debates about modern architecture only in the 20th century via writers including Adolf Loos, Alois Riegel, and Siegfried Giedion were adopted only imprecisely by modern architects, who conflated them awkwardly. Forty reflected how modern architects came to understand space imprecisely as both something static, contained within walls, and something dynamic, flowing through architecture. They imagined it as an abstract mathematical grid but also understood it from the bodily viewpoint of individuals moving around. They saw space as simultaneously tightly bounded, and with infinite extent. And they imagined it both as an abstract idea, and as stuff that architects could shape. The emerging vocabulary of space in modem architecture was thus sometimes muddled. But it s no coincidence that it began forming when the fleshless skeletons of the early railway terminals, Crystal Palace, and Eiffel Tower were constructed, because the heightened experiences of those structures illustrated vividly how the idea of space could be imagined. Sullivan, Wright, and the separation of wall from structure A sequence of innovations in the latter part of the 19th century transformed iron technology, resulting in the widespread production of a less brittle variant called mild steel. The inventor Henry Bessemer successfully blew cold air through molten iron at his London bronze-powder factory in 1856, wholly decarburising it. He licensed his process to manufacturers, but it tumed out that his innovation relied on low-phosphorous iron ore which wasn t widely available and it stalled.

Parallel, developments in iron rolling by John Alleyne, for example, to fabricate sections of St Pancras station s roof matured through the 1860s. By 1890, the combination of the basic Bessemer process with improved rolling mills alongside other refinements resulted in bigger sections and longer lengths of steel whose chemistry could be controlled to achieve different material properties. In architecture, this meant that trusses and arches made of smaller, brittle iron components could be replaced, up to certain lengths, by single, ductile steel beams or columns. And trusses made of mild steel elements could cover longer spans. Steel construction thus became easier, faster, and cheaper than iron. The new material eventually yielded new architectural imagery, but it took architects decades to work that out. By 1890, technical initiative in steel production had shifted from Europe to America. Chicago was an important centre; characterized, into the 20th century, by sparks from its Bessemer converters puncturing night-time views of Lake Michigan. Various architects from Chicago s substantial German immigrant community knew Semper s ideas, but the rapid development of steel-framed buildings there owed more to commercial motivations than theoretical ones. Chicago was destroyed in a catastrophic fire in 1871. As reconstruction gathered pace, soaring land values encouraged developers and architects to build high, maximizing the lettable area on each plot to maximize revenues. After the inventor Elisha Otis made hydraulic elevators safe, increasing the number of floors that could be accessed easily, the primary constraint on tall buildings became the capacity for structural masonry to bear load. The eighteen-storey Monadnock Building in Chicago s downtown Loop , 1893, designed by Burnham and Root, demonstrated the limits of what was possible in brick, its massive flared plinth illustrating the bulk of masonry needed to support the walls above. The idea that steel frames could exceed the height limits of brickwork came not from architects but the local steel industry. The first building to hang its external walls from a Bessemer steel frame was the Home Insurance Building in the Loop, designed by William LeBaron Jenney, 1885; followed by Holabird and Roche s Tacoma Building, 1888. Rapid construction was achieved by suspending brick, stone, and terracotta work from the frame, \r",{"entities":[[110,122,"PER"],[162,180,"ARCH"],[953,959,"LOC"],[963,971,"LOC"],[972,979,"LOC"],[1113,1127,"LOC"],[1152,1159,"LOC"],[1206,1212,"PER"],[1339,1346,"LOC"],[1581,1592,"PER"],[1805,1823,"ARCH"],[1827,1834,"LOC"],[1871,1878,"PER"],[1883,1887,"PER"],[2337,2373,"ARCH"]]}],["permitting its completion in advance of the external walls. Those walls no longer loadbearing thus became separated conceptually from the building s structure, echoing Semper s ideas about cladding. Louis Sullivan, of Chicago firm Adler and Sullivan, developed this approach in the Wainwright Building, St Louis, 1890, and the Guaranty Building, Buffalo, 1895. However, just as Ironbridge s iron bridge took the shape of a masonry arch, early steel-framed buildings designed by Chicago architects seemed constrained by established architectural imagery. Sullivan initially understood these projects primarily as a decorative problem about the proper expression of tall buildings, more than an opportunity for a new architectural logic. Adler and Sullivan s substantial, complex, intricately detailed Auditorium Building in Chicago s Loop was completed in 1889, wrapping an opera house with offices, hotel rooms, and a seventeen-storey tower. Its ingenious section, constructed in steel frame within masonry walls, resolved practically the differing needs of diverse accommodation. The theatre was the first lit by electric light, also employing a novel system to circulate air. And its innovative steel and concrete raft foundations were loaded up with weights that were removed while the building was constructed to avoid different parts settling at different rates. Integrating its framed structure with new building services, the Auditorium Building seemed to be imagined as a technological machine. Critic Colin Rowe argued in a 1956 essay, Chicago Frame , that although Sullivan and his contemporaries didn t grasp the full implications of what they were doing they changed architecture. They integrated new technologies into building, valuing practicality, simplicity, and innovation. More importantly, they pointed the way towards a new steel-framed architectural logic, illustrating the separation of cladding from structure. Rowe emphasized the significance of this. The frame has come to possess a value for contemporary architecture, he wrote, equivalent to that of the column for classical antiquity and the Renaissance ... The frame establishes throughout the building a common ratio to which all the parts are related; and, like the vaulting bay in the Gothic cathedral, it prescribes a system to which all parts are subordinate. \r",{"entities":[[168,174,"PER"],[199,213,"PER"],[218,225,"LOC"],[231,249,"PER"],[282,301,"ARCH"],[303,311,"LOC"],[327,344,"ARCH"],[346,353,"LOC"],[378,388,"ARCH"],[554,562,"PER"],[746,754,"PER"],[800,819,"ARCH"],[1510,1520,"PER"],[1545,1552,"LOC"],[1575,1583,"PER"],[2267,2283,"ARCH"]]}],["Rowe linked the innovations of downtown Chicago s steel-framed skyscrapers with the work of another architect working in that city s suburbs, Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright, who assisted Adler and Sullivan with the Auditorium Building, tested a set of ideas through a sequence of brick- and timber-built houses. These included: the Ward Willits House, Highland Park, Illinois, 1901; Darwin Martin House, Buffalo, 1904; and Frederick Robie House, Chicago, 1907. Before modernity, most buildings in the West were constructed from masonry and timber: a combination controlled by the timber sizes that could be cut efficiently from logs, preferring floor spans of 6 metres or less. Masonry and timber thus tend to produce groups of rectangular rooms enclosed by loadbearing walls holding up the floors, their architectural logic implying a series of cellular rooms surrounded by heavy walls with small openings. Wright s designs tested, within the constraints of those materials, how far conventional four-square masonry boxes could be dissolved. He experimented with: interlocking spaces at the corners of rooms, achieved using concealed steel lintels; a central hearth expressed as a pinwheel around which those interlocking spaces were arranged; horizontal lines expressed in roofs and window strips to cheat the appearance of weighty masonry; and interior spaces linked to their surrounding landscape by loggias and plane walls extending outwards from the buildings. Images of Wright s work were published in Germany in 1911. They became influential in Europe, like images of Chicago s steel-framed towers had previously, and both contributed to the slow emergence of a distinctive architectural expression for the steel frame there during the first half of the 20th century. While the frame developed quickly as a commercial and technical expedience in America, straightforwardly symbolizing trade and industry, Rowe argued, European architects only embraced it slowly, agonizing about it instead as a new spatial idea.

Far from the rectangular grids of office buildings in Chicago, Tatlin s tower proposed a leaning spiral of columns and diagonal bracing, propped on an inclined pylon, with three glass rooms locked within. A cube, housing legislative assemblies, would revolve on its axis once a year. Above that, a pyramid for executive bodies would revolve once a month. On top of that, a cylinder, rotating once a day, would issue forth newspapers, proclamations, and pamphlets (spinning the spin doctors!). The tower s form derived from structural logic but was conceived primarily as an image of dynamism, symbolizing agitation and propaganda: a twisting motion frozen in steel, with mobile rooms inside. It reinvented Pieter Bruegel the Elder s famous 1563 painting of the Tower of Babel, and the Eiffel Tower, substituting their supposedly static images with a dynamic depiction of space. And space, here, was not layered into rectilinear floors and rooms but instead became a remarkable three- dimensional volume. The image of Tatlin s tower was unique in modern architecture, sticking in architects imaginations.

First, in front of its steel columns faced in brick were large panels of glass, hung from the frame, seemingly applied to the walls as planes. This was subsequently hailed (inaccurately) as the first glass curtain wall named after Semper s ideas. Second, the traditional pitched roof was rejected, in favour of a flat roof (in fact laid with a slight fall for draining rainwater), an element that became an inescapable image of modernity.

Steel allowed floors to be supported on columns or walls in fewer places than timber. Rather than enclosing a series of cells, walls could thus be reimagined as screening but not enclosing activities, separating them but not parcelling them up into compartments: as free-standing planes within larger spaces. These planes could be imagined as slipping out of buildings, past a perimeter glass screen, blurring divisions between inside and outside, encouraged by the notion of space as flowing and fluid. This idea was influenced by modern painting in the late 1910s and early 1920s. Cubist paintings, like those of Fernand L ger and Juan Gris or Expressionist paintings like Wassily Kandinsky s broke up and abstracted figures and everyday objects into fragmented compositions using flattened perspectives and multiple perspective viewpoints. Rather than depicting conventional scenes, these painters instead composed lines and blocks of colour in the space of the painting. Various modern architects imagined they were doing something similar, arranging walls as lines and planes in space, and only then making a weathertight enclosure around them. And their plan drawings sometimes looked like compositions by Kandinsky or L ger. A house in Utrecht, the Netherlands, planned for a young widow, Truus Schr der-Schrader, and her three children, by furniture designer Gerrit Rietveld, 1924, provided an extraordinary demonstration of this architecture of planes (Figure 5). Client and designer egged each other on to make something remarkable, and the small house seemed less like a building than a giant piece of inhabitable furniture. Certain walls were imagined as sliding or folding planes. Key furniture elements were fitted, with mobile pieces expressed as folding and sliding planes at another scale.

The result was a striking demonstration of a planar architectural logic whose potential was extended by modern materials. Gropius developed his articulation of the Fagus Factory, without its brick panels, at another framed structure finished in 1926: the headquarters of the Bauhaus school of design in Dessau, Germany, where he became the first head. The building consolidated an appreciation of the visual detachment of planes, as developed through the work of Wright, De Stijl, and Rietveld. Part hippie commune, part zen monastery (as Richard Weston put it), the curriculum of Gropius s Bauhaus reflected its new home emphasizing engineering, geometry, and industrial craft, with the addition of radical politics. In its early years, it was imagined as a reinvented medieval craft guild, and Bauhaus students worked directly with materials, including steel. They integrated art and engineering, craft and machine production, product design and manufacturing. Striking furniture, paintings, sculptures, objects, and (later) architecture resulted, envisaged as symbols of modernity. And the Bauhaus ethos went on to inspire numerous modern architects. By the 1930s, thanks partly to images produced there, curtain walls, flat roofs, corner windows, and apparently free-standing planes became linked together into what Reyner Banham later called the teenage uniform of modern architecture . Mies, on campus The first of the four anointed superheroes of modern architecture I 1l introduce here refined the logic of steel-framed architecture obsessively. Known to architects simply as Mies (1886-1969), he was born Ludwig Mies at Aachen on the German Dutch border. The family firm made stone fireplaces, and he acquired an early sense of the dignity of materials and the craftspeople who worked them. In 1922 spending time with artists from the Dada movement who deliberately cultivated their personas he reinvented himself as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, adding his mother s surname and the van der which hinted (without basis) at Dutch nobility.

Alongside his practical training, Mies read voraciously in philosophy, history, and art criticism, encouraged by the philosopher Alois Riehl who was an early client. Detlef Mertins has argued that Mies took from his apprenticeship with Behrens the idea of a quest for architectural forms, to suit the modern age, which could be seen as universal. From the work of Dutch architect H.P. Berlage, he became interested in a handful of so-called normal forms and types : basic shapes supposedly drawn from ancient traditions. From Gropius, Bruno Taut, and the so-called November Group, he took the idea that creativity, freedom, and social justice were connected. And, from Catholic philosopher Romano Guardini, he understood the purpose of life as directing the human spirit into the future. The resulting Mies was highly contradictory: a curious spiritual, non-political, socialist authoritarian. He was hard enough to place in interwar Germany that he was both commissioned to design a memorial to the murdered communists Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxembourg, 1926, and remained able to practice modern architecture after it was censured by the Nazis following their rise to power in 1933, until they decisively pronounced it degenerate in 1937. In that year, Mies was invited to design a house in the American state of Wyoming. His reputation preceded him, based on a pavilion he d designed for a 1929 expo in Barcelona a remarkable exercise in the architecture of planes and on his role as the last head of the Bauhaus before it closed in 1933. On an extended visit, Mies negotiated an appointment as a professor with what became Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in Chicago, including a commission to masterplan its new campus at Bronzeville on the city s Near South Side. He thus became poised to bring together in Chicago European thinking about the steel frame as a symbol of modernity, with American talent for steel fabrication, in conjunction with the planar thinking previously cultivated by Wright, Gropius, and Rietveld.

Over nearly fifteen years, Mies s office designed a sequence of low-rise rectangular blocks within IIT s grid. The first, a three-storey engineering lab the Minerals and Metals Research Building, 1947 established the formula (Figure 6). Its primary structure was a welded steel frame on a regular module, expressed externally and internally, with special attention paid to the detailing of the corners. Echoing the Fagus factory, its steel frame was infilled with just two materials: glass curtains set in slender steel glazing bars and panels of brickwork. To emphasize honestly that the brick was infill and not supporting structure, it was set forward from the frame as a visually separate plane.

Others understood its abstract qualities, and its tendency to make its inhabitants self-police their behaviour, as rigid and autocratic. It s seldom done in histories of modern architecture to note that the exposed steelwork of Mies s IIT buildings, paired with thin brickwork panels and single-glazed windows, made the buildings perishingly cold in Chicago s freezing winters, and unbearably hot in summer. It s also rare to mention that, because steel and brickwork expand and contract at different rates, many brick panels cracked, and flat roofs, hidden behind steel for visual effect, regularly leaked. For Mies fans like the admirers of other famous modern architects these were merely defensible consequences of genius. Until recently, architectural histories also rarely acknowledged that the blocks over which Mies laid his planning grid were no empty lot. They were cleared as slums by the largely white city and Institute authorities in the 1940s, having previously housed a notable middle-class black community whose cultural life was expressed in a vibrant jazz scene. Some have reinterpreted their demolition as racially motivated social cleansing. Historian Tim Samuelson has illustrated how the Mecca Apartments, a welcoming home for black immigrants to Chicago, immortalized in the Mecca Flat Blues (1924), was cleared to make way for Crown Hall.

He made two striking photomontages celebrating the literal transparency of all-glass facades: one showing floor to ceiling glazing enigmatically reflecting the sky in daylight; the other illustrating its see-through qualities when lit from within at night. Although they didn t win Mies the competition, these images later became famous, anticipating the modern tower block. The first steel towers built to the designs of Mies s office were twin apartment blocks overlooking Lake Michigan, turned at 90 degrees to each other, connected with a slender low-level canopy, known as 860-880 Lake Shore Drive. Internal cores provided the buildings structural stability, accommodating the elevators and vertical services. Individual flats, eight per floor, were laid out around the cores, designed as open spaces, with fitted furniture and sliding screens substituting for most walls and doors. Structurally, a grid of primary steel columns was placed inside the outer edges of the towers floors, encased in concrete for fireproofing. Prefabricated secondary steel elements were then fixed to the facade, expressed as vertical I-sections, four per structural bay. These steels supported aluminium-framed windows and provided so-called lateral bracing, reinforcing the building against wind loads. A small break in the secondary steels at every floor level illustrated visually on the fagade that these secondary steels weren t continuous, and therefore weren t primary supports for the building. But, to the consternation of Mies fans, every fifth I-section was fitted directly over a concrete-encased primary steel column. These steels thus had no structural purpose, added instead to maintain the rhythm of the fagade. For good modernists accustomed to Mies s dictum that less is more , and Sullivan s form ever follows function , these steels remained unnecessary. They were functionally redundant adornments, serving only the visual image of the tower, and they became objects of controversy among modern architects.

Shaping modern culture in steel In 1831, Victor Hugo had anticipated a modern architecture reflecting scientific culture, arguing for special buildings, which people could identify with as symbols of the age. Mies believed that his work fulfilled this promise. Indeed, his fans likened the I-section steels of Lake Shore Drive to the tracery of medieval Gothic cathedrals. True architecture, Mies claimed, is always objective and is the expression of the inner structure of our times, from which it comes . He didn t just think he was designing individual buildings for individual sites and clients. He thought he was isolating the universal forms of architecture itself, paring down the logic of steel and building types like campus buildings and high-rise towers to their essential images. Mies imagined himself not as inventing a style, but as identifying the authentic, timeless architectural expression of the future. Once the job of isolating these forms was done, Mies imagined he would pass the images and techniques to others for repeating and refining. He imagined he was designing bespoke prototypes for others to mass produce. Indeed, he lavished attention on the first campus buildings and towers designed in his office but once he felt the archetypes were established left later versions to his associates.

The Hennebique villa incorporated every kind of cantilever possible at that time. Its floors stepped down to the rear as a series of terraces, covered with soil and densely planted as hanging gardens , illustrating concrete s substantial load-bearing capacity. By contrast, the terrace balustrades showed how delicate concrete elements could become. Looming above the house, cantilevered out from it, was a sculptural concrete water tower, which neighbours nicknamed the minaret . The villa s external walls followed an innovative construction method, where concrete was poured in situ between 3-centimetre-thick precast concrete slabs. These slabs provided permanent formwork for structural concrete poured in behind, replacing the sacrificial timber shuttering normally used to make temporary moulds for concrete construction. They served to conceal the concrete poured on site, whose finish could be unreliable, giving a more reliable precast finish, and were hand tooled to reveal the flint aggregate used in the mix, so they looked like stone from a distance. Hennebique didn t invent reinforced concrete but commercialized it ingeniously. The ancient Romans had used concrete 2,000 years before, working out how to make mortar by mixing kiln-dried lime with sand and water, adding stone dust to produce a paste that set hard when it dried in the air. They subsequently found that, by adding a natural compound of iron oxide and silica alumina, mortar could harden in large quantities independently of the air. We now call this cement. Large quantities of cement poured around broken bricks and fragments of stone were employed to make the first concrete walls in Rome in the 2nd century BCE (although the name concrete, describing cement combined with masonry aggregate, didn t emerge until the 19th century). The most significant Roman invention when concrete started to find its own architectural logic was the vaulted concrete floor, an important invention for the Roman empire because of its scarcity of timber. And the most spectacular survival of Roman concrete is the soaring dome of the Pantheon in Rome, (probably) completed in 125 cE. \r",{"entities":[[208,224,"ARCH"],[2305,2321,"ARCH"]]}],["Historically, concrete was strong in compression but poor in tension. It proved itself as a material for walls, vaults, and domes which carry loads in compression but not for beams and spans reliant on tension. And because the outcome of each concrete pour could be temperamental, depending on the precise mix, the temperature and humidity when it was poured, as well as the builder s skill in achieving a reliable outcome, concrete wasn t widely used between Roman and Victorian times. The structures required by 19th-century industries and infrastructures revived interest in concrete, however. As skills in working the material gradually improved, inventors tried combining it with iron. Iron was stronger in tension but weaker in compression the opposite properties to concrete and the combination of materials held promise. In 1854, a plasterer called William Boutland Wilkinson from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK, patented a method for inserting iron barrel hoops as tension rods at the crown of concrete vaults. In 1875, William Henry Lascelles, a London building contractor, filed a patent for strengthening concrete panels with iron rods, and strengthening concrete floors with wire mesh. In 1877, Thaddeus Hyatt, a New York manufacturer, published an account of fifteen years experimentation with reinforced concrete, establishing that iron reinforcement added to the bottom of a concrete beam would cope with tension, while concrete at the top would handle compression, countering what engineers call bending moments to produce rigid structural elements. He also established that iron covered with concrete would remain undamaged in fire, promoting ferro-concrete as a fireproof material. Experiments and patents multiplied towards the end of the 19th century. Hennebique s own innovations weren t extraordinary. He substituted steel reinforcement for iron, and spaced steel straps closer together near the ends of beams where structural loads were greater. It was his patents filed in 1892, however, that established his fortune. His genius lay in recognizing the commercial opportunities those patents established. As soon as they were signed, Hennebique sold his contracting concern and established a reinforced concrete construction consultancy. It provided engineering drafting services, licensing only reliable contractors to construct its designs. And it guarded its intellectual property jealously, challenging infringements with legal action.

Hennebique thus established the idea of the professional construction consultancy, which was as important to the emergence of modern architecture as any of the buildings discussed in this book. Hennebique s house thus indicated how reinforced concrete could symbolize the new, prefiguring the emergence of a technically oriented construction industry. It anticipated the higher status and value that gradually became accorded to design skills over craft skills. It also illustrates how entrepreneurial modern architects and engineers learnt they could monetize intellectual property and professional expertise be it technical prowess or visual innovation as much as designing buildings. Ethics of production and living Beginning as a gloopy liquid but setting hard, reinforced concrete is a troublesome commodity. In philosophy, concrete refers to something immediately present. However, as Adrian Forty has shown, many thinkers have struggled with the contradictory qualities of this demanding material. Famous for making dramatic forms, concrete has no form of its own, merely shaped by the formwork into which it is poured. Seemingly substantial, cement only becomes strong when combined with aggregate and steel. While the ingredients of concrete are natural, it grew to symbolize the human-made world. And, while it s been imagined as timeless, concrete frequently came to represent the new because of its difference from other materials. It was attributed a moral rightness because its finished surfaces bear honest traces of how they were worked.

(Architect; Albert Kahn.) Kahn and Ford shared ideas, becoming friends, and the Highland Park factory can be understood as a built diagram of their thinking together. It comprised a four-storey concrete frame, relatively long and thin, with decoration limited to an ornamented cornice. Internally, there were no dividing walls. Vertical circulation and staff changing spaces were pushed outside the primary volume, as towers, to maximize continuous space for machinery. The concrete frame was infilled externally with floor to ceiling glazing, maximizing light. Gravity was used to shift parts from upper floors to the main production line at ground level, and cars moved along this \r",{"entities":[[4,32,"ARCH"],[34,62,"LOC"],[146,156,"PER"],[410,422,"PER"],[424,428,"PER"],[433,437,"PER"],[478,499,"ARCH"]]}],["production line with components dropped onto them from above. Car bodies, for example, complete with doors and seats, were slid down chutes for fitting to their chassis. If the processes on each floor were properly coordinated, Ford believed, lazy working would become immediately apparent. Architecturally, Highland Park was transitional, with origins in 18th-century European mill buildings that had separate workshops on multiple floors. And Kahn s later factories for Ford like the River Rouge plant in Detroit became even clearer diagrams of industrial processes, concentrating production into a single line on a single floor. Concrete came to stand for Fordist industrial production in Detroit, representing capitalist free enterprise, the efficiency of centralized industry, dedication to work, and self-sacrifice. However, it could also stand for socialist collective living. Twenty years after Highland Park, in 1929, the Narkomfin Communal House was completed in Moscow to designs by architects Moisei Ginzburg and [gnatii Milinis (Figure 11). The Russian Revolution of 1917 had overturned the autocratic regime of the Tsar and inspired by communist ideas of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels ousted the so-called bourgeois class of aristocrats and managers in favour of worker s councils called Soviets. By the time that the Narkomfin was constructed, there was a drive to industrialize the Soviet economy, paralleled by a cultural revolution seeking to restructure social life along Marxist lines. \r",{"entities":[[228,232,"PER"],[308,321,"ARCH"],[445,449,"PER"],[472,476,"PER"],[486,503,"ARCH"],[507,514,"LOC"],[692,699,"LOC"],[903,911,"ARCH"],[931,955,"ARCH"],[973,979,"LOC"],[1005,1020,"PER"],[1169,1178,"PER"],[1183,1199,"PER"],[1333,1342,"ARCH"]]}],["11, Narkomfin Communal House, Moscow, Russia, 1929. A radical experiment in communist social engineering: a social condenser housing bureaucrats of the Ministry of Finance, including twenty-four collectivized flats whose residents ate, relaxed, and socialized together, imagined as sharing ideals and daily practicalities. (Architects: Moisei Ginzburg and Ignatii Milinis.) Commissioned as a prototype, the Narkomfin was a radical exercise in social engineering. Designed for bureaucrats of the Ministry of Finance, it replaced two bourgeois villas on Moscow s Garden Ring Road. Dressed in modern architecture s Gropius-inspired teenage uniform , it boasted white painted concrete walls with flat roofs and ribbon windows, seemingly hovering above the ground on columns. It was most striking for its radical organization. Devised by a state research agency headed by Ginzburg, it maximized shared facilities, like those for cooking and dining, adding a library, gymnasium, and laundry, plus a cr che with professional childcare \r",{"entities":[[4,28,"ARCH"],[30,44,"LOC"],[336,351,"PER"],[356,372,"PER"],[552,578,"LOC"]]}],["so women could play a fuller role in society. The flats were grouped into a single slab, connected with a bridge to another block containing most of the communal spaces, while a laundry and cr che stood as separate buildings in the garden. The aim was to socialize private aspects of domestic life into the public sphere. Different flat types were included. Two so-called transitional flats weren t dependent on communal facilities. However, twenty-four collectivized units were provided for individuals or couples: compact double-height volumes, accommodating only sleeping, showers, and toilets. These had no kitchens, and living space was minimal, because residents were expected to spend most of their home lives as part of the collective eating, relaxing, and exercising together sharing ideals and daily practicalities. The Narkomfin was never the fully communal society its champions envisaged because of the multiple flat types. Indeed, a rooftop penthouse was added at a late stage for the minister of finance, separate from the collective, and Ginzburg added an enlarged version of the transitional unit for himself. Moreover, the prototype was barely repeated because Soviet communism changed around it. The Narkomfin was celebrated in 1928, but Stalinist authorities declared by 1930 that workers preferred conventional domestic arrangements, and Ginzburg was required to disown the building as an elitist experiment. Together, the Narkomfin and Highland Park show how concrete structures came to stand for radically opposing ideas of communism and high capitalism in the 20th century. They indicate how concrete at once liquid and solid, formless and formed, natural and human-made became associated with divergent attempts to rethink social order and mechanized production. They illustrate how the material was not only contradictory in itself, but also had divergent ideas about modernity projected onto it.
